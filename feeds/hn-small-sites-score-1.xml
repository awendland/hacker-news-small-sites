  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Consider a mining town. Once upon a time there was a mine, and the mine was the largest employer in the town. They mined copper ore and sold it on the global market. This brought money into the town, which sprouted a restaurant, real estate broker, doctor’s office, and church. Although those people weren’t employed by the mine, they got enough customers from the miners, who fundamentally got money from outside the town.</p>

<p>But eventually the mine dried up. The miners lost their jobs, since the town was no longer bringing in enough money to pay them. The doctor, realtor, and waiter were still employed, as their “mines” didn’t dry up. But they did, as they were really just mining the miners. The town persisted for a bit, passing the same money around in a circle. But with each pass, there was a transaction fee. And there were still things like food, which needed to be imported into the town.</p>

<p>The town went broke, died, and became a ghost town.</p>

<hr>
<p><br>
<b>All jobs can be broken down into one of three groups.</b></p>

<p>The first(constant) is the shoeshiners, bank tellers, politicians, retail workers, clergy, social media managers, lawyers, and the rest of the service industry. An economy made up of only these people wouldn’t work. Imagine a town without imports and exports comprised of only this class of people. Considering every transaction always has a fee, regardless of what this town started with, they would always end up going broke.</p>

<p>So where does money come from? There’s a literal answer to this question, but that’s not what I want to explore. I mean money in a more abstract sense, perhaps more like wealth or value.</p>

<p>The second(linear) group produces “money” linearly. This group includes farmers, miners, and manufacturers. They create value by the ton, bushel, carton, or barrel, a ton of ore mined, a barrel of oil extracted, a bushel of apples grown. This is the only group that could sustain an economy by itself.</p>

<p>The third(exponential) group seeks efficiency improvements for the second. This group includes scientists and engineers. The scientist who genetically engineers crops to get 30% more yield per acre. The engineer who replaces a ox drawn plow with a tractor drawn megaplow. This group can’t sustain an economy alone, but mixing a few of them in with the second group yields much higher per capita money creation.</p>

<p><img src="https://geohot.github.io/blog/assets/images/ourworldindata_share-working-in-agriculture-since-1300.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>Most people used to unquestionly be in the second group. The third group has this exponential effect, where in the beginning they do very little, but because they build on the previous successes of the group in a way the other groups don’t, they eventually come to be the driving force of society. Today, although we aren’t quite there yet, it is easy to imagine a few farmers farming all the land, extending their reach with automation and sensors. Or even, no farmers, just machines. And more machines to fix the machines. But the machines would still be in group 2. Group 2 is the basis of any economy.</p>

<p>I set about classifing the top 30 jobs (2/3rds of the workforce, minor level classification from bls.gov) in the US into the three groups, and realized I should break group 1 down further for more clarity. The top 4 jobs consist of just moving stuff around, a clearly group 1 activity!</p>

<p>Breaking down group 1 into 3 subgroups:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1M: movers of stuff (waiters, retail, clerks, drivers, bankers)</li>
  <li>1E: fighters of entropy (maids, doctors, nurses)</li>
  <li>1B: people who tell other people what to do. “bosses” of various sorts (management, executives, specialists, “finance”, sales, admins)</li>
</ul>

<p>I found teachers somewhat hard to classify as well, assuming education works, they are group 2, producing more productive people, like a tractor maker. If education is daycare, they are group 1. We gave them the benefit of the doubt and included them in group 2.</p>

<p>And surely not all “Computer Occupations” are group 3, but that’s how it’s broken down.</p>

<p><img src="https://geohot.github.io/blog/assets/images/job_chart_percent.png" alt="image">
<img src="https://geohot.github.io/blog/assets/images/job_chart_class.png" alt="image"></p>

<p>I would like to dive into this further, as the categories used from the Bureau of Labor Statistics were rather crude. You can dive even deeper than minor categories. I’d also like to see this analysis done for China, as perhaps this is a US specific problem that only predicts the decline of the US.</p>

<p>But this makes my point, that group 1 jobs have been growing at the expense of group 2. They are now 73% of US jobs! Group 1 jobs do not contribute to the money creation as a whole, and it’s concerning to consider what will happen if this trend continues. We cannot have a worldwide economy of group 1 jobs, as just like the town, the whole world would end up going broke.</p>

        <p>
          April 21, 2020

            ☼ <a href="https://tyler.kim/tagged/life">life</a>
            ☼ <a href="https://tyler.kim/tagged/roka">roka</a>
        </p>

        
<p>I’m an occasional on-call operator for my battalion, assisting the on-call commander and staffing the control room from 16:00 in the afternoon until 08:30 the next morning on weekdays. Most of the work is answering and making calls, updating documents, and making sure that nothing is out of the ordinary. It’s not that difficult, just tiring as there is a lot of stuff to follow and pay attention to through the night.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I was on-call on Friday, the 10th, and for 24 hours last Wednesday (not the usual shift), starting from 08:30 to the next 08:30 since it was the legislative election day in Korea. I wrote most of this post over those two shifts to share how I personally am being on-call.</p>

<hr>

<p>A little past 2300 is when I try to find some peace. I usually make myself a cup of coffee, and it doesn’t take long to feel the caffeine flowing through my bloodstream. I’m exhausted. It’s been many hours since I started my shift, and I have nine hours to go. No shift goes without a hectic evening with lots of random situations to handle, and they are usually followed by a series of paperwork.</p>
<p>I sit in front of a bunch of monitors and tactical comms equipment in bad posture, and the chair predates the concept of ergonomics. Meanwhile my feet are trapped in my airtight combat boots and they are begging to take a breath. In addition, no matter how much water I drink, my mouth is dry the whole time. It’s probably from all the sugar-intakes from snacking. It’s a similar feeling to a tiring second day at a college hackathon - constant snack intakes and sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>Around midnight, after I’m finished with all the paperwork that needs to be done by the morning, is a good time to seek solace in a cup ramen. It’s hard to convey the exact late-night-cup-ramen sentiment, but the hot soup warms you up in a way no others can console you in this late time.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I also have books with me so that I can read whenever I can. Late in the night especially after a ramen session is usually a good time to read. Every time I try to read in the evening or during the day, I either get a disruptive phone call or a situation, and they make me re-read the same page multiple times. It gets annoying after a couple of tries.</p>
<p>When I tried to read on the past few shifts, I faced some sad ironies. I brought <em>Why We Sleep</em> to my first shift. Reading about the importance of sleep while not being able to sleep was quite saddening, so I stopped after a few pages in. At least I learned why I feel wide awake towards the end of my shift (in the morning), and why I have difficulties sleeping after my shift despite being tired as hell. Now I’m reading <em>the Utopia of Rules</em>, a book filled with social commentaries on bureaucracy and filling out paper forms. Reading that in between the processing and filling out a ton of paperwork was yet another sad irony I encountered. Inevitably and unfortunately, as the night passes, my ability to focus gets decimated. I wish I could accomplish more reading on the job.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Around 0300~0400, a little after 12 hours (or 20) into the shift, I’m usually passed out on my desk. In a zombie-like state, I get half-woken up by periodic phone calls but I occasionally sleep through the ringings. Sometimes I answer the phone and pretend to handle whatever they tell me, and then go right back to sleep, forgetting everything I heard. I also get woken up when I have to unlock a small safe with ammunition for those going to a guard shift at night. Even then, my body isn’t fully awake sometimes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By dawn, I can feel my internal organs are rotting. With that, my body starts to produce an uncomfortable amount of gas. A little past 0600, with my internal rhythm resetting, my body spontaneously wakes me up. It’s when I start to get busy again. Meanwhile my body goes through this illusion of feeling refreshed, but soon enough it feels like it has aged about six months over the past six hours. It’s obviously not a great feeling and it takes me about two full days to recover. Five more on-call shifts will age me by two years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite such horribleness, the one positive aspect about doing the on-call shifts is that I get to sleep in and rest for the entirety of the next day, getting exempt from pretty much everything. Then, after one shift, two days have gone by just like that. Time flies and a week passes by only after a few days. And I get to rest over the weekend. That’s a good feeling to have in here, the sense of getting closer to the discharge date quicker than how I would feel it otherwise. Just gotta rinse and repeat till I’m out. It’s like Stockholm syndrome - despite how shitty I feel during and after the shift, I’m a bit disappointed that I don’t have a shift this week.</p>

        <br>

	<p>If you haven’t been living under a rock, you’ve probably heard that
there are different date formats in the world such as the American one
(mm/dd/yyyy) and the European one (dd.mm.yyyy). If you’re smart
enough, you’ve probably also noticed that the American one makes no
sense and is just awful. A simple conclusion that many people draw out
of this is that the European format is the best one, however I don’t
think this is true. If you’re one of these people who think so, I’m
here to (hopefully) change your mind by introducing you to a
lesser-known date format called ISO 8601.</p>
<h2 id="basics">Basics</h2>
<p>As you can see by the “ISO” part in the format’s name, it’s an actual
standard written by the International Organization for
Standardization. It defines many cool things like a way to write time
intervals, which can be useful for writing portable software, and a
calendar where the year is separated not by months but by weeks, which
is used in finances, but here we’re only interested in the basics.
Simplified, the core date format looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss
</code></pre><p>Yup, that’s about it. You write the year, the month, the day, and then
the time exactly like it’s done in other date formats. There’s nothing
extraordinary, so you can learn it in 2 minutes.</p>
<h2 id="why-its-better">Why it’s better</h2>
<h3 id="its-unambigous">It’s unambigous</h3>
<p>This is the main reason the standard was written and why people still
use it. Other date formats can be diffucult to tell apart. For
example, consider this date:</p>
<pre><code>02-03-04
</code></pre><p>When you read it out of context, you have absolutely no idea what’s
going on there. Is <code>02</code> here the day or the month? You just can’t know
unless the day in the date is greater than 12, in which case it just
can’t be a month:</p>
<pre><code>30-03-04
</code></pre><p>This day-month ambiguity is a really common problem, which often
occurs online. People just write down their dates in whatever date
format they know without even thinking that other people can interpret
it in different ways.</p>
<p>ISO 8601 doesn’t have this problem as it’s always obvious which part
is the day and which is the month because of the uniqueness of the
format:</p>
<pre><code>2004-03-02
</code></pre><h3 id="its-more-strict">It’s more strict</h3>
<p>While other date formats usually don’t provide strict requirements on
how to write something, ISO 8601 is an exception. Here there’s only
one correct way to write a date, which is not only useful for
computers to parse, but also helpful for humans to avoid confusion
with other formats and improve readability. Here are some of the
restrictions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The elements in the date are always separated by a hyphen. Not many
date formats use this delimiter, and this also can be useful when
using dates inside filenames as slashes are usually not accepted in
them.</li>
<li>The elements are always padded to the maximum number of digits. This
not only makes all of the dates look equally nice, but also, coupled
with other quirks of this format, allows the files with the date in
the name to be sorted just by the filename.</li>
<li>The year is always written in the full form. This makes the format
unique when written down and  eliminates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem">the year 2000 problem</a> in
any forms that it can take. For example, when writing down
birthdays, it always makes it obvious which century we’re talking
about.</li>
<li>The time is always written in the 24 hour format, so there can be no
confusion about what half of the day something happened in.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="it-makes-more-sense">It makes more sense</h3>
<p>On the first glance, it seems like the European format is about as
logical as it can get - days go into months and months go into years:</p>
<pre><code>18.12.2002
---------&gt; Elements
</code></pre><p>However, this ignores a very important characteristic of numbers -
endianness. Consider a regular number, for example:</p>
<pre><code>69420
&lt;---- Digits
</code></pre><p>As you can see the digits here do the opposite of what elements do in
the European format. When the leftmost element of something is the
most valuable, we call it big endian.</p>
<p>Thus, the European format is little endian while the numbers in it are
big endian:</p>
<pre><code>18.12.2002
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- Digits
---------&gt; Elements
</code></pre><p>And the American format just makes no sense:</p>
<pre><code>12/18/2002
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- Digits
?????????? Elements
</code></pre><p>And, as you can see, ISO 8601 is completely consistent in this regard
as everything is big endian:</p>
<pre><code>2002-12-18
&lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
&lt;--------- Elements
</code></pre><p>The situation becomes even worse if you consider time because it is
big endian, like ISO 8601, thus doesn’t work with any other date
format:</p>
<pre><code>18.12.2002 23:03:59
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
---------&gt; &lt;------- Elements

12/18/2002 23:03:59
&lt;- &lt;- &lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
?????????? &lt;------- Elements

2002-12-18 23:03:59
&lt;--- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- &lt;- Digits
&lt;--------- &lt;------- Elements
</code></pre><p>If you’re still having trouble visualizing all of this in your head,
look at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ISO8601/comments/ln33j2/datetime_format_by_region_visualised_v3_thanks/">this Reddit post</a>.</p>
<h3 id="its-standardized-and-actively-used">It’s standardized and actively used</h3>
<p>If you think that ISO 8601 is a silly thing that someone in their
basement made up and no one actually uses, think again because that
can’t be further from the truth:</p>
<ul>
<li>The fact that it’s standardized says at least something. Does your
favorite format has a neat several hundred page document where it’s
described in extreme detail and that is internationally recognized?
Also the standard is quite far from being dead - after being
published in 1988 it was updated in 1991, 2000, 2004, and 2019.</li>
<li>As I already mentioned, the standard is actively used in IT.
Almost everything that is used by software and somehow involves a
written numerical date format already speaks ISO 8601.</li>
<li>yyyy-mm-dd has been adapted or used since the beginning as a
national date format by many countries such as Canada, Sweden, and
Japan. See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_format_by_country">this article</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions">Frequently asked questions</h2>
<h3 id="why-not-use-a-format-like-01-jan-2020">Why not use a format like 01-Jan-2020?</h3>
<p>It doesn’t have any of the nice features ISO 8601 has and doesn’t work
well internationally (i.e. assumes the person you’re communicating
with knows knows English). If you think the latter is not a problem,
imagine how you would feel feel if you had to read a date someone
wrote in their native language that you don’t understand:</p>
<pre><code>01-Янв-2020
</code></pre><h3 id="yyyy-mm-dd-looks-weird">yyyy-mm-dd looks weird</h3>
<p>The only reason why it does to you is because you’re not used to it.
After a little bit of practice, it’ll be even less weird than your
favorite date format.</p>
<h3 id="maybe-the-european-date-format-is-better-because-the-elements-are-in-the--order-of-relevance">Maybe the European date format is better because the elements are in the  order of relevance?</h3>
<p>First of all, the claim that the order of relevance is little endian
is quite questionable. The only situation when you can say that for
certain is when we’re talking about events occuring on a day-to-day
basis, however I can think of numerous cases when the year and the
month are more relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Article publication date</li>
<li>Historical event</li>
<li>Personal event that happened a long time ago</li>
<li>Someone’s birthday</li>
<li>Random database entry</li>
</ul>
<p>Second, the order of relevance is actually irrelevant. Even if the
order of relevance was this way, you’re not reading the dates out
loud, so there’s no need for them to be ordered a certain way. If
you’re not interested in the year, you just skip it and read the end
of the date just like you would do when reading time while not being
interested in the hour.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In my opinion, ISO 8601 seems clearly superior to other date formats
when it comes to international communication (such as posting things
online), and as you can see, I have enough reasons to say so. While
the format certainly has an audience, it’s unfortunate that it’s not
as big as it could be. By writing this article, I hope I made you at
least think about different date formats and be more careful when it
comes to making people understand what date you’re talking about.</p>

  </p>

  
  

  <p>Two years ago, I starting learning <a href="https://www.purescript.org/">PureScript</a>.  I
had been intrigued by purely functional programming for some time but had failed
to learn <a href="https://www.haskell.org/">Haskell</a> once or twice. PureScript seemed to
be a kinder, gentler introduction to this world while retaining the fundamental
properties of pureness that made Haskell intriguing to me. As part of my
learning process, I rebuilt a slack bot<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> I had previously written in go.</p>

<p>Once I had learned PureScript and become more comfortable with purely functional
idioms, the next logical step seemed to be learning Haskell. I was surprised to
discover how much Haskell I already knew from learning PureScript, but core
features like laziness (PureScript is a strict language) took some getting used
to.</p>

<p>I decided to finish my Haskell learning experience by rewriting my slack bot<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>
once again, this time in Haskell. In this post I’ll compare and contrast my
experiences writing the same program in Haskell and PureScript. The application
I built was “real” enough to have some interesting design challenges. They
included:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Exposing an HTTP endpoint</li>
  <li>Parsing and generating JSON</li>
  <li>Full-text search</li>
</ul>

<p>On to the comparison!</p>



<p>Haskell is a lazy language while PureScript is a strict one. I expected this
core difference to manifest itself constantly when writing these applications,
but in reality it rarely came up. I had predicted a lot of banging my head
against the wall dealing with laziness bugs but it just didn’t happen.</p>

<p>I will say that I generally prefer PureScript being a strict-by-default
language. When laziness is required, there are plenty of ways to <a href="https://blog.drewolson.org/laziness-in-purescript">get
it</a>, but it is always explicit.</p>

<p>While not directly related to strictness, a pain point on the PureScript side
that I didn’t experience in Haskell was stack safety<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup>. In PureScript, it can
often be confusing to determine if the operation you’re using is stack safe.
When these operations <em>aren’t</em> stack safe, the errors that are produced can be
confusing and hard to track down. I found myself struggling with stack safety in
PureScript far more than I struggled with laziness in Haskell.</p>



<p>A year or two ago, I would have simply said that PureScript has incredible
tooling and Haskell does not. Thanks to the amazing work on the <a href="https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server">Haskell
Language Server</a> project,
this gap is starting to close.</p>

<p>Regardless, PureScript still has far better tooling.
<a href="https://github.com/purescript/spago">Spago</a> is an incredible build tool that
offers many of the same features as
<a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> while remaining far
more user friendly and PureScript’s <a href="https://github.com/nwolverson/purescript-language-server">language
server</a> is excellent
and easy to install.</p>

<p>However, PureScript is currently struggling on a few fronts. First, the package
ecosystem is moving from bower to a
<a href="https://github.com/purescript/registry">registry</a> hosted on Github. The
resulting registry seems to be moving along nicely and I believe the result will
be incredible for the language, but the current in-between state is unfortunate.
I am glad the core maintainers are taking their time to design this registry
well and I firmly believe that this will be a strong positive for the PureScript
community in 6-12 months.</p>

<p>Second, PureScript doesn’t have a great option for a formatter. While
<a href="https://gitlab.com/joneshf/purty">purty</a> does exist, it seems to be mostly in
maintenance mode and many of the formatting choices are frustrating for me.
Specifically, the automatic removal of blank lines within functions and the
addition of newlines for <code>let</code> assignments in <code>do</code> blocks both hamper
readability and author intent. On the Haskell side,
<a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/ormolu">ormolu</a> was easy to install and
“just worked”.</p>



<p>It’s not a controversial statement to say that Haskell has far more language
features than PureScript. It’s also not a new observation to say that it is
challenging to determine which of these features one should be using and what
extensions one should enable to use them. Here’s the list of default extensions
I have enabled for my project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>DataKinds</li>
  <li>DeriveGeneric</li>
  <li>FlexibleContexts</li>
  <li>FlexibleInstances</li>
  <li>GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving</li>
  <li>InstanceSigs</li>
  <li>LambdaCase</li>
  <li>MultiParamTypeClasses</li>
  <li>NamedFieldPuns</li>
  <li>OverloadedStrings</li>
  <li>ScopedTypeVariables</li>
  <li>TypeApplications</li>
  <li>TypeOperators</li>
</ul>

<p>I found Haskell’s deriving capabilities to be more powerful than PureScript and
led to reduced boilerplate, especially when creating my application monad. I
also like that Haskell’s type class instances do not require names. The names
required by PureScript add very little in terms of readability or author intent.</p>

<p>By far the biggest difference I felt between the two languages is the way they
deal with records. Again, this isn’t a new observation, but it can not be
overstated how much better PureScript’s records are than Haskell’s. Records
based on row polymorphism are a joy to work with, as is having a dedicated
syntax for creating, updating, and accessing records. GHC does have an <a href="https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals/blob/master/proposals/0282-record-dot-syntax.rst">accepted
proposal</a>
for adding record dot syntax which will solve many of these problems, but I
think the underlying implementation based on row polymorphism will continue to
give PureScript the edge here.</p>



<p>When I first learned PureScript I compared its compile times to other statically
typed languages like Rust, Go, and Java. I found it much slower than these other
languages, though incremental rebuilds were generally quite fast. I assumed upon
moving to Haskell that the situation would be comparable or better. I was very
wrong.</p>

<p>Compilation times in Haskell are significantly worse than PureScript, often by
an order or two of magnitude when compiling a project’s dependencies. I say this
less to rag on Haskell (this seems like a challenging problem to tackle), but
more to applaud the PureScript community for the work they’ve already done on
this front.</p>



<p>Haskell has a far larger ecosystem of packages than PureScript – kind of. In
terms of Haskell and PureScript in isolation, Haskell has a vastly superior
collection of packages and the quality of these packages is generally very high.
However, PureScript has done a great job of porting over many of the best
Haskell packages.</p>

<p>Additionally, PureScript gives you access to the entire ecosystem of JavaScript
packages via FFI. While many in the community find this to be something of a
disadvantage, from a practical perspective it is fantastic. As an example, when
building full-text search for Haskell, I ended up using the full-text-search
package. It was fully featured and comprehensive, but required <a href="https://github.com/drewolson/epicbot-hs/blob/736e4a47a29f8935ecb489d3cdbeb48b738c34ca/src/Epicbot/Data/Index/SearchEngine.hs">quite a
bit</a>
of code to get working.</p>

<p>On the PureScript side, I built a <a href="https://github.com/drewolson/epicbot/blob/e7e93d2e2642ae135c92c6ff5b73b733685b550e/src/Epicbot/Index.js">simple FFI
wrapper</a>
around elasticlunr. While I understand that the JavaScript ecosystem has
packages of variable quality, it does have <em>lots</em> of package solving <em>many</em>
problems and PureScript’s FFI makes it extremely easy to leverage this giant
ecosystem in a safe way.</p>



<p>For my PureScript application I chose the
<a href="https://github.com/cprussin/purescript-httpure">HTTPure</a>. It was light-weight
and easy to use while feeling idiomatic. This was a relatively simple choice
because there are few options for server-side frameworks within the PureScript
ecosystem that included the features I needed (specifically middleware).</p>

<p>On the Haskell side, the choice of web framework was more complicated. I wanted
something small and light-weight, but with the ability work within my custom
monad stack for my application. I ended up using <a href="">scotty</a>, but the default
middleware solution doesn’t operate within your application’s monad stack, so I
needed to explicitly provide middleware-like-functions for <a href="https://github.com/drewolson/epicbot-hs/blob/736e4a47a29f8935ecb489d3cdbeb48b738c34ca/src/Epicbot/Web/Router.hs#L33-L34">each
endpoint</a>
in my router.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, this was mostly a wash between languages, but I expected
the Haskell ecosystem to be far more mature in the backend HTTP service space.</p>



<p>To deploy my PureScript application, I used
<a href="https://github.com/vercel/ncc">ncc</a>. While this required that I had <code>node</code>
available in my deployment environment, it made everything else easy. The <code>ncc</code>
tool produced a single, self-contained JavaScript file that included all of the
application code along with required dependencies. I then simply <code>scp</code>‘d this to
my deployment environment and ran it with <code>node</code>.</p>

<p>On the Haskell side, I used stack’s docker support to build my application’s
executable within a container that matches my deployment environment (debian),
and then shipped the resulting executable via <code>scp</code> as well. The executable was
completely self-contained.</p>

<p>Overall, both approaches felt equivalent in terms of ease. On the PureScript
side, it is a bit frustrating to need <code>node</code> within the deployment environment.
On the Haskell side, there was the added complication of having to use docker
for cross-compilation. Overall, though, both experiences were reasonably nice.</p>



<p>In reading over this post, I worry that it feels like I’m picking on Haskell –
I’m absolutely not. I’m very aware that PureScript is <em>heavily</em> influenced by
Haskell and is standing the shoulders of giants. PureScript was able to learn
from some of the mistakes of Haskell and make choices about intentional
departures from the Haskell ecosystem that better fit the intended use cases of
PureScript.</p>

<p>I found the experiences of learning and using both Haskell and PureScript very
rewarding. I will admit to being surprised at how well PureScript compared to
Haskell in the server-side HTTP space, given that its primary focus is currently
on the front end. I think both languages have a bright future and I’m excited to
follow their continued development.</p>

<p>For this week’s <strong>musing</strong>, I want to expand on an issue that came up in the discussion in the universal warrior series, which was the question of changing <strong>lethality</strong> in warfare.  Just how likely were you to <em>die</em> on the battlefield in different eras, and how did changing offensive, defensive and medical technologies alter that balance?  One assumption I see frequently is that since the advent of modern medicine has made serious infections survivable, it must follow that basically all wounds were fatal in the pre-modern period.  Of course balanced against this is the relatively higher lethality of modern weapons, which strike with much greater energies and in consequence do much more damage to the body.  So where does the answer lie?</p>



<p>(Just a quick reminder that these musings are just that: me talking through an idea and to some degree thinking out loud with the information I have available.  Consequently, you should take any of the conclusions here as preliminary; whatever level of confidence you place in my normal ‘Collections’ ramblings, a ‘musing’ is probably at least a half-a-notch lower in the ‘epistemological certainty’ scale.)</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, it is complex.  The first question we need to ask is what kind of mortality we are interested in.  If we include non-combat related disease deaths, those will swamp combat related deaths, but there are problems with this.  Estimates for disease-losses in pre-industrial armies (some of these figures compiled in Rosenstein, <em>Rome at War</em> (2004), 130-2) vary tremendously; late nineteenth century rule of thumb held that disease casualties would be four times battle deaths; but in the American Civil War and the Boer War they were only twice battle deaths and in the Imperial Japanese Army during the Russo-Japanese War, they were actually four times <em>less</em> than battle deaths.  Basic sanitation, it turns out, matters a lot here.  The next problem is that here our question needs to be about <em>excess</em> deaths because of course some level of disease is prevalence in the larger society; that is even harder to calculate, but if we fail to adjust for that, all we are doing is measuring the size of armies, since the background disease death rate in the pre-modern world was so elevated.  In this case, I think it is best to remove non-combat disease deaths from the equation, since the concern here was the experience of battle, so we should limit ourselves to violent death in war.</p>



<p>Except that brings us to the next question, which is the word ‘battle.’  Are we limiting ourselves to <em>battles</em> or not?  If we want to consider warfare as a totality, then the evidence is fairly clear that violent death <em>per capita</em> (so adjusting for population growth) decreases as a function of time (on this, note A Gat, <em>War in Human Civilization</em> (2006) rather than S. Pinker, <em>Better Angels of Our Nature</em> (2011).  Yes, I am aware that the former has spoken highly of the latter’s book, but frankly the more careful and cautious argument of <em>War</em> is to be preferred).  This decline isn’t necessary a smooth curve, but seems to move in steps with lots of variation within those steps.  Lifetime violent mortality among early hunter-gatherers and other non-state peoples seems to have been on the order of 15% (with some examples above 25% generally.  These deaths were concentrated among males; a 15% overall rate of violent mortality might mean a 25% rate among males and only a 5% rate among females).  For pre-industrial agrarian state-societies, that figure falls to single-digit percentages, often very low single digits, but perhaps sometimes as high as 5-10% (some estimates for the military mortality of the Romans during the worst years of the Second Punic War run up to 20% of the adult male population, so c. 7% of the total population; I think this is a smidge too high and perhaps 5% is more correct).  In post-nuclear, post-industrial states where conventional war is often sharply constrained by deterrence and the industrial revolution means that returns to trade and investment are higher than returns to war (the reverse being true previously) that figure often falls to fractions of a percent, but again with potentially wide variance in the event of rare but extremely destructive wars.</p>



<p>But – and you knew there was a but coming – but that absolutely massive hunter-gatherer lethality level isn’t generally in <em>battles</em>.  The bulk of those deaths occur during very one-sided ambushes and raids, directed at individuals who are effectively incapable of fighting back.  So we might ask the question a different way: <strong>what was the chance of dying in a particular <em>battle</em> at a given point of time</strong>?  Once again, that’s complicated, in part because reliable casualty statistics for <em>losing</em> armies are often frustratingly rare even well into the modern period.  But there are a few observations we can make in terms of how technology might have impacted these changes.  First, in both West Africa and North America, we can observe that the introduction of gunpowder so radically increased the lethality of open battles that tactics shifted entirely away from them.  Now, this might not be surprising in North America, where the battles in question were of the first-system type – lower lethality missile exchanges when the raid or the ambush had failed .  But in West Africa, the battles in question were often state-on-state and concluded with shock infantry engagements (with a notable use of blunt weapons, since part of the goal in battle was for the victor to take many captives; on this see Lee, <em>Waging War</em>, ch. 8), yet even in that context the increased lethality of gunpowder meant that such battles had to be discontinued in a context where the demographics of the underlying society simply couldn’t support massive losses.  <strong>So the strong suggestion here is that gunpowder weapons represented a significant increase not merely in the lethality of the weapons but of the battles themselves.</strong></p>



<p>We might also compare individual battles or campaigns.  Rosenstein (<em>op. cit.</em>) estimates that for the Romans from 200 to 168 BCE (the period of our most sustained data, due to Livy), the Roman battle-death rate was very roughly 8-9% of soldiers engaged.  That accords fairly well with the general 5-15% rule of thumb often posited for hoplite combat in Classical Greece (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/934hfj/what_was_the_casualty_rate_for_battles_between/">but note the difficulties with those figures</a>).  To compare with, say, the Battle of Austerlitz (1805), there the French had c. 75,000 men and the coalition c. 90,000 and the former took c. 9,000 casualties to the latter’s c. 36,000; so out of 165,000 men engaged, 45,000 had become casualties (27%); it’s hard to say exactly how many <em>died</em> because the looser’s casualties in Napoleonic battles often aren’t broken out clearly between dead, captured and injured (because the loser is not in the position to count the field).  At least on the French side, the wounded outnumbered the dead roughly 5-to-1.  At Waterloo, where it is the coalition who won and thus have the more precise figures, British wounded outnumbered dead about 3-to-1, while Prussian wounded outnumbered dead by 3.5-to-1.  At Gettysburg (1863), with 104,256 Union and 75,000 Confederate forces engaged, there were 23,055 union casualties (3,155 killed, a WIA-to-KIA ratio of 4.6-to-1) and perhaps 23,231 confederate losses (4,708 killed, a WIA-to-KIA ratio of 1.2-to-1); about 25% of men engaged had become casualties of some sort, about 4-5% of those engaged had been killed.  I’d suggest that the flurry of figures there suggests, broadly, casualties moving very broadly within the same basic range as a percentage of men deployed.  Our ability to get a sense of the impact of wounds is complicated by the fact that pre-gunpowder sources tend not to give solid numbers for the wounded at all.</p>



<p>Now the question is how does the industrial revolution and antibiotics change this?  Well, for some World War I examples (post-industrialization, pre-widespread antibiotics), at the First Battle of the Marne (1914), roughly 1 million British and French troops had squared off against 900,000 Germans; both sides took around a quarter of a million losses (so c. 25%) of which c. 149,400 were killed (7.8%).  At the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes (also 1914), 215,000 Germans met 146,000 Russians with 10,000 German losses and 70,000 Russian WIA or KIA and another 30,000 prisoners, so roughly 30% casualties, but unclear what slice of those were deaths.  At Kolubara (1914), 400,000 Serbs faced off against 450,000 Austrian troops, with 405,000 total casualties, of which 52,000 were deaths (the WIA to KIA ratio was 5-to-1).  I’ve tried to pull major battles in 1914 because the long battles of the trench stalemate are difficult to generalize figures from as units rotate in and out.  Taking a longer view, some roughly eight million Frenchmen served in the first world war, of which 1,150,000 died in combat (not counting disease), suggesting a combat mortality rate over the whole war of a <em>staggering</em> (by modern standards) 12.5% (though note above that many non-state societies lived in a situation of WWI casualty levels <em>in every generation</em>).</p>



<p>(Update: note that the casualty figures here include KIA, WIA and MIA, so I’ve obtained the WIA-to-KIA ratio by by directly comparing those two figures, without the MIAs.  That seemed to have been confusing some folks in the comments.)</p>



<p>For post-industrialization, post-antibiotics, options are narrower.  American, British and Commonwealth forces had good access to …</p></div></div>

                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="programrejectedformentalhealthreasons">PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</h2>
<p>In 1972, two students learning FORTRAN came up with a fantastic new programming language called INTERCAL.  INTERCAL is a bit unusual. For example, single quotes are called <em>sparks</em>, and double quotes are called <em>rabbit ears</em>, less than (&lt;) is an <em>angle</em>, and a dash (-) is a <em>worm</em>.  This makes the manual read like a word puzzle combined with an extended in-joke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One final comment about sparks and rabbit-ears; if the next character in the program is a spot, as often happens because onespot variables are common choices for operands, a spark and the following spot can be combined into a wow (!). - <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm">INTERCAL Manual</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The compiler errors are where the authors got genuinely creative. Errors include <code>VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</code> for accessing an array incorrectly, <code>IT CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE</code> for invalid control flow, <code>PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</code> for threading issues, <code>I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</code> for file not found, and <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm#Errors">many many more</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a parody language, and reading the manual, you get the sense that no one has yet had as much fun writing technical documentation as Lyon and Woods did writing this.</p>
<p>The language itself looks less fun.  Here is <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Intercal">Hello World</a>:</p>
<pre><code>       NOTE THIS IS INTERCAL
       PLEASE ,1 &lt;- #5
       DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #54
       DO ,1 SUB #2 &lt;- #192
       DO ,1 SUB #3 &lt;- #136
       PLEASE ,1 SUB #4 &lt;- #208
       DO ,1 SUB #5 &lt;- #98
       DO COME FROM (1)
       DO READ OUT ,1
(2)    DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #134
(1)    PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM (2)
</code></pre>
<p>One of the exciting innovations of INTERCAL is the <code>COMEFROM</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM#Examples">instruction</a>, seen here in a variant of BASIC.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>10 COMEFROM 40
20 INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME? "; A$
30 PRINT "HELLO, "; A$
40 REM
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> anywhere in a program can grab control flow from the line you are reading. And in some implementations, if many <code>COMEFROM</code>'s reference the same line, execution splits off in each direction.</p>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> is the inverse of a <code>GOTO</code> statement with multi-threading thrown in. It breaks the mental model of imperative execution where each line's evaluation leads to the next line. The idea that you can simulate its execution in your head, line by line, is fundamental to imperative programming and <code>COMEFROM</code> attempts to break that model.</p>
<h2 id="variablesmaynotbestoredinwesthyperspace">VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</h2>
<p>At Twitter, they have a giant monorepo with lots of services in it.  And somebody at Twitter wanted to know which language was most prevalent.  Which language does Twitter use the most?</p>
<p>Java came in 3rd, and Scala came in 2nd. But 1st was a surprise.  The number one programming language used at Twitter was YAML.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>YAML usually doesn't feel like a programming language to me.  The file I'm currently writing in is in markdown with some YAML at the top to set the title and associated fields:</p>
<pre><code>title: INTERCAL, YAML, And Other Horrible Programming Languages
author: Adam
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing executes this YAML. It only offers some information to the blogging platform. But I don't think that is the type of YAML that made up the bulk of config at Twitter.</p>
<p>I suspect a lot of it was build and deployment scripts in the form of YAML. It was the type of configuration that encoded the control flow of some external system.  YAML like that lives in this grey zone between declarative configuration and a full-blown programming language.</p>
<p>I'll show you what I mean. Let's look at an example from <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/.travis.yml">shellcheck</a>'s build script:</p>
<pre><code>language: shell
os: linux

services:
  - docker
</code></pre>
<p>That seems like straight-forward config.</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
  include:
    - stage: Build
      env: BUILD=linux
      workspaces:
        create:
          name: ws-linux
          paths: deploy
</code></pre>
<p><code>create</code>, in the above, is starting to seem a bit more like execution. Let's continue.</p>
<pre><code>      script:
        - ls -la ${CASHER_DIR}/ || true
        - tar -xvf ${CASHER_DIR}/ws-osx-fetch.tgz --strip-components=5
        - ls -la deploy
        - ./.github_deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Now the YAML has just devolved into specifying how to execute a grab bag of commands.  We haven't seen control-flow yet, but it's coming.</p>
<pre><code>      if: type = push
      script:
        - source ./.multi_arch_docker
        - set -ex; multi_arch_docker::main; set +x
</code></pre>
<p>There we go, branching. It's an if statement in a YAML file!</p>
<p>That was for TravisCI but this isn't TravisCI, or CI specific.  Here is a simple example from Ansible:</p>
<pre><code>- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - include: foo.yml
      when: something == "foo"
    
    - include: bar.yml
      when: something == "bar"
</code></pre>
<p>Here is GitHub Actions:</p>
<pre><code>steps:
 - name: Step 7
   if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' &amp;&amp; github.event.action == 'unassigned' }}
   run: echo This event is a pull request that had an assignee removed.
</code></pre>
<p>Here is part of a Grafana <a href="https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/grafana/templates/deployment.yaml">Helm Chart</a>:</p>
<pre><code>
{{ if (or (not .Values.persistence.enabled) (eq .Values.persistence.type "pvc")) }}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ template "grafana.fullname" . }}
  namespace: {{ template "grafana.namespace" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "grafana.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
{{- if .Values.labels }}
{{ toYaml .Values.labels | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
{{- with .Values.annotations }}
  annotations:
{{ toYaml . | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is a problem. Writing control flow in a config file is like hammering in a screw. It's a useful tool being used for the wrong job<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>How did we get to this world of little programming languages embedded into YAML? Is calling something configuration just less scary? And if so, is a c++ program just config you give to gcc?</p>
<p>Did things ever get this complicated in XML times?</p>
<p>It turns out they did:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="text" omit-xml-declaration="yes" /&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="1" /&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name="i" /&gt;
    &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="($i mod 3) = 0 and ($i mod 5) = 0"&gt;FizzBuzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 3 = 0"&gt;Fizz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 5 = 0"&gt;Buzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="$i" /&gt;&lt;xsl:text&gt;&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
    &lt;xsl:if test="$i &amp;lt; 100"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="$i + 1" /&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That is <code>FizzBuzz</code> in <a href="https://gist.github.com/JustinPealing/6f619a23729720a9c14d9917201028c8">XSLT</a>. I assume it was written in jest, but in many ways, XML and XSLT are better than an ad-hoc YAML based scripting language. XSLT is a documented and standardized thing, not just some ad-hoc format for specifying execution.</p>
<p>It burns my eyes to look at it, but at least XSLT was intended to be used as a programming language. That is something we can't say about YAML or INTERCAL.</p>
<p>The problem with these languages embedded into YAML is they are all one-off implementations.  TravisCI conditionals have a TravisCI specific syntax, usage, and features. You can't use Travis's <code>concat</code> function or conditional regex in the YAML configuration for your ansible playbooks.</p>
<p>In a vague way, this YAML problem is like the <code>COMEFROM</code> problem. If you know yaml, you can't just open a .yml file and start reading file line by line.  You need to understand how the configuration controls the execution of the specific system it's for.  And that is hard.</p>
<h2 id="ihavenofileandimustscream">I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</h2>
<p>The line between configuration and programming languages is not some bright dividing line. It's easy to slowly drift into adding programming language constructs to a config file. Before you know it, you have a full unspecified programming language embedded in the interpretation of your config file.</p>
<p>That is the worst of both worlds, and so much YAML seems to drift into this area.</p>
<p>I like YAML more than XML, but for control flow, you know what would be better than YAML? Anything else!  Maybe even INTERCAL? I mean, how bad could a joke programming language be?</p>

No matter how generous and smart we think we are in our private giving, unless we shift from trying to minimize our taxes to advocating to be taxed more, we are not living up to being “for humanity.” Are most millionaires there yet? No. I do feel a shift is starting, though. Please keep encouraging us — and keep pressuring us, too.</p><p><strong>ANAND: You have an interesting personal background that led you to this place of advocating for structural change as a very rich person. Tell us about your journey.</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>I am one of those who gets highlighted by the media as a “self-made man.” I am told that I fit the storyline: I am an immigrant son of a single mother from Iran; while my mum cleaned in hotels, I studied hard, worked hard, and became a successful entrepreneur. I rose to be a multimillionaire — the American dream, except in Denmark!</p><p>It has always been evident to me, however, that I have not risen all by my own efforts: that I am&nbsp;<em>not</em>&nbsp;a “self-made man,” that the&nbsp;<em>welfare state</em>&nbsp;made me. Without the creche care and schooling and health care I received, I could not have flourished. And without Denmark’s strong public services, neither could my business.</p><p><strong>ANAND: What was your epiphany, if any, in realizing that very rich people like yourself need to be reined in rather than asked to give back?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>I knew it as a working-class immigrant child. Later, when I became rich and got involved in philanthropy across the world, I witnessed that while philanthropy can help ameliorate tough times for some people, it is only in collective action through government policy that we can we achieve a fair society and shared prosperity. All the data bear out what I witnessed. The way I put it to my fellow rich people is this: there is a title that is more noble and consequential than “Generous Philanthropist,” and that title is “Happy Taxpayer.”</p><p><strong>ANAND: Since you’re speaking as a rich guy on these topics, give us a sense of how rich we’re talking about, without disclosing any of your account numbers or PINs.</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>I made many millions of dollars, and I made them relatively young. I have three places I call home. I never worry about money. DM for my PIN.</p><p><strong>ANAND: What are the most significant structural changes that you think are necessary to attack wealth and income inequality worldwide and in certain countries in particular?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>We need a wealth tax everywhere. We need quality free health and education for everyone, everywhere. We need a green new deal everywhere. There’s no country where this is impossible, and no country where this is not necessary.</p><p><strong>ANAND: There has been a lot of recent discussion of a wealth tax in America, but even the most ambitious of the serious proposals, by Senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, are quite far from being “erosive” wealth taxes. In other words, even at a top rate of 8 or 10 percent, most billionaires’ fortunes would grow rather than shrink each year under their plans. Do you think we need to go further and have an erosive wealth tax?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>You make an excellent point that even if there is a wealth tax, rich people can make so much from the interest on their capital that we will still keep getting richer, just less fast. The most important thing now is to initiate the wealth tax because there’s so much nonsense talk about how it “cannot” be done. Of course&nbsp;it can. The only way to move on from that debate is to bring a wealth tax in&nbsp;<em>now</em>. Someone has to pay for the recovery from Covid-19, in which everyone except the rich has lost. Are we multimillionaires going to say it’s not us? Are we going to be such shmucks, such losers, and say no?</p><p><strong>ANAND: You live in Denmark. Many Americans, especially people who aspire to business success like you’ve had, believe that if we were to adopt policies like Denmark’s, capitalism would die, and gulags would sprout across the land. Are they correct?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>They could not be more wrong.&nbsp;In real life, contrary to the Hollywood tale, kids are more likely to achieve the American dream in Denmark than in America. America is not a beacon to the world on how to run an economy. Scandinavia has a much more impressive economic record than the US and is much more innovative. Sorry, my American friends — we’re not just fairer than you. We’re doing&nbsp;<em>better</em>&nbsp;by being so.</p><p><strong>ANAND: In America, wealthy individuals and businesses lobby for a threadbare safety net to pay less in taxes. But this creates a complication. It puts the onus on companies to figure out healthcare for their employees, to make these awful life-or-death decisions about pensions and maternity leave and the like. And what I often hear from friends who are in business in Europe is how much easier it is to do business when you’re not making all these societal decisions about your employees’ well-being and health and life and children as part of your operation.</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>Absolutely. And that’s just&nbsp;part&nbsp;of it. Social stability, low crime, a well-educated population, and great infrastructure are good for business. As we put it, the right thing to do is also the smart thing to do. We could also put it this way: the mean way to run an economy is also the dumb way to run an economy.</p><p><strong>ANAND: Should billionaires exist?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>In a well-regulated, well-managed, and thriving economy without monopolies, they wouldn’t. Wealth is like manure: spread it, and it makes everything grow; pile it up, and it stinks.</p><p><strong>ANAND: You advocate going “beyond philanthropy” and doing real structural change. I wonder what you think of the argument that philanthropy isn’t merely inadequate. That it can be actively part of the problem, by buying off a certain amount of anger, laundering reputations, and intensifying the plutocrats’ stranglehold over public conversation and power?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>You make a vital point. Right now, philanthropy is treated as an alternative to structural change. I focus on structural change, and I am working to persuade other multimillionaires to join me, advocating for a wealth tax on people like us. I still do philanthropy, but I know that it is no solution. You know, the thrill of seeing your nameplate on one school or a hundred schools is pretty empty in the end, compared to the thrill that we will all feel when&nbsp;<em>every child in the world</em>&nbsp;goes to a good school. Philanthropy is just so&nbsp;unambitious.</p><p><strong>ANAND: One of the features of the neoliberal age is that politicians, even left-leaning ones, are reluctant to use the language of “I welcome their hatred” that President Franklin Roosevelt used long ago. Do you think we need a little more class warfare, as it’s sometimes derisively called, rather than less of it?</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>Warren Buffet was right when <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/26/business/yourmoney/26every.html">he said</a>, “There’s&nbsp;class warfare, all right, but it’s my class, the rich class, that’s making war, and we’re winning.”&nbsp;We set up <a href="https://www.millionairesforhumanity.com/">Millionaires for Humanity</a> as an international network to help more millionaires move across from the dark side.</p><p><strong>ANAND: Explain Elon Musk to me in one sentence.</strong></p><p><strong>DJAFFAR: </strong>There’s not much “there” there, is there?</p><p><em>Djaffar Shalchi is an entrepreneur from Denmark and founder of <a href="https://www.millionairesforhumanity.com/">Millionaires for Humanity</a>, a network of wealthy people who advocate for raising taxes on wealthy people.

<h2>
  <big>redbean</big><br>
  <small>single-file distributable web server</small>
</h2>

<p>
  redbean makes it possible to share web applications that run offline
  as a
  single-file <a aria-label="Actually Portable Executable" href="https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/ape.html">αcτµαlly
  pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> zip archive which contains your assets. All
  you need to do is download the <code>redbean.com</code> program below,
  change the filename to .zip, add your content in a zip tool like
  Windows 10 or InfoZIP, and change the extension back to .com.

</p><p>
  redbean can serve 1 million+ gzip encoded responses per second on a
  cheap personal computer. That performance is thanks to zip and gzip
  using the same compression format, which enables kernelspace copies.
  Another reason redbean goes fast is that it's a tiny static binary,
  which makes fork memory paging nearly free.

</p><p>
  redbean is also easy to modify to suit your own needs. The program
  itself is written as a single .c file.

  Assets can be listed by running the following command:

</p><pre>unzip -vl redbean.com        # lists files

<p>
  Assets can be added to the zip archive as follows:

</p><pre>zip redbean.com index.html   # adds file
</pre>

<p>
  By default, anything you add to the archive gets compressed. Sometimes
  you don't want that to happen. A good example is video files. The web
  browser will want to send HTTP range requests to seek in the video, in
  which case redbean requires that the asset be uncompressed.

</p><pre>zip -0 redbean.com video.mp4  # adds file without compression
</pre>

<p>
  Each connection uses a point in time snapshot of your ZIP file.
  If your ZIP is deleted then serving continues. If it's replaced
  then issuing SIGUSR1 (or SIGHUP if daemon) will reindex the zip
  for subsequent connections without interrupting active ones. If
  SIGINT or SIGTERM is issued then a graceful shutdown is started
  but if it's issued a second time, active connections are reset.

Thank you, <a href="https://kevzettler.com/">Kev Zettler</a>, for showing your work on the Dasung Paperlike Pro and making all of this possible. I will later create an accompanying video to go over the Dasung HD-FT teardown process.</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_203519.jpg"></p><h2 id="overview-of-the-dasung-hd-ft">Overview of the Dasung HD-FT</h2><p>The Dasung HD-FT is a third-generation e-ink monitor with a display of 13.3“, a screen resolution of 2200x1650, a touchscreen, and an adjustable backlight. The monitor connects via a proprietary Y cable, with connections for USB and HDMI; additionally, the Dasung HD-FT can be powered by the micro-usb connection on the left side.</p><p>Once connected to a computer, it acts as a second monitor or, for our purposes, a primary monitor for our e-ink laptop. The monitor’s physical buttons allow you to adjust the contrast, brightness, clear the screen, and change modes.</p><p>The modes (M1, M2, M3, Fast, Fast++, Black, Black+, Black++) correspond to how the monitor displays what’s rendered in the screen using different shades of grey or black/white.</p><p>Let’s take a closer look and dismantle the Dasung HD-FT and look at its components.</p><h2 id="opening-the-dasung-paperlike-hd-ft">Opening the Dasung Paperlike HD-FT</h2><p>Similar to Zettler’s observations and approach, the Dasung HD-FT is made of one piece of construction. I first began with a knife, carefully prying the outer edges of the Dasung Monitor where it’s all glued and making my way slowly through all of the sides.</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_194558.jpg"></p><p>Once I finished prying through all of the sides, what became visible were the screws that were holding everything together.</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_194714.jpg"></p><p>After removing all of the screws, I was able to gain access to the panel!</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_203519.jpg"></p><h2 id="the-e-ink-display-module-and-control-board">The E-ink display module and control board</h2><p>Like Zettler discovered, the Dasung HD-FT chip components upon closer inspection were also chemically peeled off to prevent reverse engineering of the e-ink display and control board.</p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_201821.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_201158.jpg"> <img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_201211.jpg"></p><h2 id="es133tt3-display-module">ES133TT3 Display Module</h2><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_201921.jpg"></p><p><img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_202037.jpg"> <img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_202009.jpg"> <img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_202020.jpg"> <img src="https://alexsoto.dev/static/building-an-e-ink-laptop/IMG_20210216_202024.jpg"></p><p>The e-ink display module model number for the Dasung HD-FT is the: <span><strong>ES133TT3</strong></span></p><p>beck-elektronik<span data-nosnippet=""><sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">1</a></sup></span> describes it as “<em>reflective electrophoretic E Ink technology display module based on active matrix TFT and plastic substrate.

<p>Oh come on!  Don’t play it safe and only go just go for a Coke or Pepsi.  You’re in Japan now.  It’s time to try something more adventurous.</p>



<p>Vending machines mainly for carbonated drinks started appearing across the country in 1960.&nbsp; Now there are an estimated 2,470,000 of them throughout Japan or 1 for approximately every 50 people.&nbsp; Thus, it is easy to grab either a cold or hot drink virtually anywhere in the country on a 24/7 basis.</p>



<p>While the same global players such as Coca-Cola and national powerhouses in the beverage industry like Suntory do, in fact, dominate distribution via vending machines and other channels, relatively obscure minor entrants have still managed to carve out a niche with several unique offerings.&nbsp; Even the big boys have become used to granting a creative license to their marketers to go well beyond normal colas.</p>

<p>The sheer variety of beverages—<em>both non-alcoholic and alcoholic</em>—available in Japan is staggering. &nbsp;To make sense of it all is soft drink critic Ryoko Shimizu (aside–<em>now that’s a cool job!</em>).&nbsp; She has been reviewing the world of non-alcoholic Japanese beverages since the 1980s.&nbsp; Shimizu recently published a <a href="https://news.nifty.com/article/entame/etc/12113-930661/">Top 50 list of her all-time favorites</a> (the original article in Japanese only).</p>



<p>…but wait!  First you need to know this.</p>



<h3><strong>What’s a <em>supodo</em>?</strong></h3>



<p><em>Supodo</em> (スポド) is an abbreviation for the made-up English term “sports drink” in Japanese.&nbsp; This category is a type of soft drink that replenishes the water and minerals lost from the body due to perspiration, especially during exercise. &nbsp;It supposedly helps to prevent dehydration and the potential for heatstroke while playing sports under the scorching sun.</p>



<h3><strong>Top Fifty</strong></h3>



<p>Okay, now that this term has been defined, let’s get to Shimizu’s extensive list which includes plenty of <em>supodo</em> as well as other types of drinks!</p>



<p>Not all of her favorites are still around, but, despite humble beginnings in some cases, a surprising number have since gone mainstream.&nbsp; Scroll down to see how Shimizu ranked them by counting backward from 50 down to 1:</p>



<h4>#50 Sports Mugicha</h4>



<p><strong>Sports Mugicha</strong> sold in the 1990s by Kanebo:&nbsp; Shimizu wrote, “When I first heard the name of this drink, my first impression was that it must be a blend of traditional barley tea and a ‘sports drink.’&nbsp; It consists, in fact, of a combination of an appropriate amount of salt mixed with regular barley tea to enhance its absorption into the body. &nbsp;The can was decorated with a theme from the professional baseball team Yokohama BayStars.”</p>

<h4>#49 Mountain Dew</h4>



<p><strong>Mountain Dew</strong> launched in 1981 by Pepsi Co:&nbsp; This long-seller, which is still popular today, is marketed in Japan with the tag line “new citrus beverage.”&nbsp; The package has changed little over the years.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="239" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mountain-Dew-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mountain-Dew-Image-from-Crea.jpg 239w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Mountain-Dew-Image-from-Crea-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px"><figcaption>Mountain Dew (written in Japanese), Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#48 Tab Clear</h4>



<p><strong>Tab Clear</strong> launched in 1993 by Coca-Cola:&nbsp; Shimizu commented, “It became a hot topic because it was a transparent cola, but I remember that it was subtle in terms of taste. Kotaro Tawara, a popular newscaster at the time, appeared in a commercial.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="245" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tab-Clear-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tab-Clear-Image-from-Crea.jpg 245w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tab-Clear-Image-from-Crea-230x300.jpg 230w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px"><figcaption>Tab Clear, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#47 Tsubu-Tsubu Orange</h4>



<p><strong>Tsubu-Tsubu Orange</strong> was sold in the 1990s by Yamato:&nbsp; This orange drink was conceived based upon the trend of mashed fruit drinks in the 1980s.&nbsp; “Tsubu” means “bead” or “drop” in Japanese.&nbsp; When it was launched, Tsubu-Tsubu Orange lacked national distribution.&nbsp; It was only marketed locally in Nagoya, near where it was made.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="208" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tsubu-Tsubu-Orange-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tsubu-Tsubu-Orange-Image-from-Crea.jpg 208w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tsubu-Tsubu-Orange-Image-from-Crea-195x300.jpg 195w" sizes="(max-width: 208px) 100vw, 208px"><figcaption>Tsubu Tsubu Orange, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#46 Post Water</h4>



<p><strong>Post Water</strong> launched in 1990 by Kirin:&nbsp; Made from lychees, this <em>supodo</em>  or “sports drink” made quite a scene when it debuted in an unusually-shaped flask.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="554" height="554" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Post-Water-Image-Sourced-from-Twitter.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Post-Water-Image-Sourced-from-Twitter.jpg 554w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Post-Water-Image-Sourced-from-Twitter-300x300.jpg 300w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Post-Water-Image-Sourced-from-Twitter-150x150.jpg 150w" sizes="(max-width: 554px) 100vw, 554px"><figcaption>Post Water, Image sourced from Twitter</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#45 Cheerio Grape</h4>



<p><strong>Cheerio Grape</strong> launched in 1965 by Cheerio:&nbsp; Shimizu fondly recalls Cheerio’s Grape drink as being for sale at the candy store near her childhood home.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="204" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cheerio-Grape-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cheerio-Grape-Image-from-Crea.jpg 204w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Cheerio-Grape-Image-from-Crea-191x300.jpg 191w" sizes="(max-width: 204px) 100vw, 204px"><figcaption>Cheerio Grape, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#44 J Water</h4>



<p><strong>J Water</strong> launched in 1993 by Suntory:&nbsp; This drink made its debut as an officially licensed beverage of the J League or Japan Professional Football (soccer) League back when J League was new.&nbsp; This “sports drink” did not have a particularly distinctive taste, but the taste was secondary to packaging in any case.&nbsp; There are also team-specific variants.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="195" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/J-Water-Image-from-Bunshun-Online.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/J-Water-Image-from-Bunshun-Online.jpg 195w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/J-Water-Image-from-Bunshun-Online-183x300.jpg 183w" sizes="(max-width: 195px) 100vw, 195px"><figcaption>J. Water, Image sourced from Bunshun Online</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#43 Ambasa</h4>



<p><strong>Ambasa</strong> launched in 1982 by Coca-Cola:&nbsp; Shimizu commented, “I felt a little &nbsp;uncomfortable with the unfamiliar word ‘Ambasa’ at first, but I quickly got used to it because it was put into virtually every Coca-Cola vending machine.” &nbsp;This carbonated beverage looks milky and tastes lighter than Calpis Soda. &nbsp;There were also melon and pine flavors for a while.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="240" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ambasa-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ambasa-Image-from-Crea.jpg 240w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Ambasa-Image-from-Crea-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 240px) 100vw, 240px"><figcaption>Ambasa, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#42 Apple Oolong Soda</h4>



<p><strong>Apple Oolong Soda</strong> launched in 1988 by Kirin:&nbsp; This is another drink that relies primarily upon packaging to drum up sales.&nbsp; It features characters from the anime Modern Children (いまどきのこども), which attracted a lot of attention when launched.  It is still fairly popular.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="239" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Apple-Oolong-Soda-Image-from-Bunshun-Online.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Apple-Oolong-Soda-Image-from-Bunshun-Online.jpg 239w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Apple-Oolong-Soda-Image-from-Bunshun-Online-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px"><figcaption>Apple Oolong Soda, Image sourced from Bunshun Online</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#41 Sweet Kiss</h4>



<p><strong>Sweet Kiss</strong> launched in 1982 by Cheerio:&nbsp; Sweet Kiss is sort of a variant of Mountain Dew (#49) and features a distinctive graphic design.&nbsp; It is, however, still relatively difficult to find this drink even in Tokyo.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="590" height="442" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sweet-Kiss-Image-from-J-Town-Net.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sweet-Kiss-Image-from-J-Town-Net.jpg 590w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Sweet-Kiss-Image-from-J-Town-Net-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 590px) 100vw, 590px"><figcaption>Sweet  Kiss, Image sourced from J Town Net</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#40 Saruo Monkey King</h4>



<p><strong>Saruo Monkey King</strong> launched in 1994 by Lotte:&nbsp; The name Saruo literally means “monkey king” in Japanese.&nbsp; It was originally marketed as an exclusive type of oolong tea made from tea leaves grown on cliffs where monkeys like to forage food.&nbsp; There is, naturally, some question about whether monkeys actually harvest tea leaves.&nbsp; One of the respondents reportedly remarked in a taste test, “It sort of smells like a monkey.”&nbsp; Luckily for the brand, there are, however, plenty of other people who disagree!</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="216" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Saruo-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Saruo-Image-from-Crea.jpg 216w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Saruo-Image-from-Crea-203x300.jpg 203w" sizes="(max-width: 216px) 100vw, 216px"><figcaption>Saruo or “monkey king” in Japanese, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#39 Afternoon Tea</h4>



<p><strong>Afternoon Tea</strong> launched in sold in 1986 by Kirin:&nbsp; This drink is a best selling long-runner.&nbsp; It is fairly sweet and was the first black tea sold in a 1.5 liter PET bottle.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="194" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Afternoon-Tea-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Afternoon-Tea-Image-from-Crea.jpg 194w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Afternoon-Tea-Image-from-Crea-182x300.jpg 182w" sizes="(max-width: 194px) 100vw, 194px"><figcaption>Afternoon Tea, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#38 Bireley’s Orange</h4>



<p><strong>Bireley’s Orange</strong> launched in 1951 by Asahi:&nbsp; The name of this ultra-long-runner, “Birely’s,” used to be synonymous orange juice. Since the 1970s, when restrictions were introduced that limited marketers’ ability to label a drink as juice unless it was 100% juice, Birely’s had to drop the reference to juice.&nbsp; This minor setback did, however,  not make a major dent in its market share.  The brand is still sold today.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="239" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Birelys-Orange-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Birelys-Orange-Image-from-Crea.jpg 239w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Birelys-Orange-Image-from-Crea-224x300.jpg 224w" sizes="(max-width: 239px) 100vw, 239px"><figcaption>Bireley’s Orange, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#37 Hokuriku Soda Godzilla Matsui Can</h4>



<p><strong>Hokuriku Soda Godzilla Matsui Can</strong> launched in 1997 by Soka Komatsuen:&nbsp; This is a locally produced drink made to help immortalize the famous baseball player Hideki Matsui who was also a “favorite son” of Ishikawa Prefecture.&nbsp; Matsui, whose nickname was “Godzilla,” was a home run king who went on to play for the New York Yankees.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="214" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hokuriku-Soda-Godzilla-Can-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hokuriku-Soda-Godzilla-Can-Image-from-Crea.jpg 214w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Hokuriku-Soda-Godzilla-Can-Image-from-Crea-201x300.jpg 201w" sizes="(max-width: 214px) 100vw, 214px"><figcaption>Hokuriku Soda Godzilla Matsui Can, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#36 Honey Lemon</h4>



<p><strong>Honey Lemon</strong> launched in 1986 by Suntory:&nbsp; This fruit drink experienced explosive sales upon its release.&nbsp; Suntory had a problem, though.&nbsp; As they could not register a trademark for “honey lemon” or even its nickname in Japanese <em>hachi-lemo</em>, this particular name essentially became its own category because several other manufacturers flooded the market with similar drinks by the same name.&nbsp; It is a classic example of just how cut-throat the non-alcoholic drink industry can be in Japan.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="225" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Honey-Lemon-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Honey-Lemon-Image-from-Crea.jpg 225w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Honey-Lemon-Image-from-Crea-211x300.jpg 211w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"><figcaption>Honey Lemon, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#35 McCOL</h4>



<p><strong>McCOL</strong> launched in 1982 by MMC:&nbsp; This collector’s item has long since been taken off the market.&nbsp; It was, apparently, relatively hard to find even when it was available through the mid-1990s.&nbsp; McCOL was marketed as “barley cola,” but it looked just like any other cola.&nbsp; The taste was a combination of barley tea and cider.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="197" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/McCOL-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/McCOL-Image-from-Crea.jpg 197w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/McCOL-Image-from-Crea-185x300.jpg 185w" sizes="(max-width: 197px) 100vw, 197px"><figcaption>McCOL, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#34 TESS Milk Tea</h4>



<p><strong>TESS Milk Tea</strong> sold in the late 1980s by Suntory:&nbsp; TESS had a relatively short lifetime as a semi-sweet type of milk tea.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="238" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tess-Milk-Tea-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tess-Milk-Tea-Image-from-Crea.jpg 238w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Tess-Milk-Tea-Image-from-Crea-223x300.jpg 223w" sizes="(max-width: 238px) 100vw, 238px"><figcaption>TESS Milk Tea, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#33 NCAA</h4>



<p><strong>NCAA</strong> launched in 1981 by Suntory:&nbsp; Named for the National College Athletic Association (NCAA), this classic sports drink was introduced as “the brand new thirst quencher for those who love sports.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="193" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NCAA-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NCAA-Image-from-Crea.jpg 193w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/NCAA-Image-from-Crea-181x300.jpg 181w" sizes="(max-width: 193px) 100vw, 193px"><figcaption>NCAA, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#32 Atamaruko</h4>



<p><strong>Atamaruko</strong> launched in 1990 by Suntory:&nbsp; This citrus mixture of kumquats and calamansi (aka “Philippine lime”) was actually sold hot in the heated section of vending machines. Its name means, in fact, “A Child to Warm You Up.”&nbsp; The cute package design proved effective at attracting customers. &nbsp;It actually led to a second-generation character called “Nacchan” that became even more famous than Atamaruko, who was relegated to the status of “the unknown older sister.”</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="223" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Atamaruko-Image-from-Suntory.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Atamaruko-Image-from-Suntory.jpg 223w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Atamaruko-Image-from-Suntory-209x300.jpg 209w" sizes="(max-width: 223px) 100vw, 223px"><figcaption>Atamaruko, Image sourced from Suntory</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#31 Gatorade</h4>



<p><strong>Gatorade</strong> sold in the 1980s by Yukijirushi:&nbsp; Having been replaced by homegrown rival Pocari Sweat, American uber-brand Gatorade is no longer sold in cans in Japan. It was, though, the first “sports drink” to appear in Japan.&nbsp; At that point, Gatorade was only available as a powder.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="198" height="320" src="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatorade-Image-from-Crea.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatorade-Image-from-Crea.jpg 198w, https://japaninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Gatorade-Image-from-Crea-186x300.jpg 186w" sizes="(max-width: 198px) 100vw, 198px"><figcaption>Gatorade, Image sourced from Crea</figcaption></figure></div>



<h4>#30 Dr. Nakamatsu’s Head Tea</h4>



<p><strong>Dr. Nakamatsu’s Head Tea</strong> launched in 1994 by Cheerio:&nbsp; Now we’re entering the realm of the truly odd.&nbsp; Named for Dr. Yoshiro Nakamatsu, a leading researcher of “smart foods” at the time of launch, this strong blended tea was somehow supposed to enhance cognitive capability.&nbsp; Years later, the same Dr. Nakamatsu gained additional notoriety outside Japan by winning the “Ig Noble …</p></div></div>

    <h2 id="hn-hijacks-your-brain">HN hijacks your brain</h2>
<p>You're an engineer who looks at Hacker News 2-5 times a day. HN is a good way to <em>fill the gaps</em> in time. You scan the front page- repeatedly- for links of interest... reading titles, eyeing scores... often jumping directly to the (overtly contrarian) comments to see if a link is even worth the energy.</p>
<p>Sound familiar?</p>
<p>That cycle hits a sickening <strong>5</strong>/10 of Tristan Harris's <a href="https://medium.com/thrive-global/how-technology-hijacks-peoples-minds-from-a-magician-and-google-s-design-ethicist-56d62ef5edf3">list of mind hijacks</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>(1)  Control the Menu, Control the Choices</li>
<li>(3)  Fear of missing something important</li>
<li>(4)  Social Approval (upvotes)</li>
<li>(6)  Bottomless bowl</li>
<li>(10) Forecasting</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These hijacks  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">aren't</a> intentional, they're just a byproduct of link aggregation platforms.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stoics are turning in their graves, where instead of knowing what's important, the links on HN <em>become</em> what's important, no matter how trivial, pedantic, hyped, or irrelevant.</p>
<p>So if you want help breaking this negative feedback loop, I encourage you to reclaim your attention by turning HN into and RSS feed;</p>
<p>Get more <a href="https://medium.com/@bre/the-cult-of-done-manifesto-724ca1c2ff13">done</a>. Ignore the comments and the <a href="https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2020/01/16/the-internet-of-beefs/">mooks</a>. Set limits. It's incredibly liberating to finish your RSS feed and think to yourself, <em>now what</em>?</p>

<p>Declaring what deserves your attention is the defining feature of RSS, so it's important to declare what aspect of HN you like. Generally people look at high scores. Fortunately HN already has a url specifically for its most "important" (i.e. upvoted) links: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a>.</p>
<p>So if we can subscribe to the links from that page, we'll get the bulk of the links that deserve our attention.</p>
<p>For me, it's critically important for RSS to be a self-hosted solution. No third parties <small>(I'm looking at <em>you</em>, Feedly)</small>.</p>
<p>Otherwise, what's the point of retaking control, you're just shunting control to yet another third party.</p>
<p>My personal setup goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get the Raspberry Pi you bought but never used</li>
<li>Install Docker</li>
<li>Run FreshRSS</li>
<li>Add HN <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/best"><code>/best</code></a> as an RSS feed</li>
<li>(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</li>
<li>(Optional) Pick out a smartphone app to sync with</li>
</ul>
<p>This is just the first thing that worked for me, so by no means is it the guaranteed best. Recommendations and alternatives are welcome! You can, of course, tailor the following guide if you'd like to use a VPS.</p>

<h3 id="prepare-the-pi">Prepare the Pi</h3>
<h4 id="install-git">Install git</h4>
<p>Do a standard Raspbian setup the with <a href="https://soapstone.mradford.com/raspberry-pi-automatic-wifi-and-ssh">internet/ssh/hostname</a>. Then install git:</p>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install git
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker">Install Docker</h4>
<pre><span>curl -sSL</span><span> https://get.docker.com | </span><span>sh
</span></pre><pre><span>sudo</span><span> usermod</span><span> -aG</span><span> docker pi &amp;&amp; </span><span>sudo</span><span> reboot
</span></pre><h4 id="install-docker-compose">Install Docker-compose</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>This method is specifically for Raspbian, if you're using a VPS or non-ARM machine, install docker-compose the <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/">conventional</a> way.</p>
</blockquote>
<pre><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> libffi-dev libssl-dev
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get install</span><span> -y</span><span> python3 python3-pip
</span><span>sudo</span><span> apt-get remove python-configparser
</span><span>sudo</span><span> pip3 install docker-compose
</span></pre>
<pre><span>git</span><span> clone https://github.com/FreshRSS/FreshRSS

cd FreshRSS/Docker
</span></pre>
<p>We're using a Raspberry Pi, so you'll need to pick out the ARM image! Use your favorite editor to modify these lines of the <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file:</p>
<pre><span># docker-compose.yml
</span><span>-    image: freshrss/freshrss:latest
</span><span>+    image: freshrss/freshrss:arm
</span></pre>
<p>Now you're ready to execute FreshRSS:</p>
<pre><span>docker-compose</span><span> up</span><span> -d
</span></pre>
<p>Once that's complete, head to your Pi's IP address (or hostname, if you opted for that) on port <code>8080</code> in your laptop's/desktop's browser (something like http://1.2.3.4:8080), and go through the initial setup.</p>

<p>Add <code>https://hnrss.org/best</code> as an RSS feed (from <a href="https://hnrss.github.io/">hnrss.github.io</a>).</p>
<p>Congratulations! You've officially RSS-ified HN!</p>
<h3 id="optional-port-forwarding-and-dns-setup">(Optional) Port forwarding and DNS setup</h3>
<p>Unless you went with the VPS route, you're probably behind a LAN, so if you want to access your RSS outside your LAN, you'll need to set up port forwarding and/or DNS. That's beyond the scope of this guide, but there are many guides online that can get you there.</p>
<h3 id="optional-pick-out-an-app">(Optional) Pick out an app</h3>
<p>You could just expose the pi to the internet, and read RSS directly from the browser, but I think having an app is a nice touch.</p>
<p>First you'll need to enable API access in FreshRSS. Go to <code>Authentication</code> and check the box to allow API access:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-auth.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot1"></p>
<p>Then create an API key under <code>Profile</code>:</p>
<p><img src="https://soapstone.mradford.com/freshrss-profile.png" alt="fresh-rss-screenshot2"></p>
<p>Now you can use the API url and the API key in your selected app to pull data down locally. Nice!</p>
<p>Here's a non-exhaustive list of open-source (Android) apps to get you started.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/readrops/Readrops">Readrops</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.readrops.app">play store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nextcloud/news-android">New Android</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.luhmer.owncloudnewsreader&amp;pcampaignid=MKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1">play store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/nilsbraden/ttrss-reader-fork">ttrss-reader-fork</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.ttrssreader">play store</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/fistons/TinyTinyFeed">TinyTinyFeed</a> - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.poopeeland.tinytinyfeed">play store</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Truth be told, a lot of the closed source RSS apps I've checked out tend to be slightly higher in quality, so if you're willing to compromise on that front then they are worth exploring.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-did-we-gain">What did we gain?</h2>
<p>It may not seem like it, but we've gained a <strong>lot</strong> by doing this!</p>

February 25, 2021 | https://rudderstack.com/blog/reverse-etl-is-just-another-data-pipeline | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rudderstack.com/blog/reverse-etl-is-just-another-data-pipeline">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure><div></div></figure><section><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Astasia from RedPoint Ventures wrote a <a href="https://medium.com/memory-leak/reverse-etl-a-primer-4e6694dcc7fb">great post</a> on new technologies supporting “reverse ETL” functionality in the customer data stack. </p>
<p>We’re excited to be innovating in the area of reverse ETL tech (via our Warehouse Actions feature) and our product and engineering teams discuss these topics and industry trends often, so we thought it would be helpful to provide a bit more technical depth on a few of Astasia’s points. </p>
<h2>1) Data Movement Differs Between Event Streams and Tabular Data, Which is an Important Consideration for Reverse ETL</h2>
<h3>Differences in Moving Data</h3>
<p>ETL/ELT solutions all accomplish a similar function, which is moving data, but there are several foundational differences to keep in mind when it comes to the data. One of those is the difference between <em>event stream data</em> and <em>tabular data</em>. </p>
<p>Everyone is familiar with this distinction on the ingestion side of the stack. Ingesting event streams is different from ingesting tabular data from SaaS applications (like Salesforce), not just in how the data is generated, i.e., pulled via API vs generated by an SDK, but also in the structure of the data itself. </p>
<p>This distinction has significant impacts, from real-time requirements to downstream reporting implications. This distinction has led to different vendors doing well in each category (i.e., Segment for event streaming and Fivetran for tabular data), but modern companies have to leverage both. </p>
<p>At RudderStack, we believe there is an opportunity to do both well, together. In fact, a unified stack to do both can achieve some interesting things, like cross-pipeline identity stitching (i.e., joining Salesforce record IDs with anonymousIDs) and unified data governance. We’re building these solutions at RudderStack, but that’s a topic for a different post. </p>
<h3>Event Stream vs. Tabular Data for Reverse ETL</h3>
<p>When you hear the term reverse ETL, it’s easy to think only of tabular data. The distinction still exists, though, and you can (and should) distinguish between event stream data and tabular data. </p>
<p>Astasia touched on a few use cases for tabular data, but reverse ETL as an event stream is equally as important. One use case we see quite often among our customers is sending events stored in logs (e.g., generated by your back end application and dumped into S3) into destinations like Google Analytics and Amplitude for analytics or platforms like Braze for marketing. </p>
<p>Many of our customers also perform more advanced processing like data mining or ML modeling of logs before sending them as events, then use RudderStack to pipe the data. </p>
<h2>2) Table Sync can be Modeled as an Event Stream</h2>
<p>An important point related to tabular vs event stream data is that tabular data can be modeled as events, but not necessarily the other way around. On the ETL/ELT side, CDC technologies (or incremental pulls) have generated quite a bit of interest because there are advantages of representing that data as events versus doing a batch pull via API. </p>
<p>Some of those advantages include incremental syncs for real-time updates, maintaining a consistent point-in-time state and routing the data to streaming technologies (we will covers this topic in more depth in a future post). </p>
<p>This is possible because <em>tabular data are actually a subset of event data</em>. In a similar way, batch processing is a subset of streaming processing. This means that tabular data can be derived from a stream of events and recreate the final state at any point (see event sourcing architecture). This is not true for the inverse, though. </p>
<p>In fact, the reason the industry adopted the tabular/batch model were primarily technical—it is much more difficult to build and manage streaming data, though this is changing with technologies like RudderStack. </p>
<p>At RudderStack, we have modeled table sync as an event stream in our reverse ETL solution. </p>
<p>At a high level, syncing a row from your warehouse to a ‘row’ in a cloud application is an “event” that specifies which data points are being mapped. Tools like Segment and RudderStack already accomplish that functionality with <code>.identify</code> calls in the event stream, so there is no inherent limitation of the data model for the use case. </p>
<p>So, while there are certainly different user experiences for streaming-based solutions like RudderStack vs table sync solutions like Census, they are primarily variations in UI/UX. </p>
<h2>3) The Limitations of Segment’s Personas Product for Reverse ETL</h2>
<p>Astasia made a great point about the distinction between reverse ETL and Segment’s Persona’s product. Personas is a powerful product feature, but it isn’t a reverse ETL solution. The reason is simple: Personas treats the user profile as a first-class object in data sync. The practical implication of this is that all data sync must conform to a contact/account structure, but as the recent increase in reverse ETL startups has shown, companies need sync functionality that serves a much wider range of use cases. </p>
<p>Reverse ETL as an event stream directly from the warehouse is unhindered by those limitations. In fact, with our Warehouse Actions feature, our customers can turn warehouse tables into a flexible, configurable event stream. That includes updating contacts, accounts and audiences, but can also support sending of cleansed internal events, derived proxy events (events represented by absence of behavior) and use cases where the data needs to be delivered to other infrastructure via tools like Kafka, Redis or HTTP endpoints. </p>
<h2>4) Reverse ETL is Still Just Data Movement, and a Single Pipe Simplifies Your Stack, Security, and Data governance</h2>
<p>Our mission at RudderStack is to help data engineers become the heroes of their companies by providing every team with rich data. We want to make their jobs easier, and part of that mission is simplifying data management into one pipeline. </p>
<p>In the modern stack, the warehouse is king and many destinations are also becoming sources (and vice versa!). </p>
<p>For example, sources of data often include </p>
<ul>
<li>Events coming from your client or server-side apps</li>
<li>Data from your SaaS tools</li>
<li>Data from your internal databases</li>
<li>Data from your warehouses and data lakes (and…lakehouses) </li>
<li>Data from internal event streams (like Kafka). </li>
</ul>
<p>When all of those sources are also destinations, almost every combination of source and destination is a use case, which create some important categories of tooling in the customer data stack: </p>
<ul>
<li>App to warehouse/SaaS (event streaming) </li>
<li>SaaS to warehouse (‘traditional’ ETL/ELT)</li>
<li>Warehouse to SaaS (new ‘reverse ETL’ category) </li>
<li>SaaS to SaaS (API to API category) </li>
</ul>
<p>Increasingly, those categories within the stack need to support important use cases that are becoming standard, but are still challenging for many companies to implement from a technical standpoint: </p>
<ul>
<li>Enabling customer-facing ML use-cases by sending live events to a key-value store (like Redis) for real-time personalization</li>
<li>Enabling internal ML use-cases by pulling data, enriching with ML, then sending it from the warehouse to tools for internal teams (i.e., Salesforce, Marketo, etc.)</li>
<li>Streaming internal events from Kafka to SaaS applications</li>
<li>Feeding transformed data (features) to feature stores (like Tecton)</li>
</ul>
<p>When you step back and look at those categories and the use cases they must support, it becomes clear that a business could easily have to build or buy a significant number of technologies to enable all of the functionality. In fact, we hear from companies all of the time about the pain of managing multiple technologies and vendors (which means contracts) across data pipelines. </p>

<p><em>“I think we have failed as technologists if we need to build different tools to load data into a warehouse and get data out of the warehouse. This is “focus on doing one thing well” and “you must create a new category” gone too far.”</em></p>
<p>We agree. Customers tell us all of the time that when it comes to managing pipelines in the context of the modern data stack, “best of breed” is becoming problematic to manage—after all, it’s the same customer data. </p>
<p>At RudderStack, we’re building the complete customer data stack for simplified pipeline management, including the reverse ETL component. </p>

So minimising downtime when transferring hosts is a pretty big deal.</p><p>Let's learn how to avoid downtime.</p><h2 id="step-1-transfer-your-content"><a href="#step-1-transfer-your-content" aria-label="migrating wordpress hosts without downtime permalink"></a>Step 1: Transfer your content</h2><p>The first step is to transfer your content to your new host, <strong>without turning off the old host</strong>. Your site on your old hosting provider doesn't have to be shutdown for you to start standing up your site on the new hosting provider.</p><p>Whether that's via a plugin, and manually copying your files across using FileZilla, or by getting a developer to copy your database to the new host, you need to have two copies of your site running to avoid downtime.</p><p>At the end of this step you should have two WordPress sites:</p><ol><li>The old one, which your domain is still pointing to (as in, visiting <a href="https://yoursite.com/">https://yoursite.com</a> still shows your WordPress site on your old hosting provider)</li><li>The new one, with a weird URL (depending on your new provider, this could be an IP address, or just a testing URL)</li></ol><h2 id="step-2-test-everything-on-your-new-site"><a href="#step-2-test-everything-on-your-new-site" aria-label="migrating wordpress hosts without downtime permalink"></a>Step 2: Test everything on your new site</h2><p>The last thing you want is to realise you forgot to copy your images <strong>after</strong> your site's users start visiting the new site.</p><p>Click around your new WordPress site, ensure images work, pages and posts are all there with the URLs you expect.</p><p>Once you're satisfied the new site works as you expect, you're ready to update your DNS</p><h2 id="step-3-update-your-dns-settings"><a href="#step-3-update-your-dns-settings" aria-label="migrating wordpress hosts without downtime permalink"></a>Step 3: Update your DNS settings</h2><p>This step will be different depending on your domain registrar (the company you bought the domain from), but the gist of it is that you're changing the address your domain points to from your old hosting provider, to the new one.</p><p>This step can take up to 72 hours for some old school providers, and can be as quick as a few minutes with AWS or CloudFlare. The time it takes is due to the DNS TTL values you use - you can read more about that <a href="https://ns1.com/resources/understanding-ttl-values-in-dns-records">here</a>. You can speed this step up by setting your TTL to a low value (like 300 seconds or 5 minutes) <strong>before you start the migration</strong>.</p><p>You can test whether the new hosting provider is live by creating a dummy blog post or page using the same URL you tested your new hosting provider with - if the post shows up at <a href="https://yoursite.com/">https://yoursite.com</a>, your new site is live!</p><p>Once you're <strong>absolutely sure</strong> your domain is displaying the WordPress site from your new hosting provider, <em>then</em> you can turn off the WordPress site running at your old hosting provider.</p><h2 id="how-does-this-prevent-downtime"><a href="#how-does-this-prevent-downtime" aria-label="migrating wordpress hosts without downtime permalink"></a>How does this prevent downtime?</h2><p>Essentially by not turning off either WordPress site, you entirely avoid downtime. When you switch the DNS records from the old hosting provider over to the new one, people visiting your site just start seeing the new site (since you don't turn off the old site until the migration is complete).</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Nearly two years after releasing 1.0 Alpha 1, and after seven alpha releases,
            we are ready to bring EdgeDB to the public beta phase!</p>
<p>This means that as of now, we will make every effort to keep the public-facing
            APIs backwards compatible.  This includes EdgeQL, our standard library,
            schema definition language, official database clients’ APIs, even CLI
            commands and their options.  Most importantly, EdgeDB’s dumps made today
            will be restorable in future versions of the database.</p>
<p>This release completes a set of features we feel are crucial for
            a well-rounded 1.0 product, and we invite early adopters to try it out.
            On our end, we’re spending the next few months on getting EdgeDB ready
            for the first stable release.  Entering Beta means we won’t be adding
            new features until the release of 1.0 final.</p>
<p>You can <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/download">download</a> 1.0b1 in a number of ways or try it out
            in our <a href="https://tutorial.edgedb.com/">interactive tutorial</a> without the need to install
            anything.</p>

<h4>What’s EdgeDB</h4>
<p>EdgeDB is an advanced <a href="https://github.com/edgedb/edgedb">open source</a> relational database built
            on top of PostgreSQL which aims to <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/blog/a-path-to-a-10x-database">change the game</a> in terms
            of data layer usability and performance.</p>
<p>It combines an expressive object-oriented data model with a composable
            query language based on set logic, making complex data schemas easy to
            express, populate, and query.  The query system’s explicit goal is to
            address <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/blog/we-can-do-better-than-sql">shortcomings of SQL</a>.</p>
<p>As a database designed for the long haul, EdgeDB allows for your data
            to evolve along with changing business needs, by providing built-in
            support for schema migrations.  It’s also developed in the open and
            under the permissive Apache license.</p>
<p>EdgeDB’s performance focus is embodied in its carefully designed
            first-party database clients (currently available for JavaScript, Go,
            and Python.)  The database server itself compiles EdgeQL queries to
            efficient SQL in ways that outperform many manually written queries.</p>
<p>As a modern database, EdgeDB also provides interoperability with your
            other services via built-in support for GraphQL, REST, and easy <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/docs/clients/01_js/api/connection#Connection.queryJSON">casting
                from and to JSON</a> while keeping your data strictly typed.</p>
<div id="built-in-database-migrations-in-use">

<p>We believe that managing the evolution of your data models is a crucial
                feature in a modern database product.  The alternatives would be either
                weakly typed schemas or a third-party product.  We’re not satisfied with
                either.  The former unnecessarily moves some of the responsibilities of
                the database into your application code, making data consistency harder
                and development more error-prone.  The latter on the other hand usually
                ties you to a particular database connection framework in a particular
                programming language, putting that language in a privileged position.
                This is suboptimal in today’s environment where very often mobile
                applications are written in multiple programming languages, a Web
                front-end can be another, and back-end processing using yet another.</p>
<p>With Beta 1, the migrations functionality we envisioned for EdgeDB
                is fully realized.  While you could <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/docs/edgeql/ddl/migrations">start, populate, and commit
                    migrations</a> from EdgeQL directly for a few releases
                already, now you can fully manage migrations from the CLI, making the
                workflow even more high-level.</p>
<p>The idea here is to be able to version your schema alongside your
                source code, possibly as a separate repository that you can link
                as a submodule in multiple applications that your system consists of.
                That repository would hold schema files describing migrations between
                different states of your data model.</p>
<p>As an example, let’s say we start with the following schema for a simple
                chat app:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>module</span> <span>default</span> {
    <span>type</span> User {
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> name <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> email <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> password_hash <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
    }

    <span>type</span> Message {
        <span>required</span> <span>link</span> author <span>-&gt;</span> User;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> body <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> timestamp <span>-&gt;</span> <span>datetime</span> {
            <span>default</span> <span>:=</span> <span>datetime_current</span>()
        }
    }
};</span></span></pre>
<p>The migration CLI looks for <code>.esdl</code> files in the <code>dbschema</code> directory
                by default, so let’s create one and write the above into a
                <code>dbschema/default.esdl</code> file inside it.  Let’s
                <a href="https://www.edgedb.com/docs/tutorial/install/">install</a> EdgeDB server and then create a new
                database instance for our chat app:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb server init chatapp</span></span></pre>
<p>Now, we can create the initial migration to the schema we’ve written above:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp create-migration
did you create object type 'default::User'? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]</span></span></pre>
<p>This is new, what do all those possible actions mean?  Let’s find out:</p>
<pre><span><span>?

y - confirm the prompt, use the DDL statements
n - reject the prompt
l - list the DDL statements associated with prompt
c - list already confirmed EdgeQL statements
b - revert back to previous save point, perhaps previous question
s - stop and save changes (splits migration into multiple)
q - quit without saving changes
h or ? - print help
did you create object type 'default::User'? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]</span></span></pre>
<p>That’s clear, we did in fact create <code>User</code>. Let’s confirm:</p>
<pre><span><span>y
did you create object type 'default::Message'? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
Created dbschema/migrations/00001.edgeql, id:
m1ufwaxcqiwcq3ttcujnxv6f3jewhfrywc442z6gjk3sm3e5fgyr4q</span></span></pre>
<p>This creates the first migration file
                <code>dbschema/migrations/00001.edgeql</code>. After reviewing it to make
                sure everything is in order, we can apply the migration with the
                following command:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp migrate
Applied m1ufwaxcqiwcq3ttcujnxv6f3jewhfrywc442z6gjk3sm3e5fgyr4q
(00001.edgeql)</span></span></pre>
<p>In the course of implementing our app we decide to add more features,
                such as a friends list and multiple chat channels, so we alter our
                schema to be:</p>
<pre><span><span><span>module</span> <span>default</span> {
    <span>type</span> User {
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> name <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> email <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> password_hash <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;

        <span>multi</span> <span>link</span> friends <span>-&gt;</span> User;
    }

    <span>type</span> Message {
        <span>required</span> <span>link</span> author <span>-&gt;</span> User;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> body <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> timestamp <span>-&gt;</span> <span>datetime</span> {
            <span>default</span> <span>:=</span> <span>datetime_current</span>()
        }

        <span>link</span> channel <span>-&gt;</span> Channel;
    }

    <span>type</span> Channel {
        <span>required</span> <span>property</span> title <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span> {
            <span>constraint</span> <span>exclusive</span>;
        };
        <span>property</span> description <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span>;
    }
};</span></span></pre>
<p>And we apply the changes by using <code>create-migration</code> and <code>migrate</code>
                commands again:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp create-migration
did you create object type 'default::Channel'? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
did you create link 'channel' of object type 'default::Message'?
[y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
did you create link 'friends' of object type 'default::User'?
[y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
Created dbschema/migrations/00002.edgeql, id:
m1kebitqygj3o75wvrnicnpwthinqsofb6hnpbnr7vrtjfynqelmzq
$ edgedb -I chatapp migrate
Applied m1kebitqygj3o75wvrnicnpwthinqsofb6hnpbnr7vrtjfynqelmzq
(00002.edgeql)</span></span></pre>
<p>At this point we may want to actually create a default channel “Main”
                and make the <code>channel</code> link required. So we alter the schema to make
                the link required and run <code>create-migration</code> again:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp create-migration
did you make link 'channel' of object type 'default::Message'
required? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]</span></span></pre>
<p>Indeed we did but for the sake of curiosity let’s list the DDL that
                the tool is producing for us here:</p>
<pre><span><span>l

Following DDL statements will be applied:
ALTER TYPE default::Message {
    ALTER LINK channel {
        SET REQUIRED USING (\(fill_expr));
    };
};</span></span></pre>
<p>Interestingly the DDL statement specifies that some expression will
                have to be provided to backfill data in the database.  Let’s see how
                it deals with this:</p>
<pre><span><span>did you make link 'channel' of object type 'default::Message'
required? [y,n,l,c,b,s,q,?]
y
Please specify an expression to populate existing objects in
order to make link 'channel' required:
fill_expr&gt; SELECT Channel FILTER .title = 'Main'
Created dbschema/migrations/00003.edgeql, id:
m1wk64aoerkmvbdlurcxjxgbgv6c3xmuo3uz7pxc3gauyx4muysg6q</span></span></pre>
<p>However, before applying this migration we also add the line <code>INSERT
default::Channel {title := 'Main'};</code> at the beginning of the
                migration block in the <code>dbschema/migrations/00003.edgeql</code> file
                to ensure the <code>SELECT</code> above finds the default channel.
                Now we can actually apply the changes:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp migrate
edgedb error: could not read migrations in dbschema/migrations:
could not read migration file dbschema/migrations/00003.edgeql:
migration name should be
`m1fckqi5wqjtgynu77ummambcid3c2xp7wq4piadh5glbxcyxrkkba` but
`m1wk64aoerkmvbdlurcxjxgbgv6c3xmuo3uz7pxc3gauyx4muysg6q` is used
instead.
Migration names are computed from the hash of the migration
contents. To proceed you must fix the statement to read as:
  CREATE MIGRATION
  m1fckqi5wqjtgynu77ummambcid3c2xp7wq4piadh5glbxcyxrkkba ONTO ...
if this migration is not applied to any database. Alternatively,
revert the changes to the file.</span></span></pre>
<p>Uh-oh! The migration failed, but the error message actually explains
                what happened: the tool discovered we made manual changes to the file.
                Since this is deliberate, we just need to adjust the migration hash in
                order to proceed.  The tool even supplies us with the new hash. After
                adjusting the migration file, we can now apply it:</p>
<pre><span><span>$ edgedb -I chatapp migrate
Applied m1fckqi5wqjtgynu77ummambcid3c2xp7wq4piadh5glbxcyxrkkba</span></span></pre></div></section></article></div>

<p>
<span><i>ABSTRACT</i></span></p>


<p>
<span>Symbolic links make the Unix file system non-hierarchical, resulting in
multiple valid path names for a given file.
This ambiguity is a source of confusion, especially since some shells
work overtime to present a consistent view from programs such as
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>,
while other programs and
the kernel itself do nothing about the problem.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Plan 9 has no symbolic links but it does have other mechanisms that produce the same difficulty.
Moreover, Plan 9 is founded on the ability to control a program’s environment
by manipulating its name space.
Ambiguous names muddle the result of operations such as copying a name space across
the network.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>To address these problems,
the Plan 9 kernel has been modified to maintain an accurate path name for every active
file (open file, working directory, mount table entry) in the system.
The definition of ‘accurate’ is that the path name for a file is guaranteed to be the rooted,
absolute name
the program used to acquire it.
These names are maintained by an efficient method that combines lexical processing—such as
evaluating
</span><span><tt>..</tt></span><span>
by just removing the last path name element of a directory—with
local operations within the file system to maintain a consistently, easily understood view
of the name system.
Ambiguous situations are resolved by examining the lexically maintained names themselves.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>A new kernel call,
</span><span><tt>fd2path</tt></span><span>,
returns the file name associated with an open file,
permitting the use of reliable names to improve system
services ranging from
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
to debugging.
Although this work was done in Plan 9,
Unix systems could also benefit from the addition of
a method to recover the accurate name of an
open file or the current directory.
</span></p>




<p>
<span><b>Motivation
</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Consider the following unedited transcript of a session running the Bourne shell on a modern
Unix system:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;echo&nbsp;$HOME</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;$HOME</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;../rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>../rob:&nbsp;bad&nbsp;directory</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>(The same output results from running
</span><span><tt>tcsh</tt></span><span>;
we’ll discuss
</span><span><tt>ksh</tt></span><span>
in a moment.)
To a neophyte being schooled in the delights of a hierarchical file name space,
this behavior must be baffling.
It is, of course, the consequence of a series of symbolic links intended to give users
the illusion they share a disk, when in fact their files are scattered over several devices:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ls&nbsp;-ld&nbsp;/home/rob&nbsp;/home/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>lrwxr-xr-x&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;root&nbsp;&nbsp;sys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;26&nbsp;&nbsp;1998&nbsp;/home/ken&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;/n/bopp/v6/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>lrwxr-xr-x&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;root&nbsp;&nbsp;sys&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14&nbsp;Dec&nbsp;23&nbsp;&nbsp;1998&nbsp;/home/rob&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;/n/bopp/v7/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>The introduction of symbolic links has changed the Unix file system from a true
hierarchy into a directed graph, rendering
</span><span><tt>..</tt></span><span>
ambiguous and sowing confusion.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Unix popularized hierarchical naming, but the introduction of symbolic links
made its naming irregular.
Worse, the
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
command, through the underlying
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
library routine,
uses a tricky, expensive algorithm that often delivers the wrong answer.
Starting from the current directory,
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
opens the parent,
</span><span><tt>..</tt></span><span>,
and searches it for an entry whose i-number matches the current directory;
the matching entry is the final path element of the ultimate result.
Applying this process iteratively,
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
works back towards the root.
Since
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
knows nothing about symbolic links, it will recover surprising names for
directories reached by them,
as illustrated by the example;
the backward paths
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
traverses will not backtrack across the links.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Partly for efficiency and partly to make
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
more predictable, the Korn shell
</span><span><tt>ksh</tt></span><span>
[Korn94]
implements
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
as a builtin.
(The
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
command must be a builtin in any shell, since the current directory is unique to each process.)
</span><span><tt>Ksh</tt></span><span>
maintains its own private view of the file system to try to disguise symbolic links;
in particular,
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
involve some lexical processing (somewhat like the
</span><span><tt>cleanname</tt></span><span>
function discussed later
in this paper), augmented by heuristics such as examining the environment
for names like
</span><span><tt>$HOME</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>$PWD</tt></span><span>
to assist initialization of the state of the private view. [Korn00]
</span></p>
<p>
<span>This transcript begins with a Bourne shell running:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ksh</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>This result is encouraging.  Another example, again starting from a Bourne shell:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;../ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>../ken:&nbsp;bad&nbsp;directory</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ksh</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;cd&nbsp;../ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/home/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>By doing extra work,
the Korn shell is providing more sensible behavior,
but it is easy to defeat:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;bin</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob/bin</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ksh</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v7/rob/bin</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;exit</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/home/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v6/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;ksh</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;pwd</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>/n/bopp/v6/ken</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>$&nbsp;</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>In these examples,
</span><span><tt>ksh</tt></span><span>’s
built-in
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
failed to produce the results
(</span><span><tt>/home/rob/bin</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>/home/ken</tt></span><span>)
that the previous example might have led us to expect.
The Korn shell is hiding the problem, not solving it, and in fact is not even hiding it very well.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>A deeper question is whether the shell should even be trying to make
</span><span><tt>pwd</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
do a better job.
If it does, then the
</span><span><tt>getwd</tt></span><span>
library call and every program that uses it will behave differently from the shell,
a situation that is sure to confuse.
Moreover, the ability to change directory to
</span><span><tt>../ken</tt></span><span>
with the Korn shell’s
</span><span><tt>cd</tt></span><span>
command but not with the
</span><span><tt>chdir</tt></span><span>
system call is a symptom of a diseased system, not a healthy shell.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>The operating system should provide names that work and make sense.
Symbolic links, though, are here to stay, so we need a way to provide
sensible, unambiguous names in the face of a non-hierarchical name space.
This paper shows how the challenge was met on Plan 9, an operating system
with Unix-like naming.
</span></p>
<p>
<span><b>Names in Plan 9
</b></span></p>
<p>
<span>Except for some details involved with bootstrapping, file names in Plan 9 have the same syntax as in Unix.
Plan 9 has no symbolic links, but its name space construction operators,
</span><span><tt>bind</tt></span><span>
and
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>,
make it possible to build the same sort of non-hierarchical structures created
by symbolically linking directories on Unix.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Plan 9’s
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>
system call takes a file descriptor
and attaches to the local name space the file system service it represents:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>mount(fd,&nbsp;"/dir",&nbsp;flags)</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>Here
</span><span><tt>fd</tt></span><span>
is a file descriptor to a communications port such as a pipe or network connection;
at the other end of the port is a service, such as file server, that talks 9P, the Plan 9 file
system protocol.
After the call succeeds, the root directory of the service will be visible at the
</span><span><i>mount point</i></span><span>
</span><span><tt>/dir</tt></span><span>,
much as with the
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>
call of Unix.
The
</span><span><tt>flag</tt></span><span>
argument specifies the nature of the attachment:
</span><span><tt>MREPL</tt></span><span>
says that the contents of the root directory (appear to) replace the current contents of
</span><span><tt>/dir</tt></span><span>;
</span><span><tt>MAFTER</tt></span><span>
says that the current contents of
</span><span><tt>dir</tt></span><span>
remain visible, with the mounted directory’s contents appearing
</span><span><i>after</i></span><span>
any existing files;
and
</span><span><tt>MBEFORE</tt></span><span>
says that the contents remain visible, with
the mounted directory’s contents appearing
</span><span><i>before</i></span><span>
any existing files.
These multicomponent directories are called
</span><span><i>union directories</i></span><span>
and are somewhat different from union directories in 4.4BSD-Lite [PeMc95], because
only the top-level directory itself is unioned, not its descendents, recursively.
(Plan 9’s union directories are used differently from 4.4BSD-Lite’s, as will become apparent.)
</span></p>
<p>
<span>For example, to bootstrap a diskless computer the system builds a local name space containing
only the root directory,
</span><span><tt>/</tt></span><span>,
then uses the network to open a connection
to the main file server.
It then executes
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>mount(rootfd,&nbsp;"/",&nbsp;MREPL);</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>After this call, the entire file server’s tree is visible, starting from the root of the local machine.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>While
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>
connects a new service to the local name space,
</span><span><tt>bind</tt></span><span>
rearranges the existing name space:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>bind("tofile",&nbsp;"fromfile",&nbsp;flags)</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>causes subsequent mention of the
</span><span><tt>fromfile</tt></span><span>
(which may be a plain file or a directory)
to behave as though
</span><span><tt>tofile</tt></span><span>
had been mentioned instead, somewhat like a symbolic link.
(Note, however, that the arguments are in the opposite order
compared to
</span><span><tt>ln</tt></span><span>
</span><span><tt>-s</tt></span><span>).
The
</span><span><tt>flags</tt></span><span>
argument is the same as with
</span><span><tt>mount</tt></span><span>.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>As an example, a sequence something like the following is done at bootstrap time to
assemble, under the single directory
</span><span><tt>/bin</tt></span><span>,
all of the binaries suitable for this architecture, represented by (say) the string
</span><span><tt>sparc</tt></span><span>:
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>bind("/sparc/bin",&nbsp;"/bin",&nbsp;MREPL);</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>bind("/usr/rob/sparc/bin",&nbsp;"/bin",&nbsp;MAFTER);</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>This sequence of
</span><span><tt>binds</tt></span><span>
causes
</span><span><tt>/bin</tt></span><span>
to contain first the standard binaries, then the contents of
</span><span><tt>rob</tt></span><span>’s
private SPARC binaries.
The ability to build such union directories
obviates the need for a shell
</span><span><tt>$PATH</tt></span><span>
variable
while providing opportunities for managing heterogeneity.
If the system were a Power PC, the same sequence would be run with
</span><span><tt>power</tt></span><span>
textually substituted for
</span><span><tt>sparc</tt></span><span>
to place the Power PC binaries in
</span><span><tt>/bin</tt></span><span>
rather than the SPARC binaries.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>Trouble is already brewing.  After these bindings are set up,
where does
</span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;/bin</tt></span></p>
<p>
<span><tt>%&nbsp;cd&nbsp;..</tt></span></p>



<p>
<span>set the current working directory, to
</span><span><tt>/</tt></span><span>
or
</span><span><tt>/sparc</tt></span><span>
or
</span><span><tt>/usr/rob/sparc</tt></span><span>?
We will return to this issue.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>There are some important differences between
</span><span><tt>binds</tt></span><span>
and symbolic links.
First,
symbolic links are a static part of the file system, while
Plan 9 bindings are created at run time, are stored in the kernel,
and endure only as long as the system maintains them;
they are temporary.
Since they are known to the kernel but not the file system, they must
be set up each time the kernel boots or a user logs in;
permanent bindings are created by editing system initialization scripts
and user profiles rather than by building them in the file system itself.
</span></p>
<p>
<span>The Plan 9 kernel records what bindings are active for a process,
whereas symbolic links, being held on the Unix file server, may strike whenever the process evaluates
a file name.
Also, symbolic links apply to all processes that evaluate the affected file, whereas
</span><span><tt>bind</tt></span><span>
has a local scope, applying only to the process that executes it and …</span></p></div>

<p dir="ltr"><em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/chinopdsimmons/photos/crime-analyst-green-at-the-helm-of-our-real-time-crime-center/125426665468061/">Source: Chino Chief of Police</a></em></p>
</center>

<p dir="ltr">Over the last two decades, law enforcement agencies across the United States have been obtaining more and more sophisticated surveillance technologies to collect data. Technologies such as networked cameras, automated license plate readers, and gunshot detection are deployed around the clock, as are the tools to process this data, such as predictive policing software and AI-enhanced video analytics. The last five years have seen a distinct trend in which police have begun deploying all of this technology in conjunction with one another. The technologies, working in concert, are being consolidated and fed into physical locations called Real-Time Crime Centers (RTCCs). These high-tech hubs, filled with walls of TV monitors and computer workstations for sworn officers and civilian analysts, not only exploit huge amounts of data, but also are used to justify an increase in surveillance technology through new "data-driven" or "intelligence-led" policing strategies.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">As part of the Atlas of Surveillance project, the Electronic Frontier Foundation and students from the Reynolds School of Journalism at the University of Nevada, Reno have identified more than 80 RTCCs across the United States, with heavy concentrations in the South and the Northeast. In this report, we highlight the capabilities and controversies surrounding 7 of these facilities. As this trend expands, it is crucial that the public understands how the technologies are combined to collect data about people as they move through their day-to-day lives.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">RTCCs are similar to <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2014/04/why-fusion-centers-matter-faq#:~:text=about%20fusion%20centers%3F-,What%20are%20fusion%20centers%3F,who%20analyze%20and%20share%20intelligence.">Fusion Centers</a>, to the extent the terms are sometimes used interchangeably. We distinguish between the two: fusion centers are technology command centers that function on a larger regional level, are typically controlled by a state-level organization, and are formally part of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's fusion center network. They also focus on distributing information about national security "threats," which are often broadly interpreted. RTCCs are generally focused on municipal or county level activities and focus on a general spectrum of public safety issues, from car thefts to gun crime to situational awareness at public events.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The term “real-time” is also somewhat misleading: while there is often a focus on accessing data in real-time to communicate to first responders, many law enforcement agencies use RTCC to mine historical data to make decisions about the future through "predictive policing," a controversial and largely unproven strategy to identify places where crime could occur or people who might commit crimes.&nbsp;</p>

<center>
<p dir="ltr"><img alt="A map of the United States with small, orange circles representing real-time crime centers." src="https://atlasofsurveillance.org/files/pictures/12/content_RTCC_MAP.png"></p>
</center>

<p dir="ltr">So far, the Atlas of Surveillance project has identified RTCCs in 29 states, with the highest number in Florida (14) and New York (11); however, Mississippi also stood out with four RTCCs despite being a significantly smaller state. While RTCCs are commonly found in large metropolitan areas, even smaller cities such as Ogden, Utah and Hampton, Virginia have established their own RTCCs. There may be more RTCCs yet to be discovered. In Denver, local officials and news organizations were unaware the Denver Police Department had <a href="https://www.9news.com/article/news/local/denver-police-quietly-expand-surveillance-camera-network/73-80b180c4-2456-4a28-b106-feb1831ea61f">launched an RTCC </a>and expanded its camera network until Atlas of Surveillance researchers uncovered a job advertisement outlining its capabilities. The Honolulu Police Department has added a RTCC to its <a href="http://206.195.188.21/downloads/HPD_Moving_Forward.pdf">2020-2022 strategic plan</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">RTCCs tend to share common defining technological features, the most prominent being access to a <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/surveillance-cameras">surveillance camera network</a> with feeds that are broadcast live onto a wall of TV monitors within a centralized headquarters. The number of cameras can range from just a few hundred, as in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to more than 12,000, as in Atlanta, Georgia, but in all cases the number of cameras have been steadily growing.</p>

<p dir="ltr">RTCCs also go hand-in-hand with <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/gunshot-detection">gunshot detection technology</a>, especially ShotSpotter, a company that installs sensors throughout neighborhoods in order to listen for and locate suspected gunfire. The majority of RTCCs also tap into <a href="https://www.eff.org/pages/automated-license-plate-readers-alpr">automated license plate readers</a> (ALPRs) to track and get real-time alerts on the locations of vehicles. In addition, RTCC staff typically have access to a variety of criminal justice databases and monitor social media feeds.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">The starting cost of these RTCCs can range dramatically, from just a few hundred thousand dollars to as much as $11 million, as in New York City. This funding can come from a number of sources, including city budgets, voter-approved bonds, state and federal grants, private institutions, and wealthy individual donors. For example, the Atlanta Loudermilk Operation Shield Video Integration Center started with a $1-million donation from the Loudermilk family, who are real-estate developers, as well as $350,000 from the city. The price tag proved too high for the Fresno Police Department in California, which let go of its <a href="https://gvwire.com/2020/07/09/conservative-appointee-lasts-just-15-hours-on-fresno-immigrant-rights-committee/">part-time RTCC staff in 2019</a> and <a href="https://www.fresno.gov/finance/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2020/06/TRAY-MEMO-Response-to-Council-Direction-No.-41-Request-Audit-of-Video-Policing-Surveillance-Unit-6.18.20.pdf">ceased all real-time operations</a> at the RTCC in 2020 (although police can still access stored footage from previously installed cameras after crimes occur).&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Yet the cost barrier for these systems is steadily dropping. Based at the University of New Orleans, a private organization called <a href="https://www.projectnola.org/">Project NOLA</a> provides subsidized cameras and other technologies to cities and provides virtual RTCC software to municipalities through its NOLA National Real-Time Crime Center. So far, Project NOLA has partnered with police departments in Louisiana, Mississippi, New Jersey, Alabama, and Pennsylvania.&nbsp;</p>

<p dir="ltr">Source: <a href="https://cvp.newarkpublicsafety.org/">New Jersey "Citizens Virtual Patrol"</a></p>
</center>

<p dir="ltr">Funding isn't the only way that RTCCs blur the line between public and private surveillance. The Newark, New Jersey RTCC encourages citizens to view live video feeds from cameras across the city through its "<a href="https://cvp.newarkpublicsafety.org/">Citizen Virtual Patrol</a>" program. Meanwhile, police in Jackson, Mississippi began testing a new system to link doorbell cameras, including Amazon’s Ring, to their RTCC. Similar camera sharing programs are being promoted in <a href="https://www.wtxl.com/news/lcso-unveils-new-real-time-crime-center/article_af42e61c-f35a-11e8-a32d-2bd5dc910bb2.html">Leon County, Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.safecamnola.com/">New Orleans</a>.</p>

<p>The increasing computation time and cost highlight the importance of inventing computationally efficient models that retain top modeling power with reduced or accelerated computation.</p>
<p>The Transformer <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762" target="_blank" rel="noopener">architecture</a> was proposed to accelerate model training in NLP. Specifically, it is built entirely upon self-attention and avoids the use of recurrence. The rationale of this design choice, as mentioned in the original work, is to enable strong parallelization (by utilizing the full power of GPUs and TPUs). In addition, the attention mechanism is an extremely powerful component that permits efficient modeling of variable-length inputs. These advantages have made Transformer an expressive and efficient unit, and as a result, the predominant architecture for NLP.</p>
<p>A couple of interesting questions arises following the development of Transformer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is attention all we need for modeling?</li>
<li>If recurrence is not a compute bottleneck, can we find better architectures?</li>
</ul>
<h6>SRU++ and related work</h6>
<p>We present SRU++ as a possible answer to the above question. The inspiration of SRU++ comes from two lines of research:</p>
<p>First, previous works have tackled the parallelization/speed problem of RNNs and proposed various fast recurrent networks [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01576" target="_blank" rel="noopener">7</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02755" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06834" target="_blank" rel="noopener">9</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.13324" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10</a>]. Examples include <a href="https://github.com/salesforce/pytorch-qrnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quasi-RNN</a> and Simple Recurrent Unit (<a href="https://github.com/asappresearch/sru" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SRU</a>), both are highly-parallelizable RNNs. <strong>The advance eliminates the need of eschewing recurrences to trade training efficiency</strong>.</p>
<p>Second, several recent works have achieved strong results by leveraging recurrence in conjunction with self-attention. For example, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.11423" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Merity</a> (2019) demonstrated a single-headed attention LSTM (<a href="https://github.com/Smerity/sha-rnn" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHA-LSTM</a>) is sufficient to achieve competitive results on character-level language modeling task while requiring significantly less training time. In addition, RNNs have been incorporated into Transformer architectures, resulting in better results on machine translation and natural language understanding tasks [<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.02755" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.07000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">12</a>]. <strong>These results suggest that recurrence and attention are complementary at sequence modeling</strong>.</p>
<p>In light of the previous research, we enhance the modeling capacity of SRU by incorporating self-attention as part of the architecture. A simple illustration of the resulting architecture SRU++ is shown in Figure 1c.</p>

<p>SRU++ replaces the linear mapping of the input (Figure 1a) by first projecting the input into a smaller dimension. An attention operation is then applied, followed by a residual connection. The dimension is projected back to the hidden size needed by the elementwise recurrence operation of SRU. In addition, not every SRU++ layer needs attention. When the attention is disabled in SRU++, the network reduces to a SRU variant using dimension reduction to reduce the number of parameters (Figure 1b).</p>
<h6>Results</h6>
<p><strong>1. SRU++ is a highly-efficient neural architecture</strong><br>
We evaluate SRU++ on several language modeling benchmarks such as Enwik8 dataset. Compared to Transformer models such as Transformer-XL, SRU++ can achieve similar results using only a fraction of the resources. Figure 2 compares the training efficiency between the two with directly comparable training settings. SRU++ is 8.7x more efficient to surpass the dev result of Transformer-XL, and 5.1x more efficient to reach a BPC (bits-per-character) of 1.17.</p>

<h6>Conclusion</h6>
<p>We present a recurrent architecture with optional built-in self-attention that achieves leading model capacity and training efficiency. We demonstrate that highly expressive and efficient models can be derived using a combination of attention and fast recurrence. Our results reaffirm the empirical observations that attention is not all we need, and can be complemented by other sequential modeling modules.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In 1872, a fire broke out in the basement of a warehouse on Summer Street in Boston. As flames spread to nearby buildings, Boston firefighters called for backup. Neighboring towns responded, only to discover that their hoses would not fit into the hydrants. The couplings that connect the hydrants to the hoses had not been standardized. This hampered the help the firefighters could give, and thirty people died. 776 buildings burned. Fast forward to 2021. Companies and governments are trying to share information about vaccine appointments. Their systems cannot connect with each other. People cannot get shots. The death toll is ongoing. History does not repeat itself, but it does rhyme.</p>

<p>Why is government struggling to make a working vaccine registration website? Building software is challenging and requires experts to direct it. Massachusetts lacks professional development opportunities for its staff to develop the skills required to build modern software. Finally the government has yet to take leadership in establishing standards for the exchange of data within itself, never mind among a federation of private companies to which it delegated vaccine appointment responsibility.</p>

<p>Buying and building software is hard, which is why <a href="https://github.com/18F/technology-budgeting/blob/master/handbook.md#hire-tech-talent-in-house">agencies and budget offices need to hire technical talent in-house</a>. An agency in Massachusetts might have in-house lawyers to handle complex legal issues, but complex technical procurements are left to staff that have never written a line of code. Without that experience it is hard to spot issues and understand the effort required to undertake a task. Asking a software vendor whether they can do a particular thing is like asking a car salesman whether you need a new car: the answer will always be yes. We need experts who can tell us whether we <em>should</em> do a particular thing and <em>how</em> it should be done. Having technical talent at the table will make sure the right questions are being asked throughout the software procurement and oversight process.</p>

<p>Public servants succeed despite chronic underfunding of their efforts. You would be shocked at the leanness of the public sector. It makes the private sector look bloated. Responsibilities that might be an entire department at Google fall upon one or two state or municipal employees. Apple has Apple University to help its employees learn new skills. For public sector employees everything is learned on the fly and on your own. The Government of the United Kingdom has established the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/collections/gds-academy-course-descriptions">Government Digital Services Academy</a> to teach its public servants digital skills and techniques. We should do this in Massachusetts.</p>

<p>Finally the Commonwealth should establish a Data Standards Authority, modeled after the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/groups/data-standards-authority">same authority in the United Kingdom</a>. Standards are how we can have data couplings that let state agencies and municipalities talk with each other. As the Commonwealth adopts standards, the private sector will see this leadership and learn what it needs to do to share information on anything from vaccine appointments to construction plans. We can make sure when the next crises arrives, we can work together.</p>

<p>These steps would merely be a down payment on the work required to modernize state government. To make this work the state needs to successfully recruit, train, and retain product managers, designers, and developers in agencies across the Commonwealth. These individuals need to reflect the diversity of our community, and build their tools with empathy and understanding of existing people and ways. It will not happen overnight, but no place is better equipped to do this than Massachusetts.</p>

	<p>
In an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isometric_projection">isometric</a>
display, it can be tricky to draw boxes of various sizes in the correct order
to keep them appropriately in front of or behind one another.  The figure below
shows an example.  The blue box should be drawn first, then green, then red.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure1a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure1b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 1: The boxes on the left are <u>not</u> drawn in the correct order, whereas the
boxes on the right are drawn correctly.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
We will explore a simple solution for determining the correct order to draw a
given set of boxes.  But first, we must define what we mean by <em>boxes</em>.
	</p>

	<h3>What do we mean by <em>boxes</em>?</h3>

	<p>
We define boxes as <em>axis-aligned</em> and <em>non-intersecting</em>
rectangular prisms. Take a look at the above Figure 1 again.  Each box is
parallel to the <em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, and <em>z</em> axis (i.e.
axis-aligned).  Also, note that the boxes are next to each other but do not
intersect.
	</p>

	<h3>Determine if boxes overlap on screen.</h3>

	<p>
First of all, if two boxes do not overlap on the screen, then we do not have to
worry about which one is drawn first.  This is the first test we must perform,
which we explore in this section.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure2a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure2b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 2: No overlap on the left; overlap on the right.  (Note: we are talking
about overlap on screen, not intersection in space.)
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
The silhouettes of the 3D boxes become 2D hexagons in the isometric view, as seen below.  We use the
outline of these silhouettes to test for overlap.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure3a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure3b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 3: The box silhouettes in an isometric view are simple hexagons.  Note
that their sides are always parallel to the vertical and two diagonal axes.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
We take advantage of the fact that the hexagon sides are always parallel to
some axis.  This allows us to easily determine if the hexagons overlap by
checking for intersection of their regions on each axis.  We add an <em>h</em>
(horizontal) axis to help.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure4a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure4b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
The red and blue boxes do not overlap on the h axis, therefore they do not overlap.
The green and blue boxes do overlap since their region on every axis overlap.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
Now that we have outlined our concept for <em>determining if two boxes overlap
on the screen</em>, we will fill in the details necessary for implementing it.
	</p>

	<p>
The act of flattening the 3D box into a 2D hexagon involves getting rid of the
Z coordinate.  Notice that increasing a point's Z coordinate by 1 is the same
as incrementing both X and Y coordinates by 1.  Thus, we can add Z to both X
and Y and drop Z completely.  Shown below is the source code for a function
that performs this conversion.
	</p>

<code>
<span>function</span> spaceToIso(spacePos) <span>{</span>

    
    <span>var</span> isoX = spacePos.x + spacePos.z;
    <span>var</span> isoY = spacePos.y + spacePos.z;

    <span>return</span> <span>{</span>
        x: isoX,
        y: isoY,

        
        h: (isoX - isoY) * Math.cos(Math.PI/6),

        
        v: (isoX + isoY) / 2;
    <span>}</span>;
<span>}</span></code>

	<p>
And finally, after determining the bounds of each hexagon, we can determine if
they overlap by using the source code below.
	</p>

<code><span>function</span> doHexagonsOverlap(hex1, hex2) <span>{</span>
    
    <span>return</span> (

        
        !(hex1.xmin &gt;= hex2.xmax || hex2.xmin &gt;= hex1.xmax) &amp;&amp;

        
        !(hex1.ymin &gt;= hex2.ymax || hex2.ymin &gt;= hex1.ymax) &amp;&amp;

        
        !(hex1.hmin &gt;= hex2.hmax || hex2.hmin &gt;= hex1.hmax));
<span>}</span></code>

	<p>
Now that we have determined if two boxes overlap on the screen, we can begin exploring how to determine which box is in front of the other.
	</p>

	<h3>Determine which box is in front.</h3>

	<p>
Recall that our boxes do not intersect each other. we can visualize their separation
as a thin plane between them (see Figure 5 below).  After identifying this
plane, we can determine which box is in front by selecting the one on the
correct side of this plane.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure5a" width="230" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure5b" width="230" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure5c" width="230" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 5: A pair of blocks can be separated in one of three ways shown here.
The dark glass illustrates this separation.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
We can find this plane of separation by looking at each axis individually.  In
particular, we look for an axis which has non-intersecting box ranges (see
Figure 6 below).
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure6a" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<canvas id="figure6b" width="350" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 6: On the left, the blocks are separated on the y-axis.  On the right,
the blocks are separated on the x-axis. (The z-axis is omitted for simplicity.)
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
In Figure 6 above, we have chosen a coordinate system which make lesser values
of <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> to be closer to the camera.  Though not shown, the
<em>z</em> axis is positive in the up direction, so a greater value makes it
closer to the camera.
	</p>

	<p>
The following is a javascript function for determining if the first block is in
front of the second:
	</p>

	<code><span>function</span> isBoxInFront(box1, box2) <span>{</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> (box1.xmin &gt;= box2.xmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>; <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (box2.xmin &gt;= box1.xmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span>; <span>}</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> (box1.ymin &gt;= box2.ymax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>; <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (box2.ymin &gt;= box1.ymax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span>; <span>}</span>

    
    
    <span>if</span> (box1.zmin &gt;= box2.zmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>true</span>; <span>}</span>
    <span>else</span> <span>if</span> (box2.zmin &gt;= box1.zmax) <span>{</span> <span>return</span> <span>false</span>; <span>}</span>

<span>}</span></code>

	<h3>Draw boxes in the correct order.</h3>

	<p>
In general, <u>a box should not be drawn until all the ones behind it are
drawn</u>.  Thus, we begin by drawing the boxes that have nothing behind them.
Then, we can draw the boxes that are only in front of those that are already
drawn. This process continues until all boxes are drawn. (See Figure 4 below
for an example.)
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure7" width="650" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Figure 4: (1) Nothing is behind blue, so draw it first. (2) Draw green next
since blue was the only one behind it and is already drawn.  (3) Then draw red,
since both blocks that were behind it have been drawn.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
To implement this algorithm, each box must know exactly which boxes are behind
it.  We have already determined how to do this in the last section.  A search
must be implemented so that each box has a list of boxes behind it.
	</p>

	<p>
You are now armed with everything you need to know to render isometric boxes in
the correct order.
	</p>

	<h3>A conundrum</h3>

	<p>
It is possible to have a situation seen in the figure below.  The aforementioned drawing
methods dictate that we first draw the box with nothing behind it, but this example illustrates
a case where this cannot be done.
	</p>

	<figure>
		<canvas id="figure8" width="650" height="200"></canvas>
		<figcaption>
Here are three boxes intertwined in a way such that one is always behind
another.  This prevents us from drawing a first box.
		</figcaption>
		
	</figure>

	<p>
The figure above cheats by segmenting the orange box into two.
This is one method of breaking this type of cycle.
	</p>

	<p>
There are formal methods used for detecting
such cycles mentioned in the appendix.  After detection of a cycle, the blocks in that cycle
could be drawn with special clipping regions to respect front boxes or to segment a block or blocks
that will break the cycle.  These are solutions that I will be exploring and updating this article as
my experiments progress.
	</p>

	<hr>
	<h2>Appendix</h2>

	<h4>A formal description of the solution</h4>

	<p>
This is a special case of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Painter%27s_algorithm">Painter's Algorithm</a>,
which handles occlusion by drawing back-to-front.
	</p>

	<p>
For those who are interested, our method for determining if hexagons and boxes
are overlapping is a result of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane_separation_theorem">hyperplane separation theorem</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
Also, the way in which we determined the drawing order of the boxes is known in graph theory as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topological_sorting">topological sort</a>,
which is essentially a depth-first search of a directed graph.
	</p>

	<p>
You can build a directed graph of the <em>boxes</em>, with directed edges to
the boxes that are behind it.  Topologically sorting this graph will produce an
ordered list of boxes that can be drawn in that exact order.
	</p>

	<p>
Mathematicians will recognize this directed graph as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partially_ordered_set">partially ordered
set</a>.
	</p>

	<p>
Finally, to prevent the aforementioned cycle conundrum, we can use <a href="">Tarjan's
strongly connection components</a> algorithm.  After computing these cycles,
one could either split a block to prevent a cycle, or to use a clipping region
to prevent drawing over any blocks that are supposed to be in front of it.
	</p>

	<h4>Alternative Solutions</h4>

	<p>
You may be able to just use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering">Z-buffering</a>,
though drawing order is still important for transparent sprites.  Also, if all
bounding boxes are unit cubes, sorting is much simpler.
	</p>

	<h4>Full example of working code</h4>

	<p>
All the diagrams above were created using a simple isometric box renderer
written in Javascript, which applies all the techniques described in this
article.  You can study the fully annotated source code on <a href="https://github.com/shaunew/IsometricBlocks">IsometricBlocks project on
GitHub</a>.

<p>
Well, it's been a year since I started the draft, so I guess it's about time to publish this! :)
</p>
<p>
This is a map of my personal <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#dataliberation">data liberation</a> <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#infra">infrastructure</a>, with links to the scripts and tools used; and my blog posts elaborating on different parts of it.
</p>
<p>
My goal for data liberation is approximating the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html#data_mirror">'personal data mirror'</a> concept,
often <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">despite</a> crappy interoperability (or lack thereof) of different platforms.
</p>
<p>
I prepared this diagram for several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>to give more context for my blog posts about data liberation and tools around it</li>
<li>to highlight the complexity and hoops we have to jump over because of the lack of interoperability</li>
<li>it was also sort of fun :)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This time I won't write too much text and just let you explore it. <b>Tips for exploring the diagram</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>perhaps open the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra_files/myinfra.svg"><b>full size SVG</b></a> in a new tab</li>
<li>make sure to read the legend</li>
<li>links you can follow are marked with blue (and sometimes other colours)</li>
<li>there is a bubble (💬) near some nodes/edges, you can hover it to see the comment</li>
<li>some integrations are in progress: marked with <samp>WIP</samp>, construction signs (🚧🚧) and dashed edges</li>
<li>arrows roughly represent the direction of data flow</li>
<li>arrow colors roughly correspond to the data source (so it's easier to track how it flows)</li>
<li>there are some rendering issues

Some <b>notes</b> regarding the diagram:
</p>
<ul>
<li>it's plotted via graphviz, and you can find the source <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/myinfra">here</a> (although the code is quite domain specific)</li>
<li>even though there is a lot of stuff on the diagram, it's still incomplete!

<ul>
<li><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/my-data.html">here</a> there is an (also incomplete) list of data I collect/export</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/tree/master/my">HPI modules</a> are a good proxy for the data I'm using</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
note that despite some platforms dying (e.g. Jawbone/Endomondo), I can still use data produced with them!
</p>
<p>
E.g. after Endomondo was discontinued, I was able to quickly switch to open source <a href="https://github.com/jonasoreland/runnerup#readme">RunnerUp app</a>,
while <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/5b501d156266ca8e185d681fab6bc3ee156498a6/my/runnerup.py">preserving</a> complete data compatibility.
</p></li>
<li>note how many services are outright malicious with their <b>anti-API/anti-scraping/anti-interoperability</b> measures (yellow/red highlight for API nodes)</li>
<li>probably more platforms have GDPR exports, I just haven't tried yet</li>
<li><p>
indirection is crazy
</p>
<p>
Note how for some data, before I can get it on my computer, it goes as
</p>
<ul>
<li>device –&gt; phone (over bluetooth)</li>
<li>phone  –&gt; cloud (over internet)</li>
<li>cloud  –&gt; computer (over internet)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
for many phone apps <b>the only way</b> I can sync the data is <b>by rooting my phone</b> in order to access the <code>/data/data</code> directory
</p>
<p>
This is getting worse and worse with every Android version. I understand the security concerns, but this is ridiculous.
</p></li>
<li><p>
some modules/packages (marked with<sup>sb</sup> superscript) were developed by <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge">Sean Breckenridge</a>
</p>
<p>
He's forked my <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI">HPI</a> package and working on it <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI">in parallel</a>.
For now, we decided to hack on it independently, in the hope that eventually we figure out what's a good model for cooperating and maintaining the modules.
</p>
<p>
Also, he's done some cool work on <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI_API">automatic HTTP API</a> for HPI!

<div>
<p>Every now and then, <a href="https://www.cultofmac.com/658650/iphone-11-pro-max-production-cost-bill-materials-bom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">articles</a> <a href="https://technology.informa.com/582313/ihs-markit-teardown-analysis-microsofts-xbox-one-s-brings-significant-value-gains-with-minimal-commercial-pain" target="_blank" rel="noopener">get</a> <a href="https://www.roadtovr.com/oculus-rift-components-cost-around-200-new-teardown-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> stating how much higher the prices of products are than the cost of the parts that go into them. Most of these are based on woefully incorrect estimates, but they also ignore the full cost of bringing a product into market. As a consumer, it’s illuminating to dig in further. If you’re the one building and selling products though, understanding the full cost of designing, manufacturing, selling, and supporting them is a matter of life and death for your company. The generic guidance is that a product should be sold for around 3x the cost of the materials, but in actual products that could range anywhere from 0.5x (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Razor_and_blades_model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the razor and blades model</a>) to 10x (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veblen_good" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Veblen goods</a>) depending on company strategy and cost structure and the market the product is in.</p>
<p>Regardless of the pricing strategy, the best way to understand costs is to build out a detailed model and start running through different cost, price, and volume scenarios early in the development process. There are some great guides on this from <a href="https://medium.com/@BenEinstein/will-your-hardware-startup-make-money-677a8e6c665b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ben Einstein</a> and <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?page_id=2812" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Andrew Huang</a>. My general recommendation is to read as much material as you can and then distill it down into the specifics that are relevant to your product and business. In addition to providing one more reference point, I wanted to release a practical cost model in <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oVfFDxAkNXaVoPj-XpzeINiFcqkmc4ay/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Sheets and Excel</a> that you can start from.</p>
<p>Our cost calculator is broken down into manufacturing costs, financing costs, fulfillment costs, support costs, fixed costs, internal costs, and program inputs.&nbsp; This may sound like a lot of data, but each of these is only a high level placeholder to use for early modeling.&nbsp; By the time you’re ready to start selling a product, you should have a portfolio of highly customized and detailed spreadsheets with a range of scenarios modeled.&nbsp; For now, let’s step through the sections in the basic model one by one.</p>
<h3>Manufacturing Costs</h3>

<p>We’ll start with manufacturing costs, which are the most intuitive part of the cost of a product.&nbsp; This is the cost of the materials and labor required to make the product.&nbsp; You’ll need a detailed costed Bill of Materials (BOM) to feed into the calculator.&nbsp; You can reference <a href="https://www.bunniestudios.com/blog/?p=2776" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bunnie’s guide</a> or a model that <a href="https://blog.dragoninnovation.com/blog/2015/11/10/introducing-the-dragon-standard-bom" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Innovation</a> has made available.&nbsp; The BOM is made up of components, modules, royalties, consumables, packaging, and other materials, while the MVA refers to the Manufacturing Value Add of labor and manufacturer profit on the product.&nbsp; We also extend the model by considering yield and reworks.&nbsp; It would be extremely rare for a consumer electronics production line to output 100% perfect units.&nbsp; Typically a few percent (ideally decreasing over time) would have functional or cosmetic issues caught in testing and inspection, and would need to be “reworked” or repaired before they can be packed and shipped out.&nbsp; The output of this section is the amount of money paid per unit to the manufacturing partner at the Freight on Board (FOB) location, where you take ownership of the product inventory.</p>
<h3>Financing Costs</h3>

<p>Cost models often skip over financing, but this is an important part for a startup.&nbsp; It may be difficult to cover the cost of inventory entirely with cash on hand, so you may need an Inventory Line of Credit or similar type of loan to cover the time between payment being due to the supplier and receiving payment from a customer.&nbsp; This is a very basic financing model that uses simple interest and doesn’t account for differing payment terms to different suppliers, but it is a starting point you can extend on.</p>
<h3>Fulfillment Costs</h3>

<p>Now we start to get into the more obscure details of product cost, which are the costs of getting a unit from the FOB location to your customer’s doorstep.&nbsp; Note that this model only covers direct sale to the consumer and not retail sales.</p>
<p>First we’ll determine the logistics costs.&nbsp; This depends on the size and quantity of what you’re selling, but for consumer electronics, you would typically pack units together into a bigger box called a master carton and then stack together master cartons to fill a pallet.&nbsp; If you’re selling more or larger products, you may be handling container loads or if you’re selling fewer or smaller, you may do logistics at the master carton level, but we’ll stick with pallets for this model.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.onpallet.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Onpallet</a> has a convenient calculator to estimate how many units can make up a pallet load.&nbsp; We then use <a href="https://www.freightos.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frieghtos</a> to estimate the cost of getting a pallet from the FOB port to a port in the sales region by both air and sea, along with the truck or rail cost to go from the port to your fulfillment warehouse.&nbsp; Air is of course significantly more expensive and carbon intensive, but can cut 20-30 days off of the time to cross the Pacific Ocean.&nbsp; Carbon offsets from a non-profit like <a href="https://carbonfund.org/take-action/businesses/business-calculators/#gf_27" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Carbonfund</a> can help you mitigate the harm, but you should consider the air/sea split over time carefully.&nbsp; Companies often use air freight to accelerate a launch and then switch to sea as they are able to build up an inventory buffer.</p>
<p>The fulfillment partner, typically referred to as a Third Party Logistics (3PL) partner, will have additional costs you need to model around sorting and storing incoming goods as well as picking, scanning, and packing up the product to ship to the consumer.&nbsp; If you warehouse internally instead of using a 3PL, you’ll instead capture your staffing costs here.&nbsp; You will also need to capture the cost of shipping to consumers and the payment processing fees to be able to take payment from them.&nbsp; All of these will change from region to region, so your eventual model should include multiple fulfillment cost structures and a region split model.</p>
<h3>Support Costs</h3>

<p>Next, we need to consider the overall cost of supporting a product in the field.&nbsp; This includes remorse returns from consumers, warranty failures, and the staffing costs of your support team.&nbsp; Something to keep in mind is that returns and warranty failures shouldn’t be written off, but should be refurbished and brought back into the market.&nbsp; We include the average costs of refurbishing and the percent of original price for the refurbished unit in the model.</p>
<h3>Fixed Costs</h3>

<p>In addition to the range of per-unit costs, we have to consider the fixed manufacturing costs for the product.&nbsp; That includes development payments to the manufacturing and component partners, the costs of tooling and line equipment, and certifications.&nbsp; It also includes excess and obsolescence (E&amp;O), which is the amount of material that goes unused when parts change or the product goes end of life.&nbsp; Note that many of these costs are not truly fixed, since tooling will wear out and your line costs may increase if you decide to increase manufacturing capacity.</p>
<h3>Internal Costs</h3>

<p>Finally, we have to consider the internal costs of developing and selling a product.&nbsp; Each of these rows can again come from a much more detailed model, but you can start with rough estimates.</p>
<h3>Program Inputs</h3>

<p>Against all of these, we have to state our inputs of sales price and volume.&nbsp; This is usually the most interesting place to start playing with different scenarios to determine what is needed to make a program break even and eventually profitable.&nbsp; Note that if you have multiple versions or SKUs of a product, you’ll want to build a more detailed calculator with SKU splits, BOM costs per SKU, and the added fixed costs per SKU.</p>
<h3>Program Outputs</h3>

<p>As you can see from our overall outputs, quite a lot more than the bare materials goes into the cost of a product.&nbsp; With a high level calculator in place, you can better understand what levers are most important to focus on for cost reduction.</p>
<h3>What Now?</h3>
<p>With a model in hand, you can start to do scenario analysis and sensitivity analysis.&nbsp; For scenario analysis, you can start by duplicating your data into new columns and adjusting some inputs to simulate different program scenarios.&nbsp; For example, you can create a range of columns that each have differing total sales volumes, which allows amortizing the fixed costs over more units and would generally also enable cost negotiation leverage in areas like the BOM and MVA.&nbsp; You can also sanity check trades between different buckets like BOM cost and internal development costs.&nbsp; As an example, you can check the volume at which it’s worth spending a few person-months of engineering time to save a dollar on a cheaper microcontroller.</p>
<p>It’s generally worthwhile to make some best-case and worst-case scenarios on volume and other inputs to see where you most need to focus for derisking a program.&nbsp; Sensitivity analysis is basically a method to formalize this and determine which inputs are most important for improving a target output, but it is outside the scope of this already very long blog post.</p>
<p>We hope this was a helpful starting point to understand product costs, and we’re happy to respond to any questions you have on it.&nbsp; We’ll plan to update the basic model as we get feedback over time to make it as useful as possible.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<p>Milan prosecutors and the Italian Labour Inspectorate have jointly <a href="https://www.ispettorato.gov.it/it-it/notizie/Documents/Comunicato%20stampaTutele%20riders.pdf" target="_blank">ordered</a> four major food delivery platforms to fully hire over 60,000 couriers — and pay a total of €733 million in fines.</p>
<p>Couriers who worked for Uber Eats, Glovo, Just Eat and Deliveroo in Italy from 2017 to 2020 must now be treated as "coordinated and continuous workers," prosecutors declared.</p>
<p>If the companies pay the fines within 90 days, they will be able to avoid criminal proceedings — but legal experts say it's a little more complicated than that.</p>

<p>Should the platforms hire all 60,000 couriers, there's a high price to pay to catch up on previous, missed social security payments, said European labor law specialist Luca de Vecchi. Social security contributions in Italy can amount to up to 33 percent of an employee's salary and must be paid by the employer.</p>
<p>This poses a "very difficult decision" for the companies, de Vecchi added. Trying to appeal and fight the case in court risks criminal sanctions on the company managers, but accepting the fines could lead to the companies' demise. </p>
<p>"I don't know how they could manage to pay and remain alive," he said.</p>
<h3>Health and safety</h3>
<p>The sanctions are linked to alleged violations of health and safety regulations, following an investigation into driver accidents.</p>
<p>"It is no longer the time to say that riders are slaves, the time has come to say that they are citizens who need legal protection," said Milan's chief prosecutor Francesco Greco in an online press conference, according to <a href="https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/21_febbraio_24/inchiesta-rider-pm-greco-assumere-60-mila-lavoratori-non-sono-schiavi-7d823a6c-76af-11eb-843a-1237b4657d5e.shtml" data-type="URL" data-id="https://milano.corriere.it/notizie/cronaca/21_febbraio_24/inchiesta-rider-pm-greco-assumere-60-mila-lavoratori-non-sono-schiavi-7d823a6c-76af-11eb-843a-1237b4657d5e.shtml" target="_blank">Italian media</a>.</p>
<p>"This is a very heavy blow to the platform narrative, to their business model based on false autonomy and the abuse of occasional work, on the denial of any right and the infringement of laws and contracts," added the Deliverance Milano syndicate group in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/deliverancemilano/posts/2734640120180349" target="_blank">Facebook post</a>. "There is no more time to waste: hiring and rights immediately, enough with precariousness and exploitation!"</p>

<p>The Assodelivery group — which represents the likes of Uber, Deliveroo, Glovo and JustEat — said they were "surprised" by the prosecutor's decision.</p>
<p>"The platforms, despite the specific differences, have operated in recent years in compliance with current regulations, including the classification of workers and workplace safety regulations," the group said in an emailed statement. "We therefore disagree with the picture illustrated today."</p>
<h3>Next steps</h3>
<p>Attention will now turn to the platforms, and "whether they will go back to negotiate with the minister of labour and the representative trade unions to try to solve the issue," said labor law expert Valerio de Stefano.</p>
<p>A negotiated settlement might be the most likely outcome, de Vecchi said. </p>
<p>"I think that at the end of the story there will be a compromise solution that will allow these companies to stay active — probably a limited fine without any criminal prosecution," said de Vecchi. "But on the other end, they will be forced to change their operational model and to have a different standard in terms of employees' rights and guarantees."</p>
<p>The ruling comes off the back of a <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1618801">U.K. supreme court ruling</a> that declared Uber drivers to be "workers" rather than self-employed contractors, as well as a recent <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1612457">Dutch appeals court decision</a> that Deliveroo drivers are employees — signs of changing times in the gig economy. </p>

<p>"What's for sure is that it is basically more and more clear: we cannot pretend anymore that these people are just genuinely self-employed as if they were small undertakings — they are workers that should be protected as such," de Stefano said.</p>

Not “what does this do”, but “how does this do 'X'?”.</p></li><li><p>Find the highest level of interface, whether user interface (UI) or application programming interface (API), that a customer or end-user would use. View the user interaction as the top level of a feature, and drill down from there, taking it apart piece by piece, right down to the lowest level.</p></li><li><p>Get a high level overview of a codebase, and then learn by example. This means solving a specific problem and using this to help understand a codebase. This also works for onboarding, especially for a complex project, where it is usually best to give a high-level introduction and then learn details doing the first story or ticket.</p></li><li><p>I like to get an overview and then go straight to work on something small. This way, the unfamiliarity fades away. Then I either find I like the code or I don't.</p></li><li><p>Maybe <a href="https://github.com/glato/emerge">emerge</a> could help to visualise, inspect and understand structure, dependencies, and some common metrics in your codebase, if the language is supported.</p></li><li><p>Set up meetings with people on the team to understand the architecture and what parts of the software are responsible for it. Then it’s usually best starting with a small task and over time taking bigger tasks. This way I gradually get an understanding of the codebase.</p></li><li><p>I'm a consultant, so I have to do this at least once every 6-12 months. Learn <em>systems</em>, not codebases:</p><ol><li>How does the app work from the user's point of view? Ask this first.</li><li>How is the application glued together? How does data flow in the context of the architecture?</li><li>How does code go from my computer into production? Understanding the details of the code is much easier in context.</li></ol></li></ul><ul><li>When I started my 1.5 year tour at Google a long while ago, it was the first place I'd ever worked where knowing the whole codebase was clearly impossible. Accepting that was liberating. Since then I haven't concerned myself with knowing a whole codebase and I'm better for it.</li></ul><ul><li><p>Use it. Like a user. Applies to APIs and libraries too. They all have a user interface.</p></li><li><p>Browse through the live version to get an idea of what the application does. Sort of see it from the eyes of the users.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Set up the codebase locally and get it to run.</p></li><li><p>I try to make sure my environment, builds, and things like that work. I can't count the number of hours I wasted trying to do something, before realising I was missing some key part of the process. Simply going from cloning a repository to building and running the latest version locally gives you loads of good information.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Do not be afraid to ask questions.</p></li><li><p>Ask people if you can't find the answer quickly. It's better to ask than to waste time.</p></li><li><p>I ask someone who is familiar with the codebase to give me a big picture overview.</p></li><li><p>Keep asking questions to the person who wrote the code, with increasing urgency as they get closer and closer to leaving.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Pair programming is great for getting started with a codebase. We use this technique a lot at <a href="https://twitter.com/qumulo">@qumulo</a> and it is a fast way to pick up a lot of details.</p></li><li><p>Grab hold of the nearest experienced developer and make them pair program with you until they're sick of you! Seriously though, pair or mob programming is probably the best way to introduce anyone to a new codebase or team, regardless of skill levels or complexity!</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Try to find internal documentation for certain domain knowledge. Unfortunately, good onboarding documentation for new joiners or new contributers to a codebase is often not readily available.</p></li><li><p>Read the documentation, perhaps find a textbook explaining how to understand a codebase based on its tech stack, and try searching for answers on Stack Overflow.</p></li><li><p>Writing the often missing documentation is a great way to learn and a good excuse to talk people and ask questions.</p></li><li><p>Good documentation and a code editor with the ability to jump to method definitions is essential I think. That's the number one thing that helps, for me at least.</p></li><li><p>Read the docs if available.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Take notes on everything, in whatever form works for you. You WILL forget things. That's okay and expected.</p></li><li><p>Ask questions and takes notes as much as possible.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>Go <dfn>spelunking</dfn> (a term used to describe exploring a cave) in order to find bugs. Reading code or documentation in isolation does not help me to <dfn>grok</dfn> (understand) a codebase, but contributing to the codebase does.</p></li><li><p>Look at a REST endpoint then follow it to the actual data or action. Add breakpoints to debug the code bit by bit. You can add breakpoints to code within your chosen code editor or inside a browser's developer tools.</p></li><li><p>Add a small cosmetic change somewhere - extra logging, some debug output in the user interface for example. In trying to make those kinds of changes you often learn a lot.</p></li><li><p>Find a simple bug to fix: reproduce it, look in the code to find the call stack that leads to it. Timebox this! Don't worry if you get lost. If you are lost, ask someone who has knowledge of the codebase.</p></li><li><p>Run the debugger with some breakpoints. Observe what's going on.</p></li><li><p>I've been fascinated by how people use incidents as pulling back curtains on specific facets of how things are supposed to work.</p></li><li><p>Most of the tickets for new hires should be bugs. Maybe the occasional copy change – something small like changing the default order of a list to be 'creation time' rather than 'alphabetical'.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>This may sound aspirational, but get the project up and running and run tests.</p></li><li><p>I expect there to be well-documented tests and overall workflow.</p></li><li><p>Focus on parts of the system needed for a certain feature and discover things through tests and static analysis.</p></li><li><p>Look at the tests; hopefully they exist.</p></li><li><p>Start with test cases.</p></li><li><p>Hands down my preferred approach is to start writing tests for a codebase, or if it already has unit tests, find what area is under tested.</p></li><li><p>Writing user interface tests, for example using Cypress and API mocking.</p></li><li><p>Changing or adding some tests can help you understand how things work.</p></li><li><p>In practice, almost everybody has to work on codebases they don't fully <dfn>grok</dfn> (understand). I forget parts I haven't touched in a while, so that's why it pays off to invest in practices enabling people to understand a codebase quickly. These practices involve good tests, good continuous integration/delivery, and ultimately good observability in production too.</p></li></ul><ul><li>If I’m trying to work out what to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> for, looking at logs or error messages is often helpful. For example, passing random input to a service will spit out a stack trace and an error message as it fails to parse whatever you sent, and that can be pretty revealing.</li></ul><ul><li><p>Dig in to wherever there are actual changes to be made, and give yourself time to learn from there.</p></li><li><p>Splitting up a code base into smaller, self-contained pieces works especially well for Open Source. It makes one-time contributions easier by minimising the required mental overhead.</p></li><li><p>I focus on understanding the bits I need to work on. Whether it is a bug or feature I’ve been assigned to, and I skip the rest. 95% of the time, a good choice of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep">grep</a> will help me find the files I want, and I work things out from there.</p></li></ul><ul><li><p>From experience, it takes time to learn the different components of a codebase, especially ones that are large and complex. Learning comes from working on different features or components, reading documentation, and asking lots of questions.</p></li><li><p>I recently started a new job at a company with a HUGE and very complicated codebase, for an enterprise software suite. Here's what has helped me:</p><ol><li>Find a mentor who is familiar with the code, able to explain clearly, and whose communication style matches yours.</li><li>Get a 10,000 foot overview of the codebase from your mentor: what products the projects or solutions correspond to, any external dependencies on 3rd party libs or apps, a high-level dependency tree, what projects are most relevant to you at this time. Your mentor can hopefully point you in the right direction.</li><li>If you don't know where to start or what you're going to be working on, ask! When you start a new job or project, this is the time to ask questions. Ask who the best person is to talk to about each framework.</li><li>Ask about the development process for the area, project, or team you're working on. What's the workflow for issues? Who will code review your stuff? Who will test it? What things need to be checked off to call the issue done. Does this involve development testing notes, pull requests or merges, documentation, etc?</li></ol></li><li><p>As usual, I feel like my answer leaves people pretty unsatisfied. You won't get a handle on a codebase quickly. You can start to understand certain parts and let the rest unfold over time.</p><p>Whenever I talk to people about where questions like this come from, it often one of two things. "I feel like I want to learn this …</p></li></ul></div></div>

<p>In the Unabomber Manifesto, Section 212 always remained unfulfilling to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Would society EVENTUALLY develop again toward an industrial-technological form? Maybe, but there is no use in worrying about it, since we can’t predict or control events 500 or 1,000 years in the future. Those problems must be dealt with by the people who will live at that time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That issue is why the “Freedom Club” revolution isn’t appealing. Genies do not go back in boxes. Similar to the communist manifesto, while problems are correctly identified, the solution leaves something to be desired.</p>

<hr>


<p>Ran Prieur takes technology and <a href="https://www.ranprieur.com/tech.html">breaks it down</a> in a more nuanced way than I think about it. I’m going to focus on a single axis.</p>

<p>Compare Waymo to comma. In one, you need cooperation from a society, in the other you don’t. One is a complex system that depends on industry and loses it’s usefulness out of context. The other is a complex self contained system.</p>

<p>A woman in a forest can create a supercomputer. This computer is off the grid, will last for 40+ years, has petaflops of compute power, and is self repairing. It exists in harmony with nature. It is non-toxic.</p>

<p>The smartphone is a marvel. The network, a nightmare. As well as the society needed to produce it.</p>

<hr>


<p>If all our world died tomorrow, from COVID-22 or something, we would leave behind godshatter. Relics with untold power. Imagine finding all that’s left is a smartphone. Useless without a solar charger, but add one and it’s a most valuable relic. And if they downloaded wikipedia offline, the discovery of that phone will allow you to rebuild it. Can we bootstrap faster?</p>

<p>That’s godshatter of the information age. A handheld device that allowed you to breathe underwater. A phaser. A portable device that could construct houses. The doctor’s mobile emitter. A machine that pulls the water from the air. A handheld flying machine. An arc reactor. All ruined if you have to connect to WiFi.</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_Profits">Perhaps a replicator could make you god.</a></p>

<hr>


<p>Why does anyone want Waymo? We need to decentralize the world, not build brittle systems that leak power. A Waymo network can be used for evil if evil people are at the controls. The Bitcoin blockchain has no controls. Every gun fires when its owner pulls the trigger, owned by millions. We’d live in a better world if nuclear weapons weren’t possible, owned by tens.</p>

<p>Can we build technology without industry? I fantasize about living in a forest with my AI girlfriend while we probe the universe. <b>What pathetic losers are building Twitter and Facebook.</b> That’s practically industry without technology. And they have the nerve to call themselves technology companies.</p>

<p>Ask yourself this. Am I building technology to further centralize or decentralize power?</p>

<p>Power is beautiful. Using energy to create order is the highest calling of God. Energy use isn’t bad! Uniform rectangular buildings are bad. Industrial chemical factories are bad. Humans are good.</p>

<hr>


<p>I’ve been learning biology. It’s unreal how amazing the technology to build humans is. Only now are we close with our stack. Human DNA is 6 GB. That’s a DVD. In 1970, you couldn’t store 6GB. Today, I can copy it in seconds on my M1 SSD. That’s actually faster than nature.</p>

<p>Biology is non-toxic. Biology is efficient. Biology is beautiful. Biology is technology.</p>

<p>Biology is not centralized. Biology is not alien. Biology is not rectangular. Biology is not industrial.</p>

<hr>


<p>STOP BUILDING SHITTY TECHNOLOGY.</p>

<p>If it centralizes power, it’s bad. If it decentralizes power, it’s good. Build technology that is inextricable from its narrative. Build technology that will give us freedom, not enslavement.</p>

<p>One axis to consider. Does this centralize or decentralize power? The power itself is unstoppable. How we divide it is a choice.</p>

<hr>


<p>I wish I had a more concrete plan. But for the love of God, if you build technology, consider this axis. Build the wrong technology, and we will live in an eternal prison.</p>

Throughout my entire life, I have always taken great interest in science (hang with me here) and have pursued many fun engineering projects on my own time - outside of school. One of these projects I decided to turn into a startup, called Puriphico, after receiving a lot of interest from my community, school, friends, etc. about the idea. I hope to use Medium as a means of sharing my experiences throughout this journey: what I have learned and how I hope to give back by teaching others. In this article, I’ll take you through my story, explaining my biggest areas of growth that I think deter many people from commencing their own entrepreneurial (or even engineering) journey. If you have questions, feel free to leave them in the comments below, and I will answer them!</span></p><div id="viewer-ev0qd"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img ariahidden="true" data-pin-url="https://www.puriphico.com/post/at-age-15-i-founded-a-tech-startup-here-s-what-i-learned" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/681c11_a94134b591004938a78571b869a316dc~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.jpg" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/681c11_a94134b591004938a78571b869a316dc~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-200ml"><span><u>My story:</u></span></p><p id="viewer-cuh04"><span>	Towards the end of my 8th grade school year, there was an event called project week - a week in which all the students worked solely on a project outside of school. Being the unnecessary overachiever that I am, I decided I wanted to push myself that week, and I sought to build something that could carry a positive impact in my community while testing the limits of my creativity and ingenuity. When standing in the restroom line at a local coffee shop one day, I witnessed the absurdly little time people spent washing their hands after using the restroom. Watching them grip an egg sandwich before shoving it in their mouth after hardly washing their hands made me nauseous: not only was it gross, it was unsafe, to say the very least. I won’t say the idea hit me at once, but over the next few days, I found myself hung up on the issue, envisioning various prototypes of my new device. What device was I envisioning, exactly? Good question: the device, implemented in a sink faucet, would help someone properly wash their hands by, first, detecting the user’s presence using visual and auditory sensors and, second, clocking their handwashing with visual LED cues. After the user has washed their hands for 20 seconds (the sufficient amount of time recommended by the CDC to remove all harmful pathogens from the hands), the device would flash a green light three times, indicating that you are good to go! When I first explained the concept to some of my advisors, they were skeptical about the concept, but they approved my project. The following week, I gave my presentation to the school board, parents, students, and many other people. (read about the device <a href="https://www.puriphico.com/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>here</u></a>.)</span></p><div id="viewer-71lsk"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img ariahidden="true" data-pin-url="https://www.puriphico.com/post/at-age-15-i-founded-a-tech-startup-here-s-what-i-learned" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/681c11_89f5dded9f7e419cbd204dd6ad782d4d~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_1000%2Ch_1000%2Cal_c%2Cq_80/file.jpg" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/681c11_89f5dded9f7e419cbd204dd6ad782d4d~mv2.jpg/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.jpg"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-datk7"><span>	I was proud of my apparent success in completing the device so quickly, but I didn’t stop there; over the last three years, I have still been iterating the prototype, making entirely new versions, and improving on previous generations. The process has taught me many things: how to use embedded systems, how to program, how circuits work, how to make custom PCB’s with my own circuit designs, how to 3D model/print, how to build a website, and much more. If you want to learn more about my device, visit this article. </span></p><p id="viewer-ehm2e"><span>But wait: I just glossed over possibly the most difficult part of my journey - that first week, where I tasked myself with learning to program and use circuits, implement my new knowledge, and design a presentation all in one week. Like they say, the hardest part is always the start, which, understandably, is why most people never start. Luckily for me, I had committed myself to the project and could not afford to quit, so that first week, I put my head down and read, learning everything I possibly could about everything I might need to know. Since then, I have improved upon my skills, and I feel ready to share my product with the world, as well as the skills necessary to build it. </span></p><p id="viewer-cmpnt"><span><u>What do I mean when I say this?</u></span></p><p id="viewer-42itj"><span>	I have experienced firsthand many of the challenges that people try to avoid when doing something new: most people are afraid of trying something new because they are afraid of making mistakes and breaking their comfort zone. While I can’t directly help with the fear and motivate you, I can help in providing the groundwork for building your own electronic products (or products in general). This education will make your goals much more attainable and, as a result, less scary! If a 13-year-old could do it, you certainly can, and I hope to help you along your own personal journey.  </span></p><p id="viewer-36nlp"><span><u>How will I do this?</u></span></p><p id="viewer-cs1g8"><span>	I found the best way to learn is by doing. Before learning to build my device, I went and found other projects to copy so that I could practice implementing what I had read in my books; then, when I felt ready, I leaped into my own project: the assimilation of all the knowledge I had accumulated from my prior experiences. Therefore, I hope to teach you the basics of electronic products through the lens of my handwashing device. I will teach you how to build every prototype, ranging in difficulty from easiest to hardest. Throughout the process, you will learn and understand circuits, programming, PCBs, 3D modeling/printing, and much more so that when you are ready to build your own product, you can do so as if it were second nature. </span></p><p id="viewer-7ebgm"><span>	No, there is no course you have to pay for or anything like that - all the tutorials will be posted on my website (the <a href="https://www.puriphico.com/build-your-own" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Build-Your-Own</u></a> page) and my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC25QUdv5BI4KMx598UR0IWA/featured" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>YouTube</u></a> channel - I will even write blog posts summarizing the content of each tutorial, which will be published on my website as well as <a href="https://adrianlazzi.medium.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Medium</u></a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/submitted?id=AdrianLazzi" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Hacker News</u></a>. If you are interested in building your own exciting projects, subscribe to my <a href="https://www.puriphico.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>website</u></a> and YouTube channel and follow me on Medium and Instagram, where I will be posting weekly tutorials and updates. I am still in school, so some weeks the workload may be too large to post a video, but I will do my best to remain consistent!</span></p><p id="viewer-9clcg"><span>Thanks for reading to the end! While this article focused primarily on my startup’s mission of education, our other mission is to innovate devices to limit the spread of disease; if you support either of these causes, I would be very appreciative if you could take a second to ‘applaud’ this article and subscribe to my website; most importantly, though, I would ask you to share this article with someone who you know would be interested.

    <h2>Bitcoin is screwed</h2>

<p>I just realized that Bitcoin is screwed.</p>

<p>I just came across a digital currency system called Taler that solves the double spending problem by having a central authority, and makes certain provisions for levying taxes, but is also reasonably anonymous, like cash.</p>

<p>This is the best system for money I've ever seen. It's like Visa/Mastercard, but open source and with buyer anonymity. No one knows what you spend your stuff on. But everyone knows what you earned your stuff with. So it can be used within existing governments.</p>

<p>And here's the thing. The reason Bitcoin has perverse incentives for energy use, and for that reason is inherently expensive, slow and inflexible, is that it wants to do without a central authority.</p>

<p>But it's a mirage. Bitcoin can't do without a central authority. There are no power stations without a central authority. Someone has to own them, and operate them. None of that works without a central authority. It does in the little colored books of the Libertarian ideologues, who are surprised time and time again when getting rid of the government actually does not magically solve all problems. But put it to the test- nope, can't run a power station without a working legal system. Can't produce chips and have a computer supply chain without a working legal system. Everything you need to produce Bitcoins depends on the existence of technologically advanced, government-regulated civilization.</p>

<p>And if you have that- why bother doing without a central authority? Just use the darn government to solve the double spending problem. You're already doing that with Bitcoin, just in a convoluted, perversely inefficient, comically inept Rube Goldberg machine kind of way.</p>

<p>In other words- Bitcoin broke its own promise before it ever left the laboritory. It was never designed to be decentralized. It came as close as is humanely possible by all means, but quite simply by needing electricity and advanced silicon, it's doomed. In other words, Bitcoin never was what claimed to be. It's main virtue is that it's pretty good at obfuscating that.</p>

<p>For this reason, I believe that Bitcoin is going to experience a series of booms and busts, but it will never play a significant role in organizing society, building schools and bridges, banking the unbanked, and lifting people out of powverty. But Taler might.</p>

      <div>
        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>QEMU 3.0.0 can boot IBM’s AIX to a shell prompt. AIX is IBM’s version of Unix for their Power Systems line of PowerPC servers. I’ve been <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/xnuqemu2/">researching emulation</a>, so I wrote a tutorial for running AIX on your computer.</p>

<h2 id="tutorial">Tutorial</h2>

<p>Trying out AIX takes about 20 minutes. I tested these instructions on macOS 10.13.6.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Download the <a href="https://www-304.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/diags/download/home.html">AIX 7.2 Standalone Diagnostics disk</a> from IBM. You want <code>CD72220.ISO</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: (optional) If you want the Diagnostics disk to give you an AIX shell prompt instead of running diagnostics, apply <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/assets/blog/aixqemu/patch_cd72220.py">this patch</a> to your ISO file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>python patch_cd72220.py CD72220.ISO ModdedCD.ISO
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(this replaces <code>usr/lpp/diagnostics/bin/Dctrl</code> on the ISO with a shell script that launches <code>/bin/sh</code>)</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Download and install QEMU 3.0.0.</p>



<p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Launch QEMU with this command line:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu POWER9 -machine pseries -m 2G -serial mon:stdio \
	-cdrom ModdedCD.iso \
	-d guest_errors \
	-prom-env "input-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
	-prom-env "output-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
	-prom-env "boot-command=dev / 0 0 s\" ibm,aix-diagnostics\" property boot cdrom:\ppc\chrp\bootfile.exe -s verbose"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Wait. (It’ll get stuck on <code>define_rspc</code> for a long time.)</p>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong>: After <strong>nine</strong> very, very long minutes, you’ll be greeted with this notice:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
 ******* Please define the System Console. *******

Type a 1 and press Enter to use this terminal as the
  system console.
Pour definir ce terminal comme console systeme, appuyez
  sur 1 puis sur Entree.
Taste 1 und anschliessend die Eingabetaste druecken, um
  diese Datenstation als Systemkonsole zu verwenden.
Premere il tasto 1 ed Invio per usare questo terminal
  come console.
Escriba 1 y pulse Intro para utilizar esta terminal como
  consola del sistema.
Escriviu 1 1 i premeu Intro per utilitzar aquest
  terminal com a consola del sistema.
Digite um 1 e pressione Enter para utilizar este terminal
  como console do sistema.

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Type 1 in your terminal, then press enter.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7</strong>: After another two minutes, you’ll be dropped to an AIX shell prompt (or, if you didn’t patch the ISO, the IBM Diagnostics tool):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>exec(/usr/lpp/diagnostics/bin/Dctrl,/usr/lpp/diagnostics/bin/Dctrl){983324,917792}
exec(/bin/sh){1638718,983324}
#
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, you can try some Unix commands. The Diagnostics CD doesn’t have many tools, but you can try <code>uname -a</code>, <code>mount</code>, or <code>lscfg</code>.</p>

<p>(If you’re using the Diagnostics tool, you’ll be stuck on the step where it asks you to choose a terminal. Anyone knows how to get past this step?)</p>

<p><strong>Step 8</strong>: once you’re done, close the QEMU window.</p>

<p>Alternatively, press Ctrl-A, then C to drop into the QEMU monitor, then type <code>q</code> to quit.</p>

<p>The full boot log <a href="https://worthdoingbadly.com/assets/blog/aixqemu/aixboot.txt">can be found here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="edit-sep-7-2018">Edit (Sep 7, 2018)</h2>

<p>Since writing this article, I’ve also found <a href="https://twitter.com/bluestonechina/status/1001269160872046592">Liang Guo’s tutorial</a> on setting up AIX, so if you have an AIX setup disc instead of the Live CD, you can install a proper AIX virtual machine.</p>

<p>Also, <a href="https://www.nutanix.com/ibm/">Nutanix</a>’s AIX VMs <a href="https://twitter.com/robmcnelly/status/991698624357847040">are hosted with QEMU</a>. That’s cool! I didn’t know there’s a production deployment of AIX on QEMU.</p>

IBM’s AIX is one of the few still being updated today.</p>

<p>Importantly for me, QEMU 3.0.0 can emulate AIX without any modifications or workarounds, allowing me to try an Enterprise operating system without access to expensive hardware.</p>

<p>In fact, AIX even detects if it’s being run in QEMU:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ strings - bootfile.exe |grep qemu
patch_qemu
qemu,pseries
qemu,pseries
                        ---&gt; qemu,pseries detected &lt;---
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>suggesting that IBM themselves have experimented with QEMU and AIX.</p>

<p>From the few minutes I spent playing with AIX, I find it fascinating that AIX is close enough to macOS (BSD) and Linux (GNU), yet subtlely different. In some places, the old Unix preference for terseness is visible:</p>

<p>AIX:</p>
<div><div><pre><code># halt --help
halt: illegal option -- -
usage: halt [-y][-q][-l][-n][-p]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>vs Linux:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ halt --help
halt [OPTIONS...]
Halt the system.
     --help      Show this help
     --halt      Halt the machine
  -p --poweroff  Switch off the machine
     --reboot    Reboot the machine
  -f --force     Force immediate halt/power-off/reboot
  -w --wtmp-only Don't halt/power-off/reboot, just write wtmp record
  -d --no-wtmp   Don't write wtmp record
     --no-wall   Don't send wall message before halt/power-off/reboot
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>yet other parts gained richer interfaces as befit an Enterprise operating system:</p>

<p>AIX:</p>

<div><div><pre><code># mount
  node       mounted        mounted over    vfs       date        options      
-------- ---------------  ---------------  ------ ------------ --------------- 
         /dev/ram0        /                jfs    Jan 01 00:00 rw              
         /dev/ramdisk0    /mnt             jfs    Sep 06 03:12 rw,nointegrity  
         /mnt             /tmp             namefs Sep 06 03:12 rw    
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>macOS:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ mount
/dev/disk1s1 on / (apfs, local, journaled)
devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse)
/dev/disk1s4 on /private/var/vm (apfs, local, noexec, journaled, noatime, nobrowse)
map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse)
map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It keeps me just off balance enough to be interesting.</p>

<h2 id="lets-just-try-it">Let’s just try it</h2>

<p>I chose to try AIX in QEMU mostly because, unlike IBM’s other Enterprise operating systems (IBM i and z/OS), IBM provides a free Diagnostics disc for Power Systems - which contains a live version of AIX.</p>

<p>Others have tried running AIX without a physical IBM Power Server. <a href="https://tyom.blogspot.com/">One person</a> got AIX 4.2 and 5.1 to boot on QEMU. However, modern AIX (7.1) seemed  impossible to run in QEMU, according to mailing list posts from 2012, like <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2012-02/msg00048.html">this thread</a>, <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2012-06/msg00120.html">this thread</a>, or <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2012-09/msg00160.html">this thread</a>.</p>

<p>Well, that was six years ago, right? Let’s see what happens if I boot the disc today.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu POWER9 -machine pseries -m 2G -serial mon:stdio -cdrom CD72220.iso
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code>Trying to load:  from: disk ... 
E3405: No such device
Trying to load:  from: /vdevice/v-scsi@71000003/disk@8200000000000000 ...   Successfully loaded

AIX 
    Star
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And it’s stuck there. Did the boot process hang? Or is it just slow?</p>

<p>OK, I need to get more debugging output. To do so, I need to set boot parameters.</p>

<h2 id="setting-open-firmware-variables">Setting Open Firmware variables</h2>

<p><a href="https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/qemu-ppc/2012-02/msg00048.html">According to the QEMU mailing list</a>, I need to use this command to boot AIX with verbose messages:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>boot cdrom:\ppc\chrp\bootfile.exe -s verbose
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://people.redhat.com/~thuth/blog/slof/2017/01/16/prom-env.html">This guide</a> showed how to change the default boot command, by passing environment variables to SLOF, QEMU’s bootloader:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-prom-env "boot-command=boot cdrom:\ppc\chrp\bootfile.exe -s verbose" \
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The same article also mentions other SLOF environment variables; two important ones are <code>input-device</code> and <code>output-device</code>, which sets the default input and output devices of the firmware. By default, this is the emulated graphical screen and keyboard. Following the commit message on <a href="https://patchwork.ozlabs.org/patch/818725/">this patch</a>, I switched it to the virtual serial port to make interacting with the system easier:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-prom-env "input-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
-prom-env "output-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I also added the QEMU logging option <code>-d unimp,guest_errors</code> to show me when AIX invokes some unimplemented behaviour in QEMU.</p>

<p>The new command line is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>qemu-system-ppc64 -cpu POWER9 -machine pseries -m 2G -serial mon:stdio \
  -cdrom CD72220.iso \
  -d unimp,guest_errors \
  -prom-env "input-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
  -prom-env "output-device=/vdevice/vty@71000000" \
  -prom-env "boot-command=boot cdrom:\ppc\chrp\bootfile.exe -s verbose" \
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="why-did-it-eject-the-cd">Why did it eject the CD?</h2>

<p>Verbose boot and the <code>-d unimp</code> option definitely helped: with Verbose boot, I can see that <code>/sbin/init</code> starts executing, indicating that the kernel actually booted fine.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>StarLED{814}

AIX Version 7.2
exec(/etc/init){1,0}

INIT: EXECUTING /sbin/rc.boot 1
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In addition, this message popped up once every second - which reassures me that AIX hasn’t frozen yet.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Unimplemented SPAPR hcall 0x00000000000002b8
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So I waited out the several minute boot process, only to be greeted with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>exec(/usr/sbin/bootinfo,-M){983360,917792}
exec(/usr/lib/boot/bin/bootinfo_chrp,-M){983360,917792}
exec(/etc/eject,/dev/cd0){983362,917792}
exec(/usr/lib/methods/showled,0xA71){983364,917792} 
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Why did it eject the CD? A search for LED code “0xA71” gave no answers. The <code>-M</code> option for bootinfo is undocumented, so I don’t know what value would continue the boot process.</p>

<p>I needed to examine the CD’s boot script to find which value <code>bootinfo_chrp -M</code> needs to return.</p>

<p>To get the init script, I first tried extracting the ram filesystem from the bootfile.exe. Unfortunately, the first bytes of the extracted filesystem were “<code>01 02 03 04</code>”, which didn’t match any file systems I could find. In addition, there are no visible strings in the filesystem, suggesting that it’s compressed.</p>

<p>I resorted to plan B: dumping the entire RAM of the virtual machine to a giant 2GB file using QEMU’s Monitor:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>(qemu) pmemsave 0 0x80000000 look2g.bin
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and running <code>strings</code> on this document gave me:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>##########################################################################
# Check to see if the system has diagnostics support 
# if not eject cd
bootinfo -M &gt;/dev/null
if [ "$?" -ne 101 -a "$?" -ne 103 ] ; then
eject_cd
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So <code>bootinfo_chrp -M</code> must return 101 or 103.</p>

<h2 id="the-device-tree">The device tree</h2>

<p>Thankfully, the CD includes a copy of <code>bootinfo_chrp</code> in <code>usr/lib/boot/bin</code>, and it included symbols; thus, it was simple to reverse engineer the logic.</p>

<p>The program checks for options with <code>getopt</code>, and handles <code>-M</code> using a method named <code>is_eserver</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>is_eserver</code> method can return 4 values, depending on the device tree’s root node:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If the <code>ibm,model-class</code> property on the root node is “C5”, “D5”, or “E5”;
    <ul>
      <li>if the root node has the <code>ibm,aix-diagnostics</code> node, return 101.</li>
      <li>otherwise return 100.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Otherwise:
    <ul>
      <li>if the root node has the <code>ibm,aix-diagnostics</code> node, …</li></ul></li></ul></div></article></div></div></div>

The patient’s immune system is already sensitized to the foreign organ, and it’s harder to find a match.</p><p>Rothstein and his colleagues at the <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.stiresearch.health.pitt.edu/">Thomas E. Starzl Transplantation Institute</a> at Pitt analyzed blood samples taken from 244 patients who received kidney transplants at <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.upmc.com/">UPMC</a> between 2013-2015, as well as another 95 kidney transplant patients who were treated at <a href="https://href.li/?https://www.royalfree.nhs.uk/the-royal-free-hospital/">Royal Free Hospital, London</a>, and found a highly predictive biomarker.</p><p>Of the patients who were identified as high-risk for rejection based on this new biomarker, 91% rejected the organ within the first year, compared to 10% in the low-risk group. And the high-risk group was significantly more likely to lose their transplanted kidneys five years after the surgery. The biomarker Rothstein and colleagues discovered is a proxy for functioning of regulatory B cells—a type of immune cell that tunes up or down the immune response—which have recently been implicated in organ rejection and proved challenging to measure. B cells can secrete both IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and, according to this new study, it’s the ratio of these two molecules that best measures regulatory B cell activity and predicts whether a patient is at high risk of rejection. </p><p>“Being a functional biomarker, ours gives us an idea of what goes wrong in these high-risk patients,” Rothstein said. “The balance between IL-10 and TNF seems to indicate your immune setpoint—is your immune system going to be quiescent or is it going to be revved up and try to reject the transplant? We hope we can restore that balance with anti-TNF drugs.”</p><p>Anti-TNF drugs haven’t been used much for transplant patients, but they’re a mainstay for treating rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease and other conditions marked by inflammation, so the side effect profile is well-known. </p><p>To mitigate that risk, the idea is to treat patients with anti-TNF drugs for just a few months, which might be enough to “reset” the immune system to prevent rejection before it starts.</p><p>A human clinical trial is needed, but to show proof of principle, Rothstein and colleagues applied anti-TNF to B cells taken from high-risk patients and saw not only changes in the biomarker, but also a host of other changes indicative of restored regulatory B cell activity.

<p>Is your VirtualBox virtual machine starting to run out of disk space? No worries, because VirtualBox allows you to easily increase the disk size of your virtual machine. Just keep in mind that afterwards you still need to increase the size of your partitions accordingly. This article will help you along the way. It provides you with step-by-step instructions on how to increase the disk size of your VirtualBox virtual machine.<span data-ez-name="pragmaticlinux_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>Virtual machines provide a great playground for learning about and testing out all sorts of Linux related things. Both for desktop and server purposes. But what do you do when your virtual machine runs out of disk space? On real hardware you would swap the hard disk for a larger version. But how do you achieve this task for your VirtualBox virtual machine?</p>
<p>Luckily, VirtualBox allows you to easily increase the size of your virtual disk. However, that’s not the end of the story. Your disk partitions still have the same size as before. So to complete the disk size increase of your VirtualBox virtual machine, you still need to change the size of the disk partition(s). This latter step is a bit trickier. Fear not, because this article provides you with step-by-step instructions on how to increase the disk size of your VirtualBox virtual machine.</p>
<p>If you don’t yet have a virtual machine, you can follow <a href="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/2020/05/debian-10-buster-server-installation-in-virtualbox/">this tutorial</a> to create a minimal Debian server virtual machine in VirtualBox. This article takes the same Debian server virtual machine as a starting point.</p>
<h2>Virtual machine backup</h2>
<p>Increasing the disk size of your VirtualBox virtual machine, including the partition resizing, is an invasive operation. For this reason we’d better make a backup copy of the virtual machine. A virtual machine consists of plain files on you PC. Therefore simply copying these files already creates a backup of the entire virtual machine.</p>
<p>My Debian server virtual machine resides at this location in my user’s home directory:</p>
<p><code>/home/pragmalin/VirtualBox VMs/Debian Server/</code></p>
<p>The following two commands backup this virtual machine to a directory called <code>Debian Server Backup</code>:</p>
<p><code>cd ~/"VirtualBox VMs"</code></p>
<p><code>cp -avr "Debian Server" "Debian Server Backup"</code></p>
<p>These directory names contains spaces and therefore I surrounded them with double quotes.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="630" height="175" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/backup_virtual_machine.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows the command for creating a backup of a VirtualBox virtual machine." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/backup_virtual_machine.png 630w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/backup_virtual_machine-300x83.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"></figure>
<p>If something goes wrong while performing the steps outlined in this article, you can simply delete the <code>Debian Server</code> directory and restore the backup. For restoring the backup, you can use a similar <code>cp</code> command as above. You just have to swap the <code>Debian Server</code> and <code>Debian Server Backup</code> command parameters around.<span data-ez-name="pragmaticlinux_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span></p>
<h2>Increase the size of your VDI virtual disk in VirtualBox</h2>
<p>Upon creation of a virtual machine, VirtualBox creates a VDI file. VDI stand for virtual disk image. Think of this VDI file as the hard disk of your virtual machine. To locate the name of your virtual machine’s VDI file, select your virtual machine on VirtualBox’s main screen. You can then see the name of the VDI file in the “Storage” section. In my case it is <code>Debian Server.vdi</code> and its current size equals 20 GB:</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="886" height="521" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/find_vdi_name.png" alt="Screenshot of the VirtualBox main window with a virtual machine selected. It show you how to find the virtual disk image (VDI) name of the virtual machine." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/find_vdi_name.png 886w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/find_vdi_name-300x176.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/find_vdi_name-768x452.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px"></figure>
<p>For increasing the size of your VDI disk, go to the VirtualBox main screen. Next, click on the icon located at the right side of the <em>Tools</em> entry. Select <em>Media</em> from the pop-up menu to open the media view. The media view lists all the hard disks attached to your virtual machines.</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="886" height="521" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/increase_vdi_disksize.png" alt="Screenshot of VirtualBox which lists the media, including hard disks of all virtual machine. It explain how you can increase the VDI disk size of the virtual machine." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/increase_vdi_disksize.png 886w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/increase_vdi_disksize-300x176.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/increase_vdi_disksize-768x452.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 886px) 100vw, 886px"></figure>
<p>On the VirtualBox media view, select the VDI disk that you want to increase in size. In my case it is <code>Debian Server.vdi</code> which currently has a size of 20 GB. Once selected, you simply move the slider at the bottom of the screen to increase the disk size. In this example, I want to increase the disk size from 20 GB to 25 GB. Once you selected the new disk size, confirm it by clicking the <em>Apply</em> button. Keep in mind though that you can only increase the disk size and not decrease it.</p>
<p>Let’s verify that the disk size of your VirtualBox virtual machine actually got increased. Go ahead and start your virtual machine. Once ready, open the terminal if it has a desktop environment or log in via SSH if it is a server. List the information about the attached disks with command:</p>
<p><code>lsblk -p | grep "disk"</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="373" height="55" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify_disk_size.png" alt="Terminal screenshot that shows the output of the lsblk command to list the disks known to the virtual machine. It is used to verify that the disk size increase was successful." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify_disk_size.png 373w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify_disk_size-300x44.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 373px) 100vw, 373px"></figure>
<p>As expected, the command output reports 25 GB for the disk size. This proves that we successfully increased the disk size of our VirtualBox virtual machine. All done, right? I’m afraid not. Run the following command to list the partitions:</p>
<p><code>lsblk -p | grep "part"</code></p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="371" height="88" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify_partition_size_too_small.png" alt="Terminal screenshot of the lsblk command which this time lists the size of the partitions. Here it becomes clear that the VirtualBox virtual machine disk size was increase, but that the partitions still have the same size as before, so not taking advantage of the disk size increase." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify_partition_size_too_small.png 371w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/verify_partition_size_too_small-300x71.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 371px) 100vw, 371px"></figure>
<p>After adding up the size of the individual partitions, we get to about 20 GB and not the desired 25 GB. So the virtual hard disk of our virtual machine was increased, but we still need to increase the partitions. The next section describes how to achieve this.</p>
<h2>Increase the size of your root file system partition</h2>
<p>The previous terminal screenshot tells us that the virtual machine has a primary partition <code>sda1</code> that holds the root file system. Furthermore, the virtual machine has an extended partition <code>sda2</code> that holds the swap partition <code>sda5</code>. For our virtual machine to reap the benefits of the larger disk size, we want to increase the partition with the root file system (<code>sda1</code>) from 18 GB to 23 GB. Unfortunately, you cannot change the partitions while the system is live. To solve this conundrum, we will boot our virtual machine from a GParted Live ISO.</p>
<h3>Download the GParted Live ISO</h3>
<p>The GParted Live ISO contains a CD image with a live Linux system, which includes the GParted program. With the GParted program you can change your disk partitioning and format disks. Note that making a mistake in GParted tends to be permanent. To the point where you might loose data on your virtual machine. That’s the reason why I recommended making a backup copy of the virtual machine first earlier in this article. If you decided to skip the step where you back up your virtual machine, now would be a good time to reconsider this decision.</p>
<p>Before we can boot our virtual machine from the GParted Live ISO, we should first download it. <a href="https://gparted.org/download.php">Visit the download section</a> of the GParted website. Once there, download the latest 64-bit stable release. At the time of this writing the latest stable release is 1.1.0-5:</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="935" height="644" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download_gparted.png" alt="Web browser screenshot that shows you where to find the download link for the GParted Live ISO." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download_gparted.png 935w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download_gparted-300x207.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/download_gparted-768x529.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 935px) 100vw, 935px"></figure>
<p>After the download the file resides at the following location on my PC:</p>
<p><code>/home/pragmalin/Downloads/gparted-live-1.1.0-5-amd64.iso</code></p>
<h3>Attach the GParted Live ISO to the virtual machine</h3>
<p>With the GParted Live ISO downloaded, we connect it to the CD-ROM drive of our virtual machine. Make sure your virtual machine is powered off at this point. On the VirtualBox main screen, select your virtual machine and click the <em>Settings</em> button on the toolbar. When the <em>Settings</em> dialog appeared, go to the <em>Storage</em> section and select the <em>Empty</em> IDE controller. Once selected, click the blue disk icon button on the right side of the dialog. From the menu that dropped down, select the <em>Choose a disk file…</em> option. Now select the GParted Live ISO file you downloaded in the previous step. Complete the configuration by clicking the <em>OK</em> button on the <em>Settings</em> dialog. The <em>Empty</em> IDE controller should now have changed to the name of the GParted Live ISO file:</p>

Specifically the section with the storage. It illustrates how to attach the GParted Live ISO to the virtual optical drive." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/attach_gparted_live_iso.png 891w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/attach_gparted_live_iso-300x229.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/attach_gparted_live_iso-768x586.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 891px) 100vw, 891px"></figure>
<h3>Boot the virtual machine from the GParted Live ISO</h3>
<p>With the GParted Live ISO connected to the virtual machine’s optical drive, the virtual machine will boot from this Live CD image instead of its virtual disk. So go ahead and startup your virtual machine. A few prompts appear during the boot process. Just hit <kbd>Enter</kbd> every time to accept the defaults. Eventually, you’ll end with a basic desktop environment with the GParted program running:</p>
<figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="680" src="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gparted_first_boot.png" alt="Screenshot of what the virtual machine looks like after it booted from the GParted Live ISO. It basically shows the automatically opened GParted program." srcset="https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gparted_first_boot.png 800w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gparted_first_boot-300x255.png 300w, https://www.pragmaticlinux.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/gparted_first_boot-768x653.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px"></figure>
<h3>Resize the partitions</h3>
<p>In GParted you can see a 5 GB chunk that is unallocated. This is expected because it represents the size with which we increased the disk in our VirtualBox virtual machine. The goal is to give this 5 GB unallocated disk chunk to <code>/dev/sda1</code>. So once we are all set and done, <code>/dev/sda1</code> should have a size of 23 GB instead of 18 GB. It would be nice if we could just drag and drop this unallocated disk space onto <code>/dev/sda1</code>.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you cannot just move a piece of the disk space like that. What we have to do instead is move the extended partition, including the swap partition, all the way to the right. This opens up 5 GB between <code>/dev/sda1</code> and <code>/dev/sda2</code>. Once it is directly on the right side of <code>/dev/sda1</code> we can increase the size of the <code>/dev/sda1</code> to include this 5 GB. Now that we know the general idea, let’s get work.</p>
<h4>Step 1 – Add the unallocated space to the extended partition</h4>
<p>Select the <code>/dev/sda2</code> extended partition in GParted and select <em>Partition</em> → <em>Resize/Move</em> from the program menu. On the dialog that appeared, select <em>None</em> from the <em>Align to</em> drop down menu. Next, resize the partition by entering a value of 0 in the <em>Free space following</em> edit box. Alternatively, you can drag the right arrow all the way to the right, in the visual representation of the partition size. Click the <em>Resize/Move</em> button to confirm the change.</p>

<h4>Step 2 – Move the swap partition to the right of the extended partition</h4>
<p>The unallocated disk space is now a part of the <code>/dev/sda2</code> extended partition. As a next step we move the <code>/dev/sda5</code> swap partition, which is inside the extended partition, all the way to the right. Select the <code>/dev/sda5</code> swap partition in GParted and select <em>Partition</em> → <em>Resize/Move</em> from the program menu. On the dialog that appeared, select <em>None</em> from the <em>Align to</em> drop down menu. Next, drag the swap partition all the way to the right, in the visual representation of the partition size. Alternatively, you can change the numbers directly in the edit boxes. Basically the values in <em>Free space preceding</em> and <em>Free space following</em> need to be swapped. Click the <em>Resize/Move</em> button to confirm the change. Note that you might get a warning that moving a partition might cause the operating system to fail to boot. You can ignore this warning, so just click <em>OK</em> on the warning dialog.</p>

<h4>Step 3 – Shrink the extended partition back to its original size</h4>
<p>The unallocated space still resides in the <code>/dev/sda2</code> extended partition. To remove it from the extended partition, we simply shrink …</p></div></div>

February 25, 2021 | https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/quitting-twitter/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/quitting-twitter/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-body">
                    <p>I’ve only used Twitter for a few months and I did like a lot of it. The best part by far was following and listening to some incredible people. <a href="https://twitter.com/patio11">Patrick McKenzie</a> is one among many, but if you look at what he says on a daily basis, you’ll know what I mean. I can be endlessly entertained and learn a lot from what folks like him say.</p>
<p>There’s also the feeling of being the first one to know things. I often came across news or memes well before everyone else who wasn’t on twitter. Jan 6th, 2021 was a good example. I spent the whole day refreshing twitter, horrified by what I saw. It didn’t make a difference whether I learned of what was happening in 5 minutes or 2 hours or 2 days, but on that day I <em>needed</em> to know in real time.</p>
<p>As for tweeting myself, I did it a fair bit. Before twitter, I’d have this habit of wanting to share whatever interesting tidbit I found with at least one person. Something funny? To the college/school group chat it goes. Something to do with software? To my former flatmates. Cute animal? To my wife. Whatever I see, I know at least one friend who’d like it. I felt happy showing it to at least one other person. But I also felt a bit guilty sending them to people on 1:1 threads. Was I being too spammy? Were my ‘jokes’ not that funny? That’s where Twitter helped. I could broadcast without worrying that I was bothering people.</p>
<p>I also liked sending encouragement and appreciation to small time authors and content creators. These folks have it tough, and a kind word can always help. Twitter reduces the friction to doing this to the point where there’s no reason you shouldn’t.</p>
<p>It’s a pretty good website, as tens of millions of people around the world can attest. I would mostly agree with them. But it wasn’t for me.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="problem-1---lack-of-reach">Problem 1 - Lack of reach</h2>
<p>It feels stupid to complain about something as trivial as a lack of followers. There are ways to get around this, chiefly by putting out interesting content. I never used hashtags much, but that’s supposedly a great way too. But I never saw much engagement with what I was saying, which meant using the website felt a bit solitary. What was the point of saying things if I was the only one reading it?</p>
<p>It’s possible that I’m a boring knob, and that’s why no one reacted to my stuff. But that’s not been my experience elsewhere. When I use reddit or Hacker News, I find that it’s trivial to get thousands of karma and a handful of awards. Pseudo-anonymity helps too - instead of a weird Indian name I use a nickname that doesn’t mean anything. It’s possible to get positive engagement and replies from people regardless of who you are. You don’t need a reputation or a following, if you said something worth reading, people will read it and appreciate.</p>
<p>I’ll be honest - I felt jealous that people could just say “hey followers, here’s a question I could have googled. Could you google it for me?” and get a response. Or “I’m looking for a job. Any leads?” I didn’t have that. Nor did I have a way of reaching that easily.</p>
<p>I think Tiktok gets it right here. No matter who the creator is, if the content is good enough it will get hundreds of thousands of views. That system feels fairer to than Twitter.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="problem-2---pervasive-anger">Problem 2 - Pervasive anger</h2>
<p>I followed a lot of interesting people, but these folks were also upset with many things, mainly the state of the world. Watching people snipe at each other constantly, taking their anger out on anything in sight … was understandable. You can’t tell them to react differently or to chill out, because these are reasonable responses to what they’re seeing. I can’t even disagree.</p>
<p>But seeing people angry most of the time takes it’s toll too. I think it affected my mental health. Yes, I’m deeply upset with some of the things that are happening, but if I’m thinking about them 24x7 I’m not thinking about urgent things in my life that need my attention.</p>
<p>I won’t miss people dunking on each other while also not mentioning the dunkee, piquing my curiosity to the point where I investigate who the dunkee was and why. A waste of time.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="problem-3---twitter-warps-people">Problem 3 - Twitter warps people</h2>
<p>Some guy with 14k followers said something. It was something like “only Indian people are rude/assholes in this particular way. Here are some anecdotes proving this”. This is a generalisation about a race of people based on anecdotes, so by definition racist. But since the person was Indian, it’s not. Don’t look at me, I don’t make the rules.</p>
<p>Dunking on other Indian people is a common pastime for Indian people - it makes us feel superior to our compatriots. Of course we wouldn’t do the thing that we’re talking about, we’re better than that. He wasn’t doing anything I haven’t heard a hundred others do.</p>
<p>I commented that there could be sampling bias here. Since we’re more likely to be annoyed/embarassed by the actions of Indian people, we’re more likely to notice and remember it. I relayed an anecdote of my Indian friend being very annoyed by something an Indian did but not even remembering that a white person had done the exact same thing the previous day (making us wait while taking a photo). I thought it was ok to say this. I asked “You ever think this is sampling bias? You notice and get annoyed when Indians do it and embarrass you but don’t if it’s someone else?”</p>
<p>Apparently not. He went on a massive tirade. Not content with responding rudely, he quote tweets me so he can dunk in front of all his followers. Apparently, I’m jingoistic deflector, part of the “elite” that refuses to “accept and introspect” and that I “deny deny deny” legitimate issues with India. If you’ve read my other posts, you know this isn’t true. I’m the first one to point out where my country (and me personally) can do better. (<a href="https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/understanding-my-privilege/">Understanding my Privilege</a>, <a href="https://blog.nindalf.com/posts/discriminating-against-left-handers/">Discriminating against left handers</a>)</p>
<p>Anyway, he has 14k followers. I have 100. I wasn’t winning this one, regardless. I decided to stop responding, even though he went on and on.</p>
<p>The thing is, he’s actually a pretty good dude. I know, because I’ve followed him for months. But at some point he’s been exposed to so much trolling that he assumes that everyone who disagrees is a troll. It’s “#factcheckbait” according to him. He thought I was a troll and responded appropriately.</p>
<p>How does a reasonable, good person end up warped like this, where they assume that every person out there is a bad faith actor? Where there’s absolutely no scope for disagreement? My theory is that Twitter warps people in this way, by simply removing any scope for reasoned discussion. When you only meet trolls, and never have any friendly discussion with different viewpoints, you assume that a person disagreeing with you is a troll.</p>
<hr>
<p>I could stick around, play the game, build up by follower count to the point where I solve problem 1, prune my followee list to solve problem 2. But by then I’ve probably spent so much time there that I’ve become warped, probably without realising it - problem 3. Once I figured this out, I deactivated my account.</p>
<p>This probably isn’t permanent. The upsides of twitter still exist. I still want to read what people like Patrick McKenzie, Zach Weinersmith, John Carmack and others have to say. I still want to send encouraging messages to small time creators. But for now, I’m done.</p>

February 25, 2021 | https://systemd.io/BOOT_LOADER_SPECIFICATION/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://systemd.io/BOOT_LOADER_SPECIFICATION/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

<p><em>TL;DR: Currently there’s no common boot scheme across architectures and
platforms for open-source operating systems. There’s also little cooperation
between multiple distributions in dual-boot (or triple, … multi-boot)
setups. We’d like to improve this situation by getting everybody to commit to a
single boot configuration format that is based on drop-in files, and thus is
robust, simple, works without rewriting configuration files and is free of
namespace clashes.</em></p>

<p>The Boot Loader Specification defines a scheme how different operating systems
can cooperatively manage a boot loader configuration directory, that accepts
drop-in files for boot menu items that are defined in a format that is shared
between various boot loader implementations, operating systems, and userspace
programs. The same scheme can be used to prepare OS media for cases where the
firmware includes a boot loader. The target audience for this specification is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Boot loader developers, to write a boot loader that directly reads its configuration at runtime from these drop-in snippets</li>
  <li>Firmware developers, to add generic boot loading support directly to the firmware itself</li>
  <li>Distribution and Core OS developers, in order to create these snippets at OS/kernel package installation time</li>
  <li>UI developers, for implementing a user interface that discovers the available boot options</li>
  <li>OS Installer developers, to prepare their installation media and for setting up the initial drop-in directory</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="why-is-there-a-need-for-this-specification">Why is there a need for this specification?</h2>

<p>Of course, without this specification things already work mostly fine. But here’s why we think this specification is needed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>To make the boot more robust, as no explicit rewriting of configuration files is required any more</li>
  <li>To allow an out of the box boot experience on any platform without the need of traditional firmware mechanisms (e.g. BIOS calls, UEFI Boot Services)</li>
  <li>To improve dual-boot scenarios. Currently, multiple Linux installations tend to fight over which boot loader becomes the primary one in possession of the MBR, and only that one installation can then update the boot loader configuration of it freely. Other Linux installs have to be manually configured to never touch the MBR and instead install a chain-loaded boot loader in their own partition headers. In this new scheme as all installations share a loader directory no manual configuration has to take place, and all participants implicitly cooperate due to removal of name collisions and can install/remove their own boot menu entries at free will, without interfering with the entries of other installed operating systems.</li>
  <li>Drop-in directories are otherwise now pretty ubiquitous on Linux as an easy way to extend configuration without having to edit, regenerate or manipulate configuration files. For the sake of uniformity, we should do the same for extending the boot menu.</li>
  <li>Userspace code can sanely parse boot loader configuration which is essential with modern BIOSes which do not necessarily initialize USB keyboards anymore during boot, which makes boot menus hard to reach for the user. If userspace code can parse the boot loader configuration, too, this allows for UIs that can select a boot menu item to boot into, before rebooting the machine, thus not requiring interactivity during early boot.</li>
  <li>To unify and thus simplify configuration of the various boot loaders around, which makes configuration of the boot loading process easier for users, administrators and developers alike.</li>
  <li>For boot loaders with configuration <em>scripts</em> such as grub2, adopting this spec allows for mostly static scripts that are generated only once at first installation, but then do not need to be updated anymore as that is done via drop-in files exclusively.</li>
</ul>



<p>EFI is not ubiquitous, especially not in embedded systems. If you have an EFI
system, it provides a boot options logic that can offer similar
functionality. Here’s why we think that it is not enough for our uses:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The various EFI implementations implement the boot order/boot item logic to different levels. Some firmware implementations do not offer a boot menu at all and instead unconditionally follow the EFI boot order, booting the first item that is working.</li>
  <li>If the firmware setup is used to reset all data usually all EFI boot entries are lost, making the system entirely unbootable, as the firmware setups generally do not offer a UI to define additional boot items. By placing the menu item information on disk, it is always available, regardless if the BIOS setup data is lost.</li>
  <li>Harddisk images should be movable between machines and be bootable without requiring explicit EFI variables to be set. This also requires that the list of boot options is defined on disk, and not in EFI variables alone.</li>
  <li>EFI is not universal yet (especially on non-x86 platforms), this specification is useful both for EFI and non-EFI boot loaders.</li>
  <li>Many EFI systems disable USB support during early boot to optimize boot times, thus making keyboard input unavailable in the EFI menu. It is thus useful if the OS UI has a standardized way to discover available boot options which can be booted to.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>

<p>Everything described below is located on a placeholder file system <code>$BOOT</code>. The installer program should pick <code>$BOOT</code> according to the following rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li>On disks with an MBR partition table:
    <ul>
      <li>If the OS is installed on a disk with an MBR partition table, and a partition with the type id of 0xEA already exists it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with an MBR partition table, a new partition with type id of 0xEA shall be created, of a suitable size (let’s say 500MB), and it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>On disks with GPT (GUID Partition Table)
    <ul>
      <li>If the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and an Extended Boot Loader Partition or XBOOTLDR partition for short, i.e. a partition with GPT type GUID of <code>bc13c2ff-59e6-4262-a352-b275fd6f7172</code>, already exists, it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and an EFI System Partition or ESP for short, i.e. a partition with GPT type UID of <code>c12a7328-f81f-11d2-ba4b-00a0c93ec93b</code>) already exists and is large enough (let’s say 250MB) and otherwise qualifies, it should be used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and if the ESP partition already exists but is too small, a new suitably sized (let’s say 500MB) XBOOTLDR partition shall be created and used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, if the OS is installed on a disk with GPT, and no ESP partition exists yet, a new suitably sized (let’s say 500MB) ESP should be created and used as <code>$BOOT</code>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>This placeholder file system shall be determined during <em>installation time</em>, and an fstab entry may be created. It should be mounted to either <code>/boot/</code> or <code>/efi/</code>. Additional locations like <code>/boot/efi/</code>, with <code>/boot/</code> being a separate file system, might be supported by implementations. This is not recommended because the mounting of <code>$BOOT</code> is then dependent on and requires the mounting of the intermediate file system.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em><code>$BOOT</code> should be considered <strong>shared</strong> among all OS installations of a system. Instead of maintaining one <code>$BOOT</code> per installed OS (as <code>/boot/</code> was traditionally handled), all installed OS share the same place to drop in their boot-time configuration.</em></p>

<p>For systems where the firmware is able to read file systems directly, <code>$BOOT</code>
must be a file system readable by the firmware. For other systems and generic
installation and live media, <code>$BOOT</code> must be a VFAT (16 or 32) file
system. Applications accessing <code>$BOOT</code> should hence not assume that fancier
file system features such as symlinks, hardlinks, access control or case
sensitivity are supported.</p>

<p>This specification defines two types of boot loader entries. The first type is
text based, very simple and suitable for a variety of firmware, architecture
and image types (“Type #1”). The second type is specific to EFI, but allows
single-file images that embed all metadata in the kernel binary itself, which
is useful to cryptographically sign them as one file for the purpose of
SecureBoot (“Type #2”).</p>

<p>Not all boot loader entries will apply to all systems. For example, Type #1
entries that use the <code>efi</code> key and all Type #2 entries only apply to EFI
systems. Entries using the <code>architecture</code> key might specify an architecture that
doesn’t match the local one. Boot loaders should ignore all entries that don’t
match the local platform and what the boot loader can support, and hide them
from the user. Only entries matching the feature set of boot loader and system
shall be considered and displayed. This allows image builders to put together
images that transparently support multiple different architectures.</p>

<p>Note that the <code>$BOOT</code> partition is not supposed to be exclusive territory of
this specification. This specification only defines semantics of the <code>/loader/</code>
directory inside the file system (see below), but it doesn’t intend to define
ownership of the whole file system exclusively. Boot loaders, firmware, and
other software implementing this specification may choose to place other
files and directories in the same file system. For example, boot loaders that
implement this specification might install their own boot code into the <code>$BOOT</code>
partition. On systems where <code>$BOOT</code> is the ESP this is a particularly common
setup. Implementations of this specification must be able to operate correctly
if files or directories other than <code>/loader/</code> are found in the top level
directory. Implementations that add their own files or directories to the file
systems should use well-named directories, to make name collisions between
multiple users of the file system unlikely.</p>

<h3 id="type-1-boot-loader-specification-entries">Type #1 Boot Loader Specification Entries</h3>

<p>We define two directories below <code>$BOOT</code>:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>$BOOT/loader/</code> is the directory containing all files needed for Type #1 entries</li>
  <li><code>$BOOT/loader/entries/</code> is the directory containing the drop-in snippets. This directory contains one <code>.conf</code> file for each boot menu item.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>In all cases the <code>/loader/</code> directory should be …</em></p></div></div>

            <p>
              June 17, 2020<br>
              
              
            </p>

            <p>Google Analytics is incredibly popular software. <a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/analytics/Google-Analytics">According to BuiltWith, 90% of the top 100,000 websites use it</a>. And if you’re a marketer, I pretty much guarantee that stat doesn’t surprise you and that you’re using GA to make significant decisions about your website and content strategy.</p>

<p>And yet, Google Analytics has always been hugely more complex than most marketers need or understand. Its data is fairly reliable, but it’s really easy to misconfigure, and more and more users are blocking analytics tools. <a href="https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2637192?hl=en">And for anything beyond standard reporting, Google Analytics reports use sampled data</a>, which makes these reports unsuitable if you’re looking for high precision. If you’re not looking for high precision, you should also know that Google Analytics’ standard reporting is offered by lots of other tools, about which more below.</p>

<p>Do we still recommend Google Analytics? Of course – but we think responsible marketers should offer their customers a way to opt out of GA tracking, and we think it’s an interesting experiment, and useful, to think about marketing without Google Analytics.</p>

<h2 id="why-you-should-make-it-easy-for-users-to-opt-out-of-google-analytics">Why you should make it easy for users to opt out of Google Analytics</h2>

<p>Of course, in many countries, letting users opt out of tracking is a legal obligation – and visitors from those countries should see a cookie consent notice when they visit your site. For example, if you intend to provide services to people in the EU, <a href="https://gdpr.eu/cookies/">you’ll need to comply with the ePrivacy Directive</a>.</p>

<p>But there are a few more important reasons.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, we’re seeing more people object to excessive data collection, especially from Google. <strong>Users who care can easily block your tracking anyway</strong>, but by providing them a straightforward, easy way to do this, you send a signal that their privacy is important to you.</p>

<p><strong>Over the long run, we think you won’t need Google Analytics</strong>, and you certainly don’t need Google Analytics data from all of your visitors. The functionality and data that GA provides is far more than is actually needed. The result is that it’s easy to spend a lot of time setting up complex reports that don’t help you make better decisions, that may not even be accurate, and that distract you from other important sources of information – <a href="https://ercule.co/less-data-more-context">like other people in your company, or customers</a>.</p>

<p>We also think that <strong>Google Analytics will, over time, assume much less importance for web analytics</strong>. Already, tools that are privacy-focused (e.g. <a href="https://simpleanalytics.com/">Simple Analytics</a>, <a href="https://matomo.org/">Matomo</a>, <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible</a>, and <a href="https://usefathom.com/">Fathom</a>) are starting to gain more traction.</p>

<p>Because these tools are also simpler, they’re easier to use, and in many cases they rely on underlying metrics that are easier to understand, and more reliable to collect. Now is a good time to start thinking about a post Google Analytics world, and considering what you really need from your web analytics.</p>

<h2 id="javascript-to-easily-let-your-visitors-opt-out">Javascript to easily let your visitors opt out</h2>

<p><a href="https://ercule.co/google-analytics-opt-out-javascript">We’ve written some JavaScript to make it easy to allow your visitors to opt-out of Google Analytics tracking</a>. This code:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Provides a text link that, when clicked, disables Google Analytics tracking on your site, for the visitor who clicked the link</li>
  <li>Stores that preference in a cookie so that when a visitor returns, Google Analytics stays disabled</li>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>For the moment, Google Analytics is still an important part of the marketing toolkit for most marketers. But its downsides should be recognized – in addition to data privacy issues, Google Analytics makes it easy to get lost in complex reporting that doesn’t add value to your marketing efforts. Give your users a way to easily opt out, and we recommend giving some thought to how you’ll market in a post-Google-Analytics world, too.</p>

<p>A group of researchers across the UNU, UNITAR, ITU, and ISWA[0] recently released <a href="https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-D/Environment/Documents/Toolbox/GEM_2020_def.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Global E-waste Monitor 2020</a> report, giving us an up to date look at just how much electronic waste we’re generating around the world.&nbsp; The numbers are worrying.&nbsp; We’ve gone from 44.4 million metric tons per year in 2014 to 53.6 million metric tons in 2019.&nbsp; Even worse, another group of UN-affiliated researchers[1] published a paper called <a href="http://www.step-initiative.org/files/_documents/publications/FUTURE%20E-WASTE%20SCENARIOS_UNU_190829_low_screen.pdf">Future E-waste Scenarios</a> that projects a possible increase to 111 million metric tons by 2050.&nbsp; This assumes a scenario where economic improvements in developing countries result in consumption patterns similar to developed countries along with limited changes to the status quo around product lifecycles.</p>
<p>Numbers that large are hard to make any sense of.&nbsp; The problem feels more real when you break it down to a personal scale.&nbsp; In 2019, each of us on average is creating 7.3 kg of e-waste annually, which may grow to around 12.3 kg by 2050.&nbsp; As a rough approximation, this means that a person born in 1980 will generate around 500kg of e-waste in their lifetime, or about around eight times their own body weight.&nbsp; We can categorize those numbers further.&nbsp; Currently, around 17.4% of e-waste is properly recycled (1.4 people’s worth) and 8% is estimated to be improperly disposed of in normal waste bins (0.6 people’s worth).&nbsp; The remaining 6 people’s worth is just unknown and assumed to often be stored, dumped, incinerated, or re-processed in unsafe and environmentally unfriendly methods.</p>
<p>The UN groups are creating initiatives to boost tracking and reporting and make it easier for governments to create and maintain sound programs around recycling e-waste.&nbsp; Ultimately though, the best lever we have is to generate less waste to begin with.&nbsp; We can do that by repairing our products instead of buying new ones and by designing products to be longer lived.&nbsp; This requires companies and consumers to both embrace repair, upgradeability, and long software support lifetimes.&nbsp; We can shrink our personal piles of waste, and together, shrink the global one too.</p>
<p><em>If you’d like to help on this, we’re <a href="https://jobs.lever.co/framework" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring across a range of roles</a> to fulfill our mission of making consumer electronics products long lived.</em></p>

<p>A year ago, covid was a mystery. We didn't know how it spread, we didn't know who it infected, we didn't know how to treat it. All we knew was that it was spreading fast and the early epicenters were slaughterhouses.</p>
<p>It's been a year, and now we know a lot more. One thing we know, for example, is that even though virus particles can linger for a long time on surfaces, you're not likely to catch the virus from these "fomites."</p>
<p>Simple handwashing of the sort we should have all practised all along will do the trick. You don't need to sterilize your groceries or leave your parcels to sit on your doorstep for three days. Just wash your hands!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/health/covid-19-surfaces-spread-clean/">https://www.popsci.com/story/health/covid-19-surfaces-spread-clean/</a></p>
<p>However, in the lockdown's early days, businesses were floundering, wondering how they'd reopen, and, driven by the scant science of covid transmission, a class of highly speculative health consultant sprang into existence to promote a meticulous regime of surface cleaning.</p>
<p>Surface-cleaning is a highly visible activity, and it can feel reassuring to be handed a grocery basket whose handle is glistening with a layer of freshly applied sterilizing spray. But all of this hygiene theater is largely irrelevant to controlling the pandemic.</p>
<p>Hygiene theater isn't harmless. At the very least, it's a major distraction. Late in 2020, my kid's school district circulated a plan to reopen for in-person classes in early Jan, assuming the LA County health department permitted it (they didn't because LA is a plague-pit).</p>
<p>This email went into incredible, eye-watering detail about the school's plan to sterilize all surfaces, going so far as to mention the brand names, active ingredients and concentrations of the products that would be applied to every surface every day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the plan included <em>nothing</em> about ventilation. When I wrote to the district to ask some simple questions like, "Will you unseal the windows so they can be opened while students are present?" or "Do you have any fans?" no one knew the answer.</p>
<p>Needless to say, "Have you changed the kind of HVAC filters you use?" was an unanswerable mystery. This wasn't reassuring – as school safety plans go, it was about as useless as those lock-down active shooter drills they terrorize the kids with.</p>
<p>Hygiene theater is everywhere. A friend of mine owns a 100-employee business that moved into new offices just before the pandemic. The lease includes cleaning services, and twice a week, a masked crew sweeps through the unoccupied offices and sterilizes every surface.</p>
<p>Covid science is still a moving target, obviously, but the overwhelming consensus is that masks, distance and ventilation are the most important safety measures we can take – while sterilization and surfaces are no more (or less) important than they were before the plague.</p>
<p>Of course, airflow isn't easy to demonstrate or detect (some places are experimenting with giant CO2 readouts as a proxy for ventilation), so it's getting short shrift.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/10/carbon-dioxide-device-coronavirus/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2021/02/10/carbon-dioxide-device-coronavirus/</a></p>
<p>But focusing on sanitizing because it's so visible is the epidemiological equivalent of looking for car keys under the lamppost.</p>

<p>One of the worst barriers to preserving the planet in a state suitable for human habitation is the Energy Charter Treaty, an obscure 1994 treaty with 50+ signatories that allows energy companies to sue governments over environmental protection laws.</p>
<p>The ECT has just been invoked by the German polluter RWE, which is suing the Dutch government for €1.4b over a law that bans coal plants by 2030.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/germanys-rwe-uses-energy-charter-treaty-to-challenge-dutch-coal-phase-out/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/germanys-rwe-uses-energy-charter-treaty-to-challenge-dutch-coal-phase-out/</a></p>
<p>All told, the EU faces <em>at least</em> €345b in ECT liability over its climate plans. In reality, the total could be much higher, because the ECT provides for damages equal to the value of physical plant and <em>all projected future profits</em> from those plants.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2021/ect/">https://www.investigate-europe.eu/en/2021/ect/</a></p>
<p>€345b is double the EU's total annual operational budget. This is the ransom that the world's worst climate criminals are demanding that Europeans pay as a condition of continuing to have a habitable planet. Big Energy want to be rewarded for its crimes against humanity.</p>
<p>Every day the treaty remains in effect produces more liability. Under ECT's provisions, a country that pulls out of the agreement is still liable for <em>twenty years</em> for any laws that affect the profitability of energy products started while the country was still in the ECT.</p>
<p>When a country is sued by a multinational for improving its environmental protections, the case is tried by a star-chamber of corporate lawyers who meet in secret and overwhelmingly find in favor of polluters.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, this is not a stable situation. To keep countries from fleeing the ECT, the energy cartel has embarked on a "modernization" project that it has slow-walked since 2017, with help from Japan, whose worst polluters depend on ECT to operate with impunity.</p>
<p>It's not hard to grind negotiations to a halt – all you need is a requirement that every decision must be unanimous before work can proceed. Leaks show this gambit is why the "modernization" meetings have been a four-year, do-nothing talking shop:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/energy-charter-treaty-reform-reaches-milestone-with-little-progress-to-show/">https://www.euractiv.com/section/energy/news/energy-charter-treaty-reform-reaches-milestone-with-little-progress-to-show/</a></p>
<p>The harms of ECT aren't limited to direct vast transfers of public money to polluters. ECT is a major reason we don't get meaningful climate action in the first place: such legislation dies in planning once its authors are warned that it will trigger ECT enforcement action.</p>
<p>The arguments in favor of ECT are risible FUD, as Fabian Flues, Cecilia Olivet and Pia Eberhardt document for Opendemocracy.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/this-obscure-energy-treaty-is-the-greatest-threat-to-the-planet-youve-never-heard-of/">https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/oureconomy/this-obscure-energy-treaty-is-the-greatest-threat-to-the-planet-youve-never-heard-of/</a></p>
<p>Take the argument that the ECT spurs investment in renewables: a meta-analysis of 74 papers concludes that this effect is "so small as to be considered zero" (in reality, the majority of ECT-attributable investment is in dirty fossil fuel power).</p>
<p><a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joes.12392">https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joes.12392</a></p>
<p>Or the argument that since quitting ECT leaves countries exposed for 20 years, there's no point. Recall that this 20 year overhang only applies to projects begun <em>before</em> the country leaves the ECT, so the sooner countries quit it, the less risk they face.</p>
<p>Such risk as does exist can be mitigated by countries quitting in a bloc, making a mutual promise to ban companies domiciled in their borders from making any claims under the ECT, using national law to prohibit ECT action. The EU could mitigate much of its risk this way.</p>
<p>That the ECT even exists is a bad joke. It can't be fixed through "modernization" (especially not the current modernization plan, which doesn't touch corporate courts or contemplate any exemptions for climate regulation).</p>
<p>300 EU lawmakers have signed a petition calling on the EU to leave the ECT.</p>
<p><a href="http://endfossilprotection.org/sites/default/files/documents/Statement%20of%20European%20Parliamentarians%20on%20the%20modernization%20of%20the%20TCE.pdf">http://endfossilprotection.org/sites/default/files/documents/Statement%20of%20European%20Parliamentarians%20on%20the%20modernization%20of%20the%20TCE.pdf</a></p>
<p>They're joined by 450 climate activists:</p>

<p>Five weeks ago, I joined a new team at Google, and began contributing to a new
project: <a href="https://git-scm.org/">Git</a>. I was (and still am) thrilled to be
working on a piece of software used by countless developers across the globe!
To gain a deep knowledge of a tool I’ve evangelized for so long!</p>

<p>But then I subscribed to the mailing list, and it truly began to sink in to me
that for the forseeable future, I could expect my mailbox to look something like
this:</p>

<p>When I started writing code professionally, I worked on a team that used Gerrit.
I liked it well enough that I continued to recommend it when asked; an iterative
review UI based on Git, who could ask for more? At my next company, code reviews
were performed by another developer examining your ClearCase checkout and
sending you an email about it (yikes). Later I was asked to evaluate Team
Foundation Server’s built-in review tooling for another company, on a team which
insisted that “code reviews take valuable developer time” - and, as a result,
generally didn’t perform them. Then I was lucky to fall back into a team using
Git alongside a proprietary review tool, and then, back to my roots: Git and
Gerrit on <a href="https://openbmc.org/">OpenBMC</a>, and Gerrit for our internal fork, too.</p>

<p>This whole time, I figured no matter how bad the review process was, at least it
wasn’t emailed patches. Why does anybody still use that terrible workflow? Who
would want to review a diff line-by-line in their email client?!</p>

<p>I was envisioning someone painstakingly copying a diff from an email body and
pasting it into <code>apply</code>. Or carefully making a second copy of the altered file
and running <code><span>diff -u</span></code>, and then handwriting the subject and commit message.</p>

<p>Of course, nobody does that. It’s absolutely true that no developer today - let
alone the bash-happy Unix devs of yesteryear - would use that workflow. With
some tooling and good practices, I found a workflow that I love - and found
myself arguing in defense of emailed patches!</p>

<h2 id="git-format-patch-to-the-rescue"><code>git format-patch</code> to the Rescue</h2>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, since the Git project itself is organized via emailed
patches, Git has some excellent built-in tooling for preparing your commits for
the inbox. <code>git format-patch</code> is the most notable - with it you can prepare an
entire branch for mailing, include a cover letter, indicate a Request for
Comment change, generate updated v2 or later patches, and more.</p>

<p>It’s easiest to use <code>git format-patch</code> if you’ve been working in a feature
branch (which you always do, right..?) - for the purposes of the tutorial, we’ll
assume the main branch of the project is <code>master</code> and your feature branch is
<code>feature</code>; we’ll also assume that <code>feature</code> has been recently rebased onto the
tip of <code>master</code>.</p>



<p>Imagine that you’ve got only one commit in your feature branch. Typically
projects like to see individual patches sent as a single email with no cover,
with a subject like “[PATCH] component: my great feature”. Make sure that your
working tree is clean - that is, everything you want committed is committed -
and run the following.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell_session"><span>$</span> git format-patch <span>-o</span> feature-patches/ master..feature</code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s it! <code>-o feature-patches/</code> tells Git that you want your patchfile in the
<code>feature-patches/</code> directory, and <code>master..feature</code> tells Git you want patches
for the diff between <code>master</code> and <code>feature</code> - which in this case should be only
one commit.</p>

<p>Now take a look in <code>feature-patches/</code>. You should see a single file named
something like <code>0001-component-my-great-feature.patch</code>. If you open it up in
your favorite editor (I like Vim), you’ll see an email header, your commit
message, a diffspec, and a unified diff indicating your changes.</p>

<p>Ideally, your commit message should say everything there is to be said about
your patch. But sometimes, there’s some context you want to add that isn’t
appropriate for a commit message - for example, maybe you want to warn everyone
that you won’t be addressing comments until next week as you’re visiting your
aunt in Mallorca and she doesn’t like to give out her wifi password. In that
case, look for the <code>---</code> above the diffspec - you can provide your additional
message there. It will look something like this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="email">From 1345bbb3f7ac74abde040c12e737204689a72723 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: Dev Eloper &lt;developer@cool.website&gt;
Date: Thu, 18 Apr 2019 15:11:02 -0700
Subject: [PATCH] README: change the grammar

I think it looks better this way. This part of the commit message will
end up in the commit-log.

Signed-off-by: Dev Eloper &lt;developer@cool.website&gt;
---
I welcome everyone's comments on this change, however, I will be unable
to answer until next Friday. My aunt still insists that if she gives me
her wifi password I will hack the Pentagon from her cottage.

<p>Great. You can see in the example which parts of the email will be retained as
a commit message, and which parts will be ignored by <code>git am</code>. If you’re not
sure how it will look, you can always try running it through <code>git am</code> yourself
to have a look at the resulting commit.</p>

<p><em>If your organization likes even single-commit changes to contain a cover letter
you can just use the instructions in the next section.</em></p>



<p>If you’ve been working on a much larger feature and your branch has a number of
commits, you can still use <code>git format-patch</code> pretty easily. Like before, make
sure your working tree is clean and your commits are all in order, then run</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell_session"><span>$</span> git format-patch <span>--cover-letter</span> <span>-o</span> feature-patches/ master..feature</code></pre></figure>

<p>Have a look in <code>feature-patches/</code>. You should see n+1 patch files (where n is
the number of commits you have on top of master). Most of them will reflect the
subject lines of your patches, but there will be one named beginning with
0000 - that’s your cover letter. Go ahead and open it in your favorite editor.</p>

<p>You should see that it’s already got a template, including some email headers
and a diffstat. Change the subject line to something that summarizes your entire
feature, taking care to preserve the “[PATCH 0/X]” portion. You can also include
context in the body of the cover letter to explain anything about the patchset
which wasn’t appropriate for inclusion into the commit messages. For a larger
changeset, this is typically the place where you explain what your feature is
<em>as a whole</em>.</p>

<p>If you examine the other patches, you will see that they are all marked
In-Reply-To the Message-Id of your cover letter. This is good and what most
communities prefer, but you can change the behavior with the <code>--thread</code>
argument.</p>



<ul>
  <li>Resist the urge to edit the diff in the patch directly. The diff contains some
line number information that needs to match up and is hard to fudge by hand.
Plus, your local tree will get out-of-sync with what you’re sending upstream.</li>
  <li>The timestamp at the top of the patch is special and indicates that the patch
was generated with <code>git format-patch</code>; don’t touch it.</li>
  <li>The build number at the bottom indicates which version of Git you used to
generate the patch; you can delete this if you are feeling the need for
privacy.</li>
  <li>The area below the <code>---</code> or the cover letter in v2 or later patches is a great
spot for you to explain what changed between the previous version and this
one. Your reviewer could use an interdiff to figure it out, but it’s kind to
give them a hint.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="show-them-what-you-got-git-send-email">Show Them What You Got: <code>git send-email</code></h2>

<p><em>Note: One thing this tutorial won’t cover is how to download and configure
<code>git send-email</code>. Not because it’s hard, or trivial, but because setup steps
vary quite a bit depending on your system and email client. <code>send-email</code> is
often not packaged with base Git; you may have to install it separately. This
tutorial assumes you’ve already got it up and running.</em></p>

<p>After the steps in the previous section, you should have one or more patch
files in your <code>feature-patches/</code> directory, and you should also have examined
your patches to ensure that they look perfect and ready for review. Sending them
is as simple as this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell_session"><span>$</span> git send-email <span>--to</span><span>=</span>mailing-list@project.org feature-patches/<span>*</span>.patch</code></pre></figure>

<p>That’s it! Your patches are out and your reviews should come pouring in. (Okay,
maybe “trickling” is a better word.)</p>



<p><em>Note: As with Gerrit and other iterative code review tools based around a Git
workflow, making your changes involves using interactive rebase. I won’t cover
that here, as it’s not significantly different from other processes, and it’s
complex enough to take its own tutorial.</em></p>

<p>Your reviewers will likely provide their comments inline, and it’s often good
manners to reply to each review comment indicating whether you’ve taken an
action or not. When I’m replying to review comments, I like to have a window
open with a reply to the email, and another window open with my code. I make
sure that I’ve begun an interactive rebase and paused to edit the commit I’m
examining comments for, and then I open my source file. As I read comments in
the email, I make a change as appropriate in my source, then type a response
inline to the comment in question. (That way I know I didn’t miss anything!)</p>

<p>When you’ve addressed all the comments for a certain patch, make sure to <code>git
add -u &amp;&amp; git commit --amend</code> to update your commit with the changes. Once
you’ve updated your entire branch this way, you’re ready to …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Internet users have gotten increasingly discerning when it comes to search. When they type a keyword into your website's search bar, they expect to find logically ranked results, including related matches and misspellings.</p>
<p>Because users are used to these sophisticated search systems, developers have to build applications that use more than simple <code>LIKE</code> queries. </p>

    </span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html">Postgres Full Text Search</a> has been available since Postgres 8.3. It can be used to <strong>find records based on semantics and knowledge of the language</strong> rather than simple string matching, is very flexible, and unlike other search options such as <code>LIKE</code>, it performs well for partial matches.</p>
<p>While <code>LIKE</code> can be supported by indexes, that usually won’t work well when the <code>%</code> operator is used on the left side of the search term. Typically this means the query planner reverts to sequential scans when using wildcard operators like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> title <span>FROM</span> film <span>WHERE</span> description <span>LIKE</span> <span>'%brilliant'</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>When searching multiple columns, you also have additional effort, as each column needs to be queried separately using <code>LIKE</code>. There are more flexible alternatives, such as <code>SIMILAR TO</code> and POSIX regular expression search, but those are still difficult to use when you want to catch different variations of a word (e.g., word variations like “jump,” “jumps,” “jumped,” and “jumping”).</p>
<p>Because <code>LIKE</code> and other simple methods lack language support and cannot handle word variations or ranking, Postgres Full Text Search (FTS) is generally a better option when implementing search directly in the database. With FTS, your searches will match all instances of the word, its plural, and the word's various tenses. Because FTS is bundled into Postgres, there’s no need to install extra software and no extra cost for using a third-party search provider. Additionally, all your data are stored in one place, which reduces your web application’s complexity.</p>
<p>This article will show you how to use Full Text Search in raw PostgreSQL queries and implement equivalent queries in Django using the Postgres driver. Along the way, you’ll see some of the use cases for the various Full Text Search methods that Postgres provides.</p>

<h2 id="core-concepts-of-postgres-full-text-search"><a href="#core-concepts-of-postgres-full-text-search" aria-label="core concepts of postgres full text search permalink"></a>Core Concepts of Postgres Full Text Search</h2>
<p>PostgreSQL provides several native functions for Full Text Search. In the following sections, you’ll see how to use them to “vectorize” your results and search queries so that you can use Postgres’s Full Text Search features.</p>
<h3 id="tsvector-data-type"><a href="#tsvector-data-type" aria-label="tsvector data type permalink"></a>tsvector data type</h3>
<p>Before a text or document can be searched using FTS, you need to convert it to an acceptable data type, known as a <code>tsvector</code>. To convert plain text to a <code>tsvector</code>, use the Postgres <code>to_tsvector</code> function. This function reduces the original text to a set of word skeletons known as lexemes.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexeme">Lexemes</a> are important because they help match related words. For instance, the words <em>satisfy</em>, <em>satisfying</em> and <em>satisfied</em> would convert to <em>satisfi</em>. This means a search for <em>satisfy</em> will return results containing any of the other terms as well. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-dictionaries.html#TEXTSEARCH-STOPWORDS">Stop words</a> such as “a,” “on,” “of,” “you,” “who,” etc. are removed because they appear too frequently to be relevant in searches. The <code>to_tsvector</code> function returns the lexemes, along with a digit that denotes each word’s position in the text.</p>
<p>Note that the output of the function is language-dependent. You should tell PostgreSQL to treat the text as English (or whatever language your results are stored in). To convert the sentence “A Fanciful Documentary of a Frisbee And a Lumberjack who must Chase a Monkey in A Shark Tank” to a <code>tsvector</code>, run the following:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'A Fanciful Documentary of a Frisbee And a Lumberjack who must Chase a Monkey in A Shark Tank'</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> search<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You’ll see output like the following:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>                    search
----------------------------------------------------------------------
'chase':12 'documentari':3 'fanci':2 'frisbe':6 'lumberjack':9 'monkey':14 'must':11 'shark':17 'tank':18</code></pre></div>
<p>This shows each word’s root as well as its position in the text. For example, the word fanciful, the second word in the text, has been broken down into the lexeme “fanci”, so you see <code>’fanci’:2</code>.</p>
<h3 id="tsquery-data-type"><a href="#tsquery-data-type" aria-label="tsquery data type permalink"></a>tsquery data type</h3>
<p>Text search systems have two major components: the text being searched and the keyword being searched for. In the case of FTS, both components must be vectorized. You saw how searchable data is converted to a <code>tsvector</code> in the previous section, so now you’ll see how search terms are vectorized into <code>tsquery</code> values.</p>
<p>Postgres offers functions that will convert text fields to <code>tsquery</code> values such as <code>to_tsquery</code>, <code>plainto_tsquery</code> and <code>phraseto_tsquery</code>. Search terms can also be combined with the <code>&amp;</code> (AND), <code>|</code> (OR), and <code>!</code> (NOT) operators, and parentheses can be used to group operators and determine their order. <code>to_tsquery</code> converts the search terms to tokens and discards stop words.</p>
<p>The following query:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'a &amp; beautifully &amp; very &amp; quickly'</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> search<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Returns the lexemes “beauti” and “quick” because “a” and “very” are stop words:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>                    search
----------------------------------------------------------------------
'beauti' &amp; 'quick'</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="searching"><a href="#searching" aria-label="searching permalink"></a>Searching</h3>
<p>Now that you know how to create a <code>tsvector</code> from your text data and a <code>tsquery</code> from your search terms, you can perform a full-text search using the <code>@@</code> operator.</p>
<p>For example, you can run the following query to compare two strings:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'John''s performance was found wanting'</span><span>)</span> @@ to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'want'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This query returns <code>TRUE</code>, indicating that there was a match: <code>want</code>.</p>
<p>If you had a <code>film</code> table containing movie titles and descriptions, you could use Full Text Search to find all films with a description containing the word <em>epic</em> and either of the words <em>tale</em> or <em>story</em>:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> title<span>,</span> description <span>FROM</span> film
<span>WHERE</span> to_tsvector<span>(</span>description<span>)</span> @@ to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'epic &amp; (story | tale)'</span><span>)</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This would give you results similar to this:</p>
<p><span>

  </a>
    </span></p>
<h3 id="ranking"><a href="#ranking" aria-label="ranking permalink"></a>Ranking</h3>
<p>Ranking search results can ensure that the most relevant results are shown first. Postgres provides <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls.html#TEXTSEARCH-RANKING">two functions for ranking</a> search results: <code>ts_rank</code> and <code>ts_rankcd</code>. <code>ts_rank</code> considers the frequency of words, while <code>ts_rank_cd</code> (“cd” means “coverage density”) considers the position of search terms within the text being searched.</p>
<p>If you run the following query, you’ll see that <code>rank1</code> and <code>rank2</code> are ranked the same (<code>0.06078271</code>) because each search query is found once in the sentence:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank1<span>,</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank2<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The more tokens that match the text, the higher the rank. In the following example, <code>rank1</code> has a higher rank than <code>rank2</code> because the tokens “elephant” and “dolphin” are both found in the sentence while “snake” is not:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant &amp; dolphin'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank1<span>,</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'Dolphins are to water as elephants are to forest'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin &amp; snake'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> rank2<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="weighting"><a href="#weighting" aria-label="weighting permalink"></a>Weighting</h3>
<p>You can also give relevance to some factors over others by weighing them. For instance, when searching the film table, the highest weight could be given to the movie title and less weight could be given to the description using the <code>setweight</code> function:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>
<span>SELECT</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'A'</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> weight<span>;</span>


<span>SELECT</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'A'</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> 
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> elephant_rank<span>,</span>
  ts_rank<span>(</span>
    setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'elephant'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'A'</span><span>)</span> <span>||</span> setweight<span>(</span>to_tsvector<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>)</span><span>,</span>
    to_tsquery<span>(</span><span>'english'</span><span>,</span> <span>'dolphin'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span> <span>AS</span> dolphin_rank<span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>elephant_rank</code> is ranked higher because it matched elephant which has a higher weight of A, compared to dolphin_rank which has a weight of B.</p>

|---------------|--------------|
| 0.6079271     | 0.24317084   |</code></pre></div>
<p><code>ts_rank</code> takes an optional first argument, <strong>weight</strong>. When this argument is left empty, it defaults to “{0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 1.0}” in the order D, C, B, A. By default, A has the highest weight of 1.0, B has 0.4, C has 0.2, and D has 0.1. You can set the weight of any of A, B, C, or D to a different value using any decimal between -0.1 and 1.0. This allows you to have fine-grained control over how results are returned and ensure that users see the right results for their queries.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve seen how to use Postgres’ Full Text Search functions, you’re ready to start applying these ideas to your Django app.</p>
<h2 id="using-postgresql-full-text-search-in-django"><a href="#using-postgresql-full-text-search-in-django" aria-label="using postgresql full text search in django permalink"></a>Using PostgreSQL Full Text Search in Django</h2>
<p>Using Postgres’ Full Text Search in Django is an ideal way to add accurate and fast search because it is easy to maintain and fast to work with. To demonstrate Full Text Search in Django, consider a PostgreSQL database <code>dvdrental</code>, with a <code>film</code> table, and an equivalent <code>Film</code> model in a Django application implemented like this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> Models

<span>class</span> <span>Film</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Model<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    film_id <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>AutoField<span>(</span>primary_key<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>
    title <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>CharField<span>(</span>max_length<span>=</span><span>255</span><span>)</span>
    description <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>TextField<span>(</span>blank<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>,</span> null<span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

    <span>def</span> <span>__str__</span><span>(</span>self<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>', '</span><span>.</span>join<span>(</span><span>[</span><span>'film_id='</span> <span>+</span> <span>str</span><span>(</span>self<span>.</span>film_id<span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>'title='</span> <span>+</span> self<span>.</span>title<span>,</span> <span>'description='</span> <span>+</span> self<span>.</span>description<span>]</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>In the remainder of this article, you’ll see how to search a single database table field, search multiple fields, rank search results, and optimize the performance of Full text Search using vector fields and indexes. You can run the commands from your <a href="https://www.python.org/shell/">Python shell</a>.</p>

<p>This is an example machine learning image recognition stack using AWS Lambda Container Images. Lambda container images can include more source assets than traditional ZIP packages (10 GB vs 250 MB image sizes), allowing for larger ML models to be used.</p>
<p>This example contains an AWS Lambda function that uses the <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/openimages/web/index.html">Open Images Dataset</a> <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a> model to detect objects in an image. When you invoke the /detector API route with a URL to an image the function will download the image, use the TensorFlow model to detect objects in it, then return an annotated version of the image back to the client.</p>

</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code><h2>How to</h2>
<p>The repository contains a complete example stack that can be imported directly into Stackery and deployed. The rest of this post walks you through building your own ML stack using Stackery.</p>
<h3>Setup</h3>
<ol>
<li>First, <a href="https://portal.aws.amazon.com/billing/signup">create an AWS account</a> if you don't have one. Don't worry, everything we will do in this example will fit into the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/free">AWS Free Tier</a>, and even if you do not qualify for the free tier you will incur fractions of a penny's worth of expense running this example stack.</li>
<li>Second, create a <a href="https://stackery.io/sign-up">free Stackery account</a>. We will use Stackery to build the app and then deploy it into your AWS account.</li>
<li>Follow the steps after creating your Stackery account to link your AWS account. This gives Stackery permissions to package functions and generate <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/">CloudFormation</a> <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/using-cfn-updating-stacks-changesets.html">Change Sets</a> but does not give Stackery permission to arbitrarily modify resources in your AWS account. You can find more details here: <a href="https://docs.stackery.io/docs/using-stackery/security-permissions-and-controls">Stackery Permissions &amp; Controls</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Create a new stack</h3>
<ol>
<li>Once you have linked your AWS account it's time to start creating a new stack! Go to <a href="https://app.stackery.io/stacks">Stacks</a> and click the green <strong>Add a Stack</strong> button. This will create a new, untitled stack for you.<br>
<img src="https://media.graphcms.com/4ho9a2SZQIWakGiuEp7z" alt="Creating stacks inside Stackery – AWS Lambda Container Image Support Tutorial"></li>
<li>First things first, let's give our stack a name. Click the three dots next to the current stack's name (the current name will be something like <em>Untitled</em> or <em>Untitled-1</em>) and choose to <strong>Rename</strong> the stack. Now, pick a name (<em>ml-image-recognition</em> would work!) and save it.</li>
<li>Before we go any further, why don't we save our progress? Click the big green <strong>Save with Git...</strong> button to authenticate to your favorite Git provider, create a new repo for the stack, and commit our starting stack.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Add a new HTTP API</h3>
<ol>
<li>We see a blank canvas for our new stack. Let's add an HTTP API! Click the green <strong>Add Resource</strong> button in the top right corner of the canvas. Click the <strong>HTTP API</strong> resource in the palette to add a new API to our stack. Close the palette.<br>
<img src="https://media.graphcms.com/zPb0V4ZAQPSVPUorDNKH" alt="Adding resources in Stackery – AWS Lambda Container Image Support Tutorial"></li>
<li>Double-click the new HTTP API (note: don't double click the <em>GET /</em> route, that opens the route settings instead of the API settings).<br>
<img src="https://media.graphcms.com/6jgSqV5XTjmSAkLVivuV" alt="An HTTP API inside Stackery – AWS Lambda Container Image Support Tutorial"></li>
<li>Change the route from <em>GET /</em> to <em>GET /detector</em>.</li>
<li>Click the big, green <strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of the settings panel.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Add a new function</h3>
<ol>
<li><p>Now let's add a Lambda function! Again, click the green <strong>Add Resource</strong> button in the top right corner of the canvas. Click the <strong>Function</strong> resource in the palette to add a new Function to our stack. Close the palette.</p></li>
<li><p>Double-click the new Function to edit its settings.</p></li>
<li><p>Update the following settings:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logical ID: Something descriptive, like <em>Recognizer</em></li>
<li>Package Type: Docker Image (so we can fit a large ML model into our source assets!)</li>
<li>Docker Build Context: You probably want to update this from <em>/src/Function</em> to something like <em>/src/Recognizer</em></li>
<li>Timeout: 120 (it takes a while for TensorFlow to spin up!)</li>
<li>Don't forget to click the big, green <strong>Save</strong> button at the bottom of the settings panel!<br>
<img src="https://media.graphcms.com/uWK7xv9HSOmjQlhVkCNi" alt="Step6 .jpg"></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Save the stack by clicking the <strong>Commit...</strong> button. This is a great opportunity to see what we've added to the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless/sam/">AWS SAM</a> template by opening the Template Diff panel. Notice how a bunch of additional resources, like an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">AWS ECR</a> container image repository and a <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/codebuild/">CodeBuild</a> project, are scaffolded to support building and running your new Function?</p></li>
</ol>
<h3>Edit your sources</h3>
<ol>
<li>Now it's time to get our feet wet on the source code side! Pull down the stack's Git repo to edit it using your favorite editor / IDE.</li>
<li>Scaffolded in the repo will be your function's source folder and Dockerfile. This Dockerfile will have a lot of possible starting points for you to choose from. We're going to build a Python Function, so you can take a look at the default Python Dockerfile commands. But since we're building a specific implementation, delete what's in the Dockerfile and replace it with the following:
<deckgo-highlight-code terminal="carbon" theme="one-light" language="bash">
                    <code slot="code"># Download the Open Images TensorFlow model and extract it to the `model`
# folder.
FROM alpine AS builder
RUN mkdir model
RUN wget -c https://storage.googleapis.com/tfhub-modules/google/openimages_v4/ssd/mobilenet_v2/1.tar.gz -O - | tar xz -C model
# Make sure it's world-readable so the Lambda service user can access it.
RUN chmod -R a+r model

# Build the runtime image from the official AWS Lambda Python base image.
FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/python
# Copy the extracted Open Images model into the source code space.
COPY --from=builder model model
# Copy in the sources.
COPY handler.py requirements.txt ./
# Copy the OpenSans font for annotation use
COPY font ./font
# Install the Python dependencies
RUN python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
# Tell the Lambda runtime where the function handler is located.
CMD ["handler.lambda_handler"]
</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code></li>
<li>Now add the Python dependencies by putting the following into requirements.txt:
<deckgo-highlight-code terminal="carbon" theme="one-light" language="javascript">
                    <code slot="code">requests
tensorflow
Pillow
</code>
        </deckgo-highlight-code></li>
<li>Lastly, add the Function handler source code into handler.py:
<deckgo-highlight-code terminal="carbon" theme="one-light" language="python">

<h3>Deploy the stack</h3>

If you have the <a href="https://docs.stackery.io/docs/using-stackery/cli#install-the-cli">Stackery CLI</a> (you can install it from instructions here: https://docs.stackery.io/docs/using-stackery/cli#install-the-cli) it's as easy as running <code>stackery deploy --git-ref main</code> (swap <code>main</code> for whatever branch your code is on). You can also point and click through our dashboard interface to deploy by navigating to the <strong>Deploy</strong> section on the left-hand sidebar after navigating to your stack at <a href="https://app.stackery.io/">https://app.stackery.io.</a>.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Test</h3>

          <h4>Will I like this book?</h4>
          <p>
	    I think you will, yes! However, since we probably haven't met, I'm not a particularly good judge of that.
	    Rather than trust me, read one of the sections available online
	    (my favorites are <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/staff-archetypes">Staff engineer archetypes</a>
	    and <a href="https://staffeng.com/guides/work-on-what-matters">Work on what matters</a>),
	    and one or two of the interviews (I'd recommend <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/ras-kasa-williams">Kasa's</a>
	      and <a href="https://staffeng.com/stories/michelle-bu">Michelle's</a>).
        </p></div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>Why write this book?</h4>
          <p>
	    There isn't much out there about being a senior technical leader outside of the management career track.
	    As I've worked with more folks in Staff and Principal engineer roles, this lack of guidance became
	    a point of friction for both them in self-directing their professional development and for me in trying to support
	    their growth. I wrote this book to become a more effective partner for the Staff engineers I work with,
	    and with the hope that it can help others who are chating their path to technical leadership
	    within an organization that's still figuring out how to support them.
	    </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>Are you the right author for this book?</h4>
          <p>
	    The role and career of Staff engineers is a topic that deserves to be written about far more than it is written about!
	    My hope is that this book is useful enough that more folks start to write about it,
	    and hopefully quickly surpass this book with better, more useful books of their own.
	  </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div>
        <div>
          <h4>Will this advice apply to my company?</h4>
          <p>
	    Advice without context should always be taken with a grain of salt!
	    This book is based on more than a dozen interviews with folks operating in Staff engineer, or equivalent, roles,
	    along with my personal experience leading engineering organizations at Calm, Stripe, and Uber.
	    My hope is that this broad perspective will make the book applicable to your experience,
	    although aspects of the advice are undeniably United States-centric and Silicon Valley-centric.

          <p>
	    The vast majority of the writing included in this book is available for free on <a href="https://staffeng.com/">staffeng.com</a>,
	    and will continue to available for free indefinitely. The book's foreword and ending section are not available on the website.

	    that work to increase access for underepresented communities in technology.

            <h2>Bitcoin as a currency</h2>

<p>As of today (2021-02-25), 1 Bitcoin (BTC) is worth 50,863 US Dollars (USD).  In comparison, 5 years ago 1 BTC bought you 416 USD. [1]</p>

<p>Imagine if there was a fictional country on the border of the USA, called "Bitlandia", that uses BTC as its official currency.  Imagine we have a business person in Bitlandia who is selling a product to customers across the border in the USA.  If that business personal was selling their product for 1 BTC:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 years ago, that product would cost someone in the USA 416 USD to buy.</li>
<li>Today, that product would cost someone in the USA 50,863 USD to buy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Spotting this obvious problem affecting businesses in Bitlandia, the <em>Central Bank of Bitlandia</em> steps in, and starts to print currency in order to increase the supply of Bitcoins, and therefore reduce their value as they become less scarce.  Gradually an equilibrium is restored, and our Bitlandia businesses can continue to trade is their BTC currency as it stabilizes.</p>

<p>By design however, this is not possible with BTC, as:</p>

<ol>
<li>There is no "Central Bank" or indeed any central control over the currency.  That's the whole point of having a distributed blockchain, or cryptographic ledger, at the heart of BTC: <em>nobody controls that</em>.</li>
<li>There is no easy way to print large amounts of BTC in a short time.  Mining new Bitcoins is deliberately expensive, in terms of the server computation resources required, and it is getting more expensive all of the time.  Vast amounts of data center resources and electricity are already operating 24/7 around the World mining BTC.</li>
</ol>

<p>So you can now see the situation we have arrived at today: huge inflation in BTC price, and no mechanism in place to reduce that via an increased supply.  The BTC price is getting squeezed up by demand-pull and cost-push inflation, AT THE SAME TIME.</p>

<p><span>"</span>The BTC price is getting squeezed up by demand-pull and cost-push inflation, AT THE SAME TIME.<span>"</span></p>

<p>As a business or as a consumer, using BTC to actually conduct transactions is becoming less and less attractive, when for example you are getting paid your salary in USD or EURO each month, and converting those currencies into BTC is prohibitively expensive at the current price.</p>

<p>Therefore as a currency for actually buying and selling goods and services in, day to day, BTC has failed.</p>

<h2>Bitcoin as an asset</h2>

<p>So the logical thing to do now with BTC is to horde it.  After all, why buy a pizza with something so valuable, when in one week from now you can buy five or ten pizzas for the same BTC amount?  It no longer makes financial sense to spend BTC.</p>

<p>As an investor, if I bought 1 BTC for 416 USD five years ago, I would have an amazing return of 50,863 USD today!</p>

<p>As a speculative asset to buy and to hold, BTC is great <em>for as long as the price goes up</em>.  Like any other investment, its risky.</p>

<p>But please lets stop calling it a currency, its not, its an asset.</p>

<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>

This is a brief introduction to CLOS that says enough for someone who
already knows something about Common Lisp to start using CLOS.

<p>CLOS stands for Common Lisp Object System and is pronounced "see
loss" or "kloss".  (Opinions differ as to which is right.)  CLOS is
the part of Common Lisp that is directly concerned with the usual
features of object-oriented programming, such as classes and methods.
CLOS contains a number of complex and powerful features, but it is not
necessary to understand all of CLOS in order to use it effectively.
The basic parts of CLOS, which will be covered here, include pretty
much everything you'd find in a typical object-oriented language, plus
a few other things, and are sufficient for a wide range of
applications.

</p><p>When using CLOS, we will want to do three things:
</p><ol>
<li>Define classes.
</li><li>Construct objects that are instances of classes.
</li><li>Define methods and generic functions.
</li></ol>

<p>We can do these things using only three new constructs: <tt>defclass</tt>
for defining classes, <tt>make-instance</tt> for constructing instances,
and <tt>defmethod</tt> for defining methods.  <tt>defstruct</tt> can also
be used to define classes, but it is more limited than <tt>defclass</tt>.

</p><p>It's important to know how CLOS fits into the rest of Common
Lisp.  It turns out that all Common Lisp data objects are instances
of classes.  Consequently, you can define methods for all kinds of
existing object types (such as numbers, hash-tables, and vectors);
you don't have to use <tt>defclass</tt> at all before defining
methods.  Moreover, the objects created using <tt>defclass</tt>
and <tt>make-instance</tt> can be used with ordinary Lisp functions,
not only with methods.

</p><p>To find the class of an object, use the function <tt>class-of</tt>.
For example:

<table>

<tbody><tr><th>Expression</th> <th>Value</th></tr>

<tr><td><tt>(class-of 'a)</tt></td>
<td><tt>#&lt;Built-In-Class SYMBOL&gt;</tt></td>

</tr><tr><td><tt>(class-of "a")</tt></td>
<td><tt>#&lt;Built-In-Class STRING&gt;</tt></td>

</tr><tr><td><tt>(class-of 12)</tt></td>
<td><tt>#&lt;Built-In-Class INTEGER&gt;</tt></td>

</tr><tr><td><tt>(class-of '(a b))</tt></td>
<td><tt>#&lt;Built-In-Class CONS&gt;</tt></td>

</tr><tr><td><tt>(class-of '#(a b c))</tt></td>
<td><tt>#&lt;Built-In-Class VECTOR&gt;</tt></td>

</tr></tbody></table>

</p><p>In the rest of this document, we will often specify the syntax
of something in Common Lisp.  Here are the conventions used in these
descriptions.  Upper case names such as <tt>DEFCLASS</tt> are literals,
but upper case is just to distinguish them from syntactic variables:
you do not have to type them in upper case.  Lower case is used for
syntactic variables.  "Thing*" means zero or more occurrences of
thing; "thing+" means one or more.  Curly brackets { and } are used
for grouping, as in {a b}+, which means a b, a b a b, a b a b a b,
etc.

</p><h2><a name="defclass">Defining classes</a></h2>

You define a class with <tt>defclass</tt>:

<pre>(DEFCLASS class-name (superclass-name*)
  (slot-description*)
  class-option*)
</pre>

For simple things, forget about class options.  We will say nothing
more about them here.

<p>A slot-description has the form <tt>(slot-name slot-option*)</tt>,
where each option is a keyword followed by a name, expression, or
whatever.  The most useful slot options are

</p><pre>   :ACCESSOR function-name
   :INITFORM expression
   :INITARG symbol
</pre>

Initargs are usually keywords that correspond to slot names.
For instance, the initarg for the slot <tt>name</tt> would be
<tt>:name</tt>.

<p><tt>Defclass</tt> is similar to <tt>defstruct</tt>, but the syntax
is a bit different, and you have more control over what things are
called.  For instance, consider this definition:

</p><pre>(defstruct person
  (name 'bill)
  (age 10))
</pre>

<tt>Defstruct</tt> would automatically define slots with expressions
to compute default initial values, access-functions like
<tt>person-name</tt> and <tt>person-age</tt> to get and set slot
values, and a <tt>make-person</tt> that took keyword initialization
arguments (initargs) as in

<pre>(make-person :name 'george :age 12)
</pre>

A <tt>defclass</tt> that provided similar access functions, etc, would be:

<pre>(defclass person ()
  ((name :accessor person-name
         :initform 'bill
         :initarg :name)
   (age :accessor person-age
        :initform 10
        :initarg :age)))
</pre>

Note that <tt>defclass</tt> lets you control what things are
called.  For instance, you don't have to call the accessor
<tt>person-name</tt>.  You can call it <tt>name</tt>, or
<tt>object-name</tt>, or pretty much whatever you want.

<p>In general, you should pick names that make sense for a group of
related classes rather than rigidly following the <tt>defstruct</tt>
conventions.

</p><p>You do not have to provide all options for every slot.  Maybe you
don't want it to be possible to initialize a slot when calling
<tt>make-instance</tt> (for which see <a href="#instances">below</a>).
In that case, don't provide an <tt>:initarg</tt>.  Or maybe there
isn't a meaningful default value.  (Perhaps the meaningful values
will always be specified by a subclass.)  In that case, no
<tt>:initform</tt>.

</p><p>Note that classes are objects.  To get the class object from its
name, use 

</p><pre>(FIND-CLASS name)
</pre>

Ordinarily, you won't need to do this.


<h2><a name="instances">Instances</a></h2>

You can make an instance of a class with <tt>make-instance</tt>.  It's
similar to the <tt>make-</tt><var>x</var> functions defined by
<tt>defstruct</tt> but lets you pass the class to instantiate as an
argument:

<pre>(MAKE-INSTANCE class {initarg value}*)
</pre>

Instead of the class object itself, you can use its name.
For example:

<pre>(make-instance 'person :age 100)
</pre>

This person object would have age 100 and name <tt>bill</tt>, the default.

<p>It's often a good idea to define your own constructor functions,
rather than call <tt>make-instance</tt> directly, because you can hide
implementation details and don't have to use keyword parameters for
everything.  For instance, if you wanted the name and age to be
required, positional parameters, rather than keyword parameters, 
you could define

</p><pre>(defun make-person (name age)
  (make-instance 'person :name name :age age))
</pre>

The accessor functions can be used to get and set slot values:

<pre>cl&gt; (setq p1 (make-instance 'person :name 'jill :age 100))
#&lt;person @ #x7bf826&gt; 

cl&gt; (person-name p1)
jill 

cl&gt; (person-age p1)
100 

cl&gt; (setf (person-age p1) 101)
101 

cl&gt; (person-age p1)
101 
</pre>

Note that when you use <tt>defclass</tt>, the instances are 
printed using the <tt>#&lt;...&gt;</tt> notation, rather than as 
<code>#s(person :name jill :age 100)</code>.
But you can change the way instances are printed by defining 
methods on the generic function <tt>print-object</tt>.

<p>Slots can also be accessed by name using 

</p><pre>(SLOT-VALUE instance slot-name)
</pre>

Note that using <tt>slot-value</tt> reveals that the value is
stored in a slot.  Accessors are more abstract since they reveal
less and don't <em>have</em> to access slots.  Since accessors
are functions (indeed, <a href="#generic">generic functions</a>
as described below), they can be (re)defined to obtain their
value some other way.  If you decide that a value should no
longer be stored in a slot, and e.g. computed as needed instead, 
you can change the access function without having to change
all the code that calls it.

<p>Here's an example of <tt>slot-value</tt>:

</p><pre>cl&gt; (slot-value p1 'name)
jill 
 
cl&gt; (setf (slot-value p1 'name) 'jillian)
jillian 

cl&gt; (person-name p1)
jillian 
</pre>

You can find out various things about an instance by calling
<code>describe</code>:

<pre>cl&gt; (describe p1)
#&lt;person @ #x7bf826&gt; is an instance of class 
     #&lt;clos:standard-class person @ #x7ad8ae&gt;:
The following slots have :INSTANCE allocation:
age     101
name    jillian
</pre>

Different implementations of Common Lisp will show such information
in different ways and may also differ in the details of what appears
in the <tt>#&lt;...&gt;</tt> notation.

<h2><a name="slots">Inheritance of slot options</a></h2>

The class above had no superclass.  That's why there was a
"<tt>()</tt>" after "<tt>defclass</tt> <tt>person</tt>".  Actually,
this means it has one superclass: <tt>standard-object</tt>.

<p>When there are superclasses, a subclass can specify a slot that has
already been specified for a superclass.  When this happens, the
information in slot options has to be combined.  For the slot options
listed above, either the option in the subclass overrides the one in
the superclass or there is a union:

</p><pre>   :ACCESSOR  -  union
   :INITARG   -  union
   :INITFORM  -  overrides
</pre>

This is what you should expect.  The subclass can <em>change</em> the
default initial value by overriding the <tt>:initform</tt>, and can 
<em>add to</em> the initargs and accessors.

<p>However, the union for <tt>:accessor</tt> is just a consequence
of how generic functions work.  If they can apply to instances of a
class C, they can also apply to instances of subclasses of C.
(Accessor functions are generic.)

</p><p>Here are some subclasses of <tt>person</tt>.  <tt>Teacher</tt> is
a direct subclass of <tt>person</tt>; <tt>maths-teacher</tt> is a 
direct subclass of <tt>teacher</tt> and an indirect subclass of 
<tt>person</tt> (via <tt>teacher</tt>).

</p><pre>cl&gt; (defclass teacher (person)
       ((subject :accessor teacher-subject
		 :initarg :subject)))
#&lt;clos:standard-class teacher @ #x7cf796&gt; 

cl&gt; (defclass maths-teacher (teacher)
       ((subject :initform "Mathematics")))
#&lt;clos:standard-class maths-teacher @ #x7d94be&gt; 

cl&gt; (setq p2 (make-instance 'maths-teacher
		 :name 'john
		 :age 34))
#&lt;maths-teacher @ #x7dcc66&gt; 

cl&gt; (describe p2)
#&lt;maths-teacher @ #x7dcc66&gt; is an instance of
     class #&lt;clos:standard-class maths-teacher @ #x7d94be&gt;:
 The following slots have :INSTANCE allocation:
 age        34
 name       john
 subject    "Mathematics"
</pre>

Note that classes print like 
<tt>#&lt;clos:standard-class maths-teacher @ #x7d94be&gt;</tt>.
The <tt>#&lt;...&gt;</tt> notation usually has the form

<pre>   #&lt;class-of-the-object ... more information ...&gt;
</pre>

So an instance of maths-teacher prints as <tt>#&lt;maths-teacher ...&gt;</tt>.
The notation for the classes above indicates that the classes are instances
of the class <tt>standard-class</tt>.  <tt>Defclass</tt> defines standard
classes; <tt>defstruct</tt> defines structure classes.

<p>Since classes are objects, they are too are instances of classes.
A class, such as <tt>standard-class</tt>, that has classes as its
instances is called a <em>metaclass</em>.

</p><h2><a name="m-inherit">Multiple inheritance</a></h2>

First, some terminology.  When defining a class C using <tt>defclass</tt>,
the superclasses listed in the definition of C are the <em>direct
superclasses</em> of C.  We can also consider the superclasses of
the direct superclasses, the superclasses of those superclasses,
and so on.  These are the <em>indirect superclasses</em> of C.
So in the examples above <tt>teacher</tt> is a direct superclass
of <tt>math…</tt></div>

Along the way, Julie became the first woman to paddle trans-Atlantic from mainland to mainland.<br></p><p>The days were long, at times rolling on wind-driven waves that could reach as high as a two-storey building, and at other times drifting on flat calm seas beneath the unrelenting sun. It gave them plenty of time to get up close with the ocean’s inhabitants, and also to ponder the challenges of monitoring the farthest reaches of the world where human eyes rarely look but are nevertheless well within the range of anthropogenic environmental damage.</p><p>“That’s really when the idea for Open Ocean Robotics started to form,” Angus says of the adventure that spawned her 2008 memoir, <em>Rowboat in a Hurricane</em>, and 10 years later the Victoria-based company she co-founded with Colin, her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The company designs and builds autonomous boats powered by the wind and sun. The crewless vessels can be loaded with sensors and cameras for monitoring and harnessing an array of data, from ocean currents, waves, and water temperature to marine mammal vocalizations, illegal fishing, and oil spills.&nbsp;</p><p>Angus hopes Open Ocean Robotics technology will be a game-changer in the world of ocean research and monitoring: their boats, able to transit the seas uninterrupted for six months or more at a stretch, could gather data from the remotest reaches of the world’s oceans, which have so far been logistically difficult and expensive to study. What’s more, they will be much cheaper and more environmentally friendly to operate than conventional crewed, fossil fuel-powered research boats.<br></p><p>These are busy times for Open Ocean Robotics, which is based at the Vancouver Island Technology Park several kilometres from the tideline. Angel investment, government grants, and a trickle of revenues have sustained the company so far, as it refines its technology and searches for that elusive home-run market.<br></p><p>The Victoria startup could be one of the bright lights in an ecosystem of businesses and organizations that the South Island Prosperity Partnership (SIPP)—in partnership with the City of Victoria and the Association of BC Marine Industries—hopes to mould into a cluster of ocean innovation and enterprise on Victoria’s Inner Harbour worthy of the world stage that has been dubbed COAST—the Centre for Ocean Applied Sustainable Technologies&nbsp;<br></p><p>If this seed comes to fruition, in 10 years’ time there will be dozens of new ocean-based companies clustered around co-working spaces and shared technology-testing facilities. Innovators and entrepreneurs might be swapping ideas over mid-morning espressos, and in the afternoon talking investment and business growth with venture fund managers who love ocean tech. And, being located in Victoria, there will probably be a yoga studio, health food café, and espresso bar.&nbsp;<br></p><p>According to Angus, despite its oceanside setting, having a university with globally recognized oceanography expertise, and a wealth of ocean tech companies, Victoria has never thought of itself as a true maritime city.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>“Even though Open Ocean Robotics is local, we’re a global company and we need a hub to help build connections and grow,” Angus told Capital Daily at the end of day packed with virtual meetings. “We could really benefit from partnerships with other smaller companies, especially when you’re introducing new technology like we are, and also with larger companies that can drive innovation and help us reach markets that would be hard to do individually.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If the dream seems clear, the means of getting there will require the same sort of perseverance and pluck that have calloused the hands of these two athletes on their numerous human-powered adventures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><h3>From napkin to network<br></h3><p>What started as a SIPP working group discussion on the back of a napkin early in 2020, as the coronavirus pandemic sent the economy into hibernation, has become one of the organization’s flagship projects, according to Emilie de Rosenroll, CEO of the prosperity partnership.&nbsp;</p><p>BC’s diverse ocean sector includes transportation giants like Seaspan and global marine and aviation engineering specialist Babcock Canada. Aside from Open Ocean Robotics, there are more than 100 firms in the ocean science and technology space, like Jasco Applied Sciences, a specialist in acoustic marine monitoring and other ocean impact assessment work, microplastics monitoring startup Ocean Diagnostics, and Nanaimo’s Seamor Marine whose remote-operated vehicles (ROVs) are deployed worldwide for underwater pipe inspection, filming, and other applications. <br></p><p>Victoria is also a world leader in ocean data collection. Ocean Networks Canada, based on the UVic campus, gathers real-time data from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Arctic oceans. It manages both NEPTUNE (the North East Pacific Time-series Underwater Networked Experiments) observatory—an 840-kilometre-long fibre optic network linking five seafloor stations loaded with sensors for measuring changes in salinity, nutrients, and other ocean properties—and its cousin, VENUS (Victoria Experimental Network Under the Sea), in the Strait of Georgia.<br></p><p>Together, these businesses and organizations directly employ 22,000 workers, sustain another 33,000 jobs, and, in 2019, generated almost $7 billion in economic output. Despite these impressive stats, de Rosenroll thinks the sector is punching below its weight in the global ring. COAST wants to bring businesses together and create a thriving investment and startup ecosystem that will enable the West Coast to take a bigger slice of the global ocean economy, which is expected to grow in value to $3.8 trillion annually by 2030.<br></p><p>Like Julie Angus, who literally sees an ocean of research opportunities for Open Ocean Robotics’ autonomous boat technology, de Rosenroll believes there’s plenty of room to grow BC’s ocean sector by positioning COAST as a world leader in the “blue economy,” a loose term describing the sustainable, conservation-based use of the ocean and its resources.&nbsp;</p><p>“Sustainability is our strength,” de Rosenroll told Capital Daily, “Right now, Canada’s ocean economy is worth $36 billion. There’s no reason we can’t be bigger. What we’ve been missing on the West Coast is the aspiration.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To help get from aspiration to inspiration, Canada is looking to another ocean-facing nation: Norway.<br></p><p>Here’s the challenge: Norway, a country with a population roughly the size of BC, took decades to build a globally recognized ocean economy. That’s now worth an estimated $110 billion, 70% of which is generated by offshore oil and gas. De Rosenroll says Victoria wants to get there much faster, and it won’t have a lucrative fossil fuel industry to lean on.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Right now, COAST has an ocean to cross before it matches Norway’s success; in fact, it’s not much<strong> </strong>more than an idea with a volunteer CEO, Craig Norris, who is juggling the interim position with a full-time job as CEO of the Victoria International Marina. Besides a $100,000 Western Economic Diversification Grant and $20,000 from the City of Victoria to pay consultants to build a business case, neither industry nor the province or feds have made funding commitments. And although COAST hopes to have a physical address at Victoria’s equally aspirational Arts and Innovation District on vacant Rock Bay industrial land, no property has been secured.&nbsp;<br></p><p>The business case, completed in December, sets an ambitious target of creating 1,000 high-value jobs and 50 new companies by 2030. The plan also lays out a roadmap of staged financing to reach that target, starting with an initial $5 million for a co-working space, small venture fund, and startup incubator, leading up to a hoped-for future $160-million investment from government and industry for an ocean tech district on the South Island with more than 100 companies, shared testing facilities and workspaces, accelerator programs, and two venture funds managing $250 million in assets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p><p>“The goal is to enable innovation and collaboration that is hard or impossible to do without a hub like this,” de Rosenroll says.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5d97efece288d82cde97d5f3/603709c45e99f71ef1ab09c5_DSC_4803.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>BC is home to a growing shipping industry. Photo:&nbsp;James MacDonald / Capital Daily</figcaption></figure><h3>‍<br>The Norwegian model<br></h3><p>Alex Rueben, executive director of the BC marine industries association, often thinks about the barriers facing the sector in between Zoom meetings with members from his office in Sidney.&nbsp;</p><p>Diversity and depth of expertise are not the problem; growth and collaboration are. Reuben says 95% of his association’s members are small- and medium-sized enterprises with less than 10 employees, including one- and two-person startups.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It's the common curse of the startup founder: one person wearing many hats, courting investment while juggling R&amp;D, marketing, and day-to-day operations, sometimes to the detriment of all.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s no shortage of BC companies in ocean technology, but at the early stage these companies lack guidance, mentorship, and funding,” Rueben told Capital Daily in a phone interview. “We need a focal point that helps startups take technology from idea to commercialization.”<br></p><p>The template already exists in Atlantic Canada. The Centre for Ocean Ventures and Entrepreneurship (COVE) on the Halifax Harbour is a hub of innovation in marine tourism, energy, transportation, fisheries, and aquaculture, with 54 member companies.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Across Cabot Strait from Nova Scotia, the St. John’s, NL-based Ocean Supercluster is focused on innovation in the extractive ocean industries, such as offshore oil and gas, fisheries, aquaculture, as well as the shipping industry. Since forming in early 2018, the cluster has grown to nearly …</p></div></div>

Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>

<h2 id="step-1-log-in-to-soluble-fusion">Step 1: Log In To Soluble Fusion</h2>
<p>This is fast and simple using your Google or GitHub account:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Open a browser to <a href="https://app.soluble.cloud/">https://app.soluble.cloud</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Click <a href="https://app.soluble.cloud/register">Create Account</a></p>
</li>
<li>Select Google or GitHub indentity providers <em>(let us know if you'd like to see other identity providers)</em></li>
<li>Select your account</li>
<li>Agree to Terms of Service</li>
<li>Done!</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="step-2-install-the-cli">Step 2: Install the CLI</h2>
<p>Follow the instruction to <a href="https://app.soluble.cloud/cli">install the CLI</a> in the sidebar.</p>
<p>There are more <a href="https://docs.soluble.cloud/cli">detailed insructions</a> available in the documentation.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-run-your-first-assessment">Step 3: Run your first assessment</h2>
<p>Enter a directory containing terraform, CloudFormation or Kubernetes manifests and run one of the following:</p>
<pre><code># Terraform
$ soluble tf-scan

# CloudFormation
$ soluble cfn-scan

# Kubernetes
$ soluble k8s-scan

At present the scanners that are available for use are:

For Terraform:

* checkov - `soluble tf-scan checkov`
* tfsec - `soluble tf-scan tfsec`
* terrascan - `soluble tf-scan tfsec`

For CloudFormation:

* cfn-nag - `soluble cfn-scan cfn-nag`
* cfn-python-lint - `soluble cfn-scan cfn-python-lint`
* checkov - `soluble cfn-scan checkov`

For Kubernetes:

* checkov - `soluble k8s-scan checkov`

_Note: If you are interested in seeing other assessment tools, let us know at support@soluble.ai_


To send the results to Soluble Fusion, add the `--upload` flag.  For instance:

</code></pre>
<p>$ soluble tf-scan --upload
...</p>
<pre><code>
The output will include a link to the assessment results.

### Notes

For tools that depend on a language runtime and installation (i.e. checkov, cfn-lint need python runtime) we use a containerized distribution by default. 

If you don't have docker available or prefer to use the already-installed version of the assesment tool, you can add `--tool-path &lt;executable&gt;`.

So to use the locally installed version of checkov:

</code></pre>

<p>soluble tf-scan checkov --tool-path checkov</p>

<p>soluble tf-scan checkov --tool-path /usr/local/bin/checkov
```</p>

<div>
    <main>
            <article>
    
    <div>
                <p>I previously <a href="https://www.johnnunemaker.com/featureflipper-com-why/">wrote about</a> why I was working on <a href="https://www.flippercloud.io/">Flipper Cloud</a>. Since then, <strong>everything has changed</strong>.</p><p>We <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/">bought</a> Speaker Deck back from GitHub. My wife and I had another child. Microsoft <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/2018/06/04/microsoft-to-acquire-github-for-7-5-billion/">acquired</a> GitHub. I <a href="https://twitter.com/jnunemaker/status/1058354977750634496?s=20">left</a> GitHub. I <a href="https://boxoutsports.com/">joined</a> Box Out Sports. <a href="https://orderedlist.com/">Steve</a> and I &nbsp;<a href="https://twitter.com/jnunemaker/status/1331644788232368132?s=20">launched</a> Speaker Deck Pro. It has been a busy two years!</p><p>And I'd be remiss not to mention the biggest change of all – the pandemic.</p><p>All of these things led to Flipper Cloud getting pushed to the side. I mean, it was running and working great. </p><p>We used it on both Box Out and Speaker Deck. But no one else could. Well, save the lucky few who guessed the magic word. Haha!</p><p>Following the <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pro">release</a> of Speaker Deck <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/pro">Pro</a>, Steve and I <strong>knew it was Flipper's turn</strong>. Seeing people give us their hard earned money for Speaker Deck was inspiring. Having a fully functional product for 2 years that no one can pay for is stupid.</p><p>But launching a product is <strong>no easy thing</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-first-hurdle-billing">The First Hurdle: Billing </h2><p>The first thing preventing Flipper from launching was a billing system. Turns out if people can't pay you, you don't make any money. </p><p>Thankfully, Stripe makes that really easy these days – especially with their new-ish <a href="https://stripe.com/billing">billing portal</a>. </p><p>Steve completely rewrote the Box Out billing system in May 2020. And he was fresh off integrating Speaker Deck with Stripe in December 2020. So we were confident we could have something solid in place in a few days.</p><p>Before you can bill though, <strong>you must price</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-second-hurdle-pricing">The Second Hurdle: Pricing</h2><p>More difficult than naming is pricing. Steve and I have always preferred simple pricing. </p><ul><li>Whole numbers like $30 instead of $29.99. </li><li>A few tiers of no-nonsense pricing and you can 🍌 out.</li><li>Limits for tiers based on a value metric. </li><li>General disdain for per seat pricing.</li></ul><p>Simple tiers worked for <a href="http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2010/01/06/live-from-harmony/">Harmony</a>. They worked for <a href="http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2011/02/20/give-yourself-constraints/">Gauges</a>. They are currently working for Box Out and Speaker Deck.</p><h3 id="tiers-and-a-value-metric">Tiers and a value metric</h3><p>We started with this tiered pricing model for Flipper. But the first question was what is the value metric? </p><p>We didn't want to limit <a href="https://www.flippercloud.io/docs#projects">projects</a>, <a href="https://www.flippercloud.io/docs#environments">environments</a> or <a href="https://www.flippercloud.io/docs#features">features</a> in anyway, as doing so could encourage awkward use of the product (like using one project for all your projects). We want the product to always feel smooth.</p><p>Additionally, we've noticed the more developers you have using feature flags, the more valuable they become. Ding! We saw this during our time at GitHub. Value metric chosen – number of developers.</p><p>So we started with 3 plans based on the number of developers (value metric):</p><ul><li>$50 - 2 developers</li><li>$200 - 10 developers</li><li>$400 - 20 developers</li></ul><h3 id="but-it-didn-t-feel-right">But it didn't feel right</h3><p>The problem with this was $0 (open source) to $50 is a big leap. So was $50 to $200 and $200 to $400 for that matter. </p><p>For the same reasons we didn't want to limit features or projects, we didn't want customers to avoid adding a developer because it would tip them into a much larger plan. </p><ul><li>Our goal isn't to become a 🦄. Been there, done that.</li><li>Our goal isn't to squeeze as much 💰 as we can from our customers. </li><li>Our goal is <strong>to provide value to customers</strong> that makes it <strong>worth it for them</strong> to pay us and <strong>worth it for us</strong> to do so. That's it.</li></ul><h3 id="per-seat-really">Per seat... really?</h3><p>We brainstormed for a while and decided per seat pricing actually makes a lot of sense for Flipper. Shocking. I never thought I'd read those words written from my weak little programmer fingers 👐.</p><p>The value metric is number of developers. More developers for the customer is likely tied very closely to more revenue or funding. As the customer grows, we grow with them. If they shrink, the value they get from us and the cost to them does as well. </p><p><strong>It just made sense</strong>.</p><ul><li> Per seat pricing <strong>avoids the big jumps</strong> from tier to tier.</li><li> Per seat pricing <strong>ties the value to the cost</strong> for the customer.</li></ul><h3 id="market-research">Market Research </h3><p>Now the question was, how much per seat? We looked around at the market – <a href="https://launchdarkly.com/">Launch Darkly</a>, <a href="https://split.io/">Split</a>, <a href="https://rollout.io/">Rollout</a>, <a href="https://configcat.com/">Configcat</a>, <a href="https://prefab.cloud/">Prefab</a>, <a href="https://ajustee.com/">Ajustee</a>, <a href="https://unleash-hosted.com/">Unleash</a> and <a href="https://switchover.io/">Switchover</a> to name a few.</p><p>The common theme was <strong>$10 - $90 per seat</strong>. The products on the higher end of that range were typically also tied to MAU (monthly active users aka actors in Flipper's terms). </p><p>Tying to MAU makes a lot of sense as well. If you have more actors that you are checking flags for, you likely are receiving more value by using flags. We don't currently track MAU's and thus don't provide any analytics (aka value) on that data. </p><p>We only charge for the value we provide. Since we don't provide analytics yet, there was no reason to try to price in the upper range. </p><p>Additionally, we want <strong>using</strong> Flipper Cloud to <strong>be a no brainer</strong>, especially for those <strong>already using open source Flipper</strong>.</p><p>We oscillated between $10 to $30 per seat and finally just split the difference – <strong>$20 per seat</strong>. I'm pretty happy with where we ended up. </p><figure><img src="https://www.johnnunemaker.com/content/images/2021/02/pricing.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.johnnunemaker.com/content/images/size/w600/2021/02/pricing.png 600w, https://www.johnnunemaker.com/content/images/2021/02/pricing.png 923w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>But no one will buy, if they don't <strong>trust</strong> <strong>you</strong>.</p><h2 id="the-third-hurdle-trust">The Third Hurdle: Trust</h2><p>In talking with people about Flipper Cloud, the first thing that always came up was: ...<strong>but what happens if you are down</strong>, will my app be down?</p><p>This is a great problem! Its not a you don't provide any value problem. Or a you are too expensive problem. </p><p>This is an <strong>I want to use Flipper Cloud, </strong>but I want to know<strong> it won't hurt me</strong> problem. Making software not hurt you is a specialty of ours.</p><p>Before I answer the <em>what happens if you are down question</em>, let's dive into some background.</p><h3 id="one-feature-check-one-api-request">One Feature Check, One API Request</h3><p>The very first way that the <code>Flipper::Cloud</code> client <em>could</em> work is every time a feature check happens, it makes a request to the Flipper Cloud API to say "hey is this feature enabled for this actor?". </p><ul><li>If we were unavailable, your app would be unavailable. </li><li>If we were available and you were doing more than a single feature check, your app would be slow. Real slow.</li></ul><p>Nope. No way that would ever work. I worked on GitHub.com, one of the most trafficked sites in the world, for nearly 7 years. </p><p>The majority of my time at GitHub was focused on availability and resiliency. I would never ship something like the aforementioned to the world. That is just asking to tick customers off.</p><h3 id="one-request-in-your-app-one-api-request">One Request in Your App, One API Request</h3><p>The great thing about (open source) Flipper is that it is designed to be as performant as you need. It can <a href="http://www.railstips.org/blog/archives/2016/12/08/flipper-preloading/">preload all the data</a> required to check a feature for any actor, typically in one or two network calls.</p><p>With <a href="https://github.com/jnunemaker/flipper/blob/f398a745b320ef081d9618b58006d6dfb4b7dde6/docs/Optimization.md#memoizing-middleware">a single middleware</a> addition, Flipper can preload all feature data for a request/job in your application. This means you can say "hey is this feature enabled for this actor?" as many times as you want on the page and no additional API requests will be issued. </p><ul><li>If we were unavailable, your app would be unavailable.</li><li>If we were available, no matter how fast your application was, it would always have a base response time of however long it takes for your app to request feature data from our API.</li></ul><p>Nope. No way. This would make a 1 to 1 correlation between your traffic and our API traffic. I'm never a fan of tying things together like that. </p><p>My goal is always <strong>to</strong> <strong>make things as constant as possible regardless of throughput</strong>. </p><h3 id="one-api-request-per-n-seconds-per-thread-or-process-">One API Request per N seconds per thread (or process)</h3><p>The next step up in efficiency was to move the request on every page load to one request every N seconds per process per thread. This is far from ideal, but <strong>we actually used it</strong> on Box Out and Speaker Deck for more than a year.</p><p>Flipper is built on adapters. And the adapters are very composable/layerable. </p><p>At <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, we used a MySQL adapter, wrapped by a Memcached adapter. This meant all reads first went to memcached and then only to mysql if the cache wasn't populated.</p><p><a href="https://gitlab.com/">GitLab</a> does something similar.

<p>NASA offers a data product called a Vegetation Index. This can be used to track how green the Earth is.</p>







<p>Although many are familiar with recent global greening, I prefer to always check the source data. And so I downloaded all of their available 16-day-increment data from 2000 to 2021. Here’s my result:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="1420" data-permalink="https://phzoe.com/veg/" data-orig-file="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png" data-orig-size="740,620" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="veg" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=740" src="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=740" alt="" srcset="https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png 740w, https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=150 150w, https://phzoe.files.wordpress.com/2021/02/veg.png?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px"></figure></div>



<pre><code>0.0936 --&gt; 0.1029 is +9.94%</code></pre>



<p>10% global greening in 20 years! We are incredibly fortunate!</p>



<p>I just wish everyone felt that way. But you know not everyone does. To the extent that humans enhance global greening is precisely what social parasites want to tax and regulate. No good deed goes unpunished.</p>



<p>Anyway, Enjoy 🙂 -Zoe</p>



<p>P. S. The Earth is ~29% land. A Veg Index of ~0.29 would mean all covered land is heavy vegetation. </p>

					<p>It was in 2016 when the trike design has developed its first shapes and got a wider recognition. Artūras Mikalauskas – the founder – found a design student –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/43993905/AKO-inverse-trike" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i>Lukas Avėnas</i></a> – who was crazy enough to jump on such a venture. With the mentorship &amp; ideology suggestions from Artūras, they have successfully created the&nbsp;<em><a href="https://lukasavenas.com/ako-inverse-trike" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AKO Trike concept design</a></em>. Later that year, Lukas won the Young Designers Award for his design. Since then, Artūras initiated the build of a first concept-proof prototype.</p>

<div>
<p><span>It’s one thing for a few individuals to automate a few test cases and run them at scheduled intervals. It’s quite another for an agile team to run hundreds of tests in the continuous integration (CI) server at development milestones.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>To move from the former to the latter, quality assurance leaders need tools to help them scale testing operations to effectively manage the difficulty of growing tools, people, and processes.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Testim Announces TestOps</span></h2>
<p><span>TestOps is a set of capabilities designed to help managers and quality-oriented development teams efficiently and effectively scale their automation initiatives. TestOps helps users establish and maintain control, improve organization and management, and gain insights to unjumble the growing complexity.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span>Control&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Leaders of quality initiatives should set guiding principles to optimize test architecture and component reuse to minimize maintenance. They should establish policies and controls to ensure their tests meet the same high standards as their code.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Features:&nbsp;</span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Branching with conflict resolution (improved) – </b><span>Synchronize your test branches with your application code, see diffs, resolve conflicts, and cherrypick what to merge. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/merging-branches"><span>Docs</span></a><b></b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Read-only master branch (new) – </b><span>Protect the test master branch from unauthorized changes. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/read-only"><span>Docs</span></a><b></b></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Pull requests with approvers (new) – </b><span>Users can create tests and submit changes as pull requests to be reviewed by SMEs. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/pull-requests"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><b><i>The Read-Only master helps us prevent slip-ups, and it makes us much more vigilant of any changes we make. Having the PRs within testim makes sure that we don’t forget to merge a branch after merging the git side.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>– </i></b><span>Savanna Goodman, QA Automation Engineer at IntSights</span></p></blockquote>
<h2><span>Management</span></h2>
<p><span>As you grow your application and your team, your test suites also swell. A robust classification system can help users find the tests they need faster, reduce switching costs, and improving productivity. Management includes understanding which tests are trusted and CI-ready and which are temperamental and cause unnecessary heartburn. Management at scale should also consist of tools to help balance workload and prevent overlap.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Features:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Test library (new)</b><span> – In addition to suites and labels, leaders can organize tests in folders by user type, feature, and more—improving coordination. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/test-list"><span>Docs</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Shared step library (new)</b><span> – Reusable, shared steps, and groups have a new library, providing quick access in the visual editor to facilitate reuse and improve test architecture. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/shared-steps-library"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Test Status (new)</b><span> – Set status on tests to alter treatment in the CI server, for instance, quarantine flaky tests from failing builds. It helps build trust that tests are accurate when they run in the CI. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/test-status"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Test Owner (new)</b><span> – Assign test ownership to yourself or a team member to prevent duplication of effort, distribute workload, or show responsibility. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/test-owner"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p><b><i>We use a test status of “draft” to indicate tests are a work in progress or awaiting peer review. We can now quickly identify where we need to focus our attention.</i></b></p>
<p><i><span>– Erin Hess, Software Quality Lead, Duzy</span></i></p></blockquote>
<h2><span>Insights</span></h2>
<p><span>To grow your test automation project in the right direction, you need insights from your testing data. You’ll need to understand the current state and trend of quality and use data to inform team progress or process improvement areas.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3><span>Features:</span></h3>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Failure trends (existing)</b><span> – Identify troublesome tests and recurring failure types and trends over time to guide process improvement measures. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/tag-remote-runs-failures#suggested-failure-tags"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Duplication levels (new)</b><span> – Understand where test steps are duplicated across tests, refactor them, and replace them with manageable shared groups that reduce ongoing maintenance. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/auto-grouping2"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
<li aria-level="1"><b>Management reports enhancements (coming soon)</b><span> – Create and send custom reports to management to demonstrate team and quality status and progress towards goals. </span><a href="https://help.testim.io/docs/managerial-reports"><span>Docs</span></a></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Modern agile development teams comprise software engineers, quality engineers, devops engineers, and product owners. For many of them, quality is a teamwide responsibility. Yet, tools to manage quality processes efficiently are mostly absent. The TestOps capabilities announced today help fill that gap. They enable teams to scale their testing operations efficiently—with control, management, and insights. This announcement is just the start, as we plan to expand our TestOps capabilities and help more customers build quality software faster.&nbsp; </span><a href="https://www.testim.io/testops"><span>Read more</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<p>While Elon Musk was updating about the Starlink internet speed increase via a tweet last evening, a follower presented the idea of a mini portable Starlink dish, and Musk affirmed that it is a good idea.</p>



<p>SpaceX is currently working on system upgrades that might result in higher Starlink internet speeds at times. In response to a question about when Starlink will be available in the Bay Area, “Probably mid-year (2021), but Starlink is really meant for those who are least served. Bay usually has great Internet,” SpaceX CEO <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/elon-musk/">Elon Musk</a> said.</p>



<p>The idea of an even more compact, probably sub-1ft diameter dish is praised by Elon Musk, and looking at his past record, he might actually make this happen. A smaller dish that is easier to carry during remote excursions with chargeable batteries could be a perfect travel companion.</p>



<figure></figure>



<div><figure><a href="https://evannex.com/?ref=Iqtidar_TeslaOracle_EVANNEX_Banner" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer"><amp-img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" layout="intrinsic" i-amphtml-layout="intrinsic"><img src="https://www.teslaoracle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/evannex_googlead_300x250.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="250" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyBoZWlnaHQ9JzI1MCcgd2lkdGg9JzMwMCcgeG1sbnM9J2h0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnJyB2ZXJzaW9uPScxLjEnLz4="></amp-img></a><figcaption>– Sponsored –</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/cybertruck/">Tesla Cybertruck</a> going to production later this year, many Starlink customers who will own the Cybertruck will want to take the mini dish with them on their journeys. Since the Cybertruck will have power outlets and a huge battery pack inside, powering a small Starlink dish for long periods of time will not be an issue for this electric pickup truck.</p>



<p>We asked a recent <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/starlink/">Starlink</a> beta customer about how much internet speeds he is getting with his new dish installed on the roof of his home. Brian is getting from min 40 Mbps to max 177 Mbps with Starlink depending on the hour of the day or night. He is getting an average speed of 81 Mbps, not so bad. The silver lining is that with time, the speeds are only going to get better and better.</p>

<p>For internet users on Gbps rated connections, this speed might look slow but there is a large number of users even in the developed world who have a 1 – 5 Mbps connection at home. For example, Christ T. Bridgwater from England, Great Britain just upgraded to Starlink from a legacy 900 kbps connection, just imagine his experience coming from such low-speed internet, he says:</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>I’m on beta – just thank you. 11 years waiting for a connection which is better than 900kbps 🙂 thank you</p><cite>Chrs T. Bridgwater. England, GB</cite></blockquote></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/topic/spacex/">SpaceX</a> is building the Starlink satellite constellation in the lower earth orbit (LEO). 60 more Starlinks were deployed last week but sadly the <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/2021/02/16/spacex-falcon-9-lost-landing-starlink-launch/">Falcon 9 missed the landing this time</a> and fell into the ocean. Events like these won’t hinder the development of the next-gen internet service provider, exciting times ahead.</p>



<p>SpaceX is targeting Sunday 28 Feb for the next <a href="https://www.teslaoracle.com/tag/starlink/">Starlink</a> launch, so stay tuned for future Starlink news and updates, follow us on:<br><a href="https://news.google.com/publications/CAAqBwgKMOarmgswgLayAw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google News</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://flipboard.com/@TeslaOracle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Flipboard</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href="https://feedly.com/i/subscription/feed%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.teslaoracle.com%2Ffeed%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RSS (Feedly)</a>.</p>

<p>On December 24, 2020, the Delhi high court conducted its first hearing for the ongoing case against Alexandra Elbakyan’s website Sci-Hub, an online repository of academic literature that allows users free access to its contents.</p>
<p>It is not unknown that websites like Sci-Hub and Libgen (portmanteau of ‘Library Genesis’) are important for scholars and students alike in India who can’t afford individual subscriptions to academic journals.</p>


<p>However, academic publishers Elsevier Ltd., Wiley Pvt. Ltd. and the American Chemical Society sued Sci-Hub and Libgen for copyright infringement in India and asked for the country’s IT ministry to block access to these sites.</p>
<p>The court’s next hearing is scheduled for February 23. In an exclusive interview to <em>The Wire Science</em>, <strong>Alexandra Elbakyan</strong> spoke of her own days in college, where she said she first felt the need for a tool like Sci-Hub, the legal issues between Elsevier and Sci-Hub around the world, and the tension between piracy and sharing.</p>
<p><em>Excerpts from the interview are presented below, with a few minor edits for style.</em></p>
<p><strong>Could you tell me about your own college experience at Satbayev University, Kazakhstan, in the absence of portals like Sci-Hub? Were there specific difficulties you faced that led to the conception of Sci-Hub?</strong></p>
<p>I first stumbled upon academic paywalls when I was in my final year of study. I studied information technologies, and specialised in infosecurity. Since middle school I was interested in neuroscience, too, so I wanted to combine both fields in my final year project. I started to work on brain-machine interfaces and set up a task to develop a system that can use brainwaves as passwords, in the same way you can use your fingerprint to unlock a computer.</p>
<p>I started searching for information and that was when I first learned that academic journals exist at all. Today, there are people who use Sci-Hub while they study in school, but I was quite old when I started with research.</p>
<p>So, I located the articles that were interesting for my topic on websites such as IEEE or ScienceDirect and almost all of them were paywalled. I was not concerned. For a long time since school, I was using various technologies which made science movies, books and software freely available. So I was sure there was some website to download academic articles for free.</p>
<p>I googled and googled but found nothing! Then I was quite surprised and frustrated, but after a long search I found some forums such as passfans or myescience where people shared passwords to access university libraries. Using these passwords, I was able to enter universities that had subscriptions to these journals and download articles for free.</p>
<p>Then I got an idea to develop a software program that people can use to download academic articles automatically. The design I imagined then was quite different from Sci-Hub, but it was the same idea. I tried discussing it on forums but it did not cause a lot of interest, and I forgot about it for a while. I graduated from university and travelled abroad. I developed Sci-Hub two years later.</p>
<p><strong>Despite a series of lawsuits for copyright infringement, Sci-Hub is not widely thought of as a pirate, and has found acceptance among scholars. What would you say about this?</strong></p>
<p>Today, most scientists view the academic publishing system as fundamentally unjust and exploitative. The problem is that publishers are not actual creators of these works, scientists are – they do all the work, and academic publishers simply use their position of power in the Republic of Science to extract unjust profits. Sci-Hub does not enable piracy where creative people are deprived of the reward they deserve. It is a very different thing.</p>
<p>What does one mean by the word ‘piracy’? Only after several years was I able to comprehend how some people use this word in a bad sense. Most scientists do not care about the legal status at all. They want to do science, and they need to access academic literature to do it, and these legal things — they are in a different reality that scholars do not belong to at all, another planet or a different universe.</p>
<p><ins>Also read: <a href="https://science.thewire.in/science/how-scihub-is-at-the-forefront-of-the-quest-to-frame-scientific-knowledge-as-public-good/">How Sci-Hub Is at the Forefront of the Quest to Frame Scientific Knowledge as Public Good</a></ins></p>
<p><strong>How much do authors earn from the money paid to cross an academic publisher’s paywall?&nbsp;Can you talk about how publishers exercise their power?</strong></p>
<p>The careers of researchers depend on journal publications. To receive funding or secure positions at the university, a scientist must have publications in ‘high-impact’ academic journals. Most of these journals today belong to corporations like Elsevier, Wiley and Springer-Nature.</p>
<p>Researchers do the actual work: they invent the hypothesis, do the experiments and write the articles describing the results of these experiments. Then they publish this article in an academic journal. They cannot simply put this article online on their blog: to be recognised as research work, it must be published in a respectable peer-reviewed journal. So they send their articles to publishers like Elsevier, Wiley or Springer.</p>
<p>Publishers send articles they have received to other scientists for peer-review. Reviewers give their opinion on whether the work should be accepted in a journal or not, or if some additional work must be done. Based on these reviews, the article is published or rejected.</p>
<p>Both reviewers and scientists work for free. They do not earn any compensation from the academic publisher. Here, academic publishers work as organisers of the academic community, but not as creators. The work of the academic publisher is organisational and not creative.</p>
<p><strong>And yet, Elsevier Ltd. has sued Sci-Hub in the US, Sweden, Belgium and France, lobbied for a block in Russia, and now it has filed a lawsuit in India. It’s often the same group of publishers that takes action against Sci-Hub: Elsevier, Springer Nature, Wiley, the American Chemical Society. Why do you think it is this group?</strong></p>
<p>Because most academic works and the most popular works in Sci-Hub’s database are from these publishers, and Elsevier is the leading one in numbers. These companies form an oligopoly that currently controls all academic communication. These publishers alone perhaps control the majority of science. They are key players.</p>
<p>Sci-Hub’s view is that science should not be controlled by a few big companies but it should be a dynamic network of learned societies.</p>
<p><strong>In the last hearing on January 6, 2021, the Delhi High Court deemed the case to be of public importance, and allowed scholars to register their concerns with the court. You claimed many Twitter users were tweeting at the Sci-Hub account and you were archiving these tweets. But on January 8, Twitter suspended Sci-Hub’s account. Can you tell me the extent to which Twitter’s move affected your ability to defend your case?</strong></p>
<p>On Sci-Hub’s Twitter account, anyone could see right away that no researcher today supports what publishers do and everyone thinks that academic research should be free to access. It was very obvious and visible on the Sci-Hub account, and people who wanted to support Sci-Hub had a place to do it.</p>
<p>Now of course after the Sci-Hub account has been banned there are fewer people voicing their opinions about Sci-Hub, because the discussion platform is gone, so there are fewer supportive comments, and the support of Sci-Hub is not as obvious as it has previously been. However, in my view it will not seriously affect the ability to defend the current case in India.</p>
<p><ins>Also read: <a href="https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/sci-hub-case-india-academic-publishing-access-alexandra-elbakyan-twitter-account-suspension/">Curious Timing: As Sci-Hub Case Takes off in India, Twitter Suspends Its Account</a></ins></p>
<p><strong>The number of cases against you have shot up in the last five years. Would you be comfortable about sharing how this has affected you as an individual?</strong></p>
<p>Researchers depend on Sci-Hub and I feel a need to support its users, I cannot simply abandon them. I love academic literature and knowledge, and I love working on Sci-Hub. Sci-Hub is nine years old already and it has become a fundamental part of my life. I never thought about abandoning Sci-Hub actually. I have a dream to make academic literature free and I work on it consistently.</p>
<p>Currently the lawsuits have not targeted or affected me directly. I was ordered to pay Elsevier 15 million dollars in damages but I am able to ignore a United States order right now. But what might happen in the future?</p>
<p><strong>What would you say to those who argue that it is naïve to expect a system of unhindered exchange of information to thrive, and that publishing houses have a right over the knowledge that they publish?</strong></p>
<p>What is naive and dangerous is to expect science to thrive when information exchange is hindered. And as I said before, science should not be controlled by a few big corporations. That is detrimental to science.</p>

		<p>Our mission is to give everyone in the world <strong>computer superpowers</strong>. We build powerful yet approachable tools &amp; platforms for developers, students, and educators.</p>
<p>We see a new generation of hackers and entrepreneurs rising to seize the power of computers and the internet to create software that empowers them and their communities. They refuse to be programmed by the software priesthood that wants them to endlessly consume ads. Instead, they build a more free society where computers work for and under human users, not the other way around. The world we're describing is coming, and we exist to accelerate the shift. <a href="https://repl.it/careers">Join us</a>! </p>
<p><img src="https://repl.art/replit.png" alt="art"></p>
<p>Replit is a multiplayer computing environment that makes it <a href="https://blog.replit.com/internet-of-fun">fun</a> to learn how to code, build, and <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share">share apps</a> with other people. You can create a cloud-powered computer in milliseconds -- we call them "repls" -- and you can create as many of them as you'd like, all for free. Repls come with storage for your code and files, a <a href="https://blog.repl.it/database">database</a> for your data, and a <a href="https://repl.it/site/multiplayer">multiplayer editor</a> &amp; console to code with your friends. For <a href="https://repl.it/pricing">$7/month</a>, you'll get more powerful machines and, with one-click, make them <a href="https://blog.repl.it/alwayson">run forever</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="db"></p>
<p>When you invite a friend to your repl, you can see them in your editor and talk to them <a href="https://blog.repl.it/annotations-for-education">right in your code</a>. You can make <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/http-servers">web</a>, <a href="https://blog.repl.it/native-graphics-love">desktop</a>, and even command-line apps. Replit takes care of the entire process of <a href="https://docs.repl.it/repls/web-hosting">publishing and hosting apps</a> so you can focus on your ideas.</p>
<p><img src="https://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Live-Code-Editing.gif?resize=800%2C450&amp;strip=all" alt="multiplayer"></p>
<p>When you've built something you want to share, you can share the <a href="https://blog.replit.com/spotlight">repl URL</a>, and your users can play with your app, react to it, comment on it, and even fork and remix it. Replit gives you a profile to keep and showcase all your apps and repls. You can make <a href="https://repl.it/site/teams">shared team profiles</a> for your class, friends, or company to collaborate on repls.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/spotlight/ios-demo.gif" alt="share"></p>
<p>Because you can make a repl in milliseconds, Replit makes it fun and safe to experiment with ideas. Learning comes naturally as a side effect of playing in the Replit ecosystem.</p>
<p>Millions of people have learned how to code with Replit and built great apps with thousands of happy users. Some have even built businesses and become rich &amp; famous.</p>
<p>Replit's design principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Learnable yet scalable interfaces</strong>: Interfaces today present the same UI to vastly different users, from children to adults, from novices to experts. Our mission demands that we make computing environments more accessible to novices while making it possible to transition to more powerful interfaces. Replit starts with a simple editor and console, which gets learners very far. The UI, however, is adaptable and presents different faces to different users and use-cases.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Infrastructure as legos</strong>: A core part of commanding computer power is to be able to build for the modern internet-connected world. Despite progress in cloud computing, infrastructure remains inaccessible to novices, hobbyists, and educators. We change this by designing simple and scalable components, like cloud-hosted servers accessible right from the repl, storage, databases, etc., that require little configuration and maintenance by the programmer. Coders can then mix and match components to create endless possibilities.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>People-centric technology</strong>: It's more exciting and fun to create and learn with other people. The future demands that computers and the internet have human interconnectedness as a core primitive. From our multiplayer computing protocol to our community spaces for sharing software, we build support for human beings, and we put collaboration right at the heart of our technology.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="series-a">Series A</h2>
<p>As a team, we've always thought about the long-term, and we've grown Replit responsibly. We have so much conviction in our mission and our plan that we're willing to take our time. </p>
<p>Last year, with rapid growth in all aspects of our business, we felt it was a good time to raise a sizeable round to make faster progress our mission. We raised <a href="https://venturebeat.com/2021/02/18/replit-raises-20-million-for-collaborative-browser-based-coding/">$20M in Series A</a> financing led by <a href="https://acapital.com/">A.Capital</a> with strong participation from our seed investors: Andreessen Horowitz, Bloomberg Beta, Y Combinator, and Reach Capital. </p>
<p>Since then, thanks to the new capital and to <a href="https://amasad.me/moad">Engelbartian Bootstrapping</a>, we've accelerated feature development, and there's so much more on the horizon: extra resources for more complex projects, support for any language or package, further dev ops simplifications for novices and pros, business collaboration features, improvements to <a href="https://repl.it/teams-for-education">teacher workflows</a>, high quality content, a game development library, and more breakthroughs in collaborative coding. We're excited to see all the amazing things you build with the tools we provide!</p>
<p>Finally, we're hiring for multiple roles and want to bring on people who share our vision and passion. If you're interested in making computing more accessible while working with a creative and hardworking team building fantastic technology, <a href="https://repl.it/careers">join us</a>!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
      <a href="https://goteleport.com/blog/index.xml"><i></i></a>
      
      

        

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/xss-attacks/intro.png" width="100%" alt="XSS Attacks Introduction"></p>

<p>Cross-site scripting (XSS) is an attack that allows JavaScript from one site to run on another. XSS is interesting not due to the technical difficulty of the attack but rather because it exploits some of the core security mechanisms of web browsers and because of its sheer pervasiveness. Understanding XSS and its mitigations provides substantial insight into how the web works and how sites are safely (and unsafely) isolated from each other.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Initially the web was a collection of static HTML documents that the browser would render for users to view. As the web grew, demands for richer documents grew, which led to the development of JavaScript and cookies: JavaScript to make documents interactive and cookies to allow browsers to save the state of a document.</p>

<p>The advent of these features led to browsers not only rendering HTML documents, but also providing an in-memory representation of the document called the Document Object Model (DOM) as an API to the document for developers. The DOM gave developers a tree-based representation of the HTML tags of a document and also access to cookies to retrieve the state of the document. As time went on, the DOM went from a largely read-only structure to a read-write structure where updating the DOM would lead to re-rendering of the document.</p>

<p>Once documents gained the ability to execute code, browsers needed to define the execution context for JavaScript programs. The policy that was developed is called the Same-Origin policy and is still one of the fundamental security primitives of browser security. Originally, the Same-Origin policy stated that JavaScript within one document can only access its own DOM and the DOMs of other documents with the same origin. Later when <code>XMLHttpRequest</code> (and now <code>Fetch</code>) were added, a modified version of the same origin policy followed. These APIs could issue requests to any origin, they could only read the response to requests from the same origin.</p>

<p>What exactly is an origin? It’s the tuple of protocol, hostname, and port of a document.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">https://www.example.com:443/app
^^^^^   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^^^
Scheme  Host            Port</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 1: Scheme, host, and port of this url is the tuple that composes a browser origin.</em></p>

<p><img src="https://goteleport.com/blog/images/2021/xss-attacks/same-origin.png" width="100%" alt="XSS Attacks Same Origin Diagram"></p>

<p><em>Figure 2: An illustration of the Same-Origin in action. JavaScript running on www.evil.com is unable to access the DOM of www.example.com.</em></p>

<p>The Same-Origin policy has been great in mitigating attacks on static sites as illustrated in Figure (2). However, attacks on dynamically generated sites that accept user input have been quite difficult because the web allows mixing of code and data. Mixing code and data allows attacker-controlled input to execute within the origin of the document.</p>

<p>XSS attacks typically manifest themselves in three broad manners: reflected, stored, and DOM-based.</p>

<p>Reflected and stored XSS attacks are fundamentally the same, as they both rely on malicious input being sent to the backend server and the server (at some point) presenting that input to the user. Reflected XSS occurs immediately, usually in the form of a maliciously crafted link by the attacker that the victim then clicks. Stored XSS occurs when the attacker uploads malicious input that is later displayed to the user. DOM-based attacks are different in that they occur purely client-side and involve malicious input manipulating the DOM.</p>

<p>If you didn’t fully grasp the forms above, don’t worry, they’ll make more sense as we cover some examples below.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<h3 id="reflected-xss-attacks">Reflected XSS Attacks</h3>

<p>Below you can see a simple Go-based web application that “reflects” its input (even if it’s a malicious script) back to the user. You can run this application by saving it in a file called <code>xss1.go</code> and then typing <code>go run xss1.go</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"log"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>

<p>To see the XSS attack navigate to the vulnerable URL below.</p>

<p>Take a look at the source, and you’ll see the server returned a document that looks something like the one in Figure (4). Note how the mixing of code and data allowed this attack to occur.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html">&lt;<span>html</span>&gt;

    &lt;<span>script</span>&gt;<span>alert</span>(<span>1</span>)&lt;/<span>script</span>&gt;

<p>Admittedly, this may seem like a somewhat contrived example because XSS protection was explicitly disabled. However this form of XSS protection has always been heuristic-based with a variety of workarounds for different browsers. It was disabled to create simple cross-browser examples that illustrate the core concepts of XSS attacks. Furthermore, some browsers are removing these heuristic-based XSS protections, for <a href="https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5021976655560704">example if you are running Chrome 78 or above</a>, you don’t need to include the <code>w.Header().Set("X-XSS-Protection", "0")</code> line for this attack to work.</p>

<h3 id="stored-xss-attacks">Stored XSS Attacks</h3>

<p>Stored XSS attacks are fundamentally similar to reflected attacks, the main difference being the attack payload comes from a datastore instead of directly from the input. For example, an attacker will upload the payload to the web application which will then be shown to every logged in user.</p>

<p>Below is a simple chat application written in Go that illustrates a stored XSS attack. You can run this application by saving it in a file called <code>xss2.go</code> and then typing <code>go run xss2.go</code>.</p>

<p><em>Figure 5: An example of a web application with a stored XSS attack in it.</em></p>

<p>To see the XSS attack, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080</code> and type in the message <code>&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The attack occurs in two phases. First, the attack payload is saved to the datastore in the <code>storeHandler</code> function. Next, when the page is rendered in <code>viewHandler</code>, the attack payload is directly added to the output.</p>

<p>Once again, the culprit is the allowing of mixing of data and code. The browser has no way to tell if the payload was intentional or malicious.</p>

<h3 id="dom-based-xss-attacks">DOM-Based XSS Attacks</h3>

<p>DOM-based XSS attacks don’t involve the backend and occur purely client-side. They’re also quite interesting because modern web applications are moving logic to the client. DOM- based XSS attacks occur when user input is allowed to directly manipulate the DOM in unsafe ways. The good news for attackers is that the DOM has a wide variety of ways it can be abused, the most popular being <code>innerHTML</code> and <code>document.write</code>.</p>

<p>Below is an example of a web application that serves static content. It’s fundamentally the same as the reflected XSS example, but here the attack will occur entirely client- side. You can run this application by saving it in a file called <code>xss3.go</code> and then typing <code>go run xss3.go</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>package</span> <span>main</span>

<span>import</span> (
    <span>"fmt"</span>
    <span>"log"</span>
    <span>"net/http"</span>
)

<span>const</span> <span>content</span> = <span>`
</span><span>
</span><span>&lt;html&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;head&gt;
</span><span>       &lt;script&gt;
</span><span>          window.onload = function() {
</span><span>             var params = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
</span><span>             p = document.getElementById("content")
</span><span>             p.innerHTML = params.get("message")
</span><span>	     };
</span><span>       &lt;/script&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;/head&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;body&gt;
</span><span>       &lt;p id="content"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</span><span>   &lt;/body&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/html&gt;
</span><span>`</span>

<span>func</span> <span>handler</span>(<span>w</span> <span>http</span>.<span>ResponseWriter</span>, <span>r</span> <span>*</span><span>http</span>.<span>Request</span>) {

    <span>log</span>.<span>Fatal</span>(<span>http</span>.<span>ListenAndServe</span>(<span>"127.0.0.1:8080"</span>, <span>nil</span>))
}
</code></pre></div>
<p><em>Figure 6: An example of a web application with a DOM-based XSS attack in it.</em></p>

<p>To see this attack, navigate to <code>http://localhost:8080/?message="&lt;img src=1 onerror=alert(1);/&gt;"</code>. Note that the attack vector is slightly different, and the XSS sink <code>innerHTML</code> won’t execute a script directly; however, it will add HTML elements which will then execute JavaScript. In the example given, an image element is added that executes JavaScript when an error occurs. The error always occurs because the attacker conveniently always provides an invalid source.</p>

<p>If you want to directly add a script element, you’ll have to use a different XSS sink. As we mentioned, you’re in luck because the DOM provides a wide variety of dangerous sinks. Replace the script element in Figure (6) with the script element in Figure (7) and navigate to the following URL <code>http://localhost:8080/?message="&lt;script&gt;alert(1);&lt;/script&gt;"</code>. This attack works because <code>document.write</code> accepts script elements directly.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go">&lt;<span>script</span>&gt;
   <span>window</span>.<span>onload</span> = <span>function</span>() {

      <span>document</span>.<span>open</span>();
      <span>document</span>.<span>write</span>(<span>params</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>"message"</span>));
      <span>document</span>.close();
   };
&lt;<span>/</span><span>script</span>&gt;

<p>With Zeitwerk, you can streamline your programming knowing that classes and modules are available everywhere.</p>

<h2>What are Code Loaders?</h2>

<p>Code loaders let developers define <code>classes</code> and <code>modules</code> across different files and folders and use them throughout the codebase without explicitly requiring them. Rails is a good example of a piece of software that uses code loaders. Programming in Rails doesn't require explicit <code>require</code> calls to load models before using them in controllers. In fact, in Rails 6, everything in the <code>app</code> directory is auto-loaded on app boot, with a few exceptions.</p>

<p>While it is easy to think code loading is all about making calls to <code>require</code>, it isn't that simple. Code loading can be further broken down into three parts, as follows.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Auto Loading:</strong> This means code is loaded on-the-fly as required. For example, in Rails, running <code>rails s</code> doesn't load all the models, controllers, etc. But, on the first hit of the model <code>User</code>, it runs the auto loading mechanism to find and use the model. This is auto loading in action. This has some advantages for our development environment, as we have faster app and <code>rails console</code> startup times. <code>Rails.config.autoload_path</code> controls the paths to be auto-loaded.</li>
<li><strong>Eager Loading:</strong> This means code is loaded into memory at app startup and doesn't wait for the constants to be called before requiring it. In Rails, code is eager loaded in production. From the explanation above, autoloading code in production will result in slow response times, as each constant will be required on-the-fly. <code>Rails.config.eager_load_paths</code> controls the paths to be eager loaded.</li>
<li><strong>Reloading:</strong> The code loader is constantly watching for changes to files in the <code>autoload_path</code> and reloads files when it notices any changes. In Rails, this can be quite useful in development, as it enables us to run <code>rails s</code> and simultaneously make changes without needing to restart the rails server. This is reloading in action.</li>
</ul>

<p>We can easily see that most of these concepts have been developed and live in Rails. Zeitwerk changes this! Zeitwerk enables us to bring all the code loading action to any Ruby project.</p>

<h2>What is Zeitwerk?</h2>

<p>Zeitwerk is an efficient and thread-safe code loader for Ruby and can be used in any Ruby project, including Web frameworks (Rails, Hanami, Sinatra), Cli tools, and gems. With it, you can streamline your programming knowing that classes and modules are available everywhere. Traditionally, Rails and <em>some</em> other gems have built-in code loaders to enable this functionality. However, Zeitwerk extracts these concepts into a gem and allows Rubyists to apply these concepts to their projects.</p>

<h3>Installing Zeitwerk</h3>

<p>First things first, we need to install the gem:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>gem</span> <span>install</span> <span>zeitwerk</span>

<span># OR in your Gemfile</span>
<span>gem</span> <span>'zeitwerk'</span><span>,</span> <span>'~&gt; 2.4.0'</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Configuring Zeitwerk</h3>

<p>So let's start with the basics:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>require</span> <span>'zeitwerk'</span>
<span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
<span>...</span>
<span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>setup</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The above code instantiates a loader instance and calls <code>setup</code>. After the call to <code>setup</code>, loaders are ready to load code. But, before that, all the necessary configurations on the <code>loader</code> should be covered already. In this article, I'll cover a few of the configurations on the <code>loader</code> and conventions for structuring your code.</p>

<ul>
<li>File Structure: For Zeitwerk to work, files and directory names need to match the modules and class names they define. For example,</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code>  <span>lib</span><span>/</span><span>my_gem</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>         <span>-&gt;</span> <span>MyGem</span>
  <span>lib</span><span>/</span><span>my_gem</span><span>/</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>     <span>-&gt;</span> <span>MyGem</span><span>::</span><span>Foo</span>
  <span>lib</span><span>/</span><span>my_gem</span><span>/</span><span>bar_baz</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>MyGem</span><span>::</span><span>BarBaz</span>
  <span>lib</span><span>/</span><span>my_gem</span><span>/</span><span>woo</span><span>/</span><span>zoo</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>MyGem</span><span>::</span><span>Woo</span><span>::</span><span>Zoo</span>
</code></pre></div>
<ul>
<li>Root Namespaces: Root Namespaces are directories where <code>Zeitwerk</code> can find your code. When <code>modules</code> and <code>classes</code> are referenced, Zeitwerk knows to search the root namespaces with the matching file name. For example,</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code>  <span>require</span> <span>'zeitwerk'</span>
  <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>push_dir</span><span>(</span><span>"app/models"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>push_dir</span><span>(</span><span>"app/controllers"</span><span>)</span>

  <span>//</span> <span>matches</span> <span>as</span> <span>follows</span>
  <span>app</span><span>/</span><span>models</span><span>/</span><span>user</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>                        <span>-&gt;</span> <span>User</span>
  <span>app</span><span>/</span><span>controllers</span><span>/</span><span>admin</span><span>/</span><span>users_controller</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Admin</span><span>::</span><span>UsersController</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are two primary ways to define the root namespace for two different use cases. The default way is shown below:</p>
<div><pre><code>  <span>//</span> <span>init</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>
  <span>require</span> <span>'zeitwerk'</span>
  <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>push_dir</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>#{</span><span>__dir__</span><span>}</span><span>/bar"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>setup</span>

  <span>//</span> <span>bar</span><span>/</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>
  <span>class</span> <span>Foo</span><span>;</span> <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This means the class <code>Foo</code> can be referenced without an explicit <code>Bar::Foo</code>, as the bar directory acts as a root namespace. The second way to define a namespace is to explicitly state the namespace in the call to <code>push_dir</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>  <span>//</span> <span>init</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>
  <span>require</span> <span>'zeitwerk'</span>

  <span>module</span> <span>Bar</span>
  <span>end</span>
  <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>push_dir</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>#{</span><span>__dir__</span><span>}</span><span>"</span><span>/</span><span>bar</span><span>,</span> <span>namespace: </span><span>Bar</span><span>)</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>setup</span>

  <span>//</span> <span>src</span><span>/</span><span>foo</span><span>.</span><span>rb</span>
  <span>class</span> <span>Bar</span><span>::</span><span>Foo</span><span>;</span> <span>end</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>There are a few things to note from in this code:</p>

<ol>
<li>The module <code>Bar</code> was already defined before being used by <code>push_dir</code> . If the module we want to use is defined by a third-party, then a simple require will define it before we use it in our call to <code>push_dir</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>push_dir</code> explicitly specifies the namespace <code>Bar</code>.</li>
<li>The file <code>src/foo.rb</code> defined <code>Bar::Foo</code>, not <code>Foo</code>, and did not need to create the directory, like <code>src/bar/foo.rb</code>.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li><p>Independent code loader: By design, Zeitwerk allows each project or app dependency to manage its individual project tree. This means the code loading mechanism of each dependency is managed by that dependency. For example, in Rails 6, Zeitwerk handles code loading for the Rails app and allows each gem dependency to manage its own project tree separately. It is an error condition to have overlapping files between multiple code loaders.</p></li>
<li><p>Autoloading: With the above setup, once the call to <code>setup</code> is made, all classes and modules will be available on demand.</p></li>
<li><p>Reloading: To enable reloading, the <code>loader</code> has to be explicitly configured for it. For example,</p></li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code>  <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>enable_reloading</span> <span># you need to opt-in before setup</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>setup</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>reload</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>loader.reload</code> call reloads the project tree on-the-fly, and any new changes are visible immediately. However, we still need a surrounding mechanism to detect changes to the file system and call <code>loader.reload</code>. A simple version is shown below:</p>
<div><pre><code>  <span>require</span> <span>'filewatcher'</span>

  <span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>new</span>
  <span>...</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>enable_reloading</span>
  <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>setup</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>my_filewatcher</span> <span>=</span> <span>Filewatcher</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>'lib/'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>Thread</span><span>.</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>my_filewatcher</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span><span>fw</span><span>|</span> <span>fw</span><span>.</span><span>watch</span> <span>{</span><span>|</span><span>filename</span><span>|</span> <span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>reload</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Using Zeitwerk in Rails</h3>

<p>Zeitwerk is enabled by default in Rails 6.0. However, you can opt-out of it and use the Rails <code>classic</code> code loader.</p>
<div><pre><code><span># config/application.rb</span>
<span>config</span><span>.</span><span>load_defaults</span> <span>"6.0"</span>
<span>config</span><span>.</span><span>autoloader</span> <span>=</span> <span>:classic</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h3>Using Zeitwerk in Gems</h3>

<p>Zeitwerk provides a convenient method for gems, as long as they use the standard gem structure (<code>lib/special_gem</code>). This convenience method can be used as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code><span># lib/special_gem.rb</span>
<span>require</span> <span>'zeitwerk'</span>

<span>module</span> <span>SpecialGem</span>
<span>end</span>

<span>loader</span> <span>=</span> <span>Zeitwerk</span><span>::</span><span>Loader</span><span>.</span><span>for_gem</span>
<span>loader</span><span>.</span><span>setup</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>With the standard gem structure, the <code>for_gem</code> call adds the <code>lib</code> directory as a root namespace, enabling every code in the <code>lib</code> directory to be found automatically.</p>

                          Artificial intelligence and robotics are advancing at a rapid pace, with the number of autonomous intelligent machines making moral choices among us continuously on the rise. Knowledge in moral psychology pertaining to artificial intelligence and robotics is important when discussing the ethics of their development.               </p><div>
                          <div><p><a href="https://researchportal.helsinki.fi/en/projects/moralities-of-intelligent-machines-2">Moralities of Intelligent Machines</a> is a project that investigates peopleâ€™s attitudes towards moral choices made by artificial intelligence. In the latest study completed under the project, study participants read short narratives where either a robot, a somewhat humanoid robot known as iRobot, a robot with a strong humanoid appearance called iClooney or a human being encounters a moral problem along the lines of the trolley dilemma, making a specific decision. The participants were also shown images of these agents, after which they assessed the morality of their decisions. The study was funded by the Jane and Aatos Erkko Foundation and the Academy of Finland.</p>
<p>The trolley dilemma is a problem where a person sees a trolley careening on the tracks, without anyone in control, towards five people. The person can either do nothing or turn the trolley onto another track, saving the five people but killing another individual on the other track.</p>
<h2>Attitudes more negative towards humanoid robots</h2>
<p>According to the study, people consider the choice made by the humanoid iRobot and iClooney less ethically sound than the same decision made by a human and a robot with a traditional robot-like appearance. <a href="https://www.helsinki.fi/en/people/people-finder/michael-laakasuo-9112809"><strong>Michael Laakasuo</strong></a>, project lead and the principal investigator of the study, links the findings to the uncanny valley effect, which has been identified in prior research.</p>
<p>â€œHumanness in artificial intelligence is perceived as eerie or creepy, and attitudes towards such robots are more negative than towards more machine-like robots. This may be due to, for example, the difficulty of reacting to a humanoid being: is it an animal, a human or a tool?â€�</p>
<p>According to Laakasuo, the findings indicate that humans do not find robots making moral decisions a strange idea, since the decisions made by a human and a traditional robot were seen as equally acceptable. Instead, the appearance of the robot makes a difference to evaluating their morality.</p>
<h2>Discussion guides the regulation of AI</h2>
<p>Laakasuo says that the number of intelligent machines making moral choices is growing in our society, with self-driving cars as an example.</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s important to know how people view intelligent machines and what kinds of factors affect related moral assessment. For instance, are traffic violations perpetrated by a stylish self-driving car perceived differently from those of a less classy model?"</p>
<p>This knowledge can influence the direction of AI and robotics development, as well as, among other things, product branding. Knowledge can also shape the political discussion relating to the regulation of artificial intelligence. For example, self-driving cars can become test laboratories of sorts for private companies: in the case of accidents, the consequences can be dealt with using money, risking human health in the name of technological advancement with appeals to consequentialist morals.</p>
<p>â€œWhat kind of robots do we want to have among us: robots who save five people from being run over by a trolley, sacrificing one person, or robots who refuse to sacrifice anyone even if it would mean saving several lives? Should robots be designed to look like humans or not if their appearance affects the perceived morality of their actions?â€�</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Release engineering is on pace with the timelines previously documented to provide a release of Rocky Linux by Q2 2021. The infrastructure team is working on automation in their area to facilitate the deployment of build infrastructure in additional regions. We’ve finalized our sponsorship model, and are as well open to partnerships for deeper collaboration. We’ve drafted our organizational structure, as well as our community charter. Finally, we’ve secured authorization from The Linux Foundation to license Rocky Linux under the Rocky Software Enterprise Foundation, which is the official legal entity that represents Rocky Linux and fosters its growth.</p>
<h3>Timeline</h3>
<p>In our previous update, we listed a number of items and gave dates to them. We remain committed to delivering an initial release of Rocky Linux by Q2. Here are what we listed previously, and where we stand with each:</p>
<ul>
<li>Build systems and infrastructure readiness - January 31 [DONE]</li>
<li>Automatic package build infrastructures - January 31 [DONE]</li>
<li>Testing package repository made public - February 28 [In progress]</li>
<li>Installer testing readiness - February 28 [In progress]</li>
<li>ETA for length of time needed for community testing - March 31 [In progress]</li>
<li>Release candidate availability - March 31 [On Pace]</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<h2>Legal</h2>
<p>The Linux Foundation has granted us a sub-license to legally use “Linux’’ in the distribution’s name “Rocky Linux.” We have renamed the “Rocky Linux Foundation’’ (RESF) to the “Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation” and changed it to a Public Benefits Organization in Delaware.</p>
<h2>Infrastructure</h2>
<p>The build infrastructure for our first deployment in us-east-2 was completed and handed off to the Development team.</p>
<p>The next steps for the Infrastructure team is to ensure documentation (both internal and external) is accurate and up-to-date, and then to finalize the translation of the current infrastructure to automation tooling so we can replicate deployments to additional regions. These regions include Development, us-west-2, and GovCloud. Alerting automation is also in progress, so not only are we monitoring our metrics and syslogs, but when issues arise we are receiving the appropriate notifications to enable the team to respond accordingly in a timely manner. We continue to make progress toward an alternate build infrastructure to AWS and hope to have an announcement by the March community update.</p>
<h2>Release Engineering and Packaging</h2>
<p>The team is working on building packages and getting the processes ready to assemble the final release. This includes things like validating the operation of Pungi (repo/image compositions), and nailing the package build order. An <a href="https://wiki.rockylinux.org/en/team/development/build_steps">overview of the build process</a> can be found on our wiki. We’re seeking volunteers that can assist with debranding, so if this is an area you’d like to contribute, please reach out! An <a href="https://wiki.rockylinux.org/en/team/development/debranding/how-to">overview of the steps for debranding</a> is on the wiki, with a more detailed guide to shortly follow.</p>
<h2>Merchandise</h2>
<p>Muckles Inc has begun shipping orders that have been placed, and people have started to receive those items. They were a little surprised by the huge amount of orders that were placed, so it has taken them a little bit longer to process those requests. We’re thankful for your patience, and of course they are still accepting new orders for <a href="https://www.mucklesu.com/collections/rocky-linux">Rocky Linux merch</a>. Please share photos of your Rocky Linux merchandise with us on <a href="https://twitter.com/rocky_linux">Twitter</a>, the <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/">forums</a>, or <a href="https://chat.rockylinux.org/">Mattermost</a>!</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<h3>Community Charter</h3>
<p>Responsibility to the community is critical to our success. To that end, we’ve published The Rocky Enterprise Software Foundation Community Charter, and you can read that <a href="https://forums.rockylinux.org/t/community-charter/1933">here</a>. We consider our community charter one of our most important documents, as it communicates to the community what our principles, values, and intentions are. Our responsibility to the community is outlined in our charter; the community’s responsibility is to hold us accountable. We will be embedding this charter in the distribution of the core Rocky Linux operating system, ensuring the longevity and persistence of these principles.</p>
<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p>We’ve expanded upon and published a <a href="https://rockylinux.org/faq/">FAQ</a> which addresses a number of questions that we’ve received. Questions such as “If Rocky Linux is just a respin of RHEL, what’s taking so long for a release candidate?” and “If you’re not just repackaging RHEL, then what exactly are you doing?” and more are all addressed. We will be adding to the FAQ over time based on questions the community surfaces.</p>
<h3>Mattermost</h3>
<p>The migration from Slack to Mattermost has been completed, and all of the legacy Slack channels have been archived. We’ve also set up a bridge from Mattermost to IRC, so if you’re in a Mattermost channel and you see [freenode] BOT , that’s what that’s about. On IRC, Mattermost messages will come from the rlf user, a username subject to change.</p>
<p>Lastly, be sure to check out the <a href="https://mattermost.com/blog/what-matters-episode-12-rocky-linux-with-jordan-pisaniello/">latest episode</a> of “What Matters” a podcast by Mattermost where Community Manager Jordan Pisaniello sits down to discuss Rocky Linux.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>The Documentation team has been rapidly growing and has made great progress toward putting forward documentation of the highest quality, with a number of community members stepping up and taking ownership of the massive effort. The team is organizing around a number of topics, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translation</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Packaging</li>
<li>Editorial</li>
<li>Administration</li>
</ul>
<p>and more. For the translation effort, we’re looking for volunteers to support the localization effort into non-English languages.</p>
<p>The team meets virtually once a month to plan and review progress, with scheduling discussed in advance in the <a href="https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/documentation">Documentation channel</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://chat.rockylinux.org/rocky-linux/channels/documentation">Please join us</a> on Mattermost and indicate the language or subject area you can assist with. You can also create <a href="https://github.com/rocky-linux/documentation">an issue or pull request on Github</a> to propose a new documentation topic or to help fix existing documentation.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like a special recognition of the Documentation Admin team—Calder Sheagren and Ezequiel Bruni—for helping to keep us organized and on-task.</p>

  <div>                            <p>An artificial neural network with internal memory can be taught to learn complex ultrafast light phenomena in optical fibres such as the generation of a broadband supercontinuum spanning all the color of the spectrum. The network can then predict nonlinear dynamics over extended propagation distances  when the only initial information fed to the network is the input light characteristics and the properties of the nonlinear medium.</p>
                    </div>
</div><div>
  
  <div>                            <p>Researchers at Tampere University have successfully used artificial intelligence to predict nonlinear dynamics that take place when ultrashort light pulses interact with matter. This novel solution can be used for efficient and fast numerical modelling, for example, in imaging, manufacturing and surgery. The findings were published in the prestigious Nature Machine Intelligence journal.</p>
                    </div>
</div><div>
  
  <div>                            <div><p><span><span><span>Artificial intelligence can distinguish different types of laser pulse propagation, just as it recognizes subtle differences of expression in facial recognition. The newly found solution can make it simpler to design experiments in fundamental research and will allow algorithms to be embedded in the next generation of laser systems to ensure real-time optimization. This can be utilised for example in manufacturing and surgery where the pulse properties are perturbed by a target environment.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>Nonlinear ultrafast light-matter interactions are something that researchers have struggled to understand for decades. The field of study is of vital importance in many areas of research, ranging from the use of spectroscopic tools in drug development to the precision machining of technological materials and remote sensing to high-resolution imaging. </span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span>Neural networks can be trained to recognize patterns</span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span>When a high-power ultrashort pulse of light interacts with a glass optical fibre, a range of highly nonlinear interactions take place that cause complex changes in both the temporal and spectral (color) properties of the injected light. Up to now, the study of these nonlinear and multidimensional interactions has been based on nonlinear Schrödinger equation, a slow and computationally demanding method that has limited dramatically the use of numerical techniques to design or optimize experiments in real-time. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“This problem has now been solved by using artificial intelligence. Our team has been able to train a neural network to recognize the patterns inherent in such complex evolution. Significantly, once trained, the network is also able to predict nonlinear evolution for a previously unknown scenario, and can do so essentially instantaneously,” says professor <strong>Goëry Genty</strong>, the leader of the research group at Tampere University and the Director of the national Flagship for Photonics Research and Innovation. <a href="https://prein.fi/">https://prein.fi/</a></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>This research uses a specialized architecture known as the recurrent neural network that possesses an internal memory.&nbsp; Such a network can not only recognize specific patterns associated with nonlinear dynamics, but it can also learn how such patterns evolve in both the temporal and spectral domains over an extended distance.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The neural network can predict an evolution in milliseconds<span><span>, which is orders of magnitude faster than direct numerical integration</span></span>. The novel solution will lead to more efficient and faster numerical modelling of all systems where nonlinearity influences propagation, improving the design of devices used in telecommunications, manufacturing, and imaging.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></p>

<h2><span><span><span>New applications available in photonics</span></span></span></h2>

<p><span><span><span>The study reports two cases of highly significant interest in photonics: extreme pulse compression and ultrabroadband laser source development. </span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>“The approach using a neural network with internal memory allows us to bypass the conventional approach of solving an underlying mathematical model, which is very time consuming and requires sometimes prohibitive memory resources” explains Genty. &nbsp;</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>With the rapid growth of machine learning applications in all fields of science, Genty anticipates that neural networks will very soon become an important and standard tool for analyzing complex nonlinear dynamics, for optimizing the generation of broadband sources and frequency combs, as well as for designing ultrafast optics experiments.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span>The research was carried out at Tampere University as part of the Applications of Artificial Intelligence in Physical Sciences and Engineering Program (AIPSE) and within the Academy of Finland’s Flagship for Photonics Research and Innovation (PREIN).</span></span></span></p>

February 25, 2021 | https://martinord.eu/posts/2021/02/make-an-encrypted-usb-with-veracrypt/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://martinord.eu/posts/2021/02/make-an-encrypted-usb-with-veracrypt/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>Last week we <a href="https://martinord.eu/posts/2021/02/hide-your-secrets-with-luks/">have talked about encryption and a solution for Linux users</a>. This time, we will cover an Free and Open Source <strong>solution that works for everyone: Windows, MacOS and Linux users: VeraCrypt</strong>. In this guide we will <strong>encrypt your USB stick</strong> step by step, so you can hide your secrets and use it securely across different devices.</p>
<h2 id="warning-remember-the-password">Warning: remember the password</h2>
<p>I have already updated last week post with a warning. It seems trivial but I do not want to be responsible of any data loss :D</p>
<p>The truth is this <strong>if you forget your password, your files are gone</strong>. You will not able to <em>reset your password</em> and wait for an email to come to your Inbox so you can click a direct link to reset everything like magic. Once you encrypt your files with a key, you will can only change your password if you know your previous password.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p><strong>No problem!</strong> Right? At this point you already know you can use a <strong><a href="https://martinord.eu/posts/2021/01/why-should-i-have-a-password-manager/">password manager</a></strong> to store your passwords so you do not forget them. Anyway, you can always create a backup of your files in a different (encrypted) drive that you keep at home. In case you forget the password, you can go for your backup.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-veracrypt">What is VeraCrypt?</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Home.html">VeraCrypt</a> is a Free and Open Source software solution for disk encryption</strong>. It is based on a previous existing project named <em>Truecrypt</em> that is no longer mantained. Nowadays, VeraCrypt is mostly maintained by the <a href="https://www.idrix.fr/Root/">IDRIX</a> group.</p>
<p>Why choosing VeraCrypt? Here are <strong>two advantages</strong>:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://martinord.eu/img/usb-veracrypt/compatibility.png" alt="Windows, Linux, MacOS"> <figcaption>
            <p>VeraCrypt is compatible with Linux, Windows and MacOS.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="compatibility">Compatibility</h3>
<p><strong>VeraCrypt is compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux</strong>. This is a great advantage as you can use it across devices and Operating Systems. You can check their <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Supported%20Operating%20Systems.html">supported OS</a> on their website.</p>
<p>When I once asked one of my (a bit paranoid) Linux Hardening teachers, he answared me with this question: “What is the point of encrypting your USB if you are going to mount it in Windows anyway?” :D</p>
<h3 id="open-source">Open Source</h3>
<p>The tool is <strong>maintained by a community</strong> of cryptography experts, it is open to the public and you will never depend on a company changing the price or the software. Moreover, you can trust that many <strong>people is reviewing the code</strong> and it just does what it says it does. If the code is proprietary and closed source, nobody can verify what the application is doing.</p>
<p>The source code is available in <a href="https://github.com/veracrypt/VeraCrypt">Github</a>.</p>
<h2 id="get-on-with-it-veracrypt">Get on with it: VeraCrypt</h2>
<p>The next part of the article is about encrypting your USB stick. Keep in mind that VeraCrypt has also other functionalities like encrypting your Windows installation drive, so feel free to check their project and <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Documentation.html">their documentation</a>. Once you encrypt your USB, you can use it normally after mounting it with VeraCrypt.</p>
<p>For this tutorial, <strong>we will use Windows 10</strong>. However, the steps are very similar for other OS. Remember it is also compatible with Linux, MacOS and even RaspberryPi!</p>
<h3 id="install-veracrypt">Install VeraCrypt</h3>
<p>For <strong>creating</strong> the encrypted USB and for <strong>using it</strong>, you need the <strong>VeraCrypt desktop application</strong>. You can download it from their website and verify their PGP signature:</p>
<ol>
<li>Download it: <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html">https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Downloads.html</a></li>
<li>(Optional) Verify the PGP signature: <a href="https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Digital%20Signatures.html">https://www.veracrypt.fr/en/Digital%20Signatures.html</a></li>
<li>Launch the installer</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="create-a-new-encrypted-volume">Create a new encrypted volume</h3>
<p>Once you have installed VeraCrypt, it is time to get your USB stick. Fistly, we will see how to create an encrypted partition with an <strong>empty USB stick</strong>. If you already have files on it, you can copy them to a temporary folder or <a href="#existing">you can encrypt the device with them inside</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>Click on <em>Create Volume</em> and choose <em>Encrypt a non-system partition/drive</em>.</li>
<li>Choose the <em>Create encrypted volume and format it</em>. This will create a new partition in the USB stick.</li>
<li>Continue with defaults and <strong>set a password</strong>.</li>
<li>Choose the format and encrypt your drive. <strong>I recommend choosing FAT</strong> so it is compatible across devices.</li>
<li>Click <em>Format</em> and you are done!</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="existing">Extra: Encrypting an existing NTFS partition</h3>
<p>As said, if you <strong>already have a NTFS partition with files</strong>, you can use VeraCrypt to directly encrypt the partition with the files inside. For this you just have to <strong>replace step 2 choosing <em>Encrypt partition in place</em>.</strong></p>

</figure>

<h2 id="now-what-use-the-encrypted-usb">Now what? Use the encrypted USB</h2>
<p>Now you have your encrypted USB, <strong>you have to unlock it with VeraCrypt</strong>. This is easy:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://martinord.eu/img/usb-veracrypt/use1.png" alt="Usage 1"> <figcaption>
            <p>Select your encrypted USB.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Open Veracrypt</strong></li>
<li><strong>Select your device</strong> and choose a letter you want to assign</li>
<li><strong>Click on <em>Mount</em></strong></li>
<li><strong>Type your password</strong></li>
</ol>
<figure>
    <img src="https://martinord.eu/img/usb-veracrypt/use2.png" alt="Usage 2"> <figcaption>
            <p>Type your password.</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>VeraCrypt is a <strong>good solution for encrypting your drives</strong>. The advantages we have seen here make you able to use it for free and across devices. Moreover, it is easy to use through its GUI. I see a problem, though: <strong>no Operating System has native support for VeraCrypt</strong>, so you will have to install the application in every device you want to use your USB stick.</p>
<p><strong>Obri!</strong> Thank you for reading this post. I hope I made you check the VeraCrypt project.</p>

			<h4>Petr Vaněk, Andreas Shimokawa</h4>
		<p><time datetime="2021-02-25T00:00:00+01:00" itemprop="datePublished">Thu 25 February 2021</time>
	</p></div><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>First month of the new year 2021 has delivered tons of new devices. We are
happy to see new people stepping up and providing the initial support for these
watches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wasp-os - Daniel Thompson</li>
<li>Amazfit Neo - xaos</li>
<li>Amazfit GTS 2 Mini - Andreas Shimokawa</li>
<li>Huami Zepp E - Andrew Watkins</li>
<li>Amazfit GTR 2e - Jochen S</li>
<li>Amazfit GTS 2e - Andreas Shimokawa</li>
<li>Amazfit X - Stefan Bora</li>
</ul>
<p>Many thanks to all contributors!</p>
<p>While new devices' support is flowing in, this doesn't mean that all features
and functions of these newly added devices are working, but the initial support
typically already provides many important aspects required for day to day
usage. It also offers a very convenient way to look at these devices in more
detail and help to improve their support further. These Gadgetbridge releases
(0.53.0, 0.54.0 and 0.54.1) also contain many small and big fixes and
improvements all over the place :).</p>
<p>We are super happy to see a wasp-os in the list of supported devices, added by
Daniel Thompson himself. <a href="https://github.com/daniel-thompson/wasp-os">Wasp-os</a>
(Watch Application System in Python) is an open-source firmware for smart
watches that are based on the nRF52 family of micro controllers. Currently this
includes the hacker friendly PineTime from Pine64, the Senbono K9 as well as
the Colmi P8, which is a popular device with watch modders.</p>
<p>There have been many improvements done to the Fossil HR thanks to ongoing work
by Daniel Dakhno. It is an interesting piece of hardware and software, which to
some extend provides similar feature set known from the Pebble. Ongoing
development has been focusing on support in Gadgetbridge but also on the
recently introduced app ecosystem of this watch, which is now in early stage
provided by the <a href="https://github.com/dakhnod/Fossil-HR-SDK">Fossil HR SDK</a>.</p>
<p>For those tracking their sports results in Gadgetbridge, imperial units
settings is now honored in the Widget, Activity list and Sports Workouts. We
have also added a small improvement when exporting a GPX track recording,
allowing <a href="https://opentracksapp.com/">OpenTracks</a> to not duplicate these
exports.</p>
<p>For all user-facing changes since the previous blog post, check the following
list:</p>
<h4>0.54.1</h4>
<ul>
<li>Amazfit GTS2e: Really fix broken support</li>
<li>Amazfit Bip S Lite: Fix broken support (probably)</li>
</ul>
<h4>0.54.0</h4>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
    




<p>
Well, it's been a year since I started the draft, so I guess it's about time to publish this! :)
</p>
<p>
This is a map of my personal <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#dataliberation">data liberation</a> <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/tags.html#infra">infrastructure</a>, with links to the scripts and tools used; and my blog posts elaborating on different parts of it.
</p>
<p>
My goal for data liberation is approximating the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/sad-infra.html#data_mirror">'personal data mirror'</a> concept,
often <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interoperability">despite</a> crappy interoperability (or lack thereof) of different platforms.
</p>
<p>
I prepared this diagram for several reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li>to give more context for my blog posts about data liberation and tools around it</li>
<li>to highlight the complexity and hoops we have to jump over because of the lack of interoperability</li>
<li>it was also sort of fun :)</li>
</ul>
<p>
This time I won't write too much text and just let you explore it. <b>Tips for exploring the diagram</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>perhaps open the <a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra_files/myinfra.svg"><b>full size SVG</b></a> in a new tab</li>
<li>make sure to read the legend</li>
<li>links you can follow are marked with blue (and sometimes other colours)</li>
<li>there is a bubble (💬) near some nodes/edges, you can hover it to see the comment</li>
<li>some integrations are in progress: marked with <samp>WIP</samp>, construction signs (🚧🚧) and dashed edges</li>
<li>arrows roughly represent the direction of data flow</li>
<li>arrow colors roughly correspond to the data source (so it's easier to track how it flows)</li>
<li>there are some rendering issues

<ul>
<li>it's probably not very mobile friendly (it's barely desktop friendly!)</li>
<li>SVG support varies among web browsers, so there might be some minor artifacts (chromium works better, but firefox works well enough)</li>
<li>navbar centering isn't broken on this page – it's just a temporary hack to fit in the diagram till I figure out wide pages properly</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

Some <b>notes</b> regarding the diagram:
</p>
<ul>
<li>it's plotted via graphviz, and you can find the source <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/myinfra">here</a> (although the code is quite domain specific)</li>
<li>even though there is a lot of stuff on the diagram, it's still incomplete!

<ul>
<li><a href="https://beepb00p.xyz/my-data.html">here</a> there is an (also incomplete) list of data I collect/export</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/tree/master/my">HPI modules</a> are a good proxy for the data I'm using</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
note that despite some platforms dying (e.g. Jawbone/Endomondo), I can still use data produced with them!
</p>
<p>
E.g. after Endomondo was discontinued, I was able to quickly switch to open source <a href="https://github.com/jonasoreland/runnerup#readme">RunnerUp app</a>,
while <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/5b501d156266ca8e185d681fab6bc3ee156498a6/my/runnerup.py">preserving</a> complete data compatibility.
</p></li>
<li>note how many services are outright malicious with their <b>anti-API/anti-scraping/anti-interoperability</b> measures (yellow/red highlight for API nodes)</li>
<li>probably more platforms have GDPR exports, I just haven't tried yet</li>
<li><p>
indirection is crazy
</p>
<p>
Note how for some data, before I can get it on my computer, it goes as
</p>
<ul>
<li>device –&gt; phone (over bluetooth)</li>
<li>phone  –&gt; cloud (over internet)</li>
<li>cloud  –&gt; computer (over internet)</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>
for many phone apps <b>the only way</b> I can sync the data is <b>by rooting my phone</b> in order to access the <code>/data/data</code> directory
</p>
<p>
This is getting worse and worse with every Android version. I understand the security concerns, but this is ridiculous.
</p></li>
<li><p>
some modules/packages (marked with<sup>sb</sup> superscript) were developed by <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge">Sean Breckenridge</a>
</p>
<p>
He's forked my <a href="https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI">HPI</a> package and working on it <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI">in parallel</a>.
For now, we decided to hack on it independently, in the hope that eventually we figure out what's a good model for cooperating and maintaining the modules.
</p>
<p>
Also, he's done some cool work on <a href="https://github.com/seanbreckenridge/HPI_API">automatic HTTP API</a> for HPI!

    <p><img src="https://casparwre.de/images/google-godzilla.jpg" alt="'The Google Beast'"></p>

<h2 id="the-beast-that-is-google">The beast that is Google</h2>
<p>There was a time when Google was a small, quirky company with a single product so awesome that it blew away the competition. That time is long gone.</p>

<p>These days Google is a gigantic multinational mega-corp. But that’s understating it a little. Think of Google as a kind of Godzilla that slurps up data about its users at one end and craps out gold ingots at the other. It does both of these at huge scale.</p>

<p>When thinking about Google, there are three things that are not easy to grasp but which are immensely important:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Google is not a search engine, it is not simply a maker of productivity tools. Google is a giant advertising platform.</li>
  <li>Google is spectacularly, awesomely, frighteningly successful as an advertising platform. The gold ingots are coming out at an alarming rate and being used for all kinds of other things.</li>
  <li>Google’s success, the fact that it is so good at what it does, the fact that it is crapping out a mountain of gold ingots, is terrible for us and society.</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a quick tour of these points before getting onto Google Analytics.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-not-a-search-engine">Google is not a search engine</h2>
<p>Google is an advertising platform. Everything it does, all of its products, are geared towards selling advertising. Most of its products are free, many of them are useful, and a few are even great. But they all exist to suck up more data so that it can become even better at selling advertising.</p>

<p>The way Google turns data into gold ingots is as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Step 1: Google collects as much data about you as it can.</li>
  <li>Step 2: Google uses this data to get to know you very very well: what you like, what you don’t like, whether you are pregnant, whether you are gay, where your friends live, where you spend your time, what you purchase online.</li>
  <li>Step 3: Google uses its extensive knowledge of you to show you advertising that fits you like a tailor-made suit.</li>
  <li>Step 4: Lots of gold ingots.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism">surveillance capitalism</a> and it’s certainly not about giving you a great user experience, it’s about making money.</p>

<p>To give just one perfect example of the point I’m making: look at the way that paid search results (i.e. adverts) have become ever harder to identify in Google’s search results.</p>

<p><img src="https://casparwre.de/images/google-evolution.jpg" alt="'Google Ads timeline'"></p>

<p><em><a href="https://searchengineland.com/search-ad-labeling-history-google-bing-254332">Google Ads Timeline compiled by Search Engine Land</a></em></p>

<p>This is not the evolution you expect to see for a company that loves its users. This is what you expect from a mega-corp that wants ever more profits.</p>

<h2 id="google-is-spectacularly-awesomely-frighteningly-successful-as-an-advertising-platform">Google is spectacularly, awesomely, frighteningly successful as an advertising platform</h2>
<p>Many of Google’s products have an absolutely staggering market share. Google has nine products with more than one billion users each. Google Chrome is the most popular web browser with a market share of 64%. Google’s Android is the most popular operating system on mobile devices with a market share of 72%. Google’s products are being used by most internet connected humans on earth.</p>

<p>Combine this with the fact that Google has a monopoly on online advertising. Ok, actually that’s not true. It has a duopoly along  with Facebook. Facebook is guilty of most of the things I mention in this post, and is probably worse, but I’m saving my venom for Facebook for another day.</p>

<p>The result of all this is that Google’s revenue is eye-wateringly massive: around 180 billion USD in 2020, which is around the GDP of New Zealand. Now consider that only four years ago, Google’s revenue was 90 billion USD, which means that the revenue doubled in 4 years. Wow!</p>

<p>This mountain of gold ingots used to flow to newspapers and magazines – but no more. The result has been the decimation of local news and the magazine industry. It is true that  news organizations have been terrible at innovation in the past three decades and now they have been steam-rollered as a result. Why is this bad? Read on.</p>

<h2 id="googles-success-is-not-good-for-us-as-a-society">Google’s success is not good for us as a society</h2>

<p>Google’s success is good for Google and its shareholders. It’s not good for us, the consumers. We live in a world where local news is either stone dead or barely surviving. As we have learned in the past few years, a functioning media is essential to democracy.</p>

<p>So has the market done its magic and filled the gap? Has the creation part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction">creative destruction</a> happened? Do we now have a better and superior solution for local news?</p>

<p>Nope. Online news articles are a hideous cluster-fuck of click-baiting headlines, cookie banners, privacy nightmares and top heavy with advertising and it’s mostly Google’s fault. Producers of news are desperately wringing every last pathetic drop of profit from their content.</p>

<p>Do you know why online recipes now begin with the author’s life story and are an interminable bore until you reach the actual beef? It’s because of Google. It’s because even writers of online recipes are prostrating themselves before the omnipotent online God that is Google.</p>

<p>And that huge growing pile of gold ingots? That’s in itself a problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“For many years, the astonishing torrent of money thrown off by Google’s Web-search monopoly has fueled invasions of multiple other segments, enabling Google to bat aside rivals who might have brought better experiences to billions of lives.</p>

  <p>Google Apps and Google Maps are both huge presences in the tech economy. Are they paying for themselves, or are they using search advertising revenue as rocket fuel? Nobody outside Google knows.”  – <a href="https://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/202x/2020/06/25/Break-Up-Google">Break up Google</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There are many other nuanced and large problems created by Google’s size and profitability and I’ve only scratched the surface here.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-about-google-analytics">So what about Google Analytics?</h2>
<p>Google is harvesting data across all of its products, so why pick on Google Analytics? Because for most of the products, if you choose to use them, it’s your data that is harvested. It’s different for Analytics. You as a web developer are making a choice that affects all of your users.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Google Analytics is the most popular website stats tool. More than 53% of all sites on the web track their visitors using Google Analytics. 84% of sites that do use a known analytics script use Google Analytics. It’s the most popular third-party request on the web. It accounts for 0.64% of all network requests.” – <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics#its-owned-by-google-the-largest-ad-tech-company-in-the-world">Plausible.io blog</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>When I first began to develop websites, it was a no-brainer to add Google Analytics to anything I created.: “It’s free! It’s good! It’s what everyone uses!”</p>

<p>Actually it’s not that good really:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It’s a bloated script that affects your site speed</li>
  <li>It’s overkill for the majority of site owners</li>
  <li>It’s a privacy liability and requires an extensive privacy policy</li>
  <li>It worsens the user experience due to the necessity of annoying prompts.</li>
  <li>It’s blocked by many browsers (e.g. Firefox) so the data is not very accurate.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are more reasons. You can read the full list <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics#its-owned-by-google-the-largest-ad-tech-company-in-the-world">here</a>.</p>

<p>Has Google ever revealed what it does with data from Analytics internally? Nope. But we don’t even need to speculate. It seems pretty obvious to me that they’re using it to guzzle up even more data and to crap out ever more gold ingots.</p>

<h2 id="alternatives-to-google-analytics">Alternatives to Google Analytics</h2>
<p>So are there alternatives? Sure, there’s a bunch and some cost money. I think it’s money worth spending.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/onurakpolat/awesome-analytics">Here is a comprehensive and curated list</a> of analytics tools, including privacy focussed analytics.</p>

<p>I use Fathom Analytics for this blog and am switching all of my products to it. To see the analytics for this blog <a href="https://app.usefathom.com/share/folzoonq/casparwre.de">click here</a> (note that is an affiliate link – I will earn some money if you signup, you will get 10 USD off).</p>

<p>I believe it is a moral imperative for web developers to think about the “free” tools they are using to provide their products. In the case of Google Analytics, the tool is only very superficially free. We are all paying the hidden costs.</p>

      <p id="date">
        <time>Sep 01, 2020</time>
      </p>
    </header>
    <p>If you haven't noticed already I really love plain text so I thought I would find some plain text protocols that are used in different software systems. The Redis Protocol specification states it best by describing its own protocol, but this applies to all of the plain text protocols I will cover.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple to implement.</li>
<li>Fast to parse.</li>
<li>Human readable.</li>
</ul>
<p>The next time you are building a software system and have to exchange data start with using a simple plain text protocol and then add in the complexity for optimization later. All of these protocols can be sent as plain text data over a TCP or UDP. They are easily inspected, small, and direct.</p>

<p>Starting off with the simplest one in the list is the Graphite plaintext protocol for delivering metrics into Graphite via Carbon.</p>
<p>The protocol:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;metics_path&gt; &lt;metics_value&gt; &lt;metrics_timestamp&gt;
</code></pre><p>The example:</p>
<pre><code>/cpu_load/core_0 0.08 1599009388
/cpu_load/core_1 0.07 1599009388
/cpu_load/core_2 0.07 1599009388
/cpu_load/core_3 0.05 1599009388
</code></pre><p><a href="https://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/feeding-carbon.html#the-plaintext-protocol">Full Specification</a></p>

<p>The next simplest one in the list is the Influx Line Protocol. While this is similar to Graphite it does add some additional metadata to its specification.</p>
<p>The protocol:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;measurement&gt;[,&lt;tag_set&gt;...] &lt;field_set&gt;... &lt;timestamp&gt;
</code></pre><p>The example:</p>
<pre><code>cpu,core=0 load=0.08 1599009388
cpu,core=1 load=0.07 1599009388
cpu,core=2 load=0.07 1599009388
cpu,core=3 load=0.05 1599009388
</code></pre><p><a href="https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/write_protocols/line_protocol_tutorial/">Full Specification</a></p>

<p>Here is where things get more complex, but the same 3 characteristics from above apply still. Simplifying the protocol for the sake of brevity in this article we see that the protocol is a single line of text and the initial command dictates what argument data types are allowed after it.</p>
<p>The protocol:</p>
<pre><code>COMMAND arguments...
</code></pre><p>The example:</p>
<pre><code>GET key1
SET key2 100
HSET hash key1 value1
HGETALL hash
</code></pre><p>There is more to this particular protocol to denote strings, numbers, arrays, etc in a text format which is outlined in the official specification.</p>
<p><a href="https://redis.io/topics/protocol">Full Specification</a></p>

<p>Yes, HTTP is just plain text. Since the protocol itself has lots of permutations of metadata lets just look at some examples of an HTTP request and response.</p>
<p>The request example:</p>
<pre><code>GET /articles/plain-text-protocols/ HTTP/1.1
Host: blainsmith.com
Accept-Language: en-us
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
</code></pre><p>The response example:</p>
<pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Accept-Ranges: bytes
Content-Length: 6262
Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8
Date: Wed, 02 Sep 2020 01:41:35 GMT
Last-Modified: Wed, 02 Sep 2020 01:37:33 GMT

&lt;THE HTML OF THIS ARTICLE&gt;
</code></pre><p>Your browser constructs the request when you visit <a href="http://blainsmith.com/articles/plain-text-protocols/">http://blainsmith.com/articles/plain-text-protocols/</a> and parses the response when it comes back from the server. There are a lot more allowable headers, but the basics of this protocol are pretty straightforward.</p>
<p><a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616">Full Specification</a></p>

<p>The world runs on these types of plain text protocol so don't reinvent the wheel if you find yourself building a software system and there is an existing protocol available. If there is an existing plain text protocol that you can adapt to your purposes then do that since there might be a library available already to serialize and deserialize the protocol so you don't have to write your own. If any of these protocols do not fit your needs and you need to write your own then keep it simple. If everyone's web browsers are using HTTP which has worked for decades there is no reason for you to create a complicated protocol unless your can prove the need to otherwise.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>A safe space to experiment and bring your fintech innovations to life.</p><div><p>Today, we are proud to announce the launch of the <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/">Treasury Prime Developer Sandbox</a>, a space that allows developers to begin using Treasury Prime’s advanced banking services, all in the safety of an enclosed environment, without requiring a connection to a production bank account. And it's free to use, allows immediate access, and is available now. With the launch of the Developer Sandbox, developers can build in a consequence-free environment. When you don’t have to worry about a typo causing a million dollar error, you're set free to experiment, and experimentation leads to innovation.</p><p>Treasury Prime began with a mission to make banking technology more accessible, while providing enough guide rails to keep things safe and secure. We wanted to design an elegant, powerful API that lets developers do what they do best: change the world by creating innovative software solutions. At the same time–having collectively spent decades working in the banking industry–our team knows the substantial value that banks provide. As such, we also strive to empower banks to do what they do best: risk management, security at scale, and providing knowledgeable customer support. So, by helping to match the fintechs inventing the future with the forward-looking banks who are here to support them, Treasury Prime aims to enable a new generation of financial innovation.</p><h3>Features</h3><p>The Developer Sandbox allows you to test all of the Treasury Prime APIs (with a few minor exceptions), so you can build a proof of concept quickly and get to market fast. There is no cost for using this environment, so you are free to build and test as long as you like without worrying about fees or contracts. And when you’re ready to make the jump to production, you just need to swap out your environment URLs and generate some production API keys. You’ll also need to get connected with a bank, which is why we’ve partnered with a growing number of banks to make sure we can help connect almost any fintech with a banking partner.<br></p><p>The Treasury Prime APIs were designed around the principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">REST</a>, and all response bodies are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON" target="_blank">JSON</a> encoded, so they should feel familiar to almost anyone who’s worked with APIs before, and be easy to understand for those who are new to the game. So what exactly can you do with Treasury Prime's APIs?</p><ul role="list"><li>Apply to open new bank accounts</li><li>Issue branded debit cards</li><li>Make deposits with remote deposit capture</li><li>Make payments and card transactions&nbsp;</li><li>Fund accounts</li></ul><p>And that’s just to name a few… So, now that you know a bit more about what <em>we</em> do, let's take a look at how <em>you</em> can build the next big fintech innovation!</p><h3>Getting Started</h3><p>In the examples below, we’ll look at how you can transfer funds between two accounts at the same bank using a book transfer, then follow that up by checking the available balance on an account.<br></p><p>If you’d like to follow along, you can <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/" target="_blank">sign up for a free Developer Sandbox account</a> (it’s fast and painless I promise). Once you’ve signed up, you can then log into the Developer Sandbox, and generate a set of API Keys which will be used to authenticate your requests. In our examples these keys are shown as <em>$API_KEY_ID </em>and <em>$API_SECRET_KEY.</em>&nbsp;You'll need to swap these out with Key ID&nbsp;and Secret&nbsp;Key you generate in your sandbox when making requests.<br></p><p><strong><em>Note:</em></strong><em> If you’d like more in-depth information on any of our APIs, please see our </em><a href="https://developers.treasuryprime.com/docs" target="_blank"><em>API Reference Documentation</em></a><em>.</em></p><h4>Book Transfer</h4><p>A book transfer is an electronic funds transfer between two accounts at the same bank. In this example we’ll look at how you can transfer funds from a checking account to a savings account.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong><em>Note: </em></strong><em>A checking and savings account are automatically created in your Developer Sandbox for testing purposes.</em><br></p><p>The first step in creating a book transfer is to obtain the IDs of the accounts you wish to transfer funds between.

</code></pre></div><p>This will return a list of <a href="https://developers.sandbox.treasuryprime.com/docs#account" target="_blank">Account</a> objects. In order to make a book transfer, you will need the account ID for both the sending and receiving accounts, which are stored in the<em> '</em>id' property of each account object.</p><div><pre><code>{

		<p>The rules extraction from the Decision Tree can help with better understanding how samples propagate through the tree during the prediction. It can be needed if we want to implement a Decision Tree without <a href="https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn">Scikit-learn</a> or different than Python language. Decision Trees are easy to move to any programming language because there are set of <code>if-else</code> statements. I’ve seen many examples of moving scikit-learn Decision Trees into C, C++, Java, or even SQL.</p>

<p>In this post, I will show you 3 ways how to get decision rules from the Decision Tree (for both classification and regression tasks) with following approaches:</p>
<ul>
  <li>built-in text representation,</li>
  <li>convert a Decision Tree to the code (can be in any programming language)</li>
  <li>convert a Decision Tree to <strong>set of rules which are human-readable</strong> (my favourite approach)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you would like to visualize your Decision Tree model, then you should see my article <a href="https://mljar.com/blog/visualize-decision-tree/">Visualize a Decision Tree in 4 Ways with Scikit-Learn and Python</a></p>

<p>If you want to train Decision Tree and other ML algorithms (Random Forest, Neural Networks, Xgboost, CatBoost, LighGBM)  in an automated way, you should check our open-source AutoML Python Package on the GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/mljar/mljar-supervised">mljar-supervised</a></p>

<h3 id="train-decision-tree-on-classification-task">Train Decision Tree on Classification Task</h3>

<p>Let’s train a <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier.html"><code>DecisionTreeClassifier</code></a> on the <code>iris</code> dataset. I will use default hyper-parameters for the classifier, except the <code>max_depth=3</code> (don’t want too deep trees, for readability reasons).</p>

<h2 id="scikit-learn-built-in-text-representation">Scikit-Learn Built-in Text Representation</h2>

<p>The Scikit-Learn Decision Tree class has an <a href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.tree.export_text.html"><code>export_text()</code></a>. It returns the text representation of the rules.</p>

<p>The output:</p>

<p>You can pass the feature names as the argument to get better text representation:</p>

<p>There isn’t any built-in method for extracting the <code>if-else</code> code rules from the Scikit-Learn tree. We need to write it. The code below is based on <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/39772170/5605919">StackOverflow answer</a> - updated to Python 3.</p>

<p>The above code recursively walks through the nodes in the tree and prints out decision rules. The rules are presented as python function. The below <code>predict()</code> code was generated with <code>tree_to_code()</code>. You can easily adapt the above code to produce decision rules in any programming language.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>“Bitcoin mining is an environmental disaster.”</em>&nbsp;</p><p>You’ve probably come across a few articles making claims like above. Bitcoin mining is energy intensive. But should we be concerned that its energy consumption and carbon emissions pose a real threat to society?</p><p>In this article, we compiled a collection of studies and arguments made over the years as to why Bitcoin mining is not an environmental disaster and how it tends to be misunderstood in the mainstream. Our goal is to distill these arguments and present them in a cohesive way.&nbsp;</p><h2>Bitcoin Mining is Necessary&nbsp;</h2><p>Miners confirm transactions on the Bitcoin network. They ensure nobody cheats the system. To do this, they compete with each other to have their block of transactions added to the existing blocks (ie. the blockchain). The first one to do so, earns a reward. They compete through hash computations. The more hashes produced, the greater the probability of winning the reward. By converting electricity into hashes they prove to the network that they have paid a cost to participate which anybody can verify.</p><blockquote><em>“This system is the most simplistic and fair way for the physical world to validate something in the digital world.”&nbsp;<br>“Proof of Work (PoW) transmutes electricity into digital gold.”&nbsp;<br>— Dan Held in </em><a href="https://medium.com/@danhedl/pow-is-efficient-aa3d442754d3"><em>Proof of Work is Efficient</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em></blockquote><p>Does this give Bitcoin a legitimate claim on society’s resources?&nbsp;</p><p>Bitcoin power usage seems less extreme when compared to power usage of <a href="https://medium.com/braiins/so-you-think-bitcoin-mining-is-wasteful-f93cf849a2b9">video game consoles</a> or <a href="https://bitcoinist.com/bitcoin-mining-energy-consumption-us-christmas-lights/">Christmas lights</a>. However, it appears significant when it consumes as much electricity as small countries. Perspective matters here. But the fact is people are paying to have their transactions included in the blockchain. Something voluntarily exchanged cannot by definition be a waste. People are benefiting from using Bitcoin and that’s why they are subsidizing miners. For an individual to say that this is a poor use of society’s resources because <em>they </em>don’t find Bitcoin valuable is akin to them complaining that other people shouldn’t be able to buy video game consoles and consume electricity to play them because <em>they </em>don’t like video games.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>Bitcoin’s Energy Consumption</h3><p>One important factor to consider is that Bitcoin mining can take place anywhere in the world. Unlike traditional mining operations (e.g. for gold or diamonds), Bitcoin mining is highly distributed geographically and can move to wherever power is cheap.&nbsp;</p><p>Claims are often made that because Bitcoin mining is energy intensive, it becomes a drain in areas where it occurs. This is inaccurate.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, Bitcoin mining operations are most commonly located in areas where there is an oversupply of electricity. Why? Because these are the areas where electricity is cheapest — supply is greater than demand and existing technology is not sufficient to effectively store and&nbsp; transport supply to population centers where demand is higher. This is important for mining operations because electricity costs can account for up to <a href="https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/op-ed-bitcoin-miners-consume-reasonable-amount-energy-and-its-all-worth-it/">70% of their total costs</a> of operation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Estimates suggest about <a href="https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-december-2019">65% of global mining occurs in China</a>, and the province of Sichuan alone produces ~54% of global hashrate. This is largely due to an overbuild of hydroelectric power in the provinces of Sichuan and Xinjiang. The installed hydro capacity is <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-hydropower/dam-nation-big-state-projects-spared-in-chinas-hydro-crackdown-idUSKCN1LF2RG">double what its power grid can support</a>, leading to an enormous quantity of surplus electricity.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5f8337c352384d6ba3fe3748_5f4669a213b9108401ffcafc_YkZU2MitNpEsZwIUuhJRFkdPszwS7o_0g2VgOZOr3x1WYCOaa6fyEMKWSfUcRQ3Oafryh_4-fCuyB3EeHGZn4ER4D5QqNN_BqAKwIkfzOBEpNk1zULiY-B5-DzFnWSmDZ_Sf_zk.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Source: Coinshares Bitcoin Mining Report - December 2019</em></figcaption></figure><p>As Nic Carter summarizes in his <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/the-last-word-on-bitcoins-energy-consumption">article</a> on Bitcoin’s energy consumption,</p><blockquote><em>“Part of the reason Bitcoin consumes so much electricity is because China lowered the clearing price of energy by overbuilding hydro capacity due to sloppy central planning.

A study performed by the BitMEX research group revealed that the <a href="https://blog.bitmex.com/mining-incentives-part-2-why-is-china-dominant-in-bitcoin-mining/">majority of Chinese Bitcoin mining operations</a> are in areas of relative oversupply from hydropower operations.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5f8337c386c45172975631c5_5f466c06dae6771f273c63fd_7_siB1LtkEifUfFF91H8U7xbNXuMyheBuq69rn7DA8jgNiB3MeoD8VBHPc6GRVjBdz3SqFUIS3WfUGzWd6Pt6lvBqiLZImxAIY55xoOSWyApTJSIG4j6vm49sZCSGz8tJTaT3u8.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Source: Coinshares Bitcoin Mining Report - December 2019</em></figcaption></figure><p>‍<strong>In summary, Bitcoin mining typically consumes electricity which would never reach an energy grid in a large population center.</strong> Any honest comparison of energy consumption between Bitcoin mining and other sources like heating and air conditioning or video game playing should account for this fact.</p><p>And to be clear, these mechanics incentivizing mining to occur in locations of overproduction (a majority of which is renewable energy) are applicable to Bitcoin mining outside of China, as well. On a global scale, it’s estimated that some <a href="https://coinshares.com/research/bitcoin-mining-network-june-2019">74% of all Bitcoin mining electricity comes from renewable energy sources</a>.</p><h2>The Takeaway&nbsp;</h2><p>Bitcoin’s energy consumption often gets singled out because it’s easy to quantify. Yes, <strong>Bitcoin mining is energy intensive</strong>. However,<strong> this is a necessary component of Bitcoin’s value proposition</strong>: borderless, scarce, digital, censorship resistant cash that you can use without trusting a 3rd party.&nbsp;</p><p>If you don’t recognize the value of Bitcoin and Bitcoin mining, perhaps it’s because you haven’t experienced slow and expensive cross-border transactions, hyperinflation, or financial censorship and disclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, let’s acknowledge a simple fact. <strong>If Bitcoin became worthless, all mining would stop.</strong> To put it bluntly: if you still believe that mining is highly problematic for the world, your best option is to work on improving the existing financial system to be more inclusive, more efficient, and more trustworthy so that it can outcompete Bitcoin and thus weaken the incentive for miners to operate.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h3>Get notified when we release new update</h3><div><div><p>Wohoo!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When it comes to mining centralization, the big concern that people have is a “51% attack” —&nbsp; where a single actor or group controls a majority of Bitcoin’s mining power and can effectively decide which transactions (if any) get confirmed in the blockchain.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides just disrupting or censoring the confirmation of new transactions, a 51% attack can also be used for a <em>double spend</em>. This means that the attacker mines a different version of the blockchain in secret so that they can spend some coins on the public chain and then later mute the transaction by publishing their version of the blockchain in which they retain ownership of the coins. Another name for this is a blockchain reorganization because it replaces the most recent blocks in the chain.&nbsp;</p><p>So far, there have been no successful 51% attacks on Bitcoin in its history, but we have seen successful attacks on other coins like <a href="https://blog.coinbase.com/ethereum-classic-etc-is-currently-being-51-attacked-33be13ce32de">Ethereum Classic</a>. <strong>If successful, such an attack would likely cause significant harm to Bitcoin’s reputation.</strong></p><h2>Measuring 1-Hour Cost of a 51% Attack</h2><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ff87059f5e95d17a5a0a826_SvpEcuX1WYEhxLGTMVanrolfdB6b6bn9BvePdjV9gXpUswxB4G8W9KSNpjVoCQV0rRrkOJL01VZYoxCePo0ig9gTT35_oNst_kTVXdCFNtwbD-NDZI9bxFlgpgsGNl_KpfteRqs.png" alt=""></p><figcaption><em>Source: Crypto51.app</em></figcaption></figure><p>There’s a cool website called <a href="https://www.crypto51.app/">Crypto51</a> which measures the cost to 51% attack Bitcoin and other major proof of work cryptocurrencies. If you go to the About page, it describes how the <em>1h Attack Cost</em> is calculated using the current market price (aka <em>spot price</em>) for hashrate from NiceHash (NH), a hashrate exchange that allows people to buy hashpower from miners and control what it’s used for. For non-miners, the significance of this may not be clear, so let’s explain it.</p><p>Supposing that a certain blockchain has a total network hashrate of 100 TH/s, then the cost of a 1-hour 51% attack is the cost of controlling more than 50 TH/s of the hashrate. <strong>If a majority of the hashrate is available on a hashrate exchange, then the 1-hour attack cost is simply the cost of purchasing that hashrate from the market for 1 hour.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>On Crypto51, the portion of a given cryptocurrency’s hashrate that’s available for purchase is represented by the <em>NiceHash-able</em> metric on the right side of the image above. A NH-able value below 100% means that less than 51% of the coin’s hashrate can be bought.</p><p><strong>For Bitcoin, the NH-able value is under 1%</strong>, and other hashrate exchanges do not add much to the value. In other words, the 1h Attack Cost is calculated based on the <em>spot</em> <em>price</em> for SHA-256 hashrate, but the volume of SHA-256 hashrate available on the market is not nearly large enough to make it a viable way to actually attack Bitcoin.</p><p>Since the value on Crypto51 isn’t realistic for Bitcoin, let’s dive into more detail about the <strong>different methods that could be used to 51% attack Bitcoin, how feasible they are, and what can be done to mitigate them.</strong> By the end, you’ll better understand the security provided by Bitcoin’s proof of work system.</p><h2>Bitcoin Cloud Mining and Hashrate Exchanges</h2><p>For most people, it will never be profitable to mine Bitcoin. This is because competitive electricity prices are typically only found in locations with energy production (e.g. hydroelectric dams, natural gas wells, etc.), not on an urban energy grid.</p><p>However, for people who want to speculate on <a href="https://insights.braiins.com/profitability-calculator">mining profitability</a>, cloud mining offers a way to do so. Cloud mining contracts enable people to “mine” cryptocurrencies without owning the physical hardware themselves. In other words, buyers purchase a specific amount of hashrate for a specific time period and price, then earn the mining rewards produced by that hashrate. Meanwhile, the miners still operate the mining equipment, but they get paid via the cloud mining contracts or hashrate market rather than the mining rewards.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ff8705975e8eb045ae2acfd_luPmOaLr5shJUFvumj0DDWQqEqEcFVi8QUeHbywHDY1DwkFLD4qRAgnY8YOY-SFak3QOPoDoESLSh6Tw6nqWqrFvh8h3nRKU6LBIFgZIhzk5b4CBXwlIV3SrirEvxsCsURNcKeg.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>Hypothetical example of cloud mining contracts</figcaption></figure><p>In order to make a clear distinction, from now on we will refer to hashrate sold on an exchange or via cloud mining contracts as <strong><em>synthetic hashrate</em></strong>, and hashrate used to mine directly as <strong><em>physical hashrate</em></strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>So, what does this have to do with Bitcoin’s security?</p><p><strong>Well, if a malicious actor wanted to attack a cryptocurrency network, it would be far simpler to purchase synthetic hashrate than to produce physical hashrate. </strong>However, there’s not nearly enough hashpower on hashrate exchanges to consider them as an attack vector against Bitcoin.</p><p>That being the case, let’s talk about the other possible attack methods.</p><h2>The Cost of a 51% Attack with Physical Hashrate</h2><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ff870592075d921f98c3937_Z0p_QkL9w9mZtEPkLUGmYBsLrlfvpdhdZrnHXPwQsz_jpEHdRu3Y1uoeK_7QtRTcVzNYA_R-3ZqW8B_g2uJ_B983Z3vcieFdQSAKsKDTKueXhECHqxhFDyjLP3ZZGNIrN9JipHE.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>With hashrate exchanges not being viable for accessing 51% of network hashrate, there are only two realistic attack vectors left:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li>Amassing enough ASICs (mining hardware) and power capacity to attack the network with physical hashrate</li><li>Controlling mining pools who have a combined majority of the synthetic hashrate</li></ul><p>Let’s start by analyzing the first case. <strong><em>How much would it cost to 51% attack Bitcoin with physical hashrate?</em></strong></p><p>With the current total network hashrate of 150 EH/s, we’ll calculate a rough estimate of the costs necessary to set up 150 EH/s worth of ASICs (assuming the miners with the existing 150 EH/s remain honest and don’t contribute to the attack). In the most favorable case where all hashrate is produced by an equivalent machine to the highest efficiency ASIC on the market today, the Antminer S19 Pro, then the specifications per ASIC would be <em>110 TH/s</em> and <em>3250 W</em> consumption.</p><p>150,000,000 TH/s / 110 TH/s = approximately <strong>1.364M ASICs needed to amass 150 EH/s.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>With a per-unit consumption of 3250 W, that would put the<strong> electricity capacity needed to power all those ASICs at ~4.4 GW of power</strong>. That limits the possible candidates to pull off such a huge endeavor to powerful nation states who would work in coordination with large energy producers.&nbsp;</p><p>And how much would those 1.364M ASICs cost the taxpayers of such a nation state? Well, at a conservative unit price of $4000 each including power supply units, the <strong>cost of hardware would exceed $5.46 billion</strong>. Factoring in all the R&amp;D costs to catch up to existing hardware manufacturers (who are already <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/secondary-markets-asic-bitcoin-mining-manufacturing-delays">sold out</a> until May 2021), plus all the other data center equipment needed, the true cost would likely be far higher.</p><p>In the grand scheme, this may still be a small sum to the likes of the USA or China. However, it doesn’t account for significant obstacles such as the limited capacity of chip manufacturers like Samsung and TSMC to actually produce these high quality hashing chips. (Not to mention the lunacy of a government using that semiconductor manufacturing capacity to build ASICs and attack Bitcoin rather than any number of other <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/cn/Documents/technology-media-telecommunications/deloitte-cn-tmt-semiconductors-the-next-wave-en-190422.pdf">valuable applications</a>.)&nbsp;</p><div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">In TSMC's 2018 annual report, the company produced 10,436 products for 481 customers. They have limited manufacturing space at their facilities and have to account for massive customers outside of the bitcoin mining space, including Sony, Qualcom, Broadcom, and, famously, Apple.</p>— Amanda Fabiano (@_amanda_fab) <a href="https://twitter.com/_amanda_fab/status/1338190445717770240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 13, 2020</a></blockquote> </div><p>‍<strong>Ultimately, attempting to destroy trust in Bitcoin through a mining attack with physical hashrate just doesn’t make sense anymore, and it hasn’t for years. </strong>Nation states who view Bitcoin as a threat are far more likely to over-regulate or (try to) ban its use than to spend billions of taxpayer dollars on mining hardware and power.</p><p>Still, that doesn’t mean that 51% attacks are completely impossible. Let’s now turn our attention back to synthetic hashrate. This time, instead of talking about hashrate exchanges and cloud mining, we’ll discuss mining pools.</p><h2>Synthetic Hashrate and China Mining Centralization&nbsp;</h2><p>Bitcoin mining pool centralization has been a near-constant source of FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) for years. However, it's usually misrepresented. <strong>Mining pool operators have long-term stakes in the Bitcoin network and just as little incentive to attempt an attack as miners themselves.</strong></p><p>You can read an explanation of why hashrate concentration is not a huge cause for concern in this <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/no-concentration-among-miners-isnt-going-to-break-bitcoin">Coindesk article</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A more interesting case to think about is if the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) were to try taking over several mining pool operations. Currently, ~97% of Bitcoin’s total network hashrate goes through Chinese pools.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ffc51f0aa5822321d9217ea_hashrate-distribution-jan11.png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p><figcaption>Bitcoin hashrate distribution chart; source:&nbsp;coin.dance</figcaption></figure><p>It’s extremely unlikely that the CCP will attempt any attack. Nonetheless, we’ll consider the possibility for a simple reason: attacking with physical hashrate would cost at least $5 billion, whereas attacking with synthetic hashrate by taking over several pools would be essentially FREE.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there’s a problem with this attack too: <strong>miners can switch pools in a matter of seconds. </strong>If the CCP were to attempt taking over the 4+ largest pools, they would have to hope that no miners switch to other pools so that they can sustain the attack for more than a few pointless minutes.</p><p>The less concentrated hashrate is in a few mining pools, the more difficult it would be to attempt a pool attack. However, mining pools are necessary for most miners today to stabilize their revenue, and concentration in a few pools is unavoidable.</p><p><strong>Therefore, one good way to increase the difficulty of a mining pool attack is to make it impossible to do covertly.</strong> In other words, the attack causes more damage the longer it is sustained, so it can be mitigated by ensuring that some miners would detect it within minutes and switch pools.&nbsp;</p><h2>Blockchain Reorganizations</h2><p>Every block in the blockchain references the block before it with a value in the block header called the <em>prevhash</em>. With Stratum V2, miners will be able to construct blocks themselves with data from their own nodes (a process called <em>Job Negotiation</em>), so if they are honest they’ll always reference the prevhash of the most recent block in the chain.&nbsp;</p><p>By taking block construction out of the pools’ hands, Stratum V2 can help miners ensure that they won’t contribute to secretly mining a “shadow” chain that gets broadcasted later in a blockchain reorganization attack. Similarly, they can ensure that their hashrate is not used to mine a different SHA-256 chain, such as Bitcoin Cash or Bitcoin SV.</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5e5fcd39a7ed2643c8f70a6a/5ff8705a486828862383eaa0_1g3TGyPQbP_BtqcKtlydb-K4BvCluBo-ERty8nsQt7EkRnQuBPnw_kNZHhD15uKhfV9asWCtr2qtL1DJqDDHKwup-j3RA59wbPq_VXS_kxgi4N9EQ9pW7rRvi37JH4XOcx4Liks.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>The chain with the largest block height is considered valid, so mining a longer chain in …</figcaption></figure></div></div>

			<p><span>I</span>n the past quarter century, enrollment in college English departments has sunk like the Pequod in <i>Moby Dick</i>. Meanwhile enrollment in science programs has skyrocketed. It’s understandable. Elon Musk, not Herman Melville, is the role model of the digital economy. But it doesn’t have to be that way, says Angus Fletcher, 44, an English professor at Ohio State University. Fletcher is part of “group of renegades,” he says, who are on a mission to plug literature back into the electric heart of contemporary life and culture. Fletcher has a plan—“apply science and engineering to literature”—and a syllabus, <i>Wonderworks: The 25 Most Powerful Inventions in the History of Literature</i>, his new book.</p><p>Before the England-born Fletcher got his Ph.D. in literature at Yale, he earned an undergraduate degree in neuroscience, followed by a four-year stint in a neurophysiology lab at the University of Michigan. He switched careers when he realized the biology of the brain wouldn’t take him far enough toward understanding our need for stories. “What’s special about the human brain is its power of storytelling,” Fletcher says. “Its power of narrative. Its power to invent futures and tell our past. So, I thought, ‘I’ll go to an English department and learn about narrative.’” Fletcher sees the human brain as mechanical, but insists it doesn’t operate like a computer. He spelled out his view for <i>Nautilus</i> readers in “<a href="https://nautil.us/issue/95/escape/why-computers-will-never-write-good-novels" target="_blank">Why Computers Will Never Write Good Novels</a>.”&nbsp;(The essay generated a lot of discussion. See Fletcher’s response below.)</p> <p><i>Wonderworks</i> consists of 25 chapters that delve into works from the <i>Iliad</i> to <i>Emma</i>, <i>In Search of Lost Time</i> to <i>My Brilliant Friend</i>, each representative of a particular “invention” to lighten sorrow or grief or create empathy or joy. “Each of these inventions had a unique purpose, engineered with its own intricate circuitry to click into our psyche in a different way,” Fletcher writes. <i>Wonderworks</i> is captivating, as is Fletcher, who speaks with infectious enthusiasm and clarity. I began our conversation on Zoom with a question about the difference between the human brain and a computer, the subject of his <i>Nautilus</i> article, and then turned to his provocative view that to save the humanities, literature must be taught as a science.</p><figure data-alt="Berger_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18197_cea7785b31f6a028bfa54af07d6f79ce.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>STORY SCIENTIST:</strong> Angus Fletcher once worked in a neuroscience lab. “But I had this conversion moment where I thought, ‘By studying the synapse, it’s just too small to answer the big questions about narrative and life,’” he says. So he said goodbye to the lab and became a professor of English at Ohio State University, where he teaches “story science.”</span><span>Sarah Lagrotteria</span></figcaption></figure><p><b>Is a big part of the difference between human brains and computers the fact that computers lack consciousness?</b><br></p><p>No. I’m making a completely mechanical argument for novels, literature, and narrative. Consciousness is like the existence of the 913th dimension. It may exist. It’s not up to me to say that it doesn’t exist. But I can tell you right now, no human is ever going to establish a definitive proof one way or the other. That’s because it’s a metaphysical problem. Humans exist in a physical space. The reason science and engineering have advanced is because we bracketed the problem of consciousness as something unanswerable. So it’s possible that computers are conscious. It’s possible that they’re not. That’s something I don’t think anyone can answer.</p><p><b>How did science advance because the problem of consciousness is unanswerable?</b></p><p>Let me say it this way. We can get everything we want in the world without understanding where consciousness comes from. So why are we pouring all this energy into it? The only reason for doing it is because people have a religious spiritual impulse. It’s like chasing God. We know where that got the monks in the Middle Ages.</p><p><b>Where did that get the monks?</b></p><p>It didn’t get them to invent the laws of thermodynamics or invent computers or discover evolution by natural selection. It got them into a lot of arguments. I think humans enjoy having arguments about irresolvable problems. It gives us something to do. What’s the best baseball team? What’s the source of consciousness? But other than as a ludic pastime, consciousness is not something that I think anyone would seriously investigate scientifically.</p><blockquote><p>Pragmatism isn’t the enemy of beauty. Pragmatism allows beauty to happen.</p> </blockquote><p><b>Are you saying the study of metaphysics did not lead to developments in science?</b><br></p><p>That’s exactly right. That’s the narrative I would tell. In the Middle Ages, people were obsessed with the questions, “Who is God? What does God want?” But we discovered over time, starting with Machiavelli and moving into Francis Bacon and the 19th- and 20th-century scientific revolutions, that the human brain can’t answer those questions. That’s because the human brain has evolved to practice science. Science is about making hypotheses and testing them in our physical world. It’s not about reaching the metaphysical. And literature is the origin of the modern scientific method.</p><p><b>Why do you call literature a technology?</b></p><p>A technology is any human-made thing that solves a problem. Most of our technology exists to master our world, to domesticate space. That’s why we have smartphones and smart homes and satellites. Literature tackles the opposite set of problems: not how to master the nonhuman world but how to master ourselves. It wrestles with the psychological problems inside us. Grief, lack of meaning, loneliness—literature was invented to deal with these problems. To have happy and democratic societies, effective engineers and scientists, we need people who are joyful, not angry, who have a deep sense of empathy and purpose, who have an ability for logic and problem-solving. You get all these things from literature.</p><p><b>When you call literature a technology, it sounds like you’re saying literature’s a machine.</b></p><p>I <i>am</i> saying it’s a machine! It’s a machine designed to work in concert with another machine, our brain. The purpose of the two machines is to accelerate each other. Literature is a way of accelerating human imagination. And human imaginations accelerate literature. This technology is just sitting on our bookshelves and almost none of us are using it. Students now flee literature departments for the sciences and engineering.</p><p><b>That makes the act of imagination sound so mechanical, don’t you think?</b></p><p>In one regard, narrative is a mechanical act. It doesn’t require imagination. It doesn’t require free will. It’s possible humans have no imagination and no free will. Yet we can still write novels and poetry because the fundamental constituent of those things is narrative. Now, the reason that people sometimes think that narrative is creative or imaginative is because narrative is not logical. It exists in the hypothetical, the counterfactual, the speculative. You can never write a true or a false novel. All you can write is a fictional novel. That’s why we might think of it as being imaginative. In the same way, we might think of anything that an engineer creates as being imaginative. But what we’re really saying is the novel is outside the realm of the logical. It’s in a different machine space, the machine space of narrative.</p><div>

</div><p><b>In the past 20 years, enrollment in English departments has dropped by 25 percent, while enrollment in STEM classes has doubled. Why is that?</b></p><p>I can tell you exactly why that is. English literature is not being taught in a way that is connecting with people. We’ve been taught in school to interpret literature, to say what it means, to identify its themes and arguments. But when you do that, you’re working against literature. I’m saying we need to find these technologies, these inventions, and connect them to your head, see what they can do for your brain. Literature isn’t about telling you what’s right or wrong or about giving you ideas. It’s about helping you troubleshoot your own head.</p><p><b>The chapters in <i>Wonderworks</i> include fun names for the inventions of literature. The names include “Almighty Heart,” “Serenity Elevator,” “Sorrow Resolver,” “Virtual Scientist.” How did literature invent the virtual scientist?</b></p><p>A virtual scientist has no ego. Our brains are born scientists. From the moment we’re born, we make hypotheses about what will happen if we do something. Then we test those hypotheses. We might say, “If I stick my hand in the fire, it might burn.” And then we stick our hand in the fire. We’re like, “Yes, that did burn.” We’re constantly running these experiments in our lives. We build stories and narratives as a way of organizing them. But what holds us back as scientists is our egos. That’s because we just don’t like to think we’re wrong. Present someone with a piece of data that contradicts what they think and they will deny your data. They will bend your data to fit their hypothesis. This is an endemic psychological process of the human mind.</p><p>So the question is, “How do we become better scientists?” The way to do that is to remove our ego. Literature provides us the space to do that. What is Sherlock Holmes doing? Sherlock Holmes has given us a problem that we need to solve experimentally by positing hypotheses, by testing them. But we’re not Sherlock Holmes and so it’s not embarrassing if we happen to be wrong. Sherlock Holmes and tons of great detective fiction allow us to play virtual scientists by going into a space where our ego doesn’t exist and we can practice our scientific method of making predictions and testing them.</p><blockquote><p>Most of our technology exists to domesticate space. Literature tackles the opposite: how to master ourselves.</p> </blockquote><p><b>I will say, Angus, <i>Wonderworks</i> made me a little anxious. I’m sure you know Auden’s lines from “In Memory of W.B. Yeats”: “For poetry makes nothing happen: it survives/In the valley of its making where executives/Would never want to tamper …” Reading literature as instructional makes me a little queasy. I read Proust for his mad rhapsodies and not for his “therapeutic effect.” That seems reductive, or …</b></p></div></div>

  <time datetime="2021-02-24T00:00:00+00:00">24 Feb 2021 ~ 4 minute read</time>
  <p>For the record, the process of leaving comments on my own pull requests isn’t something I came up with on my own. I adopted it from a previous colleague of mine, <a href="https://twitter.com/jean_cochrane" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jean Cochrane</a>.</p>

<p>A while ago, Jean was being onboarded onto a team I was responsible for. Part of the onboarding process involved working through a <a href="https://www.azavea.com/blog/2018/10/10/engineer-onboarding-breakable-toy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breakable toy</a> exercise, which is a project similar in toolset to the ones we’d work on day-to-day, but different in scope. As part of going through that, I encouraged Jean to take notes on any steps of the exercise that weren’t clear. Jean took that further and annotated each associated pull request with comments containing their in-context notes.</p>

<p>As a reviewer, it was phenomenal to have those prompts front and center. With them, we could immediately begin cutting through any existing ambiguity and work toward a joint understanding of the changes. <mark>It was a refreshing experience, and I’ve been trying to reproduce it for all of my pull request reviewers ever since.</mark></p>

<h2 id="the-process">The process</h2>

<p>Over the years, I’ve refined the process I use before assigning my pull requests for review. In the beginning, it consisted of making sure my changes worked and looked acceptable. That evolved into ensuring all of my commits represented logical changes to the codebase and were as concise as possible. Later, I began placing extra emphasis on clear and reproducible testing instructions.</p>

<p>I still believe all of these pursuits are important, but leaving comments on my own pull requests is the newest addition.</p>

<p>First, I open the pull request (or a draft pull request—if that feature is available to you). Immediately after, I scan through the changes and proactively annotate important lines with comments. The comments aim to direct the reviewer’s attention to areas of the code I think would benefit from direct engagement. Some examples include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Calling attention to a tradeoff I made</li>
  <li>Elaborating on a not so obvious change in the change set</li>
  <li>Self-identifying an area where I wasn’t 100% certain about the approach I took</li>
  <li>Explaining a concept I don’t think my reviewer has been exposed to yet</li>
</ul>

<p>While a lot of these issues can be covered in the pull request body, I find that associating the details directly with the relevant lines of code is far more inviting to reviewers. Now, instead of trying to guess the exact changes I was uncertain about, or skipping over unfamiliar parts of the change set, the reviewer receives a clear set of prompts with supporting detail from my perspective.</p>

<h2 id="real-world-examples">Real-world examples</h2>

<p>Here, I needed a way to annotate a container image with revision relevant tags and labels. There were several different approaches to choose from, but since this process is happening in GitHub Actions, I settled on the recommended approach by <a href="https://github.com/docker/build-push-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docker/build-push-action</a>.</p>

<p>It also felt important to leave a comment here because if I was reviewing this pull request and I saw the words “crazy max” strung together, it would have immediately triggered my spidey senses. No offense, Max. <img title=":laughing:" alt=":laughing:" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e9313a31fcb3d7f1a04a598afd09565f49ce4b4d/f5771/images/emoji/unicode/1f606.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>In this case, I upgraded a library in an earlier troubleshooting step. That didn’t end up resolving the issue, but after I did finally resolve it, I decided to keep the library upgrade in so that the dependencies would be up-to-date.</p>

<p>All library upgrades incur some risk. Are we both willing to agree that the risk is worthwhile here?</p>

<p>Here, I decided to proactively drop Python 3.5 support from an existing library because it was approaching end-of-life. However, when you’re a library maintainer, these types of changes can have a large impact. I wanted to draw attention to the change so that the maintainers could engage with my decision from their perspective.</p>

<p>I needed a way to supply Docker Hub credentials to a GitHub Actions workflow so that release specific container images could be published. In this case, I wasn’t the repository owner, so I couldn’t set up the credentials myself. I left this comment to provide the repository owners with as much detail as possible to help make credential set up easy.</p>

<p>Differentiating between code and pull request-level comments is a question I get asked often when discussing this technique. While it is important to strike a good balance between the two, I find myself encouraging people to worry less about answering this question and focusing more on creating pull request comments in a thoughtful way. If a reviewer reads a comment and thinks it is important enough to persist in the codebase, that’s an easy suggestion and change. Asking reviewers to request the removal of existing code comments is a heavier ask.</p>

<p>That said, here are few loose guidelines for navigating the decision-making process:</p>

<ul>
  <li>If your comment carries relevance beyond the lifecycle of a pull request, consider that it may benefit from being a code comment.</li>
  <li>If you’re making an <em>architecturally significant</em> decision in a pull request, then it probably warrants a separate write-up in an <a href="https://www.cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Architecture Decision Record</a>.</li>
  <li>If you find yourself leaving lots of pull request comments, reflect on whether your pull request is too large, your comments are truly beneficial, or if the code itself would benefit from more clarity.</li>
</ul>

			<p><span>S</span>uppose aliens existed, and imagine that some of them had been watching our planet for its entire four and a half billion years. What would they have seen? Over most of that vast timespan, Earth’s appearance altered slowly and gradually. Continents drifted; ice cover waxed and waned; successive species emerged, evolved, with many of them becoming extinct.</p><p>But in just a tiny sliver of Earth’s history—the last hundred centuries—the patterns of vegetation altered much faster than before. This signaled the start of agriculture—and later urbanization. The changes accelerated as the human population increased.</p><p>Then came even faster changes. Within just a century, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere began to rise dangerously fast. Radio emissions that couldn’t be explained by natural processes appeared and something else unprecedented happened: Rockets launched from the planet’s surface escaped the biosphere completely. Some spacecraft were propelled into orbits around the Earth; others journeyed to the moon, Mars, Jupiter, and even Pluto.</p><p>If those hypothetical aliens continued to keep watch, what would they witness in the next century? Will a final spasm of activity be followed by silence due to climate change? Or will the planet’s ecology stabilize? Will there be massive terraforming? Will an armada of spacecraft launched from Earth spawn new oases of life elsewhere?</p><figure data-alt="Livio_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18198_9769c201b88f46a83dabfc1b9f97a033.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>LASER POWER:</strong> A crucial impediment to space flight is the inefficiency of chemical fuel. One day a laser power station, located on Earth, might generate a beam to “push” a craft through space.</span><span>NASA / Pat Rawlings (SAIC)</span></figcaption></figure><p>Let’s think specifically about the future of space exploration. Successful missions such as Viking, Cassini, New Horizons, Juno, and Rosetta were all done with last-century technology. We can realistically expect that during this century, the entire solar system—planets, moons, and asteroids—will be explored by flotillas of robotic craft.<br></p><p>Will there still be a role for humans in crewed spacecraft?</p><p>There’s no denying that NASA’s new Perseverance rover speeding across the Jezero crater on Mars may miss some startling discoveries that no human geologist could reasonably overlook. But machine learning is advancing fast, as is sensor technology. In contrast, the cost gap between crewed and autonomous missions remains huge.</p><p>We believe the future of crewed spaceflight lies with privately funded adventurers like SpaceX and Blue Origin, prepared to participate in a cut-price program far riskier than western nations could impose on publicly supported projects. These ventures—bringing a Silicon-Valley-type culture into a domain long-dominated by NASA and a few aerospace conglomerates—have innovated and improved rocketry far faster than NASA or the European Space Agency have done. The future role of the national agencies will be attenuated—becoming more akin to an airport rather than to an airline.</p><blockquote><p>We are near the end of Darwinian evolution, but technological evolution of intelligent beings is just beginning.</p> </blockquote><p>We would argue that inspirationally led private companies should front all missions involving humans as cut-price high-risk ventures. There would still be many volunteers—a few perhaps even accepting one-way tickets—driven by the same motives as early explorers and mountaineers. The phrase “space tourism” should be avoided. It lulls people into believing such ventures are routine and low-risk. If that’s the perception, the inevitable accidents will be as traumatic as those of the space shuttle were. These exploits must be sold as dangerous, extreme sports, or intrepid exploration.<br></p><p>The most crucial impediment to space flight stems from the intrinsic inefficiency of chemical fuel, and the requirement to carry a weight of fuel far exceeding that of the payload. So long as we are dependent on chemical fuels, interplanetary travel will remain a challenge. Nuclear power could be transformative. Allowing much higher in-course speeds would drastically cut the transit times in the solar system, reducing not only astronauts’ boredom, but their exposure to damaging radiation. It’s more efficient if the fuel supply can be on the ground; for instance, propelling spacecraft into orbit via a “space elevator”—and then using a “star-shot”-type laser beam generated on Earth to push on a “sail” attached to the spacecraft.</p><p>By 2100, thrill seekers in the mold of Felix Baumgartner (the Austrian skydiver who in 2012 broke the sound barrier in free fall from a high-altitude balloon) may have established bases on Mars, or maybe even on asteroids. Elon Musk has said he wants to die on Mars—“but not on impact.” It’s a realistic goal, and an alluring one to some.</p><p>But don’t expect mass emigration from Earth. It’s a dangerous delusion to think that space offers an escape from Earth’s problems. We’ve got to solve those here. Coping with climate change or the COVID-19 pandemic may seem daunting, but it’s a piece of cake compared to terraforming Mars. There’s no place in our solar system that offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Mount Everest. Simply put, there’s no Planet B for ordinary risk-averse people.</p><p>Still, we (and our progeny here on Earth) should cheer on the brave space adventurers. They have a pivotal role to play in spearheading the post-human future and determining what happens in the 22nd century and beyond.</p><p><span>P</span>ioneer explorers will be ill-adapted to their new habitat, so they will have a compelling incentive to re-design themselves. They’ll harness the super-powerful genetic and cyborg technologies that will be developed in coming decades. This might be the first step toward divergence into a new species.</p><p>Organic creatures need a planetary surface environment on which life could emerge and evolve. But if post-humans make the transition to fully inorganic intelligence, they won’t need an atmosphere. They may even prefer zero-gravity, especially for constructing massive artifacts. It’s in deep space that non-biological brains may develop powers that humans can’t even imagine.</p><p>There are chemical and metabolic limits to the size and processing power of organic brains. Maybe we are close to these limits already. But no such limits apply to or constrain electronic computers (still less, perhaps, quantum computers). So, by any definition of “thinking,” the amount and intensity that can be achieved by organic human-type brains will be swamped by the cerebrations of AI.</p><p>We are perhaps near the end of Darwinian evolution, but technological evolution of intelligent beings is only just beginning. It may happen fastest away from Earth—we wouldn’t expect (and certainly wouldn’t wish for) such rapid changes in humanity here on the Earth, though our survival may depend on ensuring the AI on Earth remains “benevolent.”</p><figure data-alt=" Livio_BREAKER-3"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18200_33ec1f50197cc4f74b3e8dc359ec3280.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>SPACE TOURISM:</strong> Private space companies should avoid the phrase “space tourism,” write Martin Ress and Mario Livio. It lulls people into believing such ventures are routine and low-risk. They’re more like extreme sports.</span><span>NASA / Jet Propulsion Laboratory</span></figcaption></figure><p>Few doubt machines will gradually surpass or enhance more and more of our distinctively human capabilities. Disagreements are only about the timescale on which this will happen. Inventor and futurist Ray Kurzweil says it will be just a matter of a few decades. More cautious scientists envisage centuries. Either way, the timescales for technological advances are an instant compared to the timescales of the Darwinian evolution that led to humanity’s emergence—and more relevantly, less than a millionth of the vast expanses of cosmic time ahead. The products of future technological evolution could surpass humans by as much as we have surpassed slime mold.<br></p><p>But, you may wonder, what about consciousness?</p><p>Philosophers and computer scientists debate whether consciousness is something that characterizes only the type of wet, organic brains possessed by humans, apes, and dogs. Would electronic intelligences, even if their intellects would seem superhuman, lack self-awareness? The ability to imagine things that do not exist? An inner life? Or is consciousness an emergent property that any sufficiently complex network will eventually possess? Some say it’s irrelevant and semantic, like asking whether submarines can swim.</p><blockquote><p>Extraterrestrial civilization might consist of a swarm of microscopic probes that could have evaded notice.</p> </blockquote><p>We don’t think it is. If the machines are what computer scientists refer to as “zombies,” we would not accord their experiences the same value as ours, and the post-human future would seem rather bleak. On the other hand, if they are conscious, we should welcome the prospect of their future hegemony.<br></p><p>What will their guiding motivation be if they become fully autonomous entities? We have to admit we have absolutely no idea. Think of the variety of bizarre motives (ideological, financial, political, egotistical, and religious) that have driven human endeavors in the past. Here’s one simple example of how different they could be from our naive expectations: They could be contemplative. Even less obtrusively, they may realize it’s easier to think at low temperatures, therefore getting far away from any star, or even hibernating for billions of years until the cosmic microwave background cooled down far below its current 3 degrees Kelvin. At the other edge of the spectrum, they could be expansionist, which seems to be the expectation of most who’ve thought about the future trajectory of civilizations.</p><p>Even if life had originated only on Earth, it need not remain a marginal, trivial feature of the cosmos. Humans could jump-start a diaspora whereby ever-more complex intelligence spreads through the galaxy, transcending our limitations. The “sphere of influence” (or some would envisage a “frontier of conquest”) could encompass the entire galaxy, spreading via self-reproducing machines, transmitting DNA or instructions for 3-D printers. The leap to neighboring stars is just an early step …</p></div></div>

			<p><span>E</span>veryone seems to be talking about the problems with physics: Peter Woit’s book <i>Not Even Wrong</i>, Lee Smolin’s <i>The Trouble With Physics</i>, and Sabine Hossenfelder’s <i>Lost in Math</i> leap to mind, and they have started a wider conversation. But is all of physics really in trouble, or just some of it? If you actually read these books, you’ll see they’re about so-called “fundamental” physics. Some other parts of physics are doing just fine, and I want to tell you about one. It’s called “condensed matter physics,” and it’s the study of solids and liquids. We are living in the golden age of condensed matter physics.</p><p>But first, what is “fundamental” physics? It’s a tricky term. You might think any truly revolutionary development in physics counts as fundamental. But in fact physicists use this term in a more precise, narrowly delimited way. One of the goals of physics is to figure out some laws that, at least in principle, we could use to predict everything that can be predicted about the physical universe. The search for these laws is fundamental physics.</p><blockquote><p>There is still plenty of mind-blowing new physics being done.</p> </blockquote><p>The fine print is crucial. First: “in principle.” In principle we can use the fundamental physics we know to calculate the boiling point of water to immense accuracy—but nobody has done it yet, because the calculation is hard. Second: “everything that can be predicted.” As far we can tell, quantum mechanics says there’s inherent randomness in things, which makes some predictions <i>impossible</i>, not just impractical, to carry out with certainty. And this inherent quantum randomness sometimes gets amplified over time, by a phenomenon called chaos. For this reason, even if we knew everything about the universe now, we couldn’t predict the weather precisely a year from now. So, even if fundamental physics succeeded perfectly, it would be far from giving the answer to all our questions about the physical world. But it’s important nonetheless, because it gives us the basic framework in which we can try to answer these questions.<br></p><p><span>A</span>s of now, research in fundamental physics has given us the Standard Model (which seeks to describe matter and all the forces <i>except</i> gravity) and General Relativity (which describes gravity). These theories are tremendously successful, but we know they are not the last word. Big questions remain unanswered—like the <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/48/chaos/the-physicist-who-denies-dark-matter" target="_blank">nature of dark matter</a>, or whatever is fooling us into thinking there’s dark matter. Unfortunately, progress on these questions has been very slow since the 1990s. Luckily fundamental physics is not all of physics, and today it is no longer the most exciting part of physics. There is still plenty of mind-blowing new physics being done. And a lot of it—though by no means all—is condensed matter physics.</p><p>Traditionally, the job of condensed matter physics was to predict the properties of solids and liquids found in nature. Sometimes this can be very hard: for example, computing the boiling point of water. But now we know enough fundamental physics to design strange new materials—and then actually <i>make</i> these materials, and probe their properties with experiments, testing our theories of how they should work. Even better, these experiments can often be done on a table top. There’s no need for <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/18/genius/who-really-found-the-higgs-boson" target="_blank">enormous particle accelerators</a> here.</p><div>

</div><p>Let’s look at an example. We’ll start with the humble “hole.” A crystal is a regular array of atoms, each with some electrons orbiting it. When one of these electrons gets knocked off somehow, we get a “hole”: an atom with a missing electron. And this hole can actually move around like a particle! When an electron from some neighboring atom moves to fill the hole, the hole moves to the neighboring atom. Imagine a line of people all wearing hats except for one whose head is bare: If their neighbor lends them their hat, the bare head moves to the neighbor. If this keeps happening, the bare head will move down the line of people. The absence of a thing can act like a thing!<br></p><p>The famous physicist Paul Dirac came up with the idea of holes in 1930. He correctly predicted that since electrons have negative electric charge, holes should have positive charge. Dirac was working on fundamental physics: He hoped the proton could be explained as a hole. That turned out not to be true. Later physicists found another particle that could: the “positron.” It’s just like an electron with the opposite charge. And thus antimatter—the evil twin of <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/47/consciousness/is-matter-conscious" target="_blank">ordinary matter</a>, with the same mass but the opposite charge—was born. (But that’s another story.)</p><blockquote><p>We now live in the era of “designer matter.”</p> </blockquote><p>In 1931, Werner Heisenberg applied the idea of holes to condensed matter physics. He realized that, just as electrons create an electrical current as they move along, so do holes—but because they’re positively charged, their electrical current goes in the other direction! It became clear that holes carry electrical current in some of the materials called “semiconductors”: for example, silicon with a bit of aluminum added to it. After many further developments, in 1948 the physicist William Schockley patented transistors that use both holes and electrons to form a kind of switch. He later won the Nobel Prize for this, and now they’re widely used in computer chips.<br></p><p>Holes in semiconductors are not really particles in the sense of fundamental physics. They are just a convenient way of thinking about the motion of electrons. But any sufficiently convenient abstraction takes on a life of its own. The equations that describe the behavior of holes are just like the equations that describe the behavior of particles. So, we can treat holes <i>as if</i> they are particles. We’ve already seen that a hole is positively charged. But because it takes energy to get a hole moving, a hole also <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/54/the-unspoken/physics-has-demoted-mass" target="_blank">acts like it has a mass</a>. And so on: The properties we normally attribute to particles also make sense for holes.</p><p>Physicists have a name for things that act like particles even though they’re not: “quasiparticles.” There are many kinds; holes are just one of the simplest. The beauty of quasiparticles is that we can practically make them to order, having a vast variety of properties. As the quantum physicist Michael Nielsen put it, we now live in the era of “designer matter.”</p><p>For example, consider the “exciton.” Since an electron is negatively charged and a hole is positively charged, they attract each other. And if the hole is much heavier than the electron—remember, a hole has a mass—an electron can orbit a hole much as an electron orbits a proton in a hydrogen atom. Thus, they form a kind of artificial atom called an exciton. It’s a ghostly dance of presence and absence!</p><figure data-alt="Baez_BREAKER"><img src="http://static.nautil.us/18201_23038c01c7e628d1eec505640a5a8472.png" width="733" alt=""><figcaption><span><strong>OPPOSITES ATTRACT:</strong> This is how an exciton, the binding together of a positively charged “hole” and an electron, moves inside a crystal lattice.</span><span>Wikipedia</span></figcaption></figure><p>The idea of excitons goes back all the way to 1931. By now we can make excitons in large quantities in certain semiconductors and other materials. They don’t last for long: The electron quickly falls back into the hole. It often takes less than a billionth of a second for this to happen. But that’s enough time to do some interesting things. Just as two atoms of hydrogen can stick together and form a molecule, two excitons can stick together and form a “biexciton.” An exciton can stick to another hole and form a “trion.” An exciton can even stick to a <i>photon</i>—a particle of light—and form something called a “polariton.” It’s a blend of matter and light!<br></p><p>Can you make a gas of artificial atoms? Yes! At low densities and high temperatures, excitons zip around very much like atoms in a gas. Can you make a liquid? Again, yes: At higher densities, and colder temperatures, excitons bump into each other enough to act like a liquid. At even colder temperatures, excitons can even form a “superfluid,” with almost zero viscosity: if you could somehow get it swirling around, it would go on practically forever.</p><p>This is just a small taste of what researchers in condensed matter physics are doing these days. Besides excitons, they are studying a host of other quasiparticles. A “phonon” is a quasiparticle of sound formed from vibrations moving through a crystal. A “magnon” is a quasiparticle of magnetization: a pulse of electrons in a crystal whose spins have flipped. The list goes on, and becomes ever more esoteric.</p><p>But there is also much more to the field than quasiparticles. Physicists can now create materials in which the speed of light is much slower than usual, say 40 miles an hour. They can even create materials in which light moves as if there were two space dimensions and two time dimensions, instead of the usual three dimensions of space and one of time! Normally we think that time can go forward in just one direction, but in these substances light has a choice between many different directions it can go “forward in time.” On the other hand, its motion in <i>space</i> is confined to a plane.</p><p>In short, the possibilities of condensed matter are limited only by our imagination and the <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/71/flow/why-beauty-is-fatal-to-physics" target="_blank">fundamental laws of physics</a>.</p><p><span>A</span>t this point, usually some skeptic comes along and questions whether these things are useful. Indeed, some of these new materials are likely to be <i>useful</i>. In fact a lot of condensed matter physics, while less glamorous than what I have just described, is carried out precisely to develop new improved computer chips—and also technologies like “photonics,” which uses light instead of electrons. The fruits of photonics are ubiquitous—it saturates modern technology, like flat-screen TVs—but physicists are now aiming for more radical applications, like computers that process information using light.</p><p>Then typically some other kind of skeptic comes along and asks if condensed matter physics is “just engineering.” Of course the very premise of this question is insulting: There is nothing wrong with engineering! Trying to build useful things is not only important in itself, it’s a great way to raise <a href="https://nautil.us/issue/69/patterns/the-math-that-takes-newton-into-the-quantum-world" target="_blank">deep new questions about physics</a>.

When running processes on Unix systems,
it is important that every process be waited-on by its parent process.
<p>
Processes (such as "daemons") should not be run in "the background",
orphaned and reparented to init,
such that nothing will be notified if they exit.
</p><p>
Instead, they should be run under some other program, perhaps a process supervisor, which will wait on them;
much has been
<a href="https://jdebp.uk/FGA/unix-daemon-design-mistakes-to-avoid.html">written about</a>
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/daemon.html">this before.</a>
</p><p>
This is absolutely true and correct,
and any system that is starting up processes in "the background" and just letting them leak
is fundamentally flawed and must be fixed;
and a dedicated process supervisor, running as a daemon, is a good way to approach fixing such problems.
</p><p>
But ultimately, the dedicated process supervisor daemon isn't necessary.
</p><p>
Starting and waiting on child processes is something any Unix program can do.
There's no need for a specialized process supervision daemon.
</p><p>
If I have a collection of processes which together provide some functionality or application,
it's natural for me to start those processes as my own child processes,
and then wait on them and implement my own failure-handling policies
based on the domain-specific information that I have about their behavior.
</p><p>
With this approach,
I start the child processes that are relevant to me and then <em>keep running</em>,
waiting on those child processes and performing any maintenance tasks necessary (such as restarting failed processes).
</p><p>
This is a naturally recursive structure,
where a given process might spawn more child processes to perform its task,
each of which might in turn spawn still more child processes.
</p><p>
This recursive structure ultimately bottoms out at the init process - systemd or something else.
</p><p>
With systemd, a weak form of this recursive structure is always the case:
The "system instance" of systemd (which is the init process)
starts and waits on a "user instance" of systemd for each interactive user;
the user instance in turn runs and waits on various user processes, such as a desktop environment.
</p><p>
But systemd only allows for two levels of recursion: system, then user.
There's no way to start a systemd instance that just manages a single user application,
with a lifecycle tied to that single application.
</p><p>
The best way to achieve further such recursion is to simply write a regular Unix program
which just starts its own child processes and waits on them.
</p><p>
Indeed, this is already how most applications which run child processes work.
They don't delegate the core Unix primitive of "fork and exec" to some system service;
they simply perform it themselves.
</p><p>
Many designs are much easier when starting one's own child processes.
If I want to connect two processes with a socketpair,
the simple and obvious way is to create the socketpair, then start the two processes,
so that they inherit the file descriptors.
If I want to start some processes in the same set of namespaces,
similarly the easiest way is to just enter those namespaces and then start the processes.
And, of course, if I want to handle process failure with more intelligence than "restart it 5 times",
it's easy to implement that logic in a general purpose programming language.
</p><p>
Delegating this basic functionality to a separate service like systemd provides little benefit,
if one is careful to monitor one's own child processes.
</p><p>
With modern programming languages and <a href="https://github.com/catern/rsyscall">libraries</a>,
it's easier than ever to write Unix programs which start and wait on collections of processes.
</p><p>
When building your next multi-process system,
consider starting and monitoring processes directly,
instead of using a process supervisor.
</p><p>
It can make sophisticated designs much easier,
and also combines well with <a href="http://catern.com/distsys.html">richly typed designs</a>.

            <section>
                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="programrejectedformentalhealthreasons">PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</h2>
<p>In 1972, two students learning FORTRAN came up with a fantastic new programming language called INTERCAL.  INTERCAL is a bit unusual. For example, single quotes are called <em>sparks</em>, and double quotes are called <em>rabbit ears</em>, less than (&lt;) is an <em>angle</em>, and a dash (-) is a <em>worm</em>.  This makes the manual read like a word puzzle combined with an extended in-joke:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One final comment about sparks and rabbit-ears; if the next character in the program is a spot, as often happens because onespot variables are common choices for operands, a spark and the following spot can be combined into a wow (!). - <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm">INTERCAL Manual</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The compiler errors are where the authors got genuinely creative. Errors include <code>VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</code> for accessing an array incorrectly, <code>IT CAME FROM BEYOND SPACE</code> for invalid control flow, <code>PROGRAM REJECTED FOR MENTAL HEALTH REASONS</code> for threading issues, <code>I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</code> for file not found, and <a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/intercal/ick.htm#Errors">many many more</a>.</p>
<p>Yes, this is a parody language, and reading the manual, you get the sense that no one has yet had as much fun writing technical documentation as Lyon and Woods did writing this.</p>
<p>The language itself looks less fun.  Here is <a href="http://www.rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Intercal">Hello World</a>:</p>
<pre><code>       NOTE THIS IS INTERCAL
       PLEASE ,1 &lt;- #5
       DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #54
       DO ,1 SUB #2 &lt;- #192
       DO ,1 SUB #3 &lt;- #136
       PLEASE ,1 SUB #4 &lt;- #208
       DO ,1 SUB #5 &lt;- #98
       DO COME FROM (1)
       DO READ OUT ,1
(2)    DO ,1 SUB #1 &lt;- #134
(1)    PLEASE ABSTAIN FROM (2)
</code></pre>
<p>One of the exciting innovations of INTERCAL is the <code>COMEFROM</code> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COMEFROM#Examples">instruction</a>, seen here in a variant of BASIC.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<pre><code>10 COMEFROM 40
20 INPUT "WHAT IS YOUR NAME? "; A$
30 PRINT "HELLO, "; A$
40 REM
</code></pre>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> anywhere in a program can grab control flow from the line you are reading. And in some implementations, if many <code>COMEFROM</code>'s reference the same line, execution splits off in each direction.</p>
<p>A <code>COMEFROM</code> is the inverse of a <code>GOTO</code> statement with multi-threading thrown in. It breaks the mental model of imperative execution where each line's evaluation leads to the next line. The idea that you can simulate its execution in your head, line by line, is fundamental to imperative programming and <code>COMEFROM</code> attempts to break that model.</p>
<h2 id="variablesmaynotbestoredinwesthyperspace">VARIABLES MAY NOT BE STORED IN WEST HYPERSPACE</h2>
<p>At Twitter, they have a giant monorepo with lots of services in it.  And somebody at Twitter wanted to know which language was most prevalent.  Which language does Twitter use the most?</p>
<p>Java came in 3rd, and Scala came in 2nd. But 1st was a surprise.  The number one programming language used at Twitter was YAML.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup></p>
<p>YAML usually doesn't feel like a programming language to me.  The file I'm currently writing in is in markdown with some YAML at the top to set the title and associated fields:</p>
<pre><code>title: INTERCAL, YAML, And Other Horrible Programming Languages
author: Adam
</code></pre>
<p>Nothing executes this YAML. It only offers some information to the blogging platform. But I don't think that is the type of YAML that made up the bulk of config at Twitter.</p>
<p>I suspect a lot of it was build and deployment scripts in the form of YAML. It was the type of configuration that encoded the control flow of some external system.  YAML like that lives in this grey zone between declarative configuration and a full-blown programming language.</p>
<p>I'll show you what I mean. Let's look at an example from <a href="https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck/blob/master/.travis.yml">shellcheck</a>'s build script:</p>
<pre><code>language: shell
os: linux

services:
  - docker
</code></pre>
<p>That seems like straight-forward config.</p>
<pre><code>jobs:
  include:
    - stage: Build
      env: BUILD=linux
      workspaces:
        create:
          name: ws-linux
          paths: deploy
</code></pre>
<p><code>create</code>, in the above, is starting to seem a bit more like execution. Let's continue.</p>
<pre><code>      script:
        - ls -la ${CASHER_DIR}/ || true
        - tar -xvf ${CASHER_DIR}/ws-osx-fetch.tgz --strip-components=5
        - ls -la deploy
        - ./.github_deploy
</code></pre>
<p>Now the YAML has just devolved into specifying how to execute a grab bag of commands.  We haven't seen control-flow yet, but it's coming.</p>
<pre><code>      if: type = push
      script:
        - source ./.multi_arch_docker
        - set -ex; multi_arch_docker::main; set +x
</code></pre>
<p>There we go, branching. It's an if statement in a YAML file!</p>
<p>That was for TravisCI but this isn't TravisCI, or CI specific.  Here is a simple example from Ansible:</p>
<pre><code>- hosts: all
  tasks:
    - include: foo.yml
      when: something == "foo"
    
    - include: bar.yml
      when: something == "bar"
</code></pre>
<p>Here is GitHub Actions:</p>
<pre><code>steps:
 - name: Step 7
   if: ${{ github.event_name == 'pull_request' &amp;&amp; github.event.action == 'unassigned' }}
   run: echo This event is a pull request that had an assignee removed.
</code></pre>
<p>Here is part of a Grafana <a href="https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/grafana/templates/deployment.yaml">Helm Chart</a>:</p>
<pre><code>
{{ if (or (not .Values.persistence.enabled) (eq .Values.persistence.type "pvc")) }}
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: {{ template "grafana.fullname" . }}
  namespace: {{ template "grafana.namespace" . }}
  labels:
    {{- include "grafana.labels" . | nindent 4 }}
{{- if .Values.labels }}
{{ toYaml .Values.labels | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
{{- with .Values.annotations }}
  annotations:
{{ toYaml . | indent 4 }}
{{- end }}
</code></pre>
<p>I think this is a problem. Writing control flow in a config file is like hammering in a screw. It's a useful tool being used for the wrong job<sup><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">[3]</a></sup>.</p>
<p>How did we get to this world of little programming languages embedded into YAML? Is calling something configuration just less scary? And if so, is a c++ program just config you give to gcc?</p>
<p>Did things ever get this complicated in XML times?</p>
<p>It turns out they did:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="text" omit-xml-declaration="yes" /&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template match="/"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="1" /&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;

  &lt;xsl:template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name="i" /&gt;
    &lt;xsl:choose&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="($i mod 3) = 0 and ($i mod 5) = 0"&gt;FizzBuzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 3 = 0"&gt;Fizz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:when test="$i mod 5 = 0"&gt;Buzz&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:when&gt;
      &lt;xsl:otherwise&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select="$i" /&gt;&lt;xsl:text&gt;&amp;#xa;&lt;/xsl:text&gt;&lt;/xsl:otherwise&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:choose&gt;
    &lt;xsl:if test="$i &amp;lt; 100"&gt;
      &lt;xsl:call-template name="FizzBuzz"&gt;
        &lt;xsl:with-param name="i" select="$i + 1" /&gt;
      &lt;/xsl:call-template&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:if&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>That is <code>FizzBuzz</code> in <a href="https://gist.github.com/JustinPealing/6f619a23729720a9c14d9917201028c8">XSLT</a>. I assume it was written in jest, but in many ways, XML and XSLT are better than an ad-hoc YAML based scripting language. XSLT is a documented and standardized thing, not just some ad-hoc format for specifying execution.</p>
<p>It burns my eyes to look at it, but at least XSLT was intended to be used as a programming language. That is something we can't say about YAML or INTERCAL.</p>
<p>The problem with these languages embedded into YAML is they are all one-off implementations.  TravisCI conditionals have a TravisCI specific syntax, usage, and features. You can't use Travis's <code>concat</code> function or conditional regex in the YAML configuration for your ansible playbooks.</p>
<p>In a vague way, this YAML problem is like the <code>COMEFROM</code> problem. If you know yaml, you can't just open a .yml file and start reading file line by line.  You need to understand how the configuration controls the execution of the specific system it's for.  And that is hard.</p>
<h2 id="ihavenofileandimustscream">I HAVE NO FILE AND I MUST SCREAM</h2>
<p>The line between configuration and programming languages is not some bright dividing line. It's easy to slowly drift into adding programming language constructs to a config file. Before you know it, you have a full unspecified programming language embedded in the interpretation of your config file.</p>
<p>That is the worst of both worlds, and so much YAML seems to drift into this area.</p>
<p>I like YAML more than XML, but for control flow, you know what would be better than YAML? Anything else!  Maybe even INTERCAL? I mean, how bad could a joke programming language be?</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>So, I decided to bolster my security this year, and invest in a YubiKey. One of its less obvious features is OpenPGP support; this means as well as U2F and TOPT authentication, you can use it for all kinds of cryptographic possibilities. Those familiar with SmartCards will probably already be familiar with what they can do, and that is the important point. The YubiKey is also an OpenPGP Smartcard.</p>

<h3 id="tl-dr">TL;DR</h3>

<p>If you're time poor, you <em>might</em> not have time to set up PGP properly, so as a first step consider using Signal and ProtonMail (they are both secure and free). At least then you can be confident you are set up to communicate via encrypted channels.</p>

<p>Your motivation to set up PGP keys will most likely depend on need such as being a journalist, wanting to sign your code or perhaps you are just a curious geek. It seems today few people are using PGP encrypted e-mail, and of those that are, probably most are using services like ProtonMail which is a good step, but doesn't let you use your own master key without uploading it*, which complicates things if you require the <strong>highest</strong> level of security.</p>

<p>* <a href="https://protonmail.com/support/knowledge-base/how-is-the-private-key-stored/" rel="nofollow">It will be stored encrypted with your password though</a>. So they never have access to it. Keeping your certification key off the internet entirely is possibly overkill for most users.</p>

<p>That being said – I think if you are willing to try, the more private communications there are in the wild, the less they stick out – so you help to mitigate mass surveillance operations, and you have secure channels of communication ready, should the need ever arise (which often becomes much more difficult to do safely / legally, if that day comes).</p>

<h2 id="the-basics">The Basics</h2>

<p>PGP allows you to sign, encrypt and authenticate (and certify) basically anything. This covers numerous activities such as:</p>
<ul><li>encrypting / decrypting messages such as emails</li>
<li>signing git commits &amp; software releases</li>
<li>authenticating via SSH</li>
<li>proving that all of the above were done by you</li></ul>

<p>To get the full benefit of PGP, you need to keep your master key safe – as if that is compromised, you lose nearly all the benefits of using it in the first place. Obviously the greater your personal need for operations security, the higher the risks of somebody targeting your key. The PGP system was designed to easily protect your information, even from threats like nation states, so much of the advice you will see on PGP is uncompromising – and is focused on how to <strong>maximise</strong> security.</p>

<p>In practice, few of us are in need of Edward Snowden levels of security – although if your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_security" rel="nofollow"><em>opsec</em></a> is strong (especially for journalists), you might be more likely to have a high security source trust you with their leaks or tips.</p>

<h2 id="generating-a-master-key">Generating a Master Key</h2>

<p>Already we are faced here with options, and I think this is what puts off most people right from the start. You really need to use the command line, decide what key length (and algorithm) you are going to use, and decide where you are going to generate your key.</p>

<p>I chose to generate a 4096-bit RSA key.</p>

<p>The main options are:</p>
<ul><li>Just using your current machine
<ul><li>This is the easiest, but is also the least secure, as a compromised machine could leak your key to the world</li></ul></li>
<li>Directly on SmartCard / YubiKey
<ul><li>This is simple and secure (as long as nobody can hack your key)</li>
<li>Even you cannot remove the master key from your YubiKey, and risk losing access</li></ul></li>
<li>Using an offline system
<ul><li>This involves having a live operating system from something like a USB drive, and while you might upgrade stuff using the internet, or install tools to manage your YubiKey, you pull the internet cable before generating your key, and you shut down the machine without internet when complete.</li></ul></li>
<li>Offline system in an air-gapped room
<ul><li>This is the Snowden level option, if you think that you are being targeted by the most advanced capabilities, then you would literally need to scrub a room (that functions as a faraday cage) of all electronics, and probably better using a single write medium with no electronic components like a DVD-R for the live operating system, and you would need to leave your phone out of this room, and then you should probably destroy and scrub everything after generating the key, and even then you would need to be careful to encrypt your messages in a similarly safe environment if possible, because frankly at this point people are potentially trying to hack you, add keyloggers, and find easier ways of breaking your encryption than actually having to decrypt your messages. Which you will never 100% guarantee they won't be able to do, as the three letter agency types of the world would not tell you if they could – although the strongest available encryption is the best you've got, and it probably will work.</li>
<li>I mostly add this option as a joke, because obviously organisations like the NSA and GCHQ have this sort of practice baked into their offices along with all the physical security etc. so even if you were to try this at home, without the resources to manage this level of security – you would probably fall down somewhere, but we can all dream right!?
<br></li></ul></li></ul>

<p>I opted for the offline system, and ran into a few problems, such as my laptops WiFi card not being supported by the stock Debian live USB, and my other machine (which has cabled LAN) didn't have USB-C ports (which my YubiKey does). In the end I bought a USB-C (f) –&gt; USB A adapter and used the LAN. This worked well, and I was able to get the packages I needed, pull the LAN cable, and then generate my key following <a href="https://github.com/drduh/YubiKey-Guide" rel="nofollow">these instructions</a>.</p>

<p><em>The important thing is that the instructions are really precise and often if you get a step wrong, you will need to start from scratch.</em></p>

<p>I then loaded up my laptop and (having made a USB key with an encrypted partition with private keys and revocation certificate, and an un-encrypted partition with the public key, as per the guide), tried to load my public key onto my machine, so I could start using my YubiKey – which had the signing, encryption and authentication keys loaded onto it now. Sadly my public key partition didn't mount and I had already shut-down the offline system so I had to load the live disk back up install some packages again and pull the LAN cable, and then load up my encrypted partition (which did mount), and restore my keys – this is the only copy of the master key, emergency revocation key and public key – so losing that would have meant starting from scratch. Once I had fixed my issues with the backup USB key, I was able to restore my public key to my laptop, and continue.</p>

<h2 id="backing-it-up">Backing it up</h2>

<p>Now, I had so far neglected to make any other backup of my keys other than the encrypted USB stick, and bit-rot is a genuine risk, so I also wanted to make physical backups – and so I used a tool <code>paperkey</code> to print them using my live USB, and restoring keys from the encrypted USB, and obviously this time I also needed to install printer drivers and things. Technically printers are a risk too, so for the ultra-paranoid you might want to either not have a backup and risk getting locked out of your own keys, or find some more reliable medium. For convenience I would have backed up my master key with a QR code tool, however the 4096 bit RSA key I generated was too big to QR – so for that I would have OCR scan it to revive the key.</p>

<h2 id="using-the-key">Using the key</h2>

<p>The first thing I did was submit my public key to a few <code>keyservers</code> which enables other users to trivially discover my public key, which is all they need to send me encrypted messages – and importantly means if I for some reason lose it, I can download it again myself. I then followed some examples of encrypting messages to myself, and decrypting them on the command line – just to try it. That all worked well.</p>

<p>I was initially excited to try and use my keys with ProtonMail, which has full PGP support and is my current e-mail provider, only to discover that it would require that I upload my private key the way it currently works – so I just had to leave it in a situation where I have different public keys for my email accounts in ProtonMail, and I don't really want to leave the service – but I was frustrated that I couldn't use it.</p>

<p>I then also got excited about Social Proofs (which is a mixture between actually verifying ownership of various accounts, and stamp collecting). I tried keybase.io – it worked, and while it did ask me to optionally upload my private key, it was able to do all the “proofs”, with me signing the actions on my local machine. The purchase of Keybase by Zoom however put me off, and various practices like mounting drives and adding stuff to startup made me remove KeyBase entirely from my system – unfortunately they just don't seem to have managed to maintain trust, respect and sufficient usage for their (originally noble goals) to pan out in the long run. I did like their idea though.</p>

<p>Next I tried a distributed social proof tool called KeyOxide – <a href="https://keyoxide.org/1AFD9615CAB90BE7" rel="nofollow">here are my proofs</a> (should you wish to contact me). KeyOxide is less automated than Keybase, doesn't have file sharing and private messaging, but it also doesn't need you to create an account or upload anything, doesn't need apps, and its proof system works well.</p>

<p>Of course, social proofs and identities matched to your cryptographic identity are not for people flying under the radar – but it is a mistake that cryptography is only for those people. I'm happy that I have a way to prove that I am who I say I am online, and therefore disavow any attempts to impersonate me.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-commit-signing">Setting up commit signing</h2>

<p>Signing commits is pretty easy, and simply requires that you point <code>git</code> to a public key file, and tell it to sign all commits in the config. Then you'll need your YubiKey to commit anything, which will also prompt you for a pin unlock the first time each session (if you don't want that, pull the YubiKey after each commit). Then you just need to upload your commit on Github, and hey-presto, all your commits show as signed and verified.</p>

<h2 id="ssh">SSH</h2>

<p>So now you have a YubiKey set up with PGP keys, and therefore you can use it for SSH. You will …</p></div></div>

        <p>Today we'll continue our voyage into the graphics subsystem components.</p>

<p>The question we'll try to answer is what kind of communications occur between the GuC and the rest of the system. In this post we'll look at firmware components and next post at Windows components.</p>

<p>For a reminder what the GuC is, look at <a href="https://igor-blue.github.io/2021/02/10/graphics-part1.html">part1 post</a> .</p>

<p>The Intel Graphics Output Protocol (GOP) EFI DXE driver can be extracted in various versions from many UEFI capsules available through many vendors.
For this post I redid my original analysis on a recent version from a CanonLake system.</p>

<p>The purpose of this exercise is to try and see whether the GOP driver communicates with the GuC over the PCIe bus (TL;dr: it doesn't)</p>

<p>The binary isn't to large - 84KB, so we can try to completely reverse engineer it. I used both IDA+HexRays and a dynamic analysis UEFI emulator I developed for just these cases. The emulator lets you run EFI DXE drivers in Windows simulating many UEFI services and allowing me to modify/inspect EFI interfaces, hook UEFI protocol structs, and even has some fuzzing capabilities.</p>

<p>Looking at the driver's entrypoint we see it stores the different service tables in globals and then jumps to the main() functions I called GopEntryPoint().</p>

<p>And then install four protocol handlers, three of which I identified: one for driver binding and two for component name handling. The InstallMultipleProtocolInterfaces(..) can accept multiple protocols, each protocol has a GUID and the “virtual table” like structure used by UEFI. The final entry is NULL. Most UEFI protocol GUIDs are public (and appear in the EDK) so we can identify them easily and this identify the virtual table structures associated with them, for example for the UEFI binding protocol we have in DriverBinding.h:</p>

      <article role="main">
          <p>In May 2020, in the early stages of the pandemic, IT outlets drew attention of their readers with headlines such as <a href="https://www.lrz.de/presse/ereignisse/2020-06-03_InterviewSecurityIncident/">“Supercomputeres offline across Europe”</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-15/hackers-target-european-supercomputers-researching-covid-19">“Hackers Target European Supercomputers Researching Covid-19”</a> or in contrast to that <a href="https://securityboulevard.com/2020/05/11-plus-supercomputers-hacked-with-cryptominers-by-china/">“11-Plus Supercomputers Hacked With Cryptominers”</a>. Apparently, at that time, some supercomputers went offline citing security reasons, but no one really knew why. To put speculations aside, we want to dedicate this blog post to a brief retrospective of what insiders only know as <em>the HPC incident</em> coupled with a forensic deep-dive from one of the affected institutions.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a clarification: A so-called  <em>supercomputer</em> is really just a sizeable bunch of ordinary computers tied together to form a single large system that is then used by scientists around the globe to perform computation-heavy tasks. To put that into perspective: While the number of physical CPU cores in a typical desktop or laptop computer in 2020 varies between two and eight, <em>HPC</em> (<em>H</em>igh <em>P</em>erformance <em>C</em>omputing) systems are made up of thousands of single computer systems with typically more than 20 cores each (forming a <em>cluster</em>). To name a random example from the current HPC Top 10 list, the <em>HPC5</em> cluster in Eni (Italy) is composed of 3,640 servers, each equipped with 24 physical CPU and four GPU cores, resulting in a total of 87,360 CPUs and 7,280 GPUs. Typical workloads for such HPC systems are medical research, seismic imaging or weather and climate modeling.</p>

<p>The difficulty in programming for such HPC systems stems from the requirement to divide workloads into a lot of small chunks that can then be distributed amongst these computers (often just called <em>nodes</em>) and executed in parallel. Since building and operating a cluster like that is obviously quite expensive, their owners try to maximize utilization of the available computing capacity by permitting concurrent access to selected researchers from all around the globe.</p>

<p>From a security perspective, this implies that HPC systems need to be generally accessible from anywhere (specifically the dangerous Internet) and therefore demand suitable authentication and authorization mechanisms so that only permitted parties have access and also won’t interfere with each other. On the other hand, restricting HPC users or workloads too much isn’t desired either. After all, the intended purpose of HPC clusters is to provide scientists easy access to a flexible platform that they can perform their research on - which often requires compromises security-wise. For instance, cluster nodes often don’t receive security fixes immediately. Instead, software updates have to be planned and tested in advance together with the cluster’s manufacturer and are scheduled only after no issues occurred during testing. Since in HPC availability is key, flawless interaction of all involved components has to be guaranteed prior to software changes. In our case, proprietary drivers for specialized hardware such as InfiniBand network controllers require even more attention and have to be re-certified with each update. Consequently, updates are often delayed and bundled together with others to reduce overall cluster downtime.</p>

<p>Having said that, the headlines mentioned earlier reporting an unscheduled downtime (in fact, for several weeks) were a clear indication that something serious must have been wrong at the time. Upon closer inspection, we discover a prime example of an <em>Advanced Persistent Threat</em> (APT), a term that depicts a “threat actor, which gains unauthorized access to a computer network and remains undetected for an extended period” according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_persistent_threat">Wikipedia</a> and has been occupying the security research community for decades. In the following sections, we’ll try to reconstruct the events surrounding this incident from our own perspective as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_emergency_response_team">CERT</a> of one of Germany’s affected national universities. But first, let’s have a look at the general architecture of our own HPC cluster (which isn’t much different from others) and how researchers interact with it.</p>

<h2 id="the-victim-still-in-good-health">The victim, still in good health</h2>

<p><img src="https://www.educv.de/img/blog-2021-02-17/architecture.png" alt="Cluster architecture"></p>

<p>From a bird’s-eye perspective, everything in our HPC cluster is centered around a large array of <em>compute nodes</em>, which is where the actual computation-heavy research tasks are executed. Since such computations are typically performed on large amounts of data (such as the raw dataset resulting from an experiment) and distributed among a lot of compute nodes, shared network storage and accompanying fast (high throughput, low latency) network connections are a necessity. In the HPC world, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InfiniBand">InfiniBand</a> has been established as the de-facto standard for the physical interconnects, while there are different technologies available for the storage part, such as NFS and Lustre. In fact, many HPC systems utilize multiple filesystems for network storage depending on requirements (smaller, but fast short-term storage during computation vs. slow, but large long-time storage).</p>

<p>Permitted HPC users interact with our cluster by logging into one of the <em>login nodes</em> via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSH_(Secure_Shell)">SSH</a>, which allows them to access the shared storage and to interact with the <em>job scheduler</em>, a sort of reservation system that schedules and distributes the research <em>jobs</em> among the available compute nodes and tries to ensure that the different jobs don’t interfere with each other. In our case the login nodes weren’t accessible from all over the Internet. Instead, access was limited to our campus network as well as selected partner universities and other collaborating institutions. Our <em>export nodes</em> were different: Since most HPC jobs require huge amounts of raw data to be copied over to our shared storage, these nodes could be accessed directly from anywhere to offer optimal bandwidth and not disrupt our VPN. As a security measure and in contrast to the login systems, access to the export nodes is restricted to file operations. They don’t provide their users with a shell to execute arbitrary commands and are therefore deemed at lower risk.</p>

<p>Lastly, the cluster setup contains management infrastructure that offers various services such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol">LDAP</a> for user authentication or the <a href="https://slurm.schedmd.com/">SLURM Workload Manager</a>, which is our job scheduler. Administrative systems are also used by the HPC team as well as the vendor of the cluster for all kinds of management purposes, such as setting up new compute nodes, scheduling updates or inspecting issues during cluster operation. Obviously, regular HPC users are not allowed to access these systems.</p>

<p>Regarding operating systems, all nodes within our HPC infrastructure run Linux, more specifically the <em>Red Hat Enterprise Linux</em> (RHEL) distribution. To fully understand the technical details within the rest of this article, some basic Linux knowledge is beneficial.</p>

<h2 id="wounded">Wounded</h2>

<p>On a fateful day in early May 2020, with the cluster happily chugging along, our HPC team was informed by a partner that a cluster from another university had spotted suspicious system modifications, which were in turn also discovered at various other HPC institutions throughout the country. More specifically, our initial report briefly mentioned <em>“files in <code>/etc/fonts</code>“</em> and - in some cases - compromised SSH binaries, which are utilized by users to connect to third party HPC systems. Alerted, our HPC guys immediately started to assess the cluster, looking for similar IoCs (<em>I</em>ndicators <em>o</em>f <em>C</em>ompromise) as the ones reported. It didn’t take long to verify that, indeed, we could confirm similar peculiarities. On some nodes, the directory <code>/etc/fonts</code> looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -la /etc/fonts
drwxr-xr-x.   3 root root    4096 Feb 20 01:31 .
drwxr-xr-x. 128 root root   12288 May 13 18:10 ..
-rwsr-sr-x    1 root root    8616 Feb 24  2017 .fonts
-rwxr-xr-x    1 root 200046 20144 Feb 24  2017 .low
drwxr-xr-x.   2 root root    4096 Feb 20 01:31 conf.d
-rw-r--r--    1 root root    2416 Jun  8  2018 fonts.conf
</code></pre>

<p>The two executable files <code>.fonts</code>  and <code>.low</code> clearly didn’t belong there. The timestamp indicates that they were last modified in 2017, which would have been horrible due to the cluster being potentially compromised since then, but that value is also very easy to forge and shouldn’t be trusted at all. Of greater concern were the file’s permissions, which are shown in the left-most column. For <code>.fonts</code>, the <code>s</code> in the permission map <code>-rwsr-sr-x</code> essentially mean that any user who executes that program automatically runs it as if he were the user with the highest privilege level, namely <code>root</code>. We later executed those files in a safe sandboxed environment, just to confirm the worst-case assumption that this file is a plain and simple backdoor that allows <em>ANY</em> user to immediately gain administrative rights on the system:</p>

<pre><code>$ whoami
user123
$ /etc/fonts/.fonts
$ whoami
root
</code></pre>

<p>Later on, more thorough analyses such as <a href="https://atdotde.blogspot.com/2020/05/high-performance-hackers.html">this</a> confirmed that behaviour and also shone light on the purpose of the other executable, <code>.low</code>. It’s essentially a log wiping tool that attempts to remove all traces of a user’s activity from the system’s log files. Having found those, the maliciousness of the reported observations weren’t in question anymore. For us, the situation was especially dire due to the fact that not only the user-facing login, compute and export nodes were found compromised, but also various administrative machines, which offered an attacker essentially full control over the entire HPC cluster. The reaction of our HPC team was swift and similar to other affected institutions: The whole cluster was disconnected from the Internet, leading to the sudden downtimes that were reported in the news. What followed was a collaborative effort coordinated by the <em>Gauss Centre for Supercomputing</em>, the <em>Gauss Alliance</em> in Germany and EU-wide association <em>PRACE</em> to share further IoCs and preliminary forensic results. Meanwhile, federal authorities also undertook a criminal investigation into the potential motives and suspects of this incident.</p>

<p>It is the beginning of 2021, after an year of changes driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, now more than ever we see the importance of global connectivity and communication. In an year of restrictions and isolation and in a hard time of changed priorities we had just the right tools, solutions and infrastructure to not separate ourselves but to stay connected. And as challenging times do happen every once in a while this time we kept more together than ever. </p>



<p>People working from home saving any bit of economics that can go on, kids and student taking virtual classrooms, all the dynamic information sharing and all this possible over a global network, truly showing that we might not live in a world of boundaries. This is an evolution made possible through a combined effort of now decades of work in IT and Telecommunications. Yet seeing this prove of all this hard work, all we know is that the Internet connects us and has become itself a large ‘organism’ of connected networks and devices. But how do we care for it?</p>



<h2>How do we proof our future</h2>



<p>To go straight to the topic, the Internet as large as it has grown has the pains of it’s own. Bringing people together, moving the office, the classroom, a conference or just a family gathering online has once again increased the number of users and connected devices. And this number of connected devices is already causing troubles – numbering, specifically the IPv4 addressing is long lasting trouble in this world of “no boundaries”. So IPv6 should be coming to save the day, right.</p>



<h2>IPv4 exhaustion and how far are we with the next generation?</h2>



<p>More and more connected devices than ever, in world of less than 4 billion available IPv4 addresses. Many of you already know the IPv4 allocation are now considered exhausted. With RIPE NCC reporting the end of the available allocations back in November 2019, most of the RIRs have now declared lack of spare IPv4 resources. Weĺl this is still far from causing any severe effect on the global connectivity. These allocated IP addresses are in the hands of providers. RIRs have developed procedures for reclaiming unused addresses. Waiting lists for new assignments were developed and so on. Measures are taken to slow down the inevitable. </p>



<p>But at some point we have to look a bit further. How far are with deploying IPv6? It has been decades since we’ve been taught that it is the future of the Internet, but did we ever get there? Well i wouldn’t mean to be dramatic, but i feel that we’re not even working focused enough to reach this future.</p>



<p>Yesterday I’ve decided to do a little experiment – how efficiently can i use IPv6 only Internet and as interesting as it may sound, it was sort of a short adventure.</p>



<h2>Who’s there?</h2>



<p>What you can find on the IPv6 Internet has a good beginning. If you’ve been the office local sysadmin you know that first three checked by the user who reports that the “Internet is down” are Google, Facebook and YouTube. Well good news the Internet “is there” in the IPv6 world.</p>



<p>What is bit of concerning is what can you reach from the Googles search results. Not that much unfortunately. First surprise is that it looks like they plan an “ad free” Internet, several Google Ads redirects don’t have AAAA records rendering several links unreachable. Then it starts microsoft.com – no AAAA, apple.com – no, several other global companies – no IPv6 records at all.</p>



<p>On the local scope in Bulgaria (where i currently live), popular news portals and a well known free email service – not on IPv6. Four out of five main universities don’t even have AAAA records, one of the universities is fully available on v6. Not one of the three major telecoms has their website available on IPv6 although they do provide IPv6 connectivity to customers. And i guess people who know me will know which was the only hosting service provider running on IPv6, half a dozen of other popular names unreachable. I was able to find one government site functioning on IPv6. Can’t order food from popular food deliveries. Local auction portal unreachable.</p>



<p>Back on the more global scale i was surprised that i couldn’t use any popular video conferencing tool,  instant messenger and several other SaaS services i use at work.</p>



<p>Scary but there is no Stack overflow on IPv6, maybe due to the lack of github.com as well.</p>



<p>It’s a lot of popular services, that don’t have DNS records for IPv6. This is not a reachabilty issue, it is just lack of support for IPv6 at the moment.</p>



<p>I didn’t feel very comfortable on the IPv6 world, so back to the 32-bit, I am willing to share this “state of the future” with an appeal. It’s not a deadline, but we also don’t have to wait for the last moment. IPv6 is running and by far it still seems to be the future of Internet.</p>



<h2>Call for action</h2>



<p>My appeal is – if you run a service, if you host a web site try using IPv6 as well.</p>



<p>It has bit of a scarier looking addresses, but we do use DNS now, right?</p>



<p>Keep in mind that sometimes you need extra security. Don’t rely solely on it for important stuff. But still if we don’t work on a better alternative, we need to start making baby steps in this direction.</p>



<p>And I don’t consider myself anything like an expert in IPv6, but if you do have any questions, i would be glad to share whatever i can to the extent of my experience with it.</p>



<p>IPv6 is working but we don’t tend to use it, and we don’t even bother. Famous last words will be “give it a try, it can’t be that bad “, but I do believe that if have to build the foundation of our future we can’t just sit and wait.</p>



<blockquote><p>Come to the IPv6 – we… still have cookies</p></blockquote>

The digital transformation of law is appearing from a new and much more <strong>collaborative angle</strong>. Law has become an object of innovation on which lawyers now work together with technical profiles in order to create new products and services with high added value.</p><p id="40dd">It is in this new context that legal design is being developed.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Capabilities are being used by many Linux-based software nowadays to limit what a process can do. But I think the documentation is a bit hard to grasp and I found some parts of capabilities implementation confusing so I decided to condense my current knowledge into a shorter article.</p>



<p>The most important reference for capabilities is up-to-date man page <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>. But that doesn’t provide an easy to read introduction.</p>



<h3>Process Capabilities</h3>



<p>Permissions of regular users are very limited, while permissions of “root” user are very powerful. But processes running under “root” often don’t require full root capabilities. </p>



<p>To help reduce “root” user power, POSIX capabilities provides a way to restrict groups of privileged system operations a process and its children are allowed to do. They basically divide full “root” privilege into a set of distinct privileges. The idea of capabilities was described in POSIX 1003.1e draft that was withdrawn in 1997.</p>



<p>Each Linux process (task) has <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/cred.h#L134">five 64-bit numbers</a> (sets) holding capability bits (used to be 32-bit before Linux 2.6.25) which can be inspected by reading  /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/status</p>



<pre>CapInh: 00000000000004c0<br>CapPrm: 00000000000004c0<br>CapEff: 00000000000004c0<br>CapBnd: 00000000000004c0<br>CapAmb: 0000000000000000</pre>



<p>These numbers (here displayed as hex digits) are acting as a bitmap encoding a set of capabilities. Full names are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Inheritable</strong> – capabilities that children can inherit</li><li><strong>Permitted</strong> – capabilities the task is permitted to use</li><li><strong>Effective</strong> – capabilities actually effective</li><li><strong>Bounding</strong> set –  prior to Linux 2.6.25, the bounding set was a system-wide attribute shared by all threads, probably meant to describe a set beyond which capabilities cannot grow. Currently it is per-task set. It is a part of execve transformation logic (more later) and also limits what a process can set to its inheritable set using capset().</li><li><strong>Ambient</strong> set (since Linux 4.3) – added to give capabilities to non-0 user easily, without using setuid or file capabilities (more later).</li></ul>



<p>If a task asks to perform a privileged operation (like binding on ports &lt; 1024), the kernel checks Effective bounding set to see if <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/capability.h#L183">CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE</a> is set. If it is, it continues. Otherwise, it rejects the operation with EPERM (operation not permitted). These CAP_ defines in the kernel source are numbered sequentially so CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE being 10 means a bit 1&lt;&lt;10 = 0x400 (that is the ‘4’ hex digit in my previous example). </p>



<p>The full human readable list of currently-defined capabilities can be found in your up-to-date manpage <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a> (the one here is for reference only).</p>



<p>Additionally there is a library libcap to make capabilities management and inspection easier. In addition to <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/libcap.3.html">library API</a>, the package includes <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/capsh.1.html">capsh</a> utility which, among other things, allows printing its capabilities. <br></p>



<pre># capsh --print
Current: = cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service+eip
Bounding set =cap_setgid,cap_setuid,cap_net_bind_service
Ambient set =
Securebits: 00/0x0/1'b0
 secure-noroot: no (unlocked)
 secure-no-suid-fixup: no (unlocked)
 secure-keep-caps: no (unlocked)
 secure-no-ambient-raise: no (unlocked)
uid=0(root)
gid=0(root)
groups=0(root),1(bin),2(daemon),3(sys),4(adm),6(disk),10(wheel),11(floppy),20(dialout),26(tape),27(video)
</pre>



<p>There are a few <strong>confusing</strong> bits:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Current</strong> – displays effective, inheritable and permitted capabilities of capsh process in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/cap_to_text.3.html"><strong>cap_to_text(3)</strong></a><strong> format</strong>. Again, it displays it in cap_to_text format which lists capabilities basically as capability[,capability…]+(e|i|p) groups, where ‘e’ means effective, ‘i’ inheritable and ‘p’ permitted. The list is not separated by ‘,’ as you would guess (cap_setgid+eip,cap_setuid+eip). The ‘,’ separates capabilities in a single +… (action) group. The actual list of action groups is then separated by spaces. So another example with two action groups would be “= cap_sys_chroot+ep cap_net_bind_service+eip”. And also these two action groups “= cap_net_bind_service+e cap_net_bind_service+ip” would encode the same meaning as  a single “cap_net_bind_service+eip”.</li><li><strong>Bounding set/Ambient set</strong>. To make things even more confusing, these two lines contain just a list of capabilities set in those sets, separated by spaces. No cap_to_text format is used here because it is not listing permitted, effective, inheritable sets together but just a single (bounding/ambient) set.</li><li><strong>Securebits</strong>: displays task’s <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/linux/cred.h#L133">securebits</a> integer in as decimal/hex/fancy-verilog-convention-for-binary-strings (yes, everyone would expect it here and it’s totally clear by ‘b because every sysadmin programs its own FPGAs and ASICs). The state of securebits follows. The actual bits are defined as SECBIT_* in <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/latest/source/include/uapi/linux/securebits.h#L22">securebits.h</a> and also described in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>.</li><li>The tool lacks the one important state and that is the “<strong>NoNewPrivs</strong>” which can be also seen by inspecting /proc/&lt;pid&gt;/status. That is described in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/prctl.2.html">prctl(2)</a> only, even though it directly affects capabilities when used in conjunction with file capabilities (more later). NoNewPrivs is described as “<em>With no_new_privs set to 1, execve(2) promises not to grant privileges to do anything that could not have been done without the execve(2) call (for example, rendering the set-user-ID and set-group-ID mode bits, and file capabilities non-functional). Once set, this the no_new_privs attribute cannot be unset.  The setting of this attribute is inherited by children created by fork(2) and clone(2), and preserved across execve(2).</em>“. This is the flag which Kubernetes sets to 1 when allowPrivilegeEscalation is set to false in pod’s securityContext. </li></ul>



<p>When a process starts a new process by doing execve(2), capabilities are transformed to the child using the formula mentioned in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a>:</p>



<pre>P'(ambient)     = (file is privileged) ? 0 : P(ambient)

P'(permitted)   = (P(inheritable) &amp; F(inheritable)) |
                  (F(permitted) &amp; P(bounding)) | P'(ambient)

P'(effective)   = F(effective) ? P'(permitted) : P'(ambient)

P'(inheritable) = P(inheritable)    [i.e., unchanged]

P'(bounding)    = P(bounding)       [i.e., unchanged]

where:

     P()   denotes the value of a thread capability set before the
           execve(2)

     P'()  denotes the value of a thread capability set after the
           execve(2)

     F()   denotes a file capability set
</pre>



<p>These rules describe action taken for every bit in ambient/permitted/effective/inheritable/bounding sets. It uses standard C syntax (&amp; for logic AND, | for logic OR). P’ is the child process, P is the current process calling execve(2). F are so called “file capabilities” of the file being execve’d.</p>



<p>Additionaly, a process can programmatically change its inheritable, permitted and effective sets using libpcap any  time according to these rules:</p>



<ul><li>Unless the caller have the CAP_SETPCAP, the new <strong>inheritable</strong> set must be a subset of <em>P(inheritable) &amp; P(permitted)</em></li><li>(since Linux 2.6.25) The new <strong>inheritable</strong> set must be a subset of <em>P(inheritable) &amp; P(bounding)</em></li><li>The new <strong>permitted</strong> set must be a subset of P(permitted) </li><li>The new <strong>effective</strong> set must be a subset of P(effective)</li></ul>



<p>As HN user eqvinox suggested, pspax from <a href="https://github.com/gentoo/pax-utils">pax-utils</a> can be used to list capabilities of running processes, just compile it with libpcap support (make USE_CAP=yes):</p>
<pre>  # pspax
  USER     PID    PAX    MAPS ETYPE      NAME             CAPS ATTR  
  root     60879  ---    w^x  ET_DYN     crond            =ep  system_u:system_r:kernel_t:s0  
  root     60910  ---    w^x  ET_DYN     ntpd             cap_net_bind_service,cap_ipc_lock,cap_sys_time=ep system_u:system_r:kernel_t:s0
</pre>



<h3>File capabilities</h3>



<p>Sometimes a user with a reduced set of capabilities needs to run a binary which requires more capabilities. Previously, this was achieved by setuid binary (chmod +s ./executable). Such a binary, if owned by root, would assign full root privileges to it when executed by any user.</p>



<p>That gives too many privileges to the binary, so POSIX capabilities implemented a concept called “file capabilities”. They are stored as a <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/xattr.7.html">extended file attribute</a> called “security.capability” so you need a capable filesystem (ext*, XFS, Raiserfs, Brtfs, overlay2, …). For a process to write to this attribute, CAP_SETFCAP capability is needed (be in process’ effective set).<br></p>



<pre>$ getfattr -m - -d `which ping`
# file: usr/bin/ping
security.capability=0sAQAAAgAgAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA=

$ getcap `which ping`  
/usr/bin/ping = cap_net_raw+ep
</pre>



<h3>Special cases and notes</h3>



<p>Of course, life is not simple, so is not the implementation of capabilities and there are several special cases described in <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/capabilities.7.html">capabilities(7)</a> man page. Probably the most important are:</p>



<ul><li><strong>setuid file bit and file capabilities are ignored if NoNewPrivs is set</strong> or filesystem is mounted nosuid or the process calling execve is being ptraced. The file capabilities are also ignored when the kernel is booted with<em> </em>no_file_caps.</li><li><strong>Capability-dumb</strong> binary is a binary converted from setuid to file capabilities without changing its code. Such binaries are often converted by setting +ep capability on them like “setcap cap_net_bind_service+ep ./binary”. The important part is “e”, effective. Upon execve, this capability is added to both permitted and effective so the executable is ready to use the privileged operation. In contrast <strong>capability-smart</strong> binary which uses libpcap or similar, can use <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/cap_set_proc.3.html">cap_set_proc(3)</a> (or <a href="http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/capget.2.html">capset</a>) to set “effective” or “inheritable” bits at any point, as long as that capability is already in the “permitted” set. So “setcap cap_net_bind_service+p ./binary” would be enough for a capability-smart binary as it will be able to set the effective bit itself before calling the privileged operation.  See my <a href="https://gist.github.com/k3a/a38f4439f85eda4f77eda19c4ae8c80c">example code</a>.</li><li><strong>setuid-root binaries</strong> continue to work, giving all privileges of root when run by a non-root user. Unless they have file capabilities set, in which case only those are granted. It is also possible to create a setuid binary with empty file capability set, making it execute as 0, though without any capabilities. …</li></ul></div></div>

<p> Tagged as <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/tag/blog.html">blog</a>, <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/tag/sbcl.html">sbcl</a>, <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/tag/common-lisp.html">common-lisp</a> </p> <p> Written on 2021-02-24 21:50:00 </p> <p>It's taken me much longer than I hoped, but I finally have a second version of
my patches to build static executables tested and ready to go! This set of
patches vastly improves upon the first by reducing the amount of compilation
needed at the cost of sacrificing a little purity. Additionally I have created
a system that automates the process of building a static executable, along with
other release related tasks.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2>At a Glance</h2>

<ul>
<li>The new patch set can be found on
  the
  <a href="https://github.com/daewok/sbcl/tree/static-executable-v2">static-executable-v2 branch</a> of
  my SBCL fork or at
  <code>https://www.timmons.dev/static/patches/sbcl/$VERSION/static-executable-support-v2.patch</code>
  with a detached signature available at
  <code>https://www.timmons.dev/static/patches/sbcl/$VERSION/static-executable-support-v2.patch.asc</code>
  signed with GPG
  key <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/static/keys/9ACF6934.pub">0x9ACF6934</a>.</li>
<li>You'll definitely want to build SBCL with the <code>:sb-prelink-linkage-table</code>
  feature (newly added by the patch). You'll probably also want the
  <code>:sb-linkable-runtime</code> feature (already exists, but the patch also enables it
  on arm/arm64).</li>
<li>The new patch lets you build a static executable with less compilation of
  Lisp code.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://gitlab.com/daewok/asdf-release-ops">asdf-release-ops system</a>
  automates the process of building a static executable by tying it into ASDF.</li>
</ul>

<h2>What's New?</h2>

<p>If you need a refresher about what static executables are or what use cases
they're good for, see
my <a href="https://www.timmons.dev/posts/static-executables-with-sbcl.html">previous post on this topic</a>.</p>

<p>With my previous patch, the only way you could create a static executable was
to perform the following steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Determine the foreign symbols needed by your code. The easiest way to do
   this is to compile all your Lisp code and then dump the information from the
   image.</li>
<li>From that list of foreign symbols, create a C file that contains fills an
   array with references to those symbols.</li>
<li>Recompile the SBCL core and runtime with this new file, additionally
   disabling libdl support and linking against your foreign libraries.</li>
<li>(Re)compile all your Lisp code with the new runtime (if you made an image in
   step 1 it will not be compatible with the new runtime due to feature and
   build ID mismatches).</li>
<li>Dump the executable.</li>
</ol>

<p>In the most general case, this involved compiling your entire Lisp image
twice. After some #lisp discussions, I realized there was a better way of doing
this. While the previous process still works, the new recommended process now
looks like:</p>

<ol>
<li>Build the image you would like to make into a static executable and save it.</li>
<li>Dump the foreign symbol info from this image and write the C file that SBCL
   can use to prelink itself.</li>
<li>Compile that C file and link it into an existing sbcl.o file to make a new
   runtime. sbcl.o is the SBCL runtime in object form, created when building
   with the <code>:sb-linkable-runtime</code> feature.</li>
<li>Load the image from step 1 into your new runtime. It will be compatible
   because the build ID and feature set are the same!</li>
<li>Dump your now static executable.</li>
</ol>

<p>This new process can significantly reduce the amount of time needed to make an
executable. Plus it lets you take more advantage of image based
development. It's fairly trivial to build an image exactly like you want, dump
it, and then pair it with a custom static runtime to make a static executable.</p>

<p>There were two primary challenges that needed to be overcome for this version
of the patch set.</p>

<p>First, the SBCL core had to be made robust to every libdl function
uncondtionally returning an error. Since we want the feature set to remain
constant we can't recompile the runtime with <code>#-os-provides-dlopen</code>. Instead,
we take advantage of the fact that Musl libc lets you link static executables
against libdl, but all those functions are noops. This is the "purity"
sacrifice I alluded to above.</p>

<p>Second, since we are reusing a image, the prelink info table (the generated C
file) needed to order the symbols exactly as the image expects them to be
ordered. The tricky bit here is that some libraries (like <code>cl-plus-ssl</code>) add
symbols to the linkage table that will always be undefined. <code>cl-plus-ssl</code> does
this in order to support a wide range of openssl versions. The previous patch
set unconditionally filtered out undefined symbols, which horribly broke things
in the new approach.</p>

<h2>More Documentation</h2>

<p>As before, after applying the patch you'll find a README.static-executable file
in the root of the repo. You'll also find a Dockerfile and an example of how to
use it in the README.static-executable.</p>

<p>You can also check out the tests and documentation in
the <a href="https://gitlab.com/daewok/asdf-release-ops">asdf-release-ops system</a>.</p>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>

<ul>
<li>The <code>:sb-prelink-linkage-table</code> feature does not work on 32-bit ARM + Musl
  libc &gt;= 1.2. Musl switched to 64-bit time under the hood while still
  mataining compatibility with everything compiled for 32-bit time.</li>
</ul>

<p>The issue is how they maintained backwards compatibility. Every time related
  symbol still exists and implements everything on top of the 32-bit time
  interface. However, if you include the standard header file where the symbol
  is defined <em>or</em> you look up the symbol via <code>dlsym</code> you actually get a pointer
  to the 64-bit time version of the symbol. We can't use <code>dlsym</code> (it doesn't
  work in static executables). And the generated C file doesn't include any
  headers.</p>

<p>This <em>could</em> be fixed if someone is motiviated enough to create/find a
  complete, easy to use map between libc symbols and the headers that define
  them and integrate it into the prelink info generator.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <code>:sb-prelink-linkage-table</code> works on Windows but causes test
  failures. The root issue is that mingw64 has implemented their own
  libm. Their trig functions are fast, but use inaccurate instructions (like
  FSIN) under the hood. When prelinking these inaccurate implementations are
  used instead of the more accurate ones (from msvcrt.dll ?) found when using
  <code>dlsym</code> to look up the symbol.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>I would love to get feedback on this approach and any ideas on how to
   improve it! Please drop me a line (etimmons on Freenode or daewok on
   Github/Gitlab) if you have suggestions.</p></li>
<li><p>I've already incorporated static executables
   into <a href="https://www.clpm.dev/">CLPM</a> and will be distributing them starting
   with v0.4.0! I'm going to continue rolling out static executables in my
   other projects.</p></li>
<li><p>Pieces of the patch set are now solid enough that I think they can be
   submitted for upstream consideration. I'll start sending them after the
   current 2.1.2 freeze.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I do not know quite what it is, but Lapa who is the CMO of Eficode has a way of triggering me in such a way that I must respond. He is almost my private <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/writingprompts">/r/writingprompts</a>.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I understand the problem with the productivity improvement. E.g. with the improvement in cycle time.</p><p>But e.g. with Lead time improvement, shouldn't the impact be on the basis of accelerating revenue generation? If you know how much a feature can extract or accelerate revenue…</p></div>— Lauri Palokangas (@lpalokan) <a href="https://twitter.com/lpalokan/status/1364285665110851585?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2021</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<p>Even though I was already immersed a particularly phrasing here stood out to me.</p>



<blockquote><p>If you know how much a feature can extract or accelerate revenue..</p><cite>– Lapa</cite></blockquote>



<p>I think this is the golden goose. If we have this capability or knowing in advance how much any given task is worth, we can reason very effectively on both priority, order and when we should stop throwing more money after a thing. This would allow us to do things like Weighted Shortest Job First and in general make economic decisions. I recommend <a href="https://amzn.to/2NX3SEu">The Principles of Product Development Flow </a>for an in-depth treatment of this and many other insights.</p>



<p>If we could do this, we would be able to much more reason about what we should do, and how we should approach it.</p>



<p>We could reason about as in this figure</p>

<p>But, unfortunately for most organizations the view is more like so: </p>

<p>Which is obviously a huge problem. It really enables the Highest Paid Persons Opinion (HiPPO) decision making strategy and moves us away from the Measuring of CALMS. </p>



<p>Some organizations are even further from that. They have a hard time figuring out what the cost and revenue is of a value stream. We talk so much about being outcome oriented, that we forget that many teams do not have the context and environment to be outcome <em>aware</em>, on a level more interesting that the number of magical story points they churn out. </p>



<p>I like the focus <a href="https://twitter.com/mik_kersten">Mik Kersten</a> brings to this in <a href="https://amzn.to/3khUpE5">Project to Product</a>. The flow metrics, combined with the Flow Items really brings some reasoning on a relevant level that can help us talk about productivity.</p>



<p>If we then add in this paper: </p>



<blockquote><p>Evaluating well-designed and executed experiments that were designed to improve a key metric, only about one-third were successful at improving the key metric!</p><cite><a href="https://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/ExPThinkWeek2009Public.pdf" rel="nofollow">https://ai.stanford.edu/~ronnyk/ExPThinkWeek2009Public.pdf</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>It starts looking really gloom. In my experience most teams are not even at the starting stages of scientific thinking and <a href="https://roamresearch.com/#/app/Modern-Software-Development/page/E38lgmr7o">hypothesis driven development</a>. And yet well-designed and executed experiments are more likely to not improve the business. What a bummer.</p>



<h2>So, DevOps Transformations</h2>



<p>We were talking about DevOps transformations. In the previous I have mostly argued for the difficulty in reasoning on the impact of a task or feature on business value. </p>



<p>So with regards to DevOps Transformations I have a few main points.</p>



<p>First off, when we try to build the <em>business case</em> of a DevOps transformation we almost always end up end some automation driven cost-down analysis. And while this might be true and valid, it is only tangentially related to DevOps, and no one was ever inspired by a visionary cost-down target. In my opinion strategy should be about raising the top-line, and then we should have a continuous focus on improving the bottom-line, but that is not for the vision.</p>



<p>Second, a DevOps transformation is a huge undertaking and trying to estimate the business case of that entire transformation would be folly. I believe that we can argue that the DevOps transformation does not set much in terms of how far we will go, but it will make it more likely that we are moving in the right direction.</p>



<p>Third, DevOps is about iterating, and we should be able to make many smaller business cases along the way. On specific, context-dependent initiatives.<br>And these improvements should be done in a hypothesis driven way. Not everything will increase productivity, speed, developer happiness or what ever is the focus area. If we are not prepared to do stuff we might have to undo afterwards, we are in dire waters.</p>



<p>Fourth, I haven’t really dug into the horrible overload of the word <em>Transformation. </em>We are not defining some function <em>f: f(x) = y</em> that will move transform one state to another. DevOps is about continuous improvement and iterations. And creating a culture where this can happen. That is not a transformation. <br>And Fourth again, the word transformation does not distance the desired end-state hard enough from the current state of affairs. This is particularly true for agile transformations. There will be blood. Someone will lose their job, or feel bullied to quit because their work has been transformed in a way that is not comfortable for them. The word transformation glosses over some of the ugly truths of a disruptive process. I paraphrase Geoffrey Moore in <a href="https://amzn.to/3ko2Xcr">Zone to Win</a> when I say “A transformation is so disruptive it takes the full attention of the CEO. There can be only one transformation at any point in time”. I think we underestimate the disruptiveness, and as such we underprioritize it in top management, and there we have already set it up to fail.</p>



<p>Fifth and Final, if we have such a hard time reasoning the impact that our work has on the business, it will be that much more difficult to reason about the impact of improving the way we work. </p>



<p>That was way too many words, but thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/lpalokan">Lapa</a> for making me think.</p>

                    <p>Much has been covered about developer salaries based on coding language, location, job title, and so on. However, little has been done to chart the rise and fall of developer salaries over the years.</p><p>Tracing developer salaries over the last 20 years was an interesting endeavor. Researching the topic meant changing the language I used to search for data. <br>Back in the early 2000s, tech and software were referred to as “Information Technology” (IT) or “Information and Communications Technology” (ICT), developers were still referred to as “IT workers” and little was mentioned about the many specialized roles we have today.</p><p>To go back in time, I mainly referred to data published by the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/tables.htm">U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> as they offered the most comprehensive year on year data. I looked at data from alternate years, from 2001 to 2019.</p><h2 id="starting-in-the-year-2000">Starting in the year 2000</h2><p>At the turn of the century, <a href="https://money.cnn.com/2000/07/21/career/q_degreecompsci/">CNN Money</a> reported that the average starting salary for an entry-level computer programmer was $40,800.</p><p>Fresh graduates were also paid differently based on the degrees they held:</p><ul><li>Computer engineering: $49,505</li><li>Computer science: $48,740</li><li>Information science: $38,900</li><li>Management information systems: $41,800</li></ul><p>Due to the shortage of skilled workers going into tech fields, salaries in America for IT graduates became more and more competitive. Salaries in 2000 were already 10% higher than the previous year and, apart from information science majors, were well above the <a href="https://www.naceweb.org/job-market/compensation/salary-trends-through-salary-survey-a-historical-perspective-on-starting-salaries-for-new-college-graduates">national average starting salary</a> of $39,824.</p><figure><img src="https://codesubmit.io/blog/content/images/2021/02/cs-grads-2000-2.png"><figcaption>The "IT Industry" looked different in 2000 than it does today</figcaption></figure><p>The following table shows the average annual salary for developers, programmers, and other IT-related job functions, across all industries in the year 2000:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

Similar to the dot-com burst in 2001, wages in 2008 remained relatively unchanged. However, roughly 111,000 Americans working in IT-related fields lost their jobs going into 2009. </p><p>2008 was also the year when wages began to increase at a slower rate compared to previous years. While individuals enjoyed an average of $5,000 increase every two years previously, after 2008, wages only increased by $2,000 every two years. </p><p>Generally speaking, from 2001 to 2011, individuals working in tech had at least a 21% increase in wages over time. Systems Software Engineers experienced the largest jump in wages, an increase of 35%.</p><p><strong>Average salary increase from 2001-2011:</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><table>

<!--kg-card-end: markdown--><h2 id="what-to-expect-in-the-future">What to expect in the future</h2><p>In the years to come, industry experts expect <a href="https://medium.com/predict/are-programmers-headed-toward-another-bursting-bubble-528e30c59a0e">low-level coding and programming jobs to become obsolete</a> with the development of new tools that remove the need to code completely. Take for example the role of Web Developers when it comes to building websites. With popular CMS tools like WordPress and Squarespace, almost anyone can build a website for their business, reducing the need for people who know “just a little bit of front end web development”. </p><p>As automation takes away the need for “basic” coding jobs, new skills or a combination of skills will be needed in the future for roles that don’t even exist yet. The need for field experts and true problem solvers will never disappear. The key is to adapt and learn as new technologies emerge. </p><p><strong>Additional sources:</strong><br><a href="http://www.oecd.org/digital/ieconomy/1939833.pdf">OECD Technology Outlook Report 2000</a><br><a href="http://www.oecd.org/sti/ieconomy/37620123.pdf">OECD Technology Outlook Report 2004</a><br><a href="https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/docserver/it_outlook-2010-sum-en.pdf?expires=1612698150&amp;id=id&amp;accname=guest&amp;checksum=7DC9765AA37510F78D7BBDA7FF42254D">OECD Information Technology Outlook Summary 2010</a><br><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iGfVr1j-VStKVwSWvVvSo3qbwwHTL_V9tPttpeBTmK4/edit?usp=sharing">BLS data in Google Sheets</a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>Just before the holidays, I launched version 1.0.0 of <a href="https://stork-search.net/">Stork</a>, the web search library I’ve been building for just over a year. Stork is a tool for building dynamic, responsive, and native full-text search interfaces—usually only possible with a SaaS product or a web server—that can be added to static, serverless web pages. It’s free, open-source, and build-system-agnostic. It’s one of the tools I wish I had when I was starting to build websites.</p><p>If you want to try a demo or read the documentation, visit Stork’s website: <a href="https://stork-search.net/">https://stork-search.net</a>.</p><p>Working on Stork has changed how I’ve interacted with the web development community. Stork is only successful if the people who use it find it useful and delightful. Over the past few months, I’ve pushed myself outside my comfort zone and connected with other web developers to ensure that that’s the case. For the first time, I’ve gotten to talk with people from across the internet who seemed excited about the tool I’ve built, and I’ve been able to contribute back to the web development community, an online community of creatives that has shaped how I use technology.</p><p>I built Stork because I thought it should exist, but in fact, <strong>Stork was a project I didn’t know I was capable of building until I had already built it.</strong> A year ago, I had no experience with full-text search, with Rust or Webassembly—the two technologies that power Stork—or with open-source contribution. In this essay, I want to describe how I approached the first year of building Stork. First, I’ll describe why I built it; then, I’ll expound on full-text search TK what a serverless search plugin brings to the web; finally, I’ll tell you why I’m excited for the next few years of Stork.</p><h2 id="the-web-is-an-organism-that-we-all-built-together">The Web is an Organism that We All Built Together.<a href="#the-web-is-an-organism-that-we-all-built-together">#</a></h2><p>It’s hard to remember which came first: the idea for Stork, or my desire to build something (anything!) for the web development community. Web development is the corner of programming where I feel most comfortable, since it seems to foster an environment of unbounded creativity—inherent to the internet, it seems, is the idea of giving something to others. <strong>The languages that power the web are powerful, but verbose, and this verbosity means that developers are strongly encouraged to use community-built tools to speed up their development.</strong> Therefore, the creativity sparked by the web platform is not just first-order creativity—in the content that gets published—but also second-order creativity—in the <a href="https://www.arp242.net/open-source.html">open source</a> tools that are used to publish and enhance that content. The presence, ubiquity, and power of these tools makes the web development experience a communal one instead of a solo endeavor.</p><p>Without the web, I wouldn’t be a programmer, and without the tools and resources that the web development community has built, I wouldn’t have started building websites. Regrettably, I’ve found it easy to forget about the community members who have built the tools that got me into web development. It’s only recently (mostly by following folks on Twitter) that I’ve discovered the humanity and individuality of the people who build the tools I use. That discovery fueled me to create something, and eventually, that something became Stork. When I started building Stork, I wanted to create something useful to give back to the web development community, from whom I had taken so much.</p><h2 id="finding-an-unfilled-niche">Finding an Unfilled Niche<a href="#finding-an-unfilled-niche">#</a></h2><p>Working on a college newspaper and watching the editors struggle to dig old articles out of the digital archives turned me onto the idea of a search experience optimized for specific domains. The web technologies available to replace the newspaper’s custom Google search were either too expensive or too finicky, and I realized I had stumbled across a niche that seemingly didn’t have anything filling it: easy-configuration full-text web search. I theorized that sticking to client-side technologies would simplify the integration experience drastically—I didn’t want to set up another search server, so I assumed other people wouldn’t either. I then theorized that client-side full-text search didn’t exist because the technology that could power it was very new.</p><p>Around that time, Rust’s WebAssembly support had been drastically improved and increasingly publicized. I had recently listened to <a href="https://www.relay.fm/radar/141">Marco Arment discuss his implementation of full-text search on an episode of Under the Radar</a>, and Chris Coyier had recently published his <a href="https://serverless.css-tricks.com/">Serverless</a> microsite. I was lost in wondering what a Jamstack search experience would entail. I realized that with the right algorithm, I could build a tool in Rust that generated a heavily-compressed search index where the results were precomputed for any valid query, and where I could use the speed of WebAssembly to parse and search through that index on the client. It was around this time that I started talking about the idea (not yet named Stork) at work and online, and met some friends—<a href="https://twitter.com/noopkat">Suz Hinton</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/matthiasendler">Matthias Endler</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/healeycodes">Andrew Healey</a>—who were excited about the project, graciously let me bounce ideas off of them, and encouraged me to share my work more widely (to them and to others I’ve talked to: I’m incredibly grateful for your feedback, support, and friendship).</p><h2 id="search-is-a-hard-problem-to-solve">Search is a Hard Problem to Solve<a href="#search-is-a-hard-problem-to-solve">#</a></h2><p>The first few months of Stork, I spent time proving out the idea, but in transitioning Stork from a tech demo into a product, I had to find a suitable balance between building algorithmic excellency and building an intuitive experience. <strong>I strongly believe that in this stage of Stork’s development the product must be polished before the algorithm is.</strong> The speed and the search results can be “good enough” in the first years of the product, but if Stork gives off a bad first impression, then nobody will use it. This is the philosophy I brought to the first year of Stork’s development.</p><p>The early versions of Stork used <a href="https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html">Readme-driven development</a> almost religiously. Before the search algorithm worked, I was building a Javascript API, building server infrastructure, and building the first search interface theme. <strong>I wrote Stork’s user-facing documentation, then made sure I wasn’t building a tool more complicated than the documentation allowed.</strong> I became obsessed with concisely describing the two steps of working with Stork: first building an index from a corpus, then loading that index into a webpage using the Stork Javascript library.</p><p>Splitting up those two steps into user-visible actions is endemic to Stork’s operation. Stork tries to front-load as much of the work as possible, precomputing search results so that the client only performs a few lookups to build its results. Today, Stork’s indexer parses documents and builds a hash-table that maps words and prefixes to their character offsets within a document. The client—the WebAssembly executable—looks up each word in the user’s query, combines the results, and uses those offsets to display excerpts from the document, giving users context for each of their search results (by necessity, each Stork index must carry the full text of every document in the index). This strategy creates search indexes that are unfortunately large, but I maintain that the resulting experience makes the tradeoff worth it.</p><p>Any full-text search algorithm involves two main pieces of functionality. First, the entire set of entries must be filtered to only those that match the search query. Second, the remaining entries must be sorted so that the most “relevant” entries are listed first. Stork’s prefix map handles the filtering, and I’ve built a rudimentary sorting algorithm that takes word-closeness, presence of queries in titles, and exact-vs-partial-match details into account—it works well in the inputs I’ve tried. Improving this ordering algorithm has taken a significant portion of Stork’s development, and most of the code I’ve deleted and rewritten has come in the form of overarching improvements to the relevance ordering. I’ve learned about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_word">stop words</a>—words like “the,” “it,” and “and” which must be indexed but heavily devalued, about how to correctly normalize both corpus input and search input so that Power⎵ matches power, about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stemming">stemming</a> algorithms that let me match tries in an index to try in a query, and I’ve watched search results improve as I incorporate each of these enhancements into Stork’s search algorithm.</p><h2 id="storks-next-steps">Stork’s Next Steps<a href="#storks-next-steps">#</a></h2><p>As I said before, I released the latest version of Stork as version 1.0.0. With this, I hope to signal Stork’s prime-time readiness and present Stork as a feature-rich project that’s ready for wider scrutiny. This is a Stork that I’m proud of and that I want to contribute to the web development community.</p><p>In encountering different open-source projects, I’ve tried to pluck the features I feel have helped me the most. The landing page contains a demo, the current version number, and working sample code (three things that an unfortunate number of landing pages seem to omit). I’ve published the project’s roadmap, and I encourage feature requests and bug reports on Github. Most importantly, though, I’m writing about Stork with a human touch, with the hope that the people who interact with the project can better recognize that there’s a coder behind the code.</p><p>I’m actively looking for people to try Stork in their own site and give me feedback. It might not be there yet (though it might be for you!), but I believe that Stork can be an easy, flexible solution to anyone who wants to implement web search, and I’m excited to put in the work to make it so. That said, Stork is far from complete. My scratchpad is pages long<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup>, and I plan to continue building features and enhancements for a while. As I see it, Stork will be useful until it’s irrelevant, and will be relevant until people stop building Jamstack-based sites. I’m also banking on the community to help me: feature requests, bug reports, and other communication has already helped Stork become a better tool, and I’m excited to see what further contributions the community will add to Stork.</p><p>If you’re …</p></article></div>

<div id="apology-of-the-thoughtful-dabbler">
<h2>Apology of the Thoughtful Dabbler<a href="#apology-of-the-thoughtful-dabbler" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The work presented in this thesis is faceted, and placed at the intersection of hydrology, black-box optimization and HPC. For reasons of space and time, I focused just on the last.</p>
<p>Given the diversity of topics involved, the extent of the material, the time assigned to this project, its focus on HPC, and finally my background, I had to <em>use some tools</em> (algorithms, concepts, etc.) without fully mastering them. This unavoidable fact is reflected in the frugality of the bibliography and in their presentation, which occasionally could be sloppy or contain plain errors. The responsibility for those is mine and mine only. However, I hope that the material presented here, if not the subject for more in-depth and broader research by the author, will be at least a prompt for more expert readers.</p>
<p>The growth of complexity in science, to which specialism was the universal response, is not going to decline; but maybe the compartmentalization of specialism will. When we will seek for systematic answers to the problems posed by this Cambrian explosion, one place to look will be computer science, which under many regards is the art of managing complexity by the human mind through abstractions. The simplest and most ubiquitous abstraction is the black box, and hence there is no shame in using black boxes when dealing with problems outside our competence. However, in order to make scientific statements about them, neglecting their inner workings, one needs to use the strictest rigour on the assumptions on their inputs and outputs.</p>
<p>It is unlikely that scientists will be replaced by scientific programmers in the future. However, good scientists surely will also be good programmers, i.e. they will be able to express elegantly both declarative knowledge by means of equations and of procedural knowledge, with the help of a computer.</p>
</div>
<div id="rage-against-machine-learning">
<h2>Rage Against Machine Learning<a href="#rage-against-machine-learning" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main problem of present scientific research is the adoption of the ideas and methods from capitalist market economy. Research institutes must profit from the work of researchers and profit is measured by publications, funding, and patents. The phenomenon is not new, but the degree to which it permeates academia is unedited. Also, it is tightly linked to the sociopolitical and economic system in which we live, and it is probably irreversible. This problem not only intoxicates the academic environment and the life of people which work in academia, but also affects negatively the quality of research. It creates positive feedback loops and inflates some research topics while stagnating others. We live in a time of a profound, yet silent, crisis in science.</p>
<p>Of course, technology and applied science, which have an immediate return, are more likely to be funded and hence get more attention from researchers. In some cases, the situation is exacerbated by lack of scientific contents and rigour. Private investments in the loop worse the situation.</p>
<p>Prominent examples of speculative bubbles are HPC and topics in machine learning as artificial neural networks. The latter deserves a word of caution. The ubiquitous application of artificial neural networks for modeling and inference, as surrogate human understanding, is the utmost failure of reductionism. We should invest more resources in their understanding, even if it is less rewarding than simply using them. Otherwise, the use of mathematical language, scientific method, and reductionism that fueled the most spectacular achievements in our understanding of nature is in danger.</p>
<p>Some problems in modern science requires HPC, although fewer than promised by exa-scale evangelists. Nonetheless, is it HPC an interesting scientific topic per se? I think that it is. Understanding the performance of large distributed systems, running thousands of coordinated processes simultaneously, is an interesting subject indeed. However, it needs a paradigm shift: it should be investigated for the sake of it, out of pure curiosity. The accent should be on comprehension, not on making things and doing stuff. Paradoxically, it is from gratuitous knowledge that the greatest technological advances come out, in the long run.</p>
<p>A related situation exists in computer science as a whole. Its cultural relevance and brief history rich of beautiful ideas are not recognized. As a consequence, programming is often taught and learned abysmally. The resources for these practices have no shortage of terms: tutorials, cookbooks, howtos. In the words of Kevlin Henney, from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbgsfeGvg3E">GOTO talk of 2018</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There’s something else in software that we are particularly bad at: we have a very weak sense of history. So it is not simply that we keep rediscovering and reinventing the wheel, and eventually we might actually make it round; it’s that we have a very poor cultural sense of history, and so we live in a constant state of astonishment and rediscovery.</p></blockquote>
<p>At best, computer science is misunderstood, as wonderfully explained by Abelson and Sussman in their classic on the subject <span id="id1">[<a href="#id15"><span>ASPS96</span></a>]</span>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Underlying our approach to this subject is our conviction that “computer science” is not a science and that its significance has little to do with computers. The computer revolution is a revolution in the way we think and in the way we express what we think. The essence of this change is the emergence of what might best be called procedural epistemology–the study of the structure of knowledge from an imperative point of view, as opposed to the more declarative point of view taken by classical mathematical subjects. Mathematics provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “what is”. Computation provides a framework for dealing precisely with notions of “how to”.</p></blockquote>
<p>If we don’t free ourselves from utilitiarian views on computer science and programming, we will be doomed to poorly reinvent the wheel. Only when we will clearly see their beautiful ineffectiveness, we will be able to make progress.</p>
<p>It is at least naive to suggest stopping using computers for science, and appreciate procedural epistemology for his own sake only. Still, there are practical reasons to approach computing more thoughtfully.</p>
<p>In many research fields, articles, reviews, and conference proceedings account only for a part of the writing duty of researchers, the other being computer programs. Nonetheless, this is something for which they are not always given the proper credit. Furthermore, code is not always published, and its quality is not always at best. However, if programming is theory-building <span id="id2">[<a href="#id10"><span>Nau85</span></a>]</span>, then we need to consider code as literature and write correct, clear, reusable and extensively documented code to make real scientific progress and not waste our collective efforts.</p>
<p>The issue is not just the consideration we have for programming as an intellectual activity. If one wants to apply the scientific method to numerical experiments, he has to attain the same standards used for laboratory experiments: in other words, they must be reproducible. Hence, the reason of the importance of code and documentation in scientific computing is that they are part of the reproducibility effort.</p>

<h2>Math is the Ultimate Javascript Framework<a href="#math-is-the-ultimate-javascript-framework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I would go as far as saying that a playful interest in fundamental questions, beyond practical applications, is a good professional investment for a programmer too.</p>
<p>During the last Christmas holidays, I was chatting with my father about medium wave and longwave antennas. Since physical evidence is better than words, he suddenly went away and reappeared from the closet with a radio in his hand. It was a Grundig from the mid 80’s. Once opened the back of the radio, the ferrite rod antenna and the long and medium wave windings were clearly visible.</p>
<p>I was mesmerized and stared intensely at the inner of the radio. The whole circuitry contained less than ten bipolar junction transistors, for both amplitude and frequency modulation. I pointed with my finger at some components I wasn’t able to recognize, and asked him what they were and why they were there, as I used to do as a kid. The strangest thing to me were the small radio frequency inductors. They had small red marks made with permanent ink. A long time before, he explained to me, he marked the original positions of the tuning screws, before trying to adjust the tune. A whole piece of the circuit board was covered with wax—which I thought was glue—, to avoid changing the position and orientation of some components, changing the inductance of the circuits and losing the right tuning.</p>
<p>That world is gone<a href="#howsad" id="id3">1</a>. We now live in a world of integrated circuits. In our world, physical devices are assembled using tools similar to the ones found in software: abstractions. Black-boxes are combined, or replaced with equivalent ones. Most of the time, it is simply cheaper to use programmable electronics.</p>
<p>This transformation is concerned with physical objects only to a lesser degree. The biggest shift was cultural. A generation of highly trained engineers has become obsolete. The knowledge and mental models they used were outdated. It has not happened during a century, but in few decades. It is highly unlikely that it will not happen again. Instead, if we extrapolate the trend, it is conceivable that the timescale of transformations will become shorter and shorter, due to technological acceleration.</p>
<p>In short, there are excellent chances that the knowledge about a particular technology that one acquires today will be worthless within the time span of his professional career<a href="#frontend" id="id4">2</a>.

    Published 2021-02-25.
  </p>

  
    
  

  <h2 id="1-introduction">1 Introduction</h2>
<p>Back in November 2020, Stay SaaSy <a href="https://staysaasy.com/management/2020/11/20/managing-workplace-crusaders.html">introduced</a> the term <em>workplace crusader</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Tech startups attract passionate people. Large companies pay well and offer a great lifestyle, so the type of personality that wants to work at a startup is often especially ambitious or driven. This can be great, but can also present a number of management challenges. One of the most difficult traits to correctly harness at a growing company is a personality type that is compelled by perfectionism, often driven by a higher sense of righteousness.</p>
<p>I like to call these folks crusaders, as they’re driven by an almost religious passion to snuff out any problem that they see. A crusader is willing to die on any hill. No issue is too small – they attack problems like “the login page doesn’t work 10% of the time” and “Billy keeps writing user stories sloppily” with the same zeal.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The post struck a chord with me because I am one of these people. (I asked one of my previous managers about it, and he wholeheartedly agreed.)</p>
<p>Stay SaaSy offered some good advice on how to manage workplace crusaders. But what if you are one yourself? Their post is still useful, as it can help you become easier to manage. Also, it is very clear on the importance of prioritization: You need to pick your battles.</p>
<p>However, I think there are additional things you should know. Having been involved with various organizations over the past 20 years, I have learned some lessons the hard way. Today, I want to share the seven most important of these with you. As a crusader, you have the potential to be very beneficial to the teams you end up working with. You just need to be smart about it.</p>
<p>Towards the end, I also speculate a bit on <a href="https://yngve.hoiseth.net/articles/being-a-workplace-crusader/#3-what-makes-someone-a-workplace-crusader">what makes a crusader</a>.</p>

</ol>
<h3 id="2-1-choose-your-organizations-wisely">2.1 Choose your organizations wisely</h3>
<p>Whether for paid employment or volunteer work, you will want to choose organizations that prioritize improvement. The variance is extreme.</p>
<p>As an example, I used to work in the (Norwegian) Army. That was a frustrating experience. For instance, I once reported to the unit that my team needed a new extension cord. Should be simple, right? Hell, no. Ten months and several follow-ups later, the cord had still not arrived.</p>
<p>The army is a huge beast that you would expect to be slow and resistant to change. But you can run into trouble in smaller organizations too. I once worked as a mechanic for a small bicycle repair shop. The shop was extremely messy. I tried tidying things up, but got berated by the owner, as he was used to the mess being the way it was. That was also not a good match for me.</p>
<p>So far, I have found tech startups to be the best fit. They may be a mess, but they are also very interested in making improvements, and they are anything but bureaucratic. There are probably other types of employers that would be a good fit too, such as manufacturing, franchising operations and some parts of management consulting.</p>
<p>If you find yourself in an organization that does not value your contributions, consider looking elsewhere.</p>
<h3 id="2-2-accept-that-people-are-very-different">2.2 Accept that people are very different</h3>
<p>People’s personalities and talents vary widely. For example, some people are empathizers rather than systematizers. They might be very interested in helping and connecting with people and rather uninterested in some technical flaw that is very important to you. This doesn’t mean that there is something wrong with them. They are just different.</p>
<p>Others may also have very different priorities than you do. A problem with your customer service process might seem very important to you right now. But if your manager is struggling to meet payroll, they will not prioritize your request. And they will probably not tell you why.</p>
<h3 id="2-3-learn-to-fix-things-yourself">2.3 Learn to fix things yourself</h3>
<p>Every organization is, at least to some extent, a <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2016716.2016740"><em>do-ocracy</em></a>. This means that you can often fix things yourself. You just have to learn how to do it. For example, you can learn how to <a href="http://automatetheboringstuff.com/">automate the boring stuff with Python</a>.</p>
<p>If you do decide to fix things yourself, make sure to be transparent about it. There is often a reason why things are the way they are, and changing them can have consequences that did not occur to you. (See <a href="https://fs.blog/2020/03/chestertons-fence/">Chesterton’s Fence</a>. The more initiative you have, the more good judgment you need.) </p>
<p>Therefore, you need to let your manager know what you are doing and give them time to object. Over time, you will get better at judging your own ideas.</p>
<h3 id="2-4-be-concrete-explicit-and-constructive">2.4 Be concrete, explicit and constructive</h3>
<p>Stay SaaSy writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Crusaders can exhaust their teams, and they can aggravate others who don’t share their idealism or perfectionism … If left unchecked they can transition into a more harmful place by becoming complainers.</p>

<p>In order to avoid exhausting your colleagues, be concrete and explicit about your observations, uncertainties and expectations. For example, instead of saying “our customer service process sucks”, you could saying something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It took us 23 business days to be resolve our customer Carl’s issue. I think this harmed his impression of us. A lot of the delay seems to come from handovers. Maybe we should look into what happens when support agents hand over requests to others? I think we would also benefit from measuring these handover times somehow.</p>
<p>Just to be clear, I am not sure that we need to prioritize this right away, as we may have some more pressing issues. But I think it should be a priority to look into this in the next three months or so.</p>

<p>Very few problems are really critical. In the words of Stay SaaSy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After a few cases of letting minor issues go, it becomes easier to realize that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many problems naturally resolve themselves with time</li>
<li>Many other problems are not existential</li>
<li>If you leave these low severity or self-resolvable problems, you and your team have more energy to tackle the challenges that really matter. This can be surprisingly hard to do for people who are very invested in their work, but when done right it can add much-needed balance.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Related to this is Paul Graham’s advice to <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">do things that don’t scale</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-6-write-things-down-and-talk-to-your-colleagues">2.6 Write things down and talk to your colleagues</h3>
<p>Writing is very useful. It</p>
<ol>
<li>helps you get things out of your head;</li>
<li>makes it easier to deal with emotions;</li>
<li>adds clarity and therefore understanding;</li>
<li>builds lasting insight in the organization; and</li>
<li>levels the playing field between aggressive and passive communicators, different cultural backgrounds, etc.</li>
</ol>
<p>However, it might be good to also schedule a meeting. There are three reasons for this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Many people, especially managers, have overflowing inboxes and use their calendar to manage their time. If it’s in their calendar, it’s happening. If not, who knows. Don’t be shy about inviting for meetings. If they think you ask for too many meetings, they will tell you. </li>
<li>Written communication is really hard. Before you know it, you have hurt or frustrated the other person. Talking is a lot easier, in part because you can pick up on their reactions continuously.</li>
<li>For many people, especially managers, writing feels like work. Talking to others is easier and more fun. Therefore, it might be easier to get a meeting with them than to get a written response.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2-7-study-prior-art">2.7 Study prior art</h3>
<p>Simultaneously improving things and accepting the things you cannot improve is hard. Fortunately, a lot of people have shared their experiences. They can help you become more effective at moving your organization in the right direction as well as managing your emotions.</p>

<h2 id="3-what-makes-someone-a-workplace-crusader">3 What makes someone a workplace crusader?</h2>
<p>Putting a name on the workplace crusader concept got me thinking about the psychology behind it. What kinds of people are more likely to become workplace crusaders? How could employers and career advisors identify them?</p>
<p>To speculate, I think there are a couple of personality traits that help predict crusading:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Openness_to_experience">Openness to experience</a>: You need to be able to imagine a different state of things in order to want change.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism">Neuroticism</a>: The more dissatisfied you are with things, the more motivated you will be to fix them.</li>
</ol>
<p>As alluded to above, I think that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathising%E2%80%93systemising_theory">systematizers</a> tend to be more common among workplace crusaders.</p>
<p>There is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Zimbardo#Time">Philip Zimbardo’s Time Perspective Theory</a>. I suspect that having a <em>future life goal-oriented time perspective</em> would make you more likely to be a workplace crusader. However, considering Zimbardo’s relaxed relationship with scientific integrity (<a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-45337-001">paper</a>, <a href="http://rationallyspeakingpodcast.org/show/rs-241-thibault-le-texier-on-debunking-the-stanford-prison-e.html">podcast episode</a>), I am hesitant to put too much weight on this.</p>
<p>I would love to hear from you if you know anything that would help me learn more about this. For example, what words would psychologists use if they were to write about workplace crusaders?</p>
<h2 id="4-conclusion">4 Conclusion</h2>
<p>To summarize, if you are a workplace crusader, I advise you to</p>

        <p>With the emergence of Bitcoin and recently proposed stablecoins from BigTechs, such as Diem (formerly Libra), central banks face growing competition from private actors offering their own digital alternative to physical cash. We do not address the normative question whether a central bank should issue a central bank digital currency (CBDC) or not. Instead, we contribute to the current research debate by showing how a central bank could do so, if desired. We propose a token-based system without distributed ledger technology and show how earlier-deployed, software-only electronic cash can be improved upon to preserve transaction privacy, meet regulatory requirements in a compelling way, and offer a level of quantum-resistant protection against systemic privacy risk. Neither monetary policy nor financial stability would be materially affected because a CBDC with this design would replicate physical cash rather than bank deposits.</p>

<p><img src="https://ferrous-systems.com/images/ferrocene_logo_horizontal.svg" alt="The Ferrocene logo. A ball between two planes. The name ferrocene next to it."></p>



<p><i>To celebrate this announcement, we will be around at this years <a href="https://www.embedded-world.de/en/exhibitor-list">embedded world digital</a>. You can watch our pitch talk on Wednesday, March 3rd, from 11:10am - 11:20am UTC.
We're available for 1:1 meetings all week.<p>

You can book those through the embedded world web application by searching for "Rust" or "Critical Section" in the exhibitors list.</p></i>
</p>



<p>Ferrocene is an effort led by Ferrous Systems and its newly formed subsidiary Critical Section GmbH to qualify the Rust Language and Compiler for use in the safety-critical domain. This is the third post in a series detailing our plans and actions around this effort, addressing topics discussed in <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/sealed-rust-the-pitch/">The Pitch</a> and <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/sealed-rust-the-plan/">The Plan</a>. Ferrocene's draft name was "Sealed Rust."</p>

<p>Our goal is to <strong>improve the status-quo of software quality and correctness in safety-critical domains</strong> by enabling the use of the Rust Programming Language for safety-critical software development. We believe that Rust is a significant improvement over existing tools both from a safety and quality perspective and as an improvement for developer productivity.</p>

<p>You can follow the progress on these efforts on the <a href="https://ferrous-systems.com/blog/">Ferrous Systems' Blog</a>, by <a href="https://eepurl.com/guoC6P">subscribing to our newsletter</a>, or by <a href="mailto:ferrocene@critical-section.com">contacting us directly</a>.
Ferrocene is currently looking for partner commitments! Please get in <a href="mailto:contact@critical-section.com">touch via email</a> if interested.</p>

<p>Since our last post in February 2020, we have moved Ferrocene from an idea to an actual project. We strengthened our contacts with interested companies and went deeper into our industrial and language research.</p>

<h2 id="finding-a-route-user-research">Finding a route: User Research</h2>

<p>Over the last 1.5 years, we have conducted several interviews with parties deploying software in safety-critical or mission-critical environments. The participants were diverse, from cloud providers to vehicle manufacturers. We found broad interest in adopting Rust in those industries.</p>

<p>There were several key takeaways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Rust as a language is seen as the big contender in critical spaces. Particularly, its focus on rigor and stability is seen as a major competitive advantage.</li>
  <li>At the same time, language evolution and improvement speed is also a crucial factor of interest.</li>
  <li>There is a desire for improvement over current language specification practices.</li>
  <li>Rust only having one main compiler at the moment is seen as a strength at the current phase of the language.</li>
  <li>Interviewed organisations see the language on a good trajectory towards their needs.</li>
</ol>

<p>On further investigation, we found a lot of openness and desire for modern, tool-assisted specification and verification techniques. Rust was regarded as being on a good path and quoted as being a language that was already easier to analyze and inspect than other languages. For that reason, we researched existing practices.</p>

<p>In addition to the above, we overwhelmingly found that the projects and tools already providing analysis and further safety guarantees operate on <a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/2016/04/19/MIR.html">MIR</a>, Rust's mid-level intermediate representation, and other IR rather than the Rust source language. They utilized MIR to carry program meaning in a simplified manner, enabling easier analysis and reasoning. As such, a desire expressed was visibility into changes to MIR and versioned stability.</p>

<p>When further interviewed on stability, organizations expressed a desire to adopt a technology that continually increases safety and assurance levels. Most organizations considered stability a consequence of structured, deliberate changes between documented milestones one can predictably target. We summed this up as "addressability". This framing resonated in interviewed organizations.</p>

<p>There was a high respect for Rust's software practices both inside and outside of the main project. It was mentioned as a strong point that many traditionally research-related tasks are conducted within the project.</p>

<p>In conclusion, there was a shared desire to produce safer, higher-quality software <strong>faster</strong> and a sense that <strong>fundamental changes are necessary</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="finding-an-orientation-why-ferrocene">Finding an orientation: why Ferrocene?</h2>

<p>A key question from these discussions with industry-leaders: what is Ferrocene, the product, and how does it relate to Rust? There was strong interest from potential clients that work that <em>can be</em> upstreamed into the Rust compiler <em>should be</em> wherever possible. We believe this points to a focus shift in the industry. Companies understand the value of FOSS as a neutral commons but also want to invest through initiatives that work towards their goals.</p>

<p>There are services required for mission and safety-critical industries that go beyond shipping a compiler. This includes (very) long-term support, qualification packages, industry-specific tooling, backends and targets, training, verification help and industry-specific advice. This is Ferrocene, the product.</p>

<p>During our conversations with industry leaders, we found that there's a need for Ferrocene as a wider initiative. Increasing the trust level of the Rust compiler will benefit many industries, and focusing only on typical safety-critical environments is one part of the picture. Improvements in the trust level of the core technology benefit <em>all</em> participants in the ecosystem. For example, we see efforts in better describing the semantics of Rust as it exists today as an important baseline for guiding the evolution of the language.</p>

<p>Ferrocene is both. It is a product to serve markets that need high assurances and committments. It is an initiative to take Rust to the next level of reliabilty and trust. Out of that comes a strong desire for collaboration.</p>

<h2 id="having-a-direction-first-waypoints">Having a direction: First Waypoints</h2>

<p>We intend to publish a solidified roadmap for Ferrocene by June 2021.</p>

<p>A major early milestone for Ferrocene is achievable criticality levels. Currently, we're aiming at ISO 26262/ASIL-B qualification readiness and general availability by the end of 2022. Along the way, we will work closely with early adopters to increase the toolchain's quality and gather feedback and experiences.</p>

<p>Ferrocene is a vehicle for a versioned Rust and MIR specification, paired with automated verification of Rust semantics. These "runnable specs" give developers in mission-critical and high-security environments a sound, proven, and addressable foundation for building critical libraries, analysis tools, and further system assurances.</p>

<p>Critical Section is also committed to improving the developer experience in mission and safety-critical industries. Ferrocene includes efforts to bring existing verification tools, like MIRI, to a production-ready state, while also improving the ease and advanced capabilities of formally verifying Rust programs.</p>

<h2 id="finding-partners-the-travel-group">Finding Partners: The travel group</h2>

<p>We have a lot of work ahead of us, but also a lot of experiences to tap into.</p>

<p>Ferrous Systems and Critical Section are calling for additional partners to join that effort! We're interested in partners from many industries, including:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Safety-critical sectors, such as automotive, railway and aerospace</li>
  <li>Operators of mission-critical infrastructure with high-reliability and security concerns, such as cloud vendors</li>
  <li>Hardware vendors</li>
  <li>Compiler vendors</li>
  <li>Organisations that require structured knowledge of their base systems</li>
  <li>Is interested in building strong, deep Rust knowledge now</li>
</ul>

<p>Partners also get early access to Ferrocene releases and can follow the development closely with engineer support.</p>

<p>If that describes your organisation, <a href="mailto:contact@critical-section.com">we're happy to be in touch</a>.</p>

<h2 id="starting-the-engine">Starting the engine</h2>

<p>In August 2020, Ferrous Systems GmbH created a wholly-owned subsidiary called Critical Section GmbH. Critical Section started work on Ferrocene in September 2020, setting up roadmaps, finalizing user research, and outreach to partners. Ferrocene is currently managed by Florian Gilcher and Sabree Blackmon.</p>

<h2 id="thanks">Thanks</h2>

<p>We would like to thank Tim Reed and Jack Greenbaum from Green Hills Software for their constant advice, guidance and collaborative experimentation along the way.</p>

<p>Dice is all we do here at Awesome Dice, and as often as we talk about the bad old days of coloring in dice with crayons from the Dungeons &amp; Dragons boxed set, that was actually very recently in the history of dice. As it turns out, dice date back about as long as human civilization does, with the earliest dice found in Egyptian tombs and archeological digs in ancient Sumeria.</p>
<p>Above is a brief timeline of the history of dice along with a map showing you where the historical events took place. Below we’ll talk about some of the sources and debunk a couple of the false claims of oldest dice.</p>

<h2>Some Debunking</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0057/6408/7896/files/ancient-dice-250x127.jpg?v=1577137780" alt="ancient roman dice"></p>
<p>Gamers doing some cursory poking around on the internet might notice a few claims of older dice that are not included in this history. Certainly if you know of something we missed, please drop a comment with a link to the sources! However, there are some seemingly official-looking stories out there that don’t withstand scrutiny. Here are the big ones:</p>
<p><strong>Burnt City Dice:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>If you go looking around online for the oldest dice found, you will inevitably stumble on a site talking about the world’s oldest backgammon set found in the Burnt City, along with the oldest set of dice. Every report of this find can be sourced back to a single Persian Journal article from 2004 (no longer online). This story has been repeated and scraped and reposted countless times across the internet. I have not been able to find any reports confirming the dice from the Burnt City that doesn’t take its text from the Persian Journal article.</p>
<p>Over at Chess Quest<span>&nbsp;</span>this article [dead link removed]<span>&nbsp;</span>does a pretty good and well-documented job of debunking the reports of the Burnt City backgammon set &amp; dice. Furthermore, it looks like the photo of ancient dice used in the article and every other repost of the article were actually taken from a now defunct website. The dice are from a collection of ancient dice and are actually roman dice made of bone dated from 100 BCE to 100 AD, and have nothing to do with the Burnt City. Thus this story doesn’t hold up enough to be included in the history of dice.</p>
<p><strong>5000 BCE Dice:</strong><span>&nbsp;</span>There are a handful of sites out on the web that claim that dice have been found dated back to 5000 BCE, and of course none of them list any sources. I’m pretty sure that this mis-dating also comes from that pesky Burnt City Persian Journal article. The article made reference to dice from 5,000 years ago. I strongly suspect that someone misinterpreted that as meaning 5000 BCE, and like the Burnt City story itself, the misinformation spread across the web.</p>
<h2>Updates</h2>
<p>11/11/2012: Added new oldest d20 for Egyptian d20 at Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
<p>5/26/2012: Added Tutankhamen knucklebone reference.</p>
<p>If you are aware of an oldest dice find or a significant archaeological find that you think should be added, please drop a comment with a link to the source and we’ll get it added if we can verify the info, and if we think it’s significant enough to squeeze in.</p>

  Imagine you just implemented an amazing new feature that will change the life of thousands of users. You fixed all the review suggestions from your awesome colleagues and are finally ready to merge and deploy. However, continuous integration (CI) defeats this plan by revealing a minor bug. And because CI is just too slow, releasing this feature now has to wait till tomorrow.</p><p>If this sounds familiar, you're not alone. At Shopify, we run automated CI, like executing tests or code linting, on every git push. While we all agree that this should be fast, it's not an easy task if you have more than 170,000 tests to execute. Our developers were frustrated and that was the reason to run a dedicated project improving the speed of Shopify’s CI. I’ll show you how the Test Infrastructure team was able to reduce the p95 of Shopify’s core monolith CI from 45 minutes to 18.</p><p>The Test Infrastructure team is responsible for ensuring Shopify’s CI systems are scalable, robust, and usable. Our team set the objective: run the CI of Shopify's Core monolith in under 10 minutes in the 95th percentile. 95th percentile means that 95% of all builds are faster than 10 minutes. This was an ambitious goal because our CI's 95th percentile was around 45 minutes.
</p><h2>Architecture Overview</h2>
<p>It's important to mention that our <a href="https://buildkite.com/" target="_blank" title="Buildkite - Lightning fast testing and delivery for all your software projects" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">CI runs on Buildkite</a>. Buildkite gives us the flexibility to run the CI servers in our own cloud infrastructure. This has several advantages like aggressive scaling, support of different architectures and better integration and customization. For instance, it allowed us to implement our own instrumentation framework which was crucial for the success of this project.</p>
<p>In Buildkite, a pipeline is a template of the steps you want to run. There are many types of steps, some run shell commands, some define conditional logic, and others wait for user input. When you run a pipeline, a build is created. Each of the steps in the pipeline end up as jobs in the build, which then get distributed to available agents. The agents are installed on our CI servers and polling Buildkite for work, running build jobs and reporting back the results. Each server runs several of these agents at the same time and we scale the number of servers based on demand throughout the day.</p>
<h2>Setting Priorities With Data Driven Development</h2>
<p>There’s a popular carpenter saying: <em>Measure twice and cut once.</em> In other words, one should double check one's measurements for accuracy before cutting a piece of wood. Otherwise it may be necessary to cut again, wasting time and material. At the beginning, we took this saying to heart and invested in setting up instrumentation for our CI. We had a good foundation, as we already measured job and build times. However, this only gave us an idea that there was <strong>something</strong> slow, but not <strong>what</strong> was slow. On top of that, we needed to instrument every command executed.</p>
<figure><img alt="A scatter plot of commands execution count vs average duration" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Keeping_Developers_Happy_With_Fast_Ci_-image3.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1614107235" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Keeping_Developers_Happy_With_Fast_Ci_-image3.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1614107235">
<figcaption>Scatter Plot with the Two Dimensions: Execution Time and Number of Executions per Command</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With this instrumentation in place, we built a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scatter_plot" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia Scatter Plot" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">scatter plot</a> with the two dimensions: execution time and number of executions per command. The dots in the top right corner are the commands that take the most time and get executed the most (our top priority). This information was tremendously important to setting priorities, and we discovered three main areas to focus on: preparing agents, building dependencies, and executing the actual tests.
</p><h2>Improving Docker Start Time by Reducing I/O Bottlenecks</h2>
<p>We grouped things like downloading the source code, restoring caches or starting docker containers for services like MySQL under preparing agents. These commands consumed around 31% of the time spent in CI, almost 1/3. This was a huge area to improve.</p>
<p>One bottleneck we discovered quickly was that starting the docker containers sometimes took up to 2 minutes. Our first assumption was that the CI machines were underprovisioned. It's important to know that we run several Buildkite agents on each testing machine (sometimes running more than 50 containers per machine). Our first experiment was to reduce the number of agents we scheduled on each machine that indeed reduced the time it took to start a docker container to a few seconds. However, one of our goals was to not increase the cloud computing expenses by more than 10%. Running more machines would have blown our budget, so this was not an option for now!</p>
<p>After more debugging, we tracked down that disk I/O was the bottleneck for starting docker containers. Right before starting containers, cached directories are downloaded and written to the disk. These directories include compiled assets or bundled gems. They often reach more than 10GB per machine. You can set a percentage of system memory that can be filled with "dirty" pages—memory pages that still need to be written to disk—before a background process kicks in to write them to disk. Whenever this threshold is reached, which is most of the time after downloading caches, I/O is blocked until the dirty pages are synced. The slow start of docker containers wasn’t the actual problem, but a symptom of another problem.</p>
<figure><img alt="Line Chart of Docker Start Time Improvements Dropping from 125 Seconds to 25 Seconds on p95" data-src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Keeping_Developers_Happy_With_Fast_Ci_-image1.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1614107235" src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0779/4361/files/Keeping_Developers_Happy_With_Fast_Ci_-image1.png?format=jpg&amp;quality=90&amp;v=1614107235">
<figcaption>Line Chart of Docker Start Time Improvements Dropping from 125 Seconds to 25 Seconds on p95</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Once we knew the root cause, we implemented several fixes. The disk size was increased and the write speed increased proportionally with it. Additionally, we mounted most of the caches as read-only. The advantage is that we share read-only caches between agents, only needing to download and write them once per machine. Our p95 for starting containers improved from 90 seconds to 25 seconds, almost 4 times faster! We now write less data a lot faster.</p>
<h2>The Fastest Code Is the Code That Doesn’t Run</h2>
<p>While the improvements for preparing the test execution benefited all of Shopify, we also implemented improvements specifically to the Rails monolith most of Shopify's engineers work on (my team’s main focus). Like most Rails apps, before we can run any tests we need to prepare dependencies like compiling assets, migrating the database, and running bundle install. These tasks were responsible for consuming about 37% of the time spent in CI. Combined with preparing agents it meant that 68% of the time in CI was spent just on overhead before we actually ran any test! To improve the speed of building dependencies, we actually didn’t optimize our code. Instead we tried not to run the code at all! Or to quote <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22863108-practical-maya-programming-with-python" target="_blank" title="Practical Maya Programming with Python by Robert Galankis" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Robert Galanakis</a>: “The fastest code is the code that doesn’t run.”</p>
<p>How did we do that? We know that only a small number of pull requests change the database or assets (most of the Shopify frontend code is in separate repositories). For database migrations, we calculate an MD5 hash of our structure.sql file and db/migrate folder. If the hash is the same as our cache, we don't need to load the Rails app and run db:migrate. A similar approach was implemented for asset compilation. On top of that, we also run these steps in parallel that resulted in an improvement from 5 minutes to around 3 minutes only for this job.</p>
<h2>The 80/20 Rule Applies to Tests Too</h2><p>
After preparing agents and building dependencies, the remaining time is spent on running tests. In Shopify Core, we have more than 170,000 tests, which grow annually by 20-30%. It takes more than 41 hours to run all tests on a single machine. To put this into context, watching all 23 Avengers movies takes around 50 hours. The sheer amount of tests and their growth makes it unrealistic to optimize the tests themselves.</p><p><a href="https://shopify.engineering/spark-joy-by-running-fewer-tests" target="_blank" title="Spark Joy by Running Fewer Tests" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Around one year ago we released a system</a> to only run tests related to the code change. Rather than running all 170,000 tests on every pull request we’d only run a subset of our test suite. In the beginning, it was merely an approach to fight flaky tests but it also reduced the test execution time significantly. While the original implementation turned out to be very reliable, it mostly focused on Ruby files. However, other non-Ruby files like JSON or YAML files also change frequently and often would trigger a full test run. It was time to go back and improve the original implementation.</p><p>For instance, the initial implementation of our test selection ignored changes to ActiveRecord fixtures that meant a change to a fixture file would always trigger a full test run. As changes to fixture files are quite frequent and have low risk of breaking production, we decided to create a test mapping for them. Luckily ActiveRecord already creates an <a href="https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_support_instrumentation.html" target="_blank" title="Active Support Instrumentation" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">ActiveSupport notification</a> for every SQL query it executes. By subscribing to these events, we were able to create a mapping of which fixtures were used in which tests. We can look up the tests we need to run by looking at what files have been modified, added, removed, or renamed. This change, along with several other new test mappings, increased the percentage of builds that didn't select all tests from 45% to over 60%. A nice side effect was that the test stability also increased from 88% to 97%.</p><p>With all these changes in place, we also noticed that a small percentage of tests are responsible for the slowest CI builds. This corresponds with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle" target="_blank" title="Pareto principle" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pareto principle</a> which states, “that for many outcomes roughly 80% of consequences come from 20% of the causes.” For instance, we discovered that one test frequently hangs and causes CI to timeout. Although we already wrap each test into a <a href="https://medium.com/@adamhooper/in-ruby-dont-use-timeout-77d9d4e5a001" target="_blank" title="In Ruby, don’t use timeout()" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Ruby timeout block, it wasn’t 100% reliable</a>. Unfortunately, my team doesn’t have the necessary context and capacity to fix broken tests. Sometimes we even have to disable tests if they cause too much “harm” to Shopify and other developers. This is of course a last resort, and we always notify the original authors to give them the opportunity to investigate and come up with a fix. In this case, by temporarily removing these tests we improved the p95 by 10 minutes from around 44 minutes to 34.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content">
<article>
    
<p>Between the negative impacts on mental health, the spread of disinformation, and concerns with data privacy, the problems with social media seem more in the spotlight than ever before. <em>The Social Dilemma</em>, a recent Netflix documentary highlighting these problems (with help from the people who created them), has reached 100 million people in 190 countries <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. It’s no exaggeration to say the problems with social media are a mainstream topic.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this visibility has also led to more awareness. At the end of <em>The Social Dilemma</em>, several countermeasures are recommended, including turning off notifications, uninstalling apps, and thinking twice before sharing clickbait material. There are now <a href="https://www.hidefeed.com/">browser extensions</a> that will block recommendations and news feeds, and instead encourage intentional browsing.</p>
<p>These are all great, but they are only temporary patches. We can only work around a broken system for so long. For a lasting change, we need to rethink the system itself. There has been some discussion around this, such as this <a href="https://twitter.com/cwarzel/status/1278116194621419520">twitter thread</a> of what a better social network would look like, and <a href="https://www.humanetech.com/technologists">this guide</a> to human-centric principles for new technologists. But most of the discussion has been at a high level. For meaningful progress, we need to get specific.</p>
<p>What would social media look like if it were designed today? What features should we add or remove? How do we build something that users want AND is good for them? To explore these questions, I’ll start with the user I know best - myself.</p>
<p><strong>How would I design the ideal social media for me, knowing what I know today?</strong></p>

<p>First, it helps to reflect on my own experience. For context, I have primarily used Facebook to connect with friends since 2010. I recently started using Twitter, and very occasionally check Instagram.</p>
<h3 id="the-good">The Good</h3>
<p>There are several use cases where social media adds value to my life. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sharing occasional life updates or new content with friends and receiving supportive comments and engagement</li>
<li>Posing a question or asking for recommendations and receiving thoughtful responses, sometimes from people I don’t normally talk to</li>
<li>Seeing updates every few days from ~5-10 close friends (who I’ve marked as Show First on Facebook)</li>
<li>Seeing major life updates every few months from a wider range of acquaintances</li>
<li>Directly checking the Twitter feeds of ~5-10 people I admire and learning something new or getting inspiration</li>
<li>Visiting David Goggin’s Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/davidgoggins/">page</a> and receiving a healthy dose of motivation.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<p>More generally, I am happy about my social media use when I feel like I am able to seek out updates intentionally from the people I care about. When my browsing is centered on people, not posts. When I choose what content I want to see, not the algorithm. The added serendipity of the algorithm can be nice to periodically check-in with distant connections or discover new people, but for the most part I am happiest when not pulled away on distractions and tangents.</p>
<h3 id="the-bad">The Bad</h3>
<p>My worst experiences with social media include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scrolling through my Facebook and Twitter feeds for a “quick break” only to get sucked in and come out scattered, disoriented, and anxious</li>
<li>Sharing a post, then spending too much time checking for new notifications that it distracts me from meaningful work.</li>
<li>Procrastinating by opening the apps for a brief dopamine hit of relief from whatever happens to show up on my feed</li>
</ul>
<p>Most of my bad experiences involve falling into the short-term reward traps. Features that were designed to take advantage of our primitive brains to increase engagement - notifications, the algorithm, and the infinite news feed - pulled me into spending more time on these platforms than I was happy with. In past attempts to manage this problem, I’ve deleted apps from my phone and deactivated my Facebook account several times.</p>

<p>How would I design a social media platform that maximizes the positive value while minimizing the negative aspects? Here are some ideas.</p>
<h3 id="1-post-without-distractions">1. Post without Distractions</h3>
<p>If I want to post something on Facebook or Twitter, or Instagram, I have to go through the home page, where I’m met with a stream of content and notifications carefully curated to steal my attention. Instead, we could encourage more intentional usage by making the home page a minimal space where one can publish content without the noise of a newsfeed in the background.
Substack’s dashboard does a good job of this for newsletters.</p>

</figure>

<h3 id="2-center-on-people-not-posts">2. Center on People, not Posts</h3>
<p>Instead of a feed of posts, we should have a feed of people we care about. Each person can be a card with their photo and name. When you click on their card, it takes you to their profile with their latest updates. People can be organized into different categories - close friends, acquaintances, influencers, etc, and those with new updates can be pinned at the top. With this design, I can still keep up to date with people I care about, but do it on my own terms. Scrolling through people instead of posts would also discourage the mindless scrolling that comes with an infinitely refilling feed.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://peteryin.fyi/people_feed2.png"> <figcaption>
            <h4>Super rough rendition of feed centered on people</h4>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="3-replace-the-feed-with-a-digest">3. Replace the feed with a Digest</h3>
<p>Instead of receiving notifications throughout the day, we should batch updates in a daily digest that you can read every morning. Similar to reading the morning paper with your cup of coffee, you can get a consolidated view of updates from the 10-20 people you care most about. Every week or month, we could consolidate updates from a wider range of acquaintances, akin to the “Sunday Paper” of print newspapers. This would allow me to still stay connected in meaningful ways without unnecessarily consuming precious time and attention.</p>
<h2 id="but-what-about-all-the-other-issues">But what about all the other issues?</h2>
<p>I haven’t mentioned anything about how this better social media would become a sustainable business, nor how it would address the major issues with social media companies today, including content moderation, data privacy, and polarization. My gut feeling is that the profitability will be increasingly related to these issues in the future.</p>
<p>This particular thought experiment focuses on the aspects of social media that personally affect my wellbeing the most. However, I do believe that on a long enough time horizon, tools that align their incentives with human wellbeing will come out on top.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Social media is ripe for an evolution. Let’s use the lessons of hindsight and our personal experiences to re-imagine what a wholesome social internet looks like. Then let’s make it happen.</p>

<p>YOUR ORDER HISTORY. Your credit card information. Even your intimate health data.</p>



<p>Amazon is amassing an empire of data as the online retailer ventures into ever more areas of our lives. But the company's efforts to protect the information it collects are inadequate, according to insiders who warn the company's security shortfalls expose users' information to potential breaches, theft and exploitation.</p>



<p>The warnings about privacy and compliance failures at Amazon come from three former high-level information security employees — one EU-based and two from the U.S. — who told POLITICO they had repeatedly tried to alert senior leadership in the company's Seattle HQ, only to be sidelined, dismissed or pushed out of the company in what they saw as professional retaliation. </p>



<p>The EU-based employee is fighting the terms of their departure from Amazon through European courts. All three spoke on condition of anonymity out of concern they could face retaliation or difficulties in the job market for discussing the details of non-public legal proceedings. </p>



<p>Put together, their accounts paint a picture of a corporate culture at Amazon that they say prioritizes growth over other factors, such as the security of customers' information, compliance with rules designed to safeguard that data and the careers of employees the company hired specifically to flag problems.</p>



<p>“Imagine if a company the size of Amazon had a breach? The issue is millions of people's personal identifiable information is at risk,” the first former U.S.-based information-security employee said.</p>

<p>A spokesman for Amazon said that maintaining customers' trust by protecting their privacy and ensuring the security of their data is a "long-standing top priority" for the company. </p>



<p>"These inaccurate, unsubstantiated and dated claims don’t reflect our commitment to keeping personal information safe. Amazon has comprehensive, long-established privacy and security policies, procedures and technologies in place. We regularly audit our services to ensure compliance and have zero tolerance for employees at all levels who do not follow our policies," he said. </p>



<p>At a time when lawmakers and government officials are ramping up scrutiny of tech companies on both sides of the Atlantic, the employees' complaints are likely to strike a chord with regulators.</p>



<p>While Amazon has faced plenty of heat over its labor practices — including alleged efforts to suppress union activity at its warehouses — its handling of data has received less attention.</p>



<p>Yet the company is one of Big Tech's most powerful players when it comes to data, thanks to the hoards of customer information it collects via its e-commerce platform, its online advertising business and its gigantic cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services. </p>



<p>Garfield Benjamin, a British academic <a href="https://inforrm.org/2020/01/29/amazon-echos-privacy-issues-go-way-beyond-voice-recordings-garfield-benjamin/" target="_blank">who has previously written about Amazon’s privacy lapses</a>, said that the company's "disregard for privacy and security" was indicative of a "big problem."</p>

<p>“It seems bizarre — although perhaps unfortunately all too common — that a company so intent on making data its primary business should have such poor practices,” Benjamin said when shown POLITICO’s findings. He added, "Is their hubris so great, their assumed power so unassailable, that they see themselves as completely untouchable?” </p>



<p>The consequence for consumers is more than potential loss of trust in Amazon's privacy and security practices. The company's practices leave it vulnerable<strong> </strong>to potential breaches or hacks that could put highly sensitive information into the hands of malicious actors. </p>



<p>The data Amazon holds includes order history, payment information, data collected through its advertising business and, for sellers on its platform, forms of identification. In the wrong hands, it could be held for ransom against the threat of online publication; deployed to defraud people; used to get access to other online accounts; or leveraged in phishing attacks in which stolen data is used to trick victims into paying a fee or revealing even more sensitive information.  </p>



<p>More broadly, the accounts raise questions about what corporate values are rewarded at a company that has risen quickly to become the world's dominant e-commerce player.</p>



<h3>Data labyrinth</h3>



<p>ACCORDING TO THE TWO U.S. information-security employees, data is at risk because Amazon has a poor grasp of what data it has, where it is stored and who has access to it. </p>



<p>“If you wanted to do a 'right to be forgotten,' it would be next to impossible for Amazon to identify all of the places where your data resides within their system,” said the first former U.S.-based employee. The right to be forgotten, or right to have data erased, is a key tool for citizens under several privacy regimes, including in Europe and California.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The second U.S.-based information-security professional confirmed Amazon's shaky understanding of what reams of personal information it holds. “Amazon has grown so fast, it doesn't know what it owns … &nbsp;They don't know where their data is at, so they don’t know if they are protecting it correctly,” the person said.</p>



<p>The company’s track record on key data-security principles — controlling who has access to what data, patching vulnerabilities, ability to detect hacks, even whether passwords are changed regularly — came in for particular flak<strong> </strong>from all of the insiders who, together, have decades of experience in the area of information security.</p>



<p>“The quality of the controls that Amazon has in place is appalling. We found hundreds of thousands of accounts where the employee is no longer there but they still have system access,” said the first former U.S.-based employee, adding that such a vast number was possible because of Amazon's massive workforce and rapid staff turnover.<strong> </strong>Amazon said it has strict procedures in place when employees leave the company that remove their access.</p>



<p>Amazon has struggled to patch vulnerabilities in its systems. According to internal security reports from 2016 and 2017 seen by one of the former employees,<strong> </strong>the company declared that it was managing to patch between 55 to 70 percent of its systems. The first former U.S.-based employee likened that to leaving a house with several windows and doors open. </p>



<p>“Amazon’s information technology general controls, considering my experience and where I've been in the past, would not have passed muster with most auditors,” the first former U.S.-based employee said. "They were just poorly managed."&nbsp;</p>



<p>Weak controls mean the company may not even detect a hack. An internal Amazon memo seen by one of the former employees from June 2018 deemed there was a “very high” possibility of critical financial loss or reputational damage to the business because of the company’s “inability to identify adversarial events.”</p>

<p>Amazon said it was not aware of the reports and does not believe the claims to be accurate. It said that any historic concerns that are flagged through routine internal reporting would be fixed, which is the purpose of these processes.</p>



<p>The second former U.S.-based employee confirmed that Amazon fails to properly control access to systems, and that, in a company whose workforce has grown to more than 1 million, reams of personal information are accessible to people who do not have the appropriate role or responsibility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You've got tens of thousands of … teams connecting to big data," said the second former U.S.-based employee. "You should have a way to follow all the different types of data. From a technology point of view, you need to know where the data is going and how it's being protected. That does not exist,” they said.</p>



<p>The former employees were careful to distinguish between issues around Amazon’s internal approach to data compliance and the company’s leading track record in data-security engineering — visible through the products and services developed by AWS.&nbsp;</p>



<p>AWS’s cloud computing products are used by the likes of the U.S. government, and are widely seen as world-beating in terms of data security. One ex-employee described the security tools at Amazon’s disposal as “second to none,” but they said the strength of AWS tools in keeping systems secure is still dependent on how the end user applies them. They also noted that AWS is largely run separately from the rest of the company.  </p>



<p>The issue, they said, is that Amazon's data-security capabilities are undermined by the willingness of the company to override internal controls.</p>



<p>For instance, according to two of the former information-security professionals, data needed for new projects was sometimes improperly classified so that it would go through fewer internal checks. </p>



<p>The company said this is false. A spokesperson said it has comprehensive privacy and security policies, procedures and technologies in place that are observed by executives at all levels. The company regularly audits services to ensure compliance and employees may not be involved in decision-making outside of their role’s remit.</p>



<h3>'Woefully behind'</h3>



<p>EUROPE'S DATA-PROTECTION RULEBOOK, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), is credited by many for putting privacy on the agenda — especially within company boardrooms, where the fines of 4 percent of global turnover introduced by the legislation are often perceived as an existential threat.</p>



<p>Even so, it was only in late April 2018 — weeks before the regulation came into force — that Amazon created a dedicated team in the information-security department to address the incoming regulation. “The organization was woefully behind,” said the first former U.S.-based employee. Amazon said it had long-standing privacy and security teams and made a standard organizational change to centralize privacy resources in 2018.</p>

<p>The CAMSS driver for Qualcomm Image Signal Processors (ISPs) isn't new, but now has support for the next generation of ISP architecture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linaro.org/">Linaro</a> has been working together with Qualcomm to enable camera support on
their platformssince 2017. The Open Source CAMSS driver was written to support the ISP IP-block with
the same name that is present on Qualcomm SoCs coming from the smartphone space.</p>
<p>The first development board targeted by this work was the DragonBoard 410C, which was followed in 2018 by
DragonBoard 820C support. Recently support for the Snapdragon 660 SoC was added to the driver,
which will be part of the v5.11 Linux Kernel release. These SoCs all contain the CAMSS
(Camera SubSystem) version of the ISP architecture.</p>
<p>Currently, support for the ISP found in the Snapdragon 845 SoC and the DragonBoard 845C is in
the process of being upstreamed to the mailinglists. Having seen major changes, the ISP is
no longer referred to as CAMSS, but is instead known as Titan.</p>
<p>The Titan architecture offers improvements in resolution, framerates and most other dimensions
of the ISP, and is the latest architecture shipped on modern Qualcomm chipsets.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>CAMSS is a V4L2 (Video for Linux 2) Linux driver which focuses on supporting the basic use cases of the ISP,
such as receiving the <a href="https://www.mipi.org/specifications/csi-2">MIPI CSI-2</a> signals from the sensors,
decoding them, and then writing them to memory. This leaves a lot of functionality typically provided
by an ISP unimplemented, but that is intentional as the development priority has been to enable the
data path from camera sensor to userspace.</p>
<p>The sub-components that the CAMSS drivers supports are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CSIPHY - the CSI PHYsical layer manages the physical electrical signals sent by camera sensors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>CSID - the CSI Decoder decodes the CSI-2 encoded data transmitted by the sensors</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VFE - the Video Front End formats received data and exposes it through to further hardware blocks.
The VFE block was renamed to IFE (Image Front End) in the Titan architecture.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RDI - the Raw Dump Interface is exposed by the VFE, and is used to write the raw decoded
CSI output directly to memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PIX - the PIXel interface is exposed by the VFE, and is used to transmit data prepared
for advanced processing by more specialized hardware blocks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>ISPIF - the Image Signal Processor InterFace ties together a lot of specialized hardware blocks
into a data pipeline which can provide various levels of additionalprocessing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Qualcomm ISP Gen 1 - CAMSS</h3>
<p>The first generation of the ISP hardware block supported by the (aptly named) CAMSS driver is
called CAMSS by Qualcomm.</p>
<p><a href="https://memcpy.io/images/2021-02-23_camss_gen1.svg"><img alt="Alt text" src="https://memcpy.io/images/2021-02-23_camss_gen1.svg" title="Qualcomm CAMSS ISP Generation 1">
</a></p>
<p>The CSIPHY, CSID &amp; VFE IP-blocks are relatively fully featured, but some functionality like
Virtual Channels are not implemented. However, a more substantial limitation of the ISPIF
support is that only basic cropping and rotation is currently implemented.</p>
<p>An obstacle caused by this limited ISPIF functionality is that it's not able to do format
conversions using the ISP. So whatever format the camera sensor is outputting, is directly
output to userspace. This can be a problem for Bayer pixel format sensors, because
they're poorly supported by userspace applications and require at least debayering to be
done in a post-processing step before the output can be viewed.</p>
<h3>Qualcomm ISP Gen 2 - Titan</h3>
<p>The next iteration of the Qualcomm ISP architecture is called Titan. The changes from Gen1
to Gen2/Titan can be summarized in two parts.</p>
<p><a href="https://memcpy.io/images/2021-02-23_camss_gen2_titan.svg"><img alt="Alt text" src="https://memcpy.io/images/2021-02-23_camss_gen2_titan.svg" title="Qualcomm CAMSS ISP Generation 2, Titan">
</a></p>
<p>The Titan frontend blocks (CSIPHY, CSID &amp; VFE) are almost identical between Gen1 and Gen2
with only minor structural changes and improvements.</p>
<p>However, the image processing pipeline has been revamped, and the ISPIF no longer exists.
What replaces it is an embedded CPU which is fed commands and in turn configures the
data processing blocks. Adding support for this CPU is beyond the current scope
of CAMSS due to the amount of work it would take to enable and the lack of documentation
for the CPU command stream. However, userspace applications are able to manage some of this
post processing. This is enough to support the most basic use cases, but many will be CPU/GPU
intensive and likely not have the same quality as an ISP based implementation would.</p>
<h2>Future</h2>
<p>Linaro will continue to maintain this driver, and is likely to extend it to support
additional hardware platforms. However, contributions are very welcome and platforms
like the SDM630 and SSDM660 have already had support contributed to the CAMSS driver.</p>
<p>Currently <a href="https://libcamera.org/index.html">libcamera</a> is a very useful development tool
for working with CAMSS. It is more flexible than most V4L2 applications, and using the
<a href="https://libcamera.org/getting-started.html">libcamera/qcam</a> application makes it possible
to view live output of even Bayer camera sensors without the ISP doing any debayering.</p>
<p>Recent Linaro contributions towards libcamera have enabled GPU accelerated format conversion
and debayering for the <a href="https://libcamera.org/getting-started.html">libcamera/qcam</a> test
application, you can read more about that
<a href="https://www.linaro.org/blog/accelerating-libcamera-qcam-format-conversion-using-opengl-shaders/">here</a>.
Linaro has also contributed the Open Embedded <a href="http://cgit.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded/tree/meta-multimedia/recipes-multimedia/libcamera/libcamera.bb?h=master">libcamera recipe</a>
for developers building their products with Yocto Project based Linux distributions.</p>
<p>Other Linaro contributions to the Linux camera landscape include work in both
userspace with libcamera and in the kernel with camera sensor drivers,
ISP drivers and V4L2 API work.</p>
<p>Further developments regarding software and GPU debayering are expected for libcamera,
and hopefully the community will see libcamera debayering enabled for all of its data paths
soon enough.</p>

<p>Postgres (or PostgreSQL, if you like) is an amazingly powerful database engine. I’ve recently been working hard on <a href="https://couchers.org/">Couchers.org</a>, and as part of that, I’ve come to really dig into Postgres and understand the incredible value of it. For our use case in an open-source project built by a handful of passionate volunteers, it’s very useful when we don’t need to pull in additional dependencies and complicate the architecture. To this end, we’ve found Postgres to be a really great fit: it just has so much functionality packed right into a stable and well supported package.</p>
<p>As part of implementing text search for Couchers, I’ve spent some time learning about the different ways of going about this using Postgres, so I jotted down some of the basic ideas.</p>
<p>Postgres has two types of text search: full text search, and trigram-based “fuzzy” search. What makes text special is the many idiosyncrasies of our natural language. In most SQL databases, you like to do very straightforward relational queries, <code>SELECT user_id, display_name WHERE username = 'aapeli'</code>, but text is not so easy. There’s a variety of differences that make the problem qutie tricky. Firstly, a word does not always come in the same form, for example <code>Examples!</code> has roughly the same semantic meaning as <code>example</code> (we also have synonyms, but these are much harder). Also, we’re all humans and we make mistakes, so often you will see spelling errors, and it’s nice to have a search engine that can be somewhat resilient to it. One can get away for very basic needs with <code>LIKE</code> and <code>ILIKE</code>, as we did, but it quickly starts limiting the usefulness of search when users really want to find topics of interest. (Note that the trigram module is able to speed up these queries as well through its index.)</p>
<p>This is not a full overview of the power of these tools, rather, it’s a quick teaser and introdution to how they work! I encourage you to go read the full Postgres docs if you find this fascinating, most of the content here is from reading those pages, playing around with these, and implementing a search for Couchers.</p>
<h2 id="full-text-search">Full text search</h2>
<p>Postgres full text search works by trying to <em>normalize</em> words, then match them up exactly. That is, it tires to get around the mesiness of the language by trying to understand it and turn all words with the same semantic meaning into one symbol. These symbols are called <em>lexemes</em> in Postgres. (Each original word may result in multiple lexemes at the end.)</p>
<p>Here’s an example using the default configuration:</p>
<pre><code># select to_tsvector('This is an example sentence.');
      to_tsvector
------------------------
 'exampl':4 'sentenc':5
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Stop words (short words that aren’t useful for search, e.g. ‘this’, ‘is’, ‘an’) are eliminated, punctuation is discarded, and the rest of the words are <em>stemmed</em>, so ‘example’ maps to the lexeme ‘exampl’, and so on. Notice that each lexeme is accompanied with positional information.</p>
<p>This allows indexing large document and matching up words exactly. To query now against this representation, we convert a query string into a <code>tsquery</code>:</p>
<pre><code># select websearch_to_tsquery('examples of sentences');
 websearch_to_tsquery
----------------------
 'exampl' &amp; 'sentenc'
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>That is, we’re looking for <em>documents</em> whose normalized forms contain both <code>exampl</code> and <code>sentenc</code> (the <code>&amp;</code> signifies logical “and”). Indeed, we get a match:</p>
<pre><code># select to_tsvector('This is an example sentence.') @@ websearch_to_tsquery('examples of sentences');
 ?column?
----------
 t
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Note that full text search is very language dependent due to the use of language-specific dictionaries. There are a variety of dictionaries available, and Postgres is additionally able to use different standard formats of dictionaries.</p>
<p>In Couchers, we’re currently using English. It’s not therefore good for words that aren’t “Englishy” and not in the dictionary, for example local place names. This causes some headaches for us.</p>
<p>There is a lot more Postgres full text search can do, including weighting different parts of a document (e.g. title, address, content) differently, ranking results with a variety of algorithms, and automatically creating snippets highlighting the matched portions of text. <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch.html">Read more about these on the Postgres docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-details-in-couchers">Implementation details in Couchers</h3>
<p>We use the Postgres A/B/C/D classes for ranking, where each different searchable type has different sets of A/B/C/D. A is normally the title of the entity, e.g. the name of the community, the name of the user (or their username), page title, etc. B is normally the address or the user’s typed in city. C is any other primary text that’s more important than just the content, and D is all other text, main content, and so forth.</p>
<p>We use <code>websearch_to_tsquery</code> to turn an input into a <code>tsquery</code>. It’s safe to use with user-supplied input, and it has the usual web searchy operators:</p>
<ul>
<li>unquoted text requires each word to be in the search</li>
<li>quoted text requries each word to appear consequtively in the text</li>
<li>supports <code>or</code> and <code>-</code> (for negation)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="trigram-search-fuzzy-search">Trigram search (fuzzy search)</h2>
<p>Trigram search works by breaking up words into consequtive triplets of characters, then looking these up in an index (though indexing is of course optional). With the right indexes, this scales to insane size and can be even used to implement indexed regular expressions over huge sets of text. Postgres supports this straight out of the box!</p>
<p>The basic search however, just basically needs to count overlapping trigrams.</p>
<p>To get started you need to install the <code>pg_trgm</code> extension which comes pre-packaged with Postgres:</p>
<pre><code># CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS pg_trgm;
CREATE EXTENSION
</code></pre><p>You can then get matching! Here’s an example sentence turned decomposed trigrams:</p>
<pre><code># select show_trgm('This is an example sentence.');
                                                                 show_trgm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"  a","  e","  i","  s","  t"," an"," ex"," is"," se"," th",amp,"an ","ce ",enc,ent,exa,his,"is ","le ",mpl,nce,nte,ple,sen,ten,thi,xam}
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>A search query with a spelling error:</p>
<pre><code># select show_trgm('example sentnences');
                                         show_trgm
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"  e","  s"," ex"," se",apl,ces,enc,ent,"es ",exm,"le ",map,nce,nen,ntn,ple,sen,tne,xma}
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Now we can match against it:</p>
<pre><code># select word_similarity('example sentnences', 'This is an example sentence.');
 word_similarity
-----------------
       0.6666667
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Note that full text search would not match due to the spelling mistake:</p>
<pre><code># select to_tsvector('This is an example sentence.') @@ websearch_to_tsquery('example sentnences');
 ?column?
----------
 f
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Good on placenames:</p>
<pre><code># select word_similarity('joens', 'Joensuu, Finland');
 word_similarity
-----------------
       0.8333333
(1 row)
</code></pre><p>Trigram search is much better for “fuzzy” matching, but it doesn’t understand text semantics at all, so it’s not ideal for proper full text search or when trying to locate topics in text, and it’s a bit trickier to rank large documents. It can also be a bit tricky to get the indexes right: if a search query results in no trigrams, Postgres falls back to a full table scan… ouch!</p>
<p>However, it should be very good for searching short titles/addresses, and we in Couchers use it against the “A” class from above. Meaning basically that we do this kind of trigram matching against usernames, city names, users’ display names, and so on. Things that don’t generally have a lot of “semantic meaning” and where people easily make typos! <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgtrgm.html">Read more about <code>pg_trgm</code> on the Postgres docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-details-in-couchers-1">Implementation details in Couchers</h3>
<p>We use <code>unaccent</code> first on the query and text to be queried to remove accents and normalize text before trigram matching (which discards non-alphanumeric characters). We match against the A list only. We weight trigram similarity a bit higher than the text search results.</p>

          <p><strong> Updated:</strong> <time datetime="2021-02-21T12:00:00+09:00">February 21, 2021</time></p>
        


        <p><a href="https://architectelevator.com/strategy/complex-topics-stick/">Part 1 of this mini-series</a> described how a good presentation should combine actual experience, mental models, and a punch line, realizing that this model closely maps to  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modes_of_persuasion" target="_blank">Aristotle’s Modes of Persuasion</a> from some 2300 years ago:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ethos: Credibility or authority of the presenter (literally meaning “character”)</li>
  <li>Logos: Reasoning and logical appeal</li>
  <li>Pathos: An appeal to the audience’s emotions (“empathy” is a related term that helps memorizing this one)</li>
</ul>

<p>Experience adds to ethos because it gives you credibility, mental models use logos to show the audience how pieces relate to each other (one could say, this is “architecture”), and a memorable punch line can stir emotions, such as surprise or humor. Having been around some 2300 years, Aristotle’s model is widely cited and shared, including in my own book.</p>

<h2 id="ingredients-alone-dont-make-a-cake">Ingredients Alone Don’t Make a Cake</h2>

<p>To make these elements fruitful in a presentation, they need to be strung together into a flow. Here we encounter the limitations of a simple model like this one that’s included in <a href="https://architectelevator.com/book">The Software Architect Elevator</a> in the chapter about Showing Pirate Ships (to figure that one out, you’ll have to go and read <a href="https://architectelevator.com/book">the book</a>):</p>

<p><img src="https://architectelevator.com/assets/img/presenting_modes_persuasion.png" alt="Modes of persuasion"></p>

<p>This picture is a prototypical model (by now you surely know that I like models): it breaks down a complex topic into its components, abstracting away noise and highlighting the important aspects. One could even say it’s the architecture of a good speech—at least it passes the test of having lines.</p>

<p>However, the model is missing some important aspects. It’s like a recipe that shows us the ingredients but it doesn’t tell much how much of each ingredient we need and how we put them together. It’ll be rather difficult to bake a tasty cake based on a list of ingredients alone (insert my pet peeve about “my architecture is <em>product X</em> and <em>product Y</em>” right here).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Upping ethos and pathos from the typical 2% (allocating 96% to logos) to about 20% makes a world of difference for technical presentations.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s start with the percentage of ingredients (I’ll leave the putting together for <em>Part 3</em>). The typical technical presentation tends to consist of 96% logos, leaving perhaps 2% each for ethos and pathos, leaving a lot of improvement to balance things out. Shifting things to perhaps 60% logos and 20% ethos and pathos each will make a world of difference. After all, we are still talking about complex technical topics, but we shouldn’t make it a purely technical talk.</p>

<p><img src="https://architectelevator.com/assets/img/complex_topics_2_balance.png" alt="Balancing out a technical talk" title="Balancing out a technical talk"></p>

<p>At the same time, technical presentations needn’t be 1/3 each or flip completely the other way, like many Ted talks do. You might be making your IT great again but your audience is likely to want to hear some logos on how exactly that’s going to work.</p>

<h2 id="going-to-extremes">Going to Extremes</h2>

<p>Injecting more logos and pathos into technical presentations has been one of my favorite exercises in my <a href="https://architectelevator.com/workshops">live workshops</a> (I don’t offer them at the moment). To highlight the power of ethos, logos, and pathos, I presented the same argument in three short speeches that turn each dial to “10”, respectively.</p>

<p>Let’s assume your job is to convince people that moving faster is the essential element of your organization’s digital transformation (I do like very realistic examples). Here are three ways to go about this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>“<em>The digital world charts new territory with new business models and new ways of interacting with customers. Such novel techniques have to be tested via experiments. Now, it doesn’t do much good if each experiment takes 18 months, therefore moving fast is the most essential property for organizations that are successful in economies of speed.</em>”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<em>We often debate how we can better compete with so-called digital disruptors. Well, after spending over a decade working as a software engineer in Silicon Valley, I point to one fundamental advantage those companies have: they are simply moving faster.</em>”</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>“<em>Our company just posted another record quarter. So did Kodak, a few quarters before they went bankrupt. They were simply not moving fast enough. But we don’t have to make the same mistake.</em>”</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>As you likely guessed correctly, the first snippet is 90% logos (“from A follows B follows C”), the second one 90% ethos (“I was there and am here to tell you”), and version three is pure pathos (“hey, we’re doing great! No, actually we’re doomed. But there’s hope…”).</p>

<p>Going to extremes (bonus points for anyone who was thinking of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QorpDX-GgY" target="_blank">Kaleidoscope</a> by Paul van Dyk with vocals by Jan Johnston) demonstrates that the three elements aren’t just minor variations, but result in completely different speeches. That’s the magic of ethos, logos, and pathos. Digital transformations are the perfect place for such mixes as they are at the intersection of technology and organizational changes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ethos, logos, and pathos aren’t just minor variations but result in completely different speeches.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="amplifying-ethos-and-pathos">Amplifying Ethos and Pathos</h2>

<p>After understanding the potential of ethos and pathos, it’s useful to know some handy techniques to increase their share in your presentations. It’s like putting more butter and sugar into your cake or your cookies: they can only get better!</p>

<p>The big difference between ethos and pathos is that ethos about you, whereas pathos is mostly about the audience. Let’s start close to home:</p>

<h3 id="more-ethos">More Ethos</h3>

<p>A little ethos goes a long way. It helps overcome the initial hurdle that any presentation must take: convince the audience that listening to you is more valuable than checking email or browsing the web.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Experience</strong>: We saw already in part 1 that experience builds ethos. Sharing your experience from a concrete project leaves a stronger impression than an abstract framework.</li>
  <li><strong>Affiliation</strong>: Related, your affiliation (along with titles or degrees) can also impact your ethos. Before you add “ex-Google, ex-ThoughtWorks” to your LinkedIn tag line, remember that this can go both ways–you wouldn’t write “failed at most  big tech companies” either, so it’s all about the dosage (yes, Mr./Mrs. “PMP, PRINCE, CCP, MCTS, MIA”, I am looking at you).</li>
  <li><strong>References</strong>: The experience doesn’t always have to be yours–you can also cite external, credible sources. If <a href="https://martinfowler.com/aboutMe.html" target="_blank">Martin Fowler</a> / Gartner / Jeff Bezos said it, it must be (mostly) true!</li>
  <li><strong>Appearance</strong>: We shouldn’t base technical credibility on appearance alone but your audience is pre-programmed to form judgment base on your looks and outfit. If you don’t like it, you might need to have a work with the ultimate chief architect, or just accept it. For example, who would want to question <a href="https://handbookofsoftwarearchitecture.com/about/" target="_blank">Grady Booch’s credibility about architecture</a>?</li>
  <li><strong>Speech Patterns</strong>: Some have observed my annoyance with the fact that <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/naturally-selected/201306/the-sound-leader-ceos-deep-voices-do-better" target="_blank">deep voices make speakers more credible</a>. Not only does it amplify gender bias, but I also end up listening to deep, slow voices far too often. But before you get the vocoder out, there are more subtle ways to boost a bit of ethos. For example, slowing down your pace, pausing, or varying your vocal patterns can also make you appear more authoritative.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="more-pathos">More Pathos</h3>

<p>Pathos is about your audience: many speakers are very excited about their topic but the audience isn’t. That’s not pathos, but pathetic. First, I tend to remind technical speakers of the breadth of emotions that we can feel, in case one or two became forgotten while typing code into a text editor all day. A nice way to illustrate emotions is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Plutchik" target="_blank">Plutchik’s Wheel of Emotions</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://architectelevator.com/assets/img/plutchik-wheel.svg" alt="Plutchik's Wheel of Emotions"></p>

<p>In my little speech above I used at least four emotions:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I began with <em>pride</em> and <em>optimism</em></li>
  <li>Next, I gave the audience a <em>surprise</em></li>
  <li>Then I triggered <em>fear</em></li>
  <li>I conclude with <em>hope</em> and <em>anticipation</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Not all pathos relies on strong, one-dimensional emotions like these. There are many simple techniques to “liven up” technical presentations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Stories and Anecdotes</strong>: stories used to be the way knowledge was passed for millennia, so humans are well attuned to listening to stories. Watch people cry when watching a move - that’s the power of pathos. Again, success lies in the balance - some people feel that they need to package their technical content into a long heart-wrenching story. That’ll surely miss many people’s (surely mine!) marks. So think about short anecdotes more than long-winded stories. You don’t want your core messages gone with the wind…</li>
  <li><strong>Analogies and Metaphors</strong>: Analogies allow you to relate your mental models (logos!) to something the audience is already familiar with and often has positive associations with (pathos!). One of my favorite examples is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OqEeIG8aPPk" target="_blank">short speech by the late Russ Ackoff</a> on continual improvement. Almost each statement he makes about complex systems is related back to the automobile (<a href="https://youtu.be/OqEeIG8aPPk?t=252">4:12</a>) or the human body (<a href="https://youtu.be/OqEeIG8aPPk?t=274" target="_blank">4:34</a>)  - notice the audience’s emotion as they are listening to an academic talk about complex systems theory.</li>
  <li><strong>Concrete Figures</strong>: Even little things like replacing words like “big”, “sizable”, or “many” with concrete figures can make a presentation more relatable. So, next time you talk about scalability, reference the customer who had “thousands” of microservices and had to manage “several hundred” custom VMs.</li>
  <li><strong>Punch Lines</strong>: We saw in Part 1 that short, memorable punchlines or slogans can also stir emotions, and such boost pathos. “Don’t run software you didn’t build” is more pathos than “a modern enterprise prefers a SaaS model of cloud computing for COTS applications”.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="the-right-kind-of-pathos">The Right Kind of Pathos</h3>

<p>Not all emotions are positive, though. Remember Plutchik’s wheel: there you’ll find contempt, loathing, rage, and sadness. That’s not the kind of pathos you’re going to want to inject into your audience. Therefore, here a (likely incomplete) list of techniques that avoid some of the biggest emotional pitfalls in technical presentations:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Arrogance</strong>: Most people listen to you because you can tell them that they don’t …</li></ul></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-7335da67b70b5bec65dc"><div><p>Charlie Munger answered questions for two hours today at the 2021 Daily Journal Annual Meeting. The topics ranged from the current investing environment to worldly wisdom, and there was something to learn for everyone. Three insights stood out in particular:</p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Current Stock Market Speculation/GameStop/Robinhood/Reddit</strong></p><p><span>Charlie Munger’s view:</span> “These kind of things [referring to recent speculation in GameStop’s stock] happen when a whole bunch of people use the public stock markets instead of betting on horse races. […]I think that you should make money by selling people things that are good for them. When you have these brokerage houses luring people to gamble in the markets and then skimming off the top that is not good. This must end badly, but I don't know when. […]Nobody should believe that Robinhood's trades are free. It's a dishonorable way to talk.”</p><p><span>My thoughts:</span> We are experiencing an extreme mania in areas of the market encouraged by brokers and social media “influencers.” Just pause and think for a second: why would any self-respecting serious investor go out and post stock advice/tips on social media to a broad audience? And what does people telling each other to have “diamond hands” and to “hold the line” have to do with investing? An old proverb comes to mind: “Those who know do not speak and those who speak do not know.” And if you are really investing rather than blindly gambling (or worse, running an illegal stock market pool), then why does it make any difference to your investment conclusion what some random anonymous person on an internet forum is doing with respect to the stock in which you are invested?</p><p>I have little doubt that looking back on this a few years from now we will rate rank amateurs dumping their savings/stimulus checks/who knows what other funds into the abyss of market speculation up there with other manias of the last couple of centuries. The likely feeling looking back will be of bewilderment and pity for the thousands of regular folks who came under its influence. As Charlie said, however, when it will end nobody knows. </p><p>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Value Investing in the Current Environment</strong></p><p><span>Charlie Munger’s view:</span> “I don't think we have a bubble in Treasury securities, I just don't think they are a good investment and I have not been buying any at these rates. […] I don't think it's crazy that good companies are trading at higher P/E ratios when we have low interest rates. […] All intelligent investing is value investing the way I define it, which is getting more for your money than you pay. Some people look for value in strong companies and others look for it among weak companies.”</p><p><span>My thoughts:</span> The whole “<a href="https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/value-investing-works">does value investing still work” debate</a> has been getting a bit worn. People who really understand value investing understand that of course it still works, just that the areas where opportunities are shift around. They also understand that value investing is really about a thoughtful comparison of price with an intrinsic value derived from careful fundamental analysis of the business, the management team and the balance sheet. Anything else is just speculation. </p><p>That being said, <a href="https://behavioralvalueinvestor.com/blog/value-investors-missing-growth">value investing can be applied to a wide range of companies</a>, depending on your own circle of competence. The reason for all these recent doubts have more to do with the exuberant stock market action of the last few years than with fundamental change in that reality. When bubble-like behavior in parts of the stock market dies down, as it always does, the inquiry will shift again to the much more useful question of how should you, given your strengths, weaknesses and circumstances, practice investing.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1614223351198_20932"><div><p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; On Learning</strong></p><p><span>Charlie Munger’s view:</span> “People have a theory that any good hardworking person can be a great investor.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    
<p>I mainly wrote this blog post to help advertise Shopify as a great place to intern at, but I'm sure all of these aspects can be found at other great companies, though maybe not all at one company/team. I recommend this blog post not only for those looking to apply to Shopify, but to know how great internships can be and what qualities you would want from an internship. </p>
<p>I'm currently writing this in my last week at Shopify as I have decided to go elsewhere full-time, though I still love Shopify enough that I chose to intern there over joining a YCombinator cohort! It is a very special place to be, which is also why I returned three times (started interning at Shopify in Summer 2018). </p>
<h2 id="flexibility">flexibility<a href="#flexibility" aria-label="Anchor link for: flexibility"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This is an underlying factor in a lot of other things I'll talk about, but I like that Shopify doesn't often have "rules" for anything. Shopify let me do two (two month) internships to accommodate for my two-month summers. They also let me work part-time after I graduated! Most importantly, they don't require interns to be enrolled in a bachelor's degree program bringing epic diversity to intern classes from people with degrees in other fields or former chefs. I got the same epic flexibility at Hatch Canada, working part-time and being allowed to work on projects of my choosing.</p>
<h2 id="room-to-do-all-the-learning">room to do all the learning<a href="#room-to-do-all-the-learning" aria-label="Anchor link for: room-to-do-all-the-learning"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>I'd say I'm three times better of a programmer than I was when I started at Shopify. It happen partially through the classic "learning on the job". By building applications and getting code reviews from coworkers I became a better programmer. However, I think the key that made learning on the job effective was being able to ask a shitload of questions. Shopify was good at building an environment where I felt I could do that without feeling like I was asking bad questions or bothering anyone. This let me spend less time confused, make better decisions, learn about things I could apply in the future (or just sate curiosity).</p>
<p>Another great thing is that I had the room to dedicate time to learning. That included working through a book, reading papers or attending conferences. Shopify funded me buying textbooks and I felt alright taking a day to read up on a subject. I often spent time going down rabbit holes of reading even after completing a task. I was approved to go to Japan for a conference (cancelled due to COVID-19) and spent a day attending a workshop on VMs (didn't even bother getting approval for that).</p>
<p>Learning is good. Especially in internships, your focus should be investing in yourself and great companies should want to invest in you (within reason of course).</p>
<h2 id="impact">impact<a href="#impact" aria-label="Anchor link for: impact"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>A lot of companies end up giving interns a special project of sorts. While the project may be substantial, interesting and potentially impactful, they often get iced as soon as the intern leaves. This may not be valuable to <em>everyone</em>, but at Shopify I was apart of the weekly sprints and worked on producing features and fixes that other engineers were actually relying on. Not having intern projects would also help you better understand how much you'd enjoy working at a company full-time. The downside of course, is that you might not actually have anything to call "your own" and you will lose engineering time to things like planning meetings (which are important and fun too!). But then... the next section.</p>
<h2 id="being-a-champion">being a champion<a href="#being-a-champion" aria-label="Anchor link for: being-a-champion"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>For my third internship at Shopify, I switched from the Facebook team to a neighbouring team with people I had worked with in the past (so it was still fairly familiar). It was a bit weird, as for those four months I'd be working part-time at 20 hours a week. This would make it hard for me to be involved in day-to-day work, especially with it being Black Friday Cyber Monday (huge week for Shopify). So, I went on to champion my own project where I extended an open source app into being able to generate code (Rails and NodeJS) to build Marketing Activity extensions. This meant that I was the lead on the project, and was responsible for informing stakeholders on the status. I interacted with numerous teams and became the "person to go to" for information on the project. Yes, there was a risk of it ending up more like an intern project, but that's why it was also apart of the job to communicate with other teams and do health checks to make sure the project was ontrack and useful. Though it was not a huge project, it was exciting, impactful and "my own"!</p>

</h2>
<p>My first four months at Shopify were on the Facebook Ads / Instagram Checkout team, where we worked on an application for Shopify merchants to be able to directly advertise on Facebook through Shopify and to sell products via Instagram. Throughout my time there, I not only worked with the Facebook API but was in contact with Facebook engineers about goals and for technical support. The Facebook team also flew in to work with us and have social events, which was pretty fun! These experiences were unique, and helped me exercise some remote-working communication skills (which are really being tested during this quarantine).</p>
<h2 id="writing-for-an-engineering-blog">writing for an engineering blog<a href="#writing-for-an-engineering-blog" aria-label="Anchor link for: writing-for-an-engineering-blog"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>At the beginning of my current internship, I wrote a blog post about the first PR I shipped. The Engineering Blog doesn't have any special barrier for interns submitting work - if you did something cool, you can write about it! Through writing the post, I was able to talk to some cool folks on the Eng Comms team and sharpen my shoddy writing skills. My post now lives on <a href="https://engineering.shopify.com/blogs/engineering/optimizing-ruby-lazy-initialization-in-truffleruby-with-deoptimization">Shopify Engineering Blog</a>! It was great exposure for a personal brand to, as the post made it to the top post of Hacker News and stayed on the front page for over twelve hours.</p>
<h2 id="people-who-really-care">people who really care<a href="#people-who-really-care" aria-label="Anchor link for: people-who-really-care"> <i></i></a>
</h2>
<p>This is the aspect I think Shopify is likely most special for, and the reason I was most afraid to leave Shopify. I always felt like my team members and lead had my best interests, and wanted to make sure that I felt productive and happy at Shopify. Weekly 1:1s, frequent kind words and so many other things really brought this together. Our CTO reached out to me to compliment me for my blog post. When the company went remote due to COVID-19, I got a personal message from my Director making sure that I was doing alright (which was ridiculous because he was dealing with being quarantined with kids) along with a little casual chat. Shopify didn't even let go of culinary workers when we went remote. The list could go on! Choosing to leaving Shopify was a really emotional experience (I cried when verbally turning down the offer) because of all the kindness, patience and care people there have offered me.</p>
<hr>
<p>So keep an eye out for Shopify internships postings, and go do internships in general! Internships at Shopify run three times a year (January, May, September) for 4 to 8 months. Applications open 4 months before start dates~</p>
<p>Feel free to email me (<code>hello@carolchen.me</code>) with any questions about choosing internships, or questions about working at Shopify or anything! Courage to talk to strangers on the internet will earn you my respect &lt;3. However, please try to avoid questions along the lines of "how do I get an internship?" as quite frankly I don't have insight beyond knowing exactly what I did (some of which I have forgotten). Requests for resume reviews, for example, is something I could actually help out with.</p>

<p>On <em>2021-02-24</em> by <em>ThatGeoGuy</em></p>

<p>Recently I <a href="https://github.com/IntelRealSense/librealsense/pull/8387">fixed a
bug</a> in
librealsense2<sup id="reference-1"><a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>. The
core of the bug was that the developers used a C++ functional cast expression
in a C header (C does not have functional cast expressions!), which broke the
<a href="https://gitlab.com/tangram-vision-oss/realsense-rust">realsense-rust</a> wrapper
we’re developing at work. Worse yet, this was shipped as part of the official
2.42.0 release of librealsense2. Oof.</p>

<p>The fix is pretty clear: use a C-style cast instead. Better yet, follow the
advice in <a href="https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/">Modern C</a> and don’t use casts at
all.  We can’t always avoid them though, and the compiler can make the whole
process annoying. At least, it becomes annoying and difficult to detect such
issues when you use a C++ compiler.</p>



<p>I’ve shipped an SDK before myself, and that ended up getting me thinking: I
reject the premise of the fix in the first place. This code <em>shouldn’t</em> be
broken, and it is frustrating that it is. The real sin here was shipping inline
functions in a public header for C code.</p>

<h2 id="inlining-code-in-c--c">Inlining code in C / C++</h2>

<p>If that’s confusing, let me expand briefly. Inlining code is a common trick for
trying to improve the performance of code by having the compiler copy the
implementation of a function and apply it in place (with no additional stack
frame). This can improve performance of small code sections, and is critical in
optimizing tight loops that centre around small functions. I’d go into extreme
depth, but <a href="https://modernc.gforge.inria.fr/">Modern C</a><sup id="reference-2"><a href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup> actually has an entire
section on this, and it explains it a lot better (look for section 15.1 on
inlining functions).</p>

<p>Anyways, the trade-off of inlining functions is that you typically have to
place them in the header; alternatively, in the same source file they’re used
in if you’re not exposing the <code>inline</code>‘d function publicly. Note that this is
entirely about “performance” and not “ergonomics” or “making it easier to
code.”</p>

<p>In the scenario where I had to fix the bug above though, there’s a few
differences. Rather than directly inlining the functions, the author of the
code chose to make them <code>static</code> instead. This behaves somewhat similarly to
inlining the code directly but it isn’t exact. In this case, the <code>static</code>
functions in that <code>rsutil.h</code> header:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Can end up being instantiated separately in every translation unit (if
they’re too big to inline).</li>
  <li>Will make taking a function pointer to any of those functions behave
“strangely.” Since that function will be local to each translation unit,
taking the pointer of such a function will result in a different pointer for
each translation unit.</li>
</ol>

<p>I suppose the first problem above is a small trade-off as long as the code
works the same, but the second one is definitely not something you expect.
Particularly, this header is shipped as a C header to librealsense2’s C-API. If
you understand C by reading the header, you’ll probably notice the subtle
difference, but even still it’s not something that sits at the front of your
mind, and may surprise you if you rely on this header in many places and decide
to use the function pointer.</p>

<p>Eventually C introduced the <code>inline</code> keyword to specifically handle these
trade-offs when defining functions this way. Thus, you can get the performance
improvement of inlining small functions without the above problems with
<code>static</code> functions. However, even if we swap out the <code>static</code> keyword for
<code>inline</code> we aren’t really solving the underlying problem at all.</p>

<h2 id="the-real-issue-inline-definitions-not-the-inline-keyword">The real issue: inline definitions, not the <code>inline</code> keyword</h2>

<p>The real issue is having those definitions in the header in the first place. By
having all that code in your header, you’re shipping a dependency that is
basically promising “this code will not break on your compiler.” You don’t know
what compiler you’re shipping to; even if your ABI is stable you still have to
worry about what standard the language supports, what extensions are available,
etc. Inlined definitions are often done best if your code isn’t likely to
change ever if at all, but here you can’t be sure.</p>

<p>If you take away anything from this, it should be the importance of not
breaking downstream code because of inline definitions. By defining another C
file and moving these definitions out of the header, you would probably lose
very little, while making it easier to generate FFI bindings in other
languages, as well as allow your end users using C to well… use C.</p>

<p>This ended up breaking the FFI generation by bindgen in Rust for us, because
the inlined definition changed (and changed to something that wasn’t standard
C). That said, it’s just a bad idea overall. Most of these functions are quite
large already, so chances that the compiler inlines them directly (especially
without the <code>inline</code>) keyword are small. Moreover, most people doing
performance critical code with functions like <code>rs2_project_to_pixel</code> or
<code>rs2_project_color_pixel_to_depth_pixel</code> are unlikely to be banking on the fact
that your utility functions are getting inlined and operating at max
efficiency. Just put the definitions in their own file, and only inline the
code when you can clearly benchmark and measure a strong use-case for doing so.
Above all else, make sure you understand the language you’re shipping to when
you make that change.</p>



<p>I certainly disagree with the way the code is structured here, but its not an
easy problem. It also isn’t something that stems from bad developers, so I
can’t accuse Intel of brash incompetence. What likely happened here is that the
engineer who made the original change works in C++ for 99% of their work day,
and only touches the C headers occasionally when they get tired of compiler
warnings or if something significant changes at a lower layer. It’s really easy
to make this mistake, even if you do commit to best practices (thanks C!).</p>

<p>At the heart of the issue, working on an SDK is hard and often thankless.  I
suggest any team that might be shipping C headers take the above advice, and
take care to watch that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C is not C++, and you should compile your C-API with a C compiler</li>
  <li><code>inline</code> is an effective tool for performance, not an easy way to avoid
committing another <code>.c</code> file to your repo.</li>
  <li>a <code>static</code> storage class on functions means something specific, and has
downsides when used the same way as <code>inline</code>.</li>
  <li>you should not inline your function definitions in headers you ship publicly
for a library! This breaks everyone downstream who is using an FFI or
relying on C because they can’t use C++!</li>
</ul>

<hr>

<p id="footnote-1">
<a href="#reference-1">[1]</a> We do use Rust at <a href="https://tangramvision.com/">Tangram Visions</a>, but sometimes we still have to
understand C and C++ to be able to interface with existing code.
</p>

<p id="footnote-2">
<a href="#reference-2">[2]</a> I can't say enough good things about this book.
C is complicated in a lot of ways, but if you break things down piece-by-piece
you'll find it's actually way less bad than many make it out to be. I still
love Rust &amp; its type system significantly more, but I've worked in C / C++ in
the past, so I know from experience where things can start to go awry.
</p>

<p>
Anyways, I highly suggest giving the book a read, you'll probably learn
something! Jens Gustedt is very well informed and while some opinions (e.g.
don't use casts) are likely to start a flame war, I tend to find myself
agreeing with the final assessment.

<![CDATA[Enhancing the Linux kernel with BTF type information]]>

February 24, 2021 | https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/2018/11/14/btf-enhancement.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/2018/11/14/btf-enhancement.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> There is work in progress to bring compact debug type information into the kernel, which will be leveraged by <a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">BPF</a> to get it to the next level in terms of developer experience and capabilities. We developed an algorithm that compresses <strong>124MB</strong> of DWARF type data into just <strong>1.5MB</strong> of compact BTF type data, making it suitable to be included in the Linux kernel image by default.</p>
<!--truncate-->

<p><a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/740157/">BPF</a> is a technology that allows unprecedented ability to execute custom external code <strong>safely</strong> inside the Linux kernel in response to various events/hooks. This enables all kinds of applications, that are either impossible or expensive to achieve by other means (e.g., low-overhead profiling and tracing, rich introspection, fast custom packet processing, etc.).</p>
<p>While the BPF technology is already very capable and is constantly being developed further, the current developer experience with it is not exactly a walk in the park yet. One way to smooth out the developer experience with BPF is through better introspection and debuggability of BPF code. To allow that, BPF needs to know a bunch of metadata information about the BPF program. Type information is one of a few critical pieces of metadata necessary to bring the BPF experience to the next level. Eventually, this metadata will enable not just introspection, but also much higher levels of re-usability of BPF code across different versions of the Linux kernel (the so-called "compile once, run everywhere" approach).</p>
<p>How is such metadata represented in normal, non-BPF programs? It's typically done through <a href="http://www.dwarfstd.org/doc/Debugging%20using%20DWARF.pdf">DWARF</a> debug information. The problem with DWARF though, is that it's very generic and expressive, which makes it a quite complicated and verbose format, and thus unsuitable to include in the Linux kernel image due to size overhead and the complexity of parsing it.</p>
<p>Enter BTF (<a href="https://www.mail-archive.com/netdev@vger.kernel.org/msg226733.html">BPF Type Format</a>). It's a minimalistic, compact format, inspired by Sun's CTF (Compact C Type Format), which is used for representing kernel debug information since Solaris 9. BTF was created for similar purposes, with a focus on simplicity and compactness to allow its usage in the Linux kernel.</p>
<p>We won't describe BTF in a lot of detail here—see the links above to get complete information. Suffice it to say that BTF represents each type with one of a few possible type descriptors identified by <em>kind</em>: <code>BTF_KIND_INT</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_ENUM</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_STRUCT</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_UNION</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_ARRAY</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_FWD</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_PTR</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_CONST</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_VOLATILE</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_RESTRICT</code>, <code>BTF_KIND_TYPEDEF</code>—a few more might be added soon for functions support. Depending on the kind, there might be additional variable-sized information available. Some kinds of types can reference other types using their type IDs (e.g., <code>int*</code> type is two type descriptors: <code>PTR</code> → <code>INT</code>). The type descriptor's ID is its position in the input array of all descriptors. BTF type information is stored in <code>.BTF</code> ELF section, which contains two parts: BTF type descriptors, followed by <code>\0</code>-separated strings section.</p>
<p><img src="https://facebookmicrosites.github.io/bpf/blog/assets/btf-dedup-example.png" alt="Sample C code and its corresponding BTF type graph"></p>
<p>The diagram above should give a pretty good idea of the BTF type graph. It shows some C source code on the left and its corresponding BTF type graph on the right. The type with ID 0 is special, it represents <code>void</code> and is implicit: the first type descriptor in the <code>.BTF</code> section has type ID 1. In all the diagrams  in this blog post, type IDs are written out in the top-left corner of each type node. Type references are marked with arrows. For structs/unions it should be obvious from the diagrams which field references which type. Note that type nodes are shown in two different colors: green for non-reference types, and red for reference once (this distinction will be explained further below).</p>
<p>A well-known (within the kernel community) tool, <code>pahole</code>, was recently updated with the ability to convert DWARF into corresponding BTF type information in a straightforward, one-to-one fashion. It iterates over each DWARF type descriptor, converts it trivially into a BTF type descriptor and embeds all of them into the <code>.BTF</code> section in the ELF binary. Simple and easy. We're done, right? Unfortunately, not yet.</p>
<p>DWARF information is emitted by the compiler for each compilation unit (CU) (e.g., in the C/C++ world that is a single compiled .c/.cpp file) independently and in isolation from other compilation units that form the resulting binary. This means that DWARF information within a single CU has to describe all types referenced directly and indirectly (e.g., through struct fields) by code within that CU, down to primitive types like <code>int</code> and <code>long</code>. DWARF data from all CUs is then concatenated by the linker and put into the resulting binary <code>.debug_info</code> (and a few other) ELF sections. As you can imagine, this results in a great duplication of type information. For instance, for the kernel image on my machine, DWARF type data (<code>.debug_info</code> section) takes 121.31MB and strings (<code>.debug_str</code> section) take another 2.68MB. After <code>pahole</code>'s DWARF-to-BTF conversion there are 3.15 million BTF type descriptors: BTF type data takes 101.7MB, and strings take an additional 3.03MB.</p>
<p>There are still other problems though. The same type hierarchy (e.g., struct and all the types that struct references) can be represented in DWARF/BTF to various degrees of completeness (or rather, incompleteness) due to struct/union forward declarations.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at an example, that we'll use throughout this note to better understand the problem and solution. Suppose we have two compilation units, each using same <code>struct S</code>, but each of them having incomplete type information about struct's fields:</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> a;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>a_ptr</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>b_ptr</span>;</span>
};




<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>;</span>

<span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> b;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>a_ptr</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>b_ptr</span>;</span>
};
</code></pre>
<p>In the case of CU #1, DWARF (and subsequently, BTF) data will know only that <code>struct B</code> (but no other) exists, but will know the complete type information about <code>struct A</code>. While for CU #2, it will know the full type information about <code>struct B</code>, but will only know about the forward declaration of <code>struct A</code> (in BTF terms, it will have <code>BTF_KIND_FWD</code> type descriptor with name <code>B</code>).</p>
<p>This compilation unit isolation means that it's possible there is no single CU with complete type information describing structs <code>S</code>, <code>A</code>, and <code>B</code>. Also, we might get tons of duplicated and redundant type information. Unfortunately, for BPF use cases that are going to rely on BTF data, it's important to have a single and complete type information per each unique type, without any duplicates and incompleteness.</p>
<p>That means we need to have an algorithm, that would take this duplicated and potentially incomplete BTF information and emit nicely deduplicated type information, while also "reconstructing" complete type information by merging pieces of it from different CUs. Such BTF data can then be embedded into the Linux kernel image and readily utilized by both the kernel itself (e.g., by BPF verifier for more advanced verification scenarios), as well as external tooling to allow types introspection and better debugging capabilities.</p>
<p>Additional complications we need to keep in mind come from the fact that types, in general, can form graphs containing cycles, not just DAGs. The example above has few type cycles, which we'll use as an opportunity to better demonstrate in subsequent sections how the algorithm works. Type cycles are very common in real programs: they're typical for linked list nodes, but any moderately complex program probably would form much more complicated cycles. The Linux kernel's <code>struct task_struct</code> is part of pretty big connected type graph with multiple cycles!</p>
<p>So, in summary, we need an algorithm that will:</p>
<ul>
<li>deduplicate redundant BTF information and leave single instance of each unique type;</li>
<li>merge and reconstruct complete type information across multiple CUs;</li>
<li>handle type cycles correctly and efficiently;</li>
<li>do all of the above fast and reliably to become a part of Linux kernel build process.</li>
</ul>
<p>This note describes one such BTF deduplication (or "dedup", for short) algorithm.</p>

<p>The BTF dedup algorithm takes as an input an in-memory blob representing <code>.BTF</code> ELF section with all BTF type descriptors and string data, that comes separately from descriptors. It overwrites that memory in-place with deduplicated types and strings without any loss of information.</p>
<p>While the algorithm does deduplication, it also merges and resolves type information, whenever possible. For instance, in the example above with two compilation units having partial type information for structs <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, the output of the algorithm will emit a single copy of each BTF type that describes structs <code>A</code>, <code>B</code>, and <code>S</code> (as well as type information for <code>int</code> and pointers), as if they were defined in a single compilation unit (see the diagram below for a visual representation of input and expected output BTF type graphs):</p>
<pre><code><span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> a;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span> {</span>
    <span>int</span> b;
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>self</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span>* <span>parent</span>;</span>
};

<span><span>struct</span> <span>S</span> {</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>A</span>* <span>a_ptr</span>;</span>
    <span><span>struct</span> <span>B</span>* <span>b_ptr</span>;</span>
};
</code></pre>

<h2>Algorithm summary</h2>
<p>The algorithm completes its work in five separate passes, which we'll describe briefly here and in detail in subsequent sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strings deduplication:</strong> Deduplicate string data, re-write all string offsets in BTF type descriptors to simplify string comparisons later.</li>
<li><strong>Non-reference types deduplication:</strong> Establish equivalence between and deduplicate integer, enum, struct, union and forward types.</li>
<li><strong>Reference types deduplication:</strong> Deduplicate pointers, const/volatile/restrict modifiers, typedefs, and array.</li>
<li><strong>Type compaction:</strong> Compact type descriptors leaving only unique ones.</li>
<li><strong>Type IDs fix up:</strong> Update all referenced type IDs with new ones established during compaction.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are also a few important ideas and data structures the algorithm relies on, which are critical to understanding it and would be useful to keep …</p></span></p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>When I re-made my site with Eleventy, the pages didn't change much, but I had loads of fun adding new features. The most fun was <strong>webmentions</strong> and I'm here to convince you to add them!</p><p>First, let me step back and explain why webmentions exist—the IndieWeb.</p><p>Check out this official description of the IndieWeb:</p><blockquote><p>The IndieWeb is a community of individual personal websites, connected by simple standards, based on the principles of owning your domain, using it as your primary identity, to publish on your own site (optionally syndicate elsewhere), and own your data—<strong>indieweb.org</strong></p></blockquote><p>So, a community of personal websites, connected together, used as identities, that makes ownership of data possible. 🦄 🌈 How does this all work?</p><ul><li>There's a <a href="https://indieweb.org/">great IndieWeb resource</a> that will tell you everything you need to know</li><li>But, start here if you want to know <a href="https://indieweb.org/why">why the IndieWeb deserves your attention</a></li><li>When you're convinced, see this handy page for a <a href="https://indiewebify.me/">quick start to becoming a citizen of the IndieWeb</a></li><li>International IndieWebCamps are here to help—I wrote a <a href="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/indiewebcamp/">post about my first IndieWebCamp visit</a><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/grow-the-indieweb-with-webmentions/img/indiewebcamp2017.png" alt="Nuernberg IndieWebCamp 2017"><figcaption>Nürnberg IndieWebCamp 2017 (I'm in the bottom right)</figcaption></figure></li></ul><p>Now the juicy stuff!</p><p>I think the coolest thing about the IndieWeb is that it is decentralised. Currently, there is a handful of corporations that own much of our data. With webmentions, each person owns their own data and each person can communicate with others. Webmentions are basically a way to display on your personal site ways that others have interacted with your content.</p><p>On my site I display mentions and bookmarks. It's possible for someone to link to one of my blog posts within one of their blog posts or bookmarks. If they do this, I won't know about it unless they let me know about it. <a href="https://webmention.app/">Letting others know you've mentioned their posts can be done manually or can be automated</a>.</p><p>I also display likes, retweets and replies on blog posts that I have tweeted about. If the URL to my post is in my tweet, I can gather the interactions on that tweet and display them on that post. Although most social media platforms do not support webmentions, it's possible to gather them by using a great free service called <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a>.</p><p>Some people have had webmentions on their site for many years, so I am a bit behind. <a href="https://adactio.com/journal/6495">Jeremy has had webmentions since 2013</a>. But, there are more people posting content online than ever before, and personal websites aren't shown the love they used to get.</p><p>So, there has never been a more pressing need to put content creation platforms (e.g. Medium) and social media platforms (e.g. Twitter) second, and put your very own little corner of the web first 💖</p><p>I used Max Böck's post on <a href="https://mxb.dev/blog/using-webmentions-on-static-sites/">using webmentions in Eleventy</a> to get started. I was able to get something on the screen quickly with Max's advice, and then I refined the incoming data a bit. Here is a summary of what I did:</p><ul><li>Sign up via <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a> - if this doesn't work right away, check out ways to <a href="https://indielogin.com/setup">set up your website for indie logins</a> (I'm able to sign in by linking to my GitHub account on my site's homepage)</li><li>Add two <code>&lt;link&gt;</code> tags to your HTML document's <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> element: <code>&lt;link rel="pingback" href="https://webmention.io/{your-domain-here}/xmlrpc"&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;link rel="webmention" href="https://webmention.io/{your-domain-here}/webmention"&gt;</code></li><li>For social media mentions, sign up to <a href="https://brid.gy/">Bridgy</a></li><li>Fetch <strong>all</strong> of your site's webmention data in JSON format using one of the <a href="https://github.com/aaronpk/webmention.io#api">webmention endpoints described by IndieWebCamp co-founder Aaron Parecki</a> and the API token provided by <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention.io</a></li><li>Shape your webmention data however you like - I filter webmentions into separate re-tweet, reply, like, mention, and bookmark functions using the <code>'wm-property'</code> (check out the <a href="https://github.com/ambrwlsn/website/blob/1d713ad9fbce19a9bd8821790fd51c1be62e1f76/src/filters/webmentions-filter.js#L51">filter functions</a> and before you say anything, yes I know they could be DRYer)</li><li>Use the data to display webmentions on your blog posts</li></ul><p>Here are some of my webmentions (from <a href="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/from-gatsby-to-eleventy/">my Gatsby to Eleventy post</a>):</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://amberwilson.co.uk/blog/grow-the-indieweb-with-webmentions/img/webmentions.png" alt="Amber's webmentions on her Gatsby to Eleventy post"></p><p>If all of this seems too difficult and inaccessible, please don't give up! I thought getting webmentions on my little static site would be <strong>way too difficult</strong>. But there are so many wonderful posts about setting up webmentions, and so many great people willing to help. I count myself as one of those people :) If you want to implement webmentions on your site and are stuck on any of the points I listed above, ping me on Twitter and I'll do my best to help out.</p></div></div>]]>

We don’t understand platforms. We don’t “get” platforms. Some of you do, but you are the minority. This has become painfully clear to me over the past six years. I was kind of hoping that competitive pressure from Microsoft and Amazon and more recently Facebook would make us wake up collectively and start doing universal services. Not in some sort of ad-hoc, half-assed way, but in more or less the same way Amazon did it: all at once, for real, no cheating, and treating it as our top priority from now on.</p><p id="feb6">But no. No, it’s like our tenth or eleventh priority. Or fifteenth, I don’t know. It’s pretty low. There are a few teams who treat the idea very seriously, but most teams either don’t think about it all, ever, or only a small percentage of them think about it in a very small way.</p><p id="d363">It’s a big stretch even to get most teams to offer a stubby service to get programmatic access to their data and computations. Most of them think they’re building products. And a stubby service is a pretty pathetic service. Go back and look at that partial list of learnings from Amazon, and tell me which ones Stubby gives you out of the box. As far as I’m concerned, it’s none of them. Stubby’s great, but it’s like parts when you need a car.</p><p id="16ca">A product is useless without a platform, or more precisely and accurately, a platform-less product will always be replaced by an equivalent platform-ized product.</p><p id="0dac">Google+ is a prime example of our complete failure to understand platforms from the very highest levels of executive leadership (hi Larry, Sergey, Eric, Vic, howdy howdy) down to the very lowest leaf workers (hey yo). We all don’t get it. The Golden Rule of platforms is that you Eat Your Own Dogfood. The Google+ platform is a pathetic afterthought. We had no API at all at launch, and last I checked, we had one measly API call. One of the team members marched in and told me about it when they launched, and I asked: “So is it the Stalker API?” She got all glum and said “Yeah.” I mean, I was joking, but no… the only API call we offer is to get someone’s stream. So I guess the joke was on me.</p><p id="8313">Microsoft has known about the Dogfood rule for at least twenty years. It’s been part of their culture for a whole generation now. You don’t eat People Food and give your developers Dog Food. Doing that is simply robbing your long-term platform value for short-term successes. Platforms are all about long-term thinking.</p><p id="0f24">Google+ is a knee-jerk reaction, a study in short-term thinking, predicated on the incorrect notion that Facebook is successful because they built a great product. But that’s not why they are successful. Facebook is successful because they built an entire constellation of products by allowing other people to do the work. So Facebook is different for everyone. Some people spend all their time on Mafia Wars. Some spend all their time on Farmville. There are hundreds or maybe thousands of different high-quality time sinks available, so there’s something there for everyone.</p><p id="9209">Our Google+ team took a look at the aftermarket and said: “Gosh, it looks like we need some games. Let’s go contract someone to, um, write some games for us.” Do you begin to see how incredibly wrong that thinking is now? The problem is that we are trying to predict what people want and deliver it for them.</p><p id="dce8">You can’t do that. Not really. Not reliably. There have been precious few people in the world, over the entire history of computing, who have been able to do it reliably. Steve Jobs was one of them. We don’t have a Steve Jobs here.

It’s incredibly frigging obvious. Except we’re not doing it. We don’t get Platforms, and we don’t get Accessibility. The two are basically the same thing, because platforms solve accessibility.

And you will want to keep that data: for reference and inspiration in the future, to include it in a portfolio, or simply to archive because you feel proud of it. It is important to <em>feel ownership</em> of that data, because the creative expression is something so personal.</p><p id="edb7">Unfortunately, cloud apps are problematic in this regard. Although they let you access your data anywhere, all data access must go via the server, and you can only do the things that the server will let you do. In a sense, you don’t have full ownership of that data — the cloud provider does. In the words of a <a href="http://www.chriswatterston.com/blog/my-there-is-no-cloud-sticker" rel="noopener">bumper sticker</a>: “There is no cloud, it’s just someone else’s computer.”</p><p id="f738">We use the term <em>“ownership”</em> not in the sense of intellectual property law and copyright, but rather as the creator’s perceived relationship to their data. We discuss this notion in <a href="https://www.inkandswitch.com/local-first.html#user-control" rel="noopener">a later section</a>.</p><p id="ba06">When data is stored on “someone else’s computer”, that third party assumes a degree of control over that data. Cloud apps are provided as a service; if the service is unavailable, you cannot use the software, and you can no longer access your data created with that software. If the service shuts down, even though you might be able to export your data, without the servers there is normally no way for you to continue running your own copy of that software. Thus, you are at the mercy of the company providing the service.</p><p id="df6a">Before web apps came along, we had what we might call “old-fashioned” apps: programs running on your local computer, reading and writing files on the local disk. We still use a lot of applications of this type today: text editors and IDEs, Git and other version control systems, and many specialized software packages such as graphics applications or CAD software fall in this category.</p><p id="72e7">The software we are talking about in this article are apps for creating documents or files (such as text, graphics, spreadsheets, CAD drawings, or music), or personal data repositories (such as notes, calendars, to-do lists, or password managers). We are not talking about implementing things like banking services, e-commerce, social networking, ride-sharing, or similar …</p></blockquote></div></div></section></div></div>

<p>sK1 is an open source cross-platform vector graphics editor like CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator, or Freehand.
    The major feature of sK1 is a professional precise printing and prepress ready PDF output.</p>

<p>sK1 2.0 is <a href="https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">licensed under GPL v3</a>.
    So you may use this application as for personal or commercial purposes without any fees.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Application supports basic vector graphics primitives: rectangles, rounded rectangles, ellipses, pies, sectors,
        chords, polygons, Bézier curves, text and bitmaps.</p>

    <p>The objects may be structured on pages, layers and just in selectable groups/containers. Pages within a document
        can be of different sizes.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Bézier curves are fundamental rendering units. All the primitives can be converted into curves. We use
        <a href="https://www.cairographics.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cairo library</a>
        to render these curves on the screen. </p>

    <p>Thanks to cairo we have cross-platform unified antialiased rendering, similar to PostScript/PDF definitions.</p>

    </p>
    <p>Like PS/PDF definitions, sK1 2.0 provides solid fill, gradient fill and pattern fill for graphics primitives. Also
        the objects can be outlined by solid stroke</p>

    <p>Like for PDF objects, alphachannel is available for solid fill, gradient stops and for stroke color.
        Application supports RGB, CMYK and Grayscale colorspaces. SPOT colors are also supported.</p>
    <p><i>Note: PANTONE® colors are just a special case of SPOT colors.</i></p>

    </p>
    <p>Inside sK1 2.0 all the color values and raster images are under color management. We use
        <a href="http://www.littlecms.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LittleCMS library</a>
        for these purposes. </p>

    <p>Despite of built-in profiles, end users can use own color profiles to customize color management engine.
        Printer emulation on screen option is also available.</p>

    </p>
    <p>sK1 2.0 text engine has a full-function rendering of multi-language text and cross-platform support because it's
        powered by <a href="https://pango.gnome.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pango library</a></p>

    <p>Thanks to this library, application handles text layout for particular combinations of script and font backend.
        Modules for Hebrew, Arabic, Hangul, Thai, and a number of Indic scripts are supported.</p>
    <br>
</div>

<p><a href="https://sk1project.net/uc2/">UniConvertor 2.0</a> is a core package of sK1 2.0 application. UC2 provides extended import/export
        functionality of different vector graphics, raster image and color palette file formats. Thus sK1 2.0 is connected
        to existent open source and commercial graphics software like Inkscape, Gimp, CorelDRAW, Adobe Illustrator,
        Xara Designer etc.</p>

<p>sK1 2.0 user interface is built on <a href="https://www.wxwidgets.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">
        wxWidgets toolkit</a>. This toolkit allows easy porting application on MS Windows and macOS without rewriting
        tonnes of GUI code.

You might have never heard of an "<a href="https://wor.do/idle_asset">idle asset</a>" before. But you probably have a good idea of what it means. Even your grandmas first guess of what an “idle asset” is, is likely to be correct.</p><p>

This cannot be said of <i>“product market fit”</i>.<br>
Ask 10 people, grandmas or even Y-Combinator applicants, and the answers will be all over the place.</p><p>

<b>Michael Seibel chips in</b></p><p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/Xx912ku.jpg" width="100%">

<small><i>"You have reached product market fit when you are overwhelmed with usage—usually to the point where you can’t even make major changes to your product because you are swamped just keeping it up and running."</i>[1]</small></p><p>

Another YC partner said that demand is growing <i>soooo</i> fast, that you just want to die.</p><p>
<i>"If you don't want to die, you don't have product market fit"</i>.</p><p>

So the people who popularized the term, say it's synonymous to <i>extreme growth</i> or <i>incredible demand</i>. Then why not call it that? Anyone and their grandma will understand such terms right away.</p><p>


<b>"Dominance"</b></p><p>
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/UHRVkCj.png" width="100%"></p><p>
Google basically <i>owns</i> the search market. They absolutely <i>dominate</i> it. Perhaps, "product market fit" is just a euphemism to avoid using the term dominant. Hmm.</p><p>

<b>So what does product market fit really mean?</b><br>
It simply means that your product and its market have found each other, and by extension, that often means seeing serious growth. Though sometimes, the product is catered towards a niche audience, in which case it might not become the next Google, while still enjoying <i>product market fit</i>.</p><p>

<b>Naval's got something to say too</b></p><p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/9g9dJVk.png" width="100%"><br>

Is that really so Naval? 🧐<br>
By that definition, many of the sideprojects I built, that went absolutely nowhere, all had product market fit. Yay. </p><p>

In reality, many nice sounding quotes require the stretching of a definition in order to make sense.<br>Example: <i>"Real wealth is having lots of free time"</i>.</p><p>
It sounds great, right? But, can you transfer this "real wealth" to your cousin from Bangladesh who's working 14 hours a day? I like Naval, though, I think that one was a miss. But I digress..</p><p>

<b>OK, so now what?</b><br>
When possible, use simple words. YC is big on avoiding <a href="https://wor.do/buzzword">buzzwords</a>, yet they throw around <i>product market fit</i> left and right, leaving many people confused. Just say <i>extreme growth</i>, or any alternative that is understood quickly.




</p><!--
Here’s a few terms that do a better job at describing product market fit, than product market fit<br>

* Extremely rapid growth<br>
* Painfully fast growth<br>
* Long lasting growth<br>
* Rapid Compound growth<br>
</li>

<br><br>
I could write a PHP random word generator, and come up with many more terms that do a better job at describing product market fit, than product market fit does.

These are the workers that stopped that."</p>    <p>CSE,&nbsp;one of Canada's key intelligence agencies, employs&nbsp;about&nbsp;2,900 people and&nbsp;is responsible for foreign intelligence and cybersecurity.</p>  <p>The vote comes nearly two years after talks&nbsp;stalled on a collective agreement. At issue is a change to the&nbsp;market allowance —&nbsp; a wage supplement negotiated to close pay gaps with workers doing similar work in the private sector. It's a benefit&nbsp;often used to attract employees into highly technical jobs in the public service.</p>  <p>"CSE management is refusing to apply a wage increase to the portion of workers' salaries that is&nbsp;made up of market allowances," said Silas.</p>  <p>"To give you an idea, for some of these workers [that] represents as much as 10 per cent of their annual income.&nbsp;So it's a significant financial loss."</p>  <p>The vote&nbsp;does not mean&nbsp;workers are&nbsp;heading for the picket lines.</p>  <p>"We are now ramping up preparations and coordinating with our members to determine the precise actions that will be taken and their timing. But we emphasize that strike action can still be avoided if CSE management comes back to the table and steps away from its concession or agrees to arbitration," said PSAC spokesperson&nbsp;Alroy Fonseca.</p>  <h2>CSE says services will continue</h2>  <p>Christopher Williams, director general of CSE public affairs and communications services, said CSE's executive management team continues to work toward&nbsp;a resolution with the union.</p>  <p>"However, we can tell you that essential service agreements are in place to ensure that all areas of&nbsp;CSE&nbsp;have the people at work necessary to continue to provide for the safety and security of the public in the event of a strike," he said in an email to CBC News.</p>  <p>CSE has been sounding the alarm about the threat of cyber&nbsp;attacks on research facilities and the health care sector during the pandemic. It was one of the intelligence agencies that stated a hacker group backed by Russia&nbsp;"almost certainly" tried&nbsp;to steal COVID-19-related vaccine research in Canada, the U.K. and the U.S.</p>  <p>Late last year, CSE warned that state-sponsored actors are "very likely" trying to shore up their cyber capabilities to attack Canada's&nbsp;critical infrastructure — such as the electricity&nbsp;supply&nbsp;— to intimidate or to prepare for future online assaults.</p>  <p>While the lights will remain on, the union says the agency will lose workers if it doesn't offer&nbsp;competitive salaries.</p>  <p>"What does it say about how we prioritize national security?" said Silas.&nbsp;"If CSE as an employer, as management, doesn't recognize the need to pay these workers a fair market rate, how are we going to attract and retain the talent needed for the important work of keeping Canadians safe from cyber attacks?"</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

February 24, 2021 | https://mainestartupsinsider.com/running-tides-attracts-big-vc-names/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mainestartupsinsider.com/running-tides-attracts-big-vc-names/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
							<p>Running Tide Technologies, a Portland-based company that operates traditional oyster farms, has just emerged from stealth with a big, bold plan to sequester gigatons of CO2 on the ocean floor over the next several years by growing kelp and then sinking it to the bottom of the sea.</p>
<p>The company has been keeping its cards close to the vest, but Fast Company magazine <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90548820/forget-planting-trees-this-company-is-making-carbon-offsets-by-putting-seaweed-on-the-ocean-floor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an article</a> today revealing Running Tide’s plan to leverage its aquaculture expertise to tackle the issue of climate change. Its plan, according to the magazine, is to grow kelp, which like other plants extracts carbon dioxide from the environment, on floating rigs and then sink them to the ocean floor. Once there, the CO2 could remain sequestered for centuries.</p>
<p>“Once it goes down below 1,000 meters, it’s not coming back up, because the pressures are so great,” Marty Odlin, Running Tide’s founder and CEO, told Fast Company. “So you can get at least 1,000 years of sequestration. More likely, it will turn into oil or sediment and be sequestered on the geologic timescale—millions of years.”</p>
<p>Unlike terrestrial forests that can burn or degrade and release the carbon back into the atmosphere, marine plants don’t break down as easy. Plus, coastal&nbsp;ecosystems sequester up to 20 times more carbon per acre than land forests, <a href="http://sitn.hms.harvard.edu/flash/2019/how-kelp-naturally-combats-global-climate-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to this article</a> published by Harvard University.</p>
<p>Running Tide <a href="https://www.runningtide.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated its website</a> this week. While previously focused on traditional shellfish aquaculture, it now includes language about its “negative emissions journey” to combat climate change with its kelp. It also says that Running Tide will be selling “kelp carbon credits.”</p>
<p>Maine Startups Insider had heard rumors about the company and how it had been able to attract big-time VC money. MSI <a href="https://mainestartupsinsider.com/has-silicon-valley-big-shot-chris-sacca-invested-in-a-maine-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published an article last week</a> speculating that Chris Sacca, one of Silicon Valley’s most well-known venture capitalists, had invested in the company via his new VC firm, Lowercarbon Capital. Sacca did not respond to MSI’s requests for confirmation, but did announce his firm’s investment in the Portland company on Twitter after the Fast Company article was published.</p>
<p>“Bonkers scale, unreasonable ambition, massive impact on the plant. During insane times, it’s entrepreneurs like @martyodlin that fire us up,” Sacca tweeted.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">

<p>Shopify, the ecommerce behemoth, also revealed itself this week as an investor in Running Tide. The ecommerce-platform company last year launched its Sustainability Fund to fight climate change. On Monday, <a href="https://www.shopify.com/about/environment/sustainability-fund/ocean" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it shared in a blog post</a> how it invested its first $5 million, including an investment of undisclosed size in Running Tide.</p>
<p>“All work is important in carbon reduction, but some people have to try to kill the monster,” Odlin told Shopify. “Everyone should try to slow it down, but we should pick 15–20 technologies that might be able to stop the whole thing all by themselves. That’s what we’re trying to build.”</p>

<p>I have not been successful getting the company to confirm how much it raised, <a href="https://pitchbook.com/profiles/company/266342-50#overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but Pitchbook claims</a> it raised $11.2 million in November 2019. In addition to Lowercarbon Capital and Shopify,&nbsp;PitchBook lists three additional investors: Soraya Darabi, an angel investor, San Francisco-based Pathbreaker Ventures, and San Francisco-based Yes VC.</p>
<p>David Frankel, a partner at Boston-based Founder Collective, also revealed on Twitter on Tuesday that he had led the seed financing.</p>
