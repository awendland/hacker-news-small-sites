<p>These days’ people find it so easy to replace quality with the quantity which in the long run leaves loopholes and challenges. Patching up which later costs higher than the quality but not up to the standard of the quality.</p>
<p>In my personal professional experience, people often offer services in my line of work for a ridiculously cheap price, and innocent people who fall for such end up spending above budget.</p>
<p>There was a client sometime back who came to inquire about a blog site, he said he doesn’t want a CMS (e.g. WordPress, Joomla, etc.) based blog but one that is built from scratch with custom features, so I gave him a quote of our quality service at the best price and he promised to call back.</p>
<p>When he did call back he was not calling for me to do the work anymore but to tell me he had given it to another person who has agreed to take a very cheap price from him but he wants me to check if the guy is giving him quality, I smiled at my own end and told him he will have to pay for consultation which is one of the services he knows we offer but he wanted it for free, I quickly objected and told him the price which was half the price in the first quote I gave him.</p>
<p>After he has paid for the consultation, I dug into the technologies used to develop the work and found it was the same Joomla which the client specifically said he doesn’t want, I brought this to his notice and he asked his guy about it, but guess what? The guy denied using a CMS to build the site and delivered the project like that. The client had to pay the amount in the first quote for me to redesign the work.</p>
<p>The total spending of the client amounted to 150% of our initial quotation plus the extra fee he paid the other guy. </p>
<p>Moral: Always be quality-oriented in your daily decisions.</p>

                    <h2>Feeling great</h2>
<p>What do you want people to feel when they talk to you? Happiness, sadness or maybe everything combined? </p>
<p>Do you want people to be inspired or motivated to tackle new and exiting problems? </p>
<p>Do you want to make the world a better place?</p>
<p>I think to understand your life purpose, you gotta understand yourself first. Not in a psychoanalytical way, but in a spiritual and reflectional way.</p>
<p>Don’t beat yourself up. Make yourself proud inside of you. If you are proud of what you do, then it means that you are following your heart. If you are following your heart, you are doing the best work you can, because there are too many people that do things for money. If you want to succeed, then there is no better strategy than that.</p>
<p>Live the life that you would feel proud about telling your grandchildren. Live the life that would inspire your children and will set a good role model for them. Be a person that is open to every opportunity, but chooses only those that align with their goals. Be open to success and closed for disappointment.</p>
<p>Shoot each time you have an idea, and don’t afraid to fail. You can miss and embers yourself just a little. Or you can never shoot and never achieve anything in life. Which one sounds worse?</p>
<h2>Understand your surrounding</h2>
<p>The most important part of being successful is in alignment with your surrounding.</p>
<p>Look around yourself. Do your habits improve it? Do people around you improve and getter better because of your actions? Are you on your way to helping others?</p>
<p>Humans are social beings, and the language that we have developed is the biggest indicator of that. If we could survive alone, we wouldn’t have needed a language to communicate. </p>
<p>You need to check up on others and help them. This will cause a domino effect, and in the end, you will benefit even more from that.</p>
<p>You are 5 people who you spend most of your time with. List those people and check if they are improving you and your well being, or are they destroying it? It is essential to make those 5 people stronger and better than you. This will allow you to grow, which will allow you that effect to trickle to other people, improving their lives.</p>
<h2>Don’t be afraid to try</h2>
<p>If you have a particular thing that you want to experiment, calculate how much will it cost. Mostly the things we are the most afraid of trying or doing we can try or do for less than $500 and the drawbacks are not irreversible.</p>
<p>Don’t be afraid to shoot and fail. Try and see how it goes. You can always roll back to the point of start.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>

            <p>This post is about how I renamed a go module from
github.com/something/somethingelse to go.gianarb.it/somethingelse. It requires
zero infrastructure, just a static site that can run on GitHub.</p>

<p>I used one of the many projects I have that nobody cares about
<a href="https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc">gianarb/go-irc</a>.</p>

<h3 id="why">Why</h3>

<p>You know, is one of those ideas you have in your mind for ages, but who cares?
At least for me that I don’t have any cool open source project under my name.</p>

<p>I am not one of those people who suffer when realizing that it is not escale. If
you end up having a project that gets traction and is tight to github.com
because you didn’t think about another way to go, you are stuck. And even if
GitHub today is cool, it won’t stay cool forever.</p>

<p>Filippo Valsorda <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">@FiloSottile</a> today
<a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile/status/1327240411266641920">tweeted</a> about this
topic, and I looked at how he set up filippo.io/age to solve this little
dilemma.</p>

<h3 id="goals">Goals</h3>

<p>This is not about how to escape from GitHub but is about setting up a “vanity
URL” that won’t lock you or your project to GitHub. It does not require any
infrastructure, just a domain that you can point to a GitHub Pages.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisite">Prerequisite</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Create a DNS record that points as CNAME to <code>&lt;github-handle&gt;.github.io</code>. I
used go.gianarb.it</li>
  <li>Create a repository; it will be the home for your static site. Mine is
<a href="https://github.com/gianarb/go-libraries">gianarb/go-libraries</a></li>
  <li>Set the repository up to be a <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub page</a> and
enable HTTPS. You can enable it via the repository Settings; we will push
HTML files to it directly, so I used the master branch as the GitHub page’s
source.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="add-your-first-library">Add your first library.</h3>

<p>If your library is already using go mod, you have to change the module name to
the new one. In my case, from was github.com/gianarb/go-irc to
go.gianarb.it/irc. I just searched and replaced with my editor in all the
project. Renaming a module is a bc break; I am not sure how to avoid or mitigate
that; if you know, let me know!</p>

<p>You can push a new file to your static site repository; I called my irc:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;html&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;head&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;meta</span> <span>name=</span><span>"go-import"</span> <span>content=</span><span>"go.gianarb.it/irc git https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc"</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>&lt;meta</span> <span>http-equiv=</span><span>"refresh"</span> <span>content=</span><span>"0;URL='https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc'"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/head&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;body&gt;</span>
        Redirecting you to the <span>&lt;a</span> <span>href=</span><span>"https://github.com/gianarb/go-irc"</span><span>&gt;</span>project page<span>&lt;/a&gt;</span>...
    <span>&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Replace your URL accordingly, but as soon as you push this file and GitHub will
release it to your page, you will be able to import: <code>go.gianarb.it/irc</code>.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>This methods works as a safeguard if you decide to move your code out from
GitHub. The static site can be deployed to Netlify, S3 or served by Nginx. It
does not need to stay on GitHub.</p>

<p>Same for your code, if you decide to move from GitHub to GitLab you can do it
transparently.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Consider a team of engineers building a feature API for Snapchat. Let’s call them Ovah’s team. They’re facing two big problems: how to build it, and how long would it take.</p>

<p>If they can’t figure out how to build it, the feature is dead already. If they take too long to build it, the feature is as good as dead: Instagram would copy it before they’ve built it.</p>

<p>This post contains 4 different perspectives to look at the two problems. As you read through the perspectives, notice the tension in the examples. Both problems are vastly different, and some perspectives are better for one problem, and worse for another problem.</p>





<h2 id="the-outside-view">The Outside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_outside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the outside view, Ovah’s team compares this feature to other similar features they’ve built in the past. They built earlier features using Flask, and it took them 1 month to do it.</p>

<p>The outside view says that a good estimate for how long it would take is 1 month as well.</p>

<p>Further, the outside view says that a good estimate for how to build it is how you built it in the past: using Flask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The outside view looks for similar problems in different contexts. It’s a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behaviour level model</a>: you look at things only from the outside. How things change from the outside are hints to what’s important on the inside.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that figuring out how long it takes might do well with the outside view, but the API design decisions - not so much. What’s different between the two problems?</p>

<p>Taking the outside view on API design decisions is like building a truck using a car model. Just because it has 4 wheels and behaves the same as a car doesn’t mean it’s used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>On the flip side, not taking the outside view for figuring out how long it would take is a fallacy. Daniel Kahneman writes about the outside view in <a href="https://amzn.to/3eVmTkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-inside-view">The Inside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_inside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the inside view, Ovah’s team looks at the components of the problem. They look at the requirements for the feature, and come up with a good design tailored exactly for this use case. It’s unique. They decide to go with Django instead of Flask, since it gets them authentication and other nice things out of the box.</p>

<p>The team figures that with Django, most things are done for them already, so it should take about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The inside view looks at specifics of the problem. It’s a gears level model: you understand how things tick. You figure out how each component would work.</p>

<p>Taking both, the inside and outside view is better than just taking one. It’s like going to the eye doctor, where they show you unreadable letters on a lit-up screen. They add one lens on your eyes, and you begin to distinguish <code>o</code> and <code>e</code>. Then they add a second lens, and now you can even tell the difference between <code>h</code> and <code>n</code>! They add a third spherical lens, and the dots become sharper - you can now even see the dots over the i’s as circles, not blobs. Each lens is a perspective that sharpens your view. It helps you realise that you’re looking at <strong>e</strong>va<strong>n</strong>’s team, not <strong>o</strong>va<strong>h</strong>’s team: and then everything clicks.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>In this case, using Django was a good decision. However, it took much longer than 2 weeks: unexpected things went wrong, and the team’s imagination was limited by how things can go right.</p>

<p>I think engineers are better at designing APIs than they are at figuring out how long it would take, which hints at them being better at taking the Inside View. This makes taking the Outside View even more important: if no one else is thinking like you, you have a sharp lens no one else has, which makes all the difference.</p>

<p>At the same time, you need to beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maslow’s Hammer</a>: If you only take the Outside View on every problem, you’ll end up with a bad API design.</p>

<h2 id="the-birds-eye-view">The Bird’s eye View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_bird.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the bird’s eye view, Evan’s team looks at how this API should connect to other teams and clients. What are the other components involved? How can we best design things to work seamlessly with existing workflows?</p>

<p>The bird’s eye view looks at the problem as a part of a system, a part of other problems. This is different from the outside view, since it’s still the same problem in the same setting, but being looked at as an interface: how it connects to other things and other problems.</p>

<!-- Sometimes, tweaking the bigger picture can improve the interface, and subsequently the problem in the specific box you were working. -->

<p>Amazon is a company that internalises the bird’s eye view: Every team talks via interfaces! Every other team is their customer. You can’t go to your friend and ask them to open a backdoor for internal calls: it needs to be part of an interface anyone in the company can call. This means, not just clients, but also their colleagues and friends face the pain when the interfaces are hard to use.</p>

<p>What would it mean to take the bird’s eye view for the second problem? Evan’s team looks at how long their dependent teams would take, and when customers would be most likely to upgrade. So, they decide to launch with the next filters release, using that as a guiding factor: if the feature won’t get done by this time, build a smaller feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-worms-eye-view---genchi-genbutsu">The worm’s eye View - Genchi Genbutsu</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_worm.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genchi_Genbutsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genchi Genbutsu</a> means to “go and see”. Go to the problem, and see why it’s a problem.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For Evan’s team, this means looking at the team dynamics, and figuring out if Evan or others are somehow holding the team back. It also means figuring out if they have the required expertise in the team, and if not, how can they build it.</p>

<p>Like how the bird’s eye view zooms out to the interface between other teams, the worm’s eye view zooms in to the interface between people in the team. It’s one layer deeper than the problem of designing the API: it’s about how the team will go about it. You’re looking at the problem as a single engineer among other engineers working on the same problem.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>I’ve noticed that the Inside View, and the Bird’s eye view comes more naturally to people, while Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View are rarer. The more uncertainty and unknown unknowns involved in a problem, the more important Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View become.</p>

<p>The importance of taking these different perspectives shows up when you’re facing hard problems without an obvious solution: with the right combination of lenses, a blur turns into a sharp dot.</p>

				<p>Brought to you by the “I hate Mondays” department of Tales Of A Tech.</p>
<p>We would like to remind you that if there is a problem and you can’t seem to figure it out there’s always one solution to look to: It’s ALWAYS DNS.</p>

<p><strong>The Story:</strong></p>
<p>Last night I was trying to login to this site in order to make a post about my drone shenanigans (which, by the way, is <a href="https://talesofatech.com/2017/03/drone-shenanigans/">here</a>). &nbsp;I was already super frustrated because Mass Effect: Andromeda is coded by a team of (apparently) monkeys who don’t understand how to make working autosave features (my autosave files are all corrupt, causing me to lose 5+ hours of gameplay) and the site wasn’t being cooperative. &nbsp;I was reaching “blow-your-top” levels of frustration. &nbsp;I was finally able to connect and login but I immediately noticed things were running VERY slowly. &nbsp;It was weird, and I couldn’t figure out why. EVERYTHING seemed slow. &nbsp;Even the SSH connection was jittery and laggy.</p>
<p>At first I thought it was a problem with the network in the apartment. &nbsp;It happens from time to time. &nbsp;We run a lot of equipment in our apartment. &nbsp;I ran some speed tests and some other diagnostics and found that everything seemed to be working. &nbsp;Very weird.</p>
<p>Since I managed to SSH in I decided to check some logs. &nbsp;There didn’t seem to be anything in the apache log. &nbsp;fail2ban wasn’t being uncooperative. MySQL was running and seemingly accepting localhost connections. &nbsp;Very weird. &nbsp;I resorted to the only thing I could think of next: I rebooted the box.</p>
<p>Everything&nbsp;came back up (yay) but the site was still clunky and slow (not so yay).</p>
<p>I decided to enable verbose logging in apache and attempt to restart the service. &nbsp;It timed out. The hell?</p>
<p>I ran “journalctl -xe” per service failure message and noticed a peculiar entry:</p>
<pre>Mar 27 21:17:51 TalesOfAnAdmin systemd[1]: apache2.service: Start operation timed out. Terminating.
Mar 27 21:17:51 TalesOfAnAdmin systemd[1]: Failed to start The Apache HTTP Server.</pre>
<p>Failed to start due to timeout? &nbsp;Timeout of what? SO CONFUSED.</p>
<p>Digging back a little further I saw another confusing line:</p>
<pre>Mar 27 21:15:12 TalesOfAnAdmin apachectl[1860]: [Mon Mar 27 21:15:12.835322 2017] [core:error] [pid 1864] (EAI 2)Name or service not known: AH00547: Could not resolve host name maplerangers.com</pre>
<p>Huh. &nbsp;Weird.</p>
<p>I had a quick confab with Nick and he suggested I check if my websites were in my hostfile. &nbsp;They weren’t, so I added them. &nbsp;Apache startup became instantaneous. &nbsp;Things seemed to be improving. &nbsp;Cool.</p>
<p>I logged in to the website which was up and more responsive, but absolutely slow. &nbsp;Very weird still. &nbsp;I noticed an error on my WordPress Administration page: “curl error 28: operation timed out”</p>
<p>What the hell?</p>
<p>So back to the SSH I go. &nbsp;I try pinging wordpress.com: &nbsp;Unknown host. &nbsp;I try pinging google.com: Unknown host. &nbsp;I try pinging an IP Address for those sites: Working fine.</p>
<p>Grrrr!</p>
<p>I look at /etc/resolv.conf — I’m using Google DNS. &nbsp;Ok.</p>
<p>Let’s see if DigitalOcean has anything about this: Bingo!</p>
<blockquote data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Our engineering team is investigating reports of DNS connectivity issues while using the Google resolvers. During… <a href="https://t.co/cEpXMPJ3Nq">https://t.co/cEpXMPJ3Nq</a></p>

<p>Interesting.</p>
<p>I edit the resolv.conf (and interfaces) to reflect a change to OpenDNS as the primary DNS with Google as the fallback DNS (as per the article linked later in the Tweet).</p>
<p>Restart networking.</p>
<p>Boom, everything is working.</p>
<p>It was DNS.</p>
<p><span><strong>It’s always DNS.</strong></span></p>
<p>-M, out.</p>

<p>An Egyptian scuba diver is believed to have set a new world record by remaining under water for nearly six entire days.</p>
<p>Saddam Al-Kilany, 29,&nbsp;completed the feat in the&nbsp;Red Sea off the Dahab coast.</p>
<p>Al-Kilany stayed underwater for 145 hours and 30 minutes, surpassing the current record&nbsp;of 142 hours, 47 minutes. The current world record was set by Cem Karabay in Cyprus.</p>
<p>Al-Kilany had&nbsp;originally planned to remain&nbsp;underwater for 150 hours, but the attempt was ended at 145 hours and 30 minutes due to concerns about his health.</p>
<p>Al-Kilany, who previously made headlines when he and his fiancee, Pia Legora, held their&nbsp;engagement ceremony&nbsp;underwater in September.</p>
<p>Video from the attempt and other documentation is being submitted to&nbsp;Guinness World Records&nbsp;for recognition.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Message queues are one of the critical components in any software architecture which helps different components talk to each other asynchronously. In this article let's discuss what message queues are, how they're used in modern architectures and what problems do they solve.</p>
<p>Let's say you want to withdraw some money from an ATM. An ATM machine can only allow one person to do transactions at a time. In this case, what do you do when you see there's a person already using the ATM machine? Do you wait in a queue or do you go back thinking you cannot withdraw money from this machine?</p>
<p>Exactly! You wait in a queue until your turn comes.</p>
<p>So when many people want to withdraw money they will have to wait in a queue and go to the ATM machine in the same order in which they entered the queue. This is one real world example of queues and message queues serve the same purpose in any software architecture.</p>
<p>We will talk about below topics in this article:</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="#properties">Other properties of message queues</a></li>
<li><a href="#resources">Resources</a></li>
<li><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-are-message-queues">What Are Message Queues?</h3>
<p>A queue is a First-In First-Out data structure. If you have a computer science background you know how a queue data structure works: the first element pushed into the queue is the first item extracted. It's basically the same concept as what we discussed in our ATM machine example.</p>
<p>A message queue is basically a queuing service used in micro services &amp; server-less architectures to decouple different components that are easier to develop, scale &amp; maintain in the long term. Message queues helps different components to communicate asynchronously by passing messages between them.</p>
<p>Generally in applications where message queues are used there are producers who create and put the messages into message queues. And there are consumers or worker processes which read those messages and take actions.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605504976290/uqTaa9q5A.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_4624157258.png"></p>
<p>A message is any data that is passed between two components. It contains all the information needed for the worker components to take actions.</p>
<p>Let's consider a use case where we have to recharge a customer's account. The worker component need to know these details: account_id, card_id, amount (in dollars).</p>
<p>The message the producer creates and puts into a message queues will look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"account_id"</span>: <span>12345</span>,
    <span>"card_id"</span>: <span>567</span>,
    <span>"amount"</span>: <span>100</span>
}
</code></pre><p>As you can see, the above message contains all the information that a worker process needs to recharge this customer's account.</p>
<p>There are many third party message queueing services like Rabbit MQ, Kafka, Amazon SQS to name a few. Each one of them provide different features suitable for different use cases.</p>

<h3 id="how-are-message-queues-used-in-a-system">How Are Message Queues Used In A System?</h3>
<p>As mentioned earlier message queues are used to decouple different components in a system. But what does it mean to decouple a system? It basically means the process of separating functions so that they're more independent and self contained.</p>
<p>Let's discuss it with an example. Let's say we need an application to generate invoices and send it to our customers at the end of the month. For the sake of this discussion let's assume that generating invoices is a time taking process and take anywhere between few seconds to a minute to generate one single invoice which involves doing the below steps in order:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get customer account details</li>
<li>Get customer billing details</li>
<li>Get data for different products used by the customer during the month</li>
<li>Apply any onetime charges and charge customers</li>
<li>Finally generate a invoice PDF and send it to the customer</li>
</ul>
<p>How would you implement such a functionality?</p>
<p>This is how a naive developer would approach it: Build a single REST service which accepts requests and does the above steps. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605506280058/Y03xhpEYG.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_8235631782.png"></p>
<p>This is a monolith architecture and has many problems with it:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>No Fault Tolerance:</strong> Fault tolerance is the ability for a system to continue operating without any interruption when one or more of its components fail. Since we have a single REST service, if the service goes down, the whole application stops working.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Components Cannot Be Scaled Independently:</strong> If we want to scale the application when the number of customers accounts increase, then we have to scale the whole application. This means more resources will be used since we cannot scale any individual component independently. So the use cases like Get Account Details will be scaled even though it is unnecessary because this components generally gets less traffic.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>No Freedom of Language:</strong> Since all the components are built using a single application, a single language / framework need to be used to build the complete application. We cannot use different languages for different components since the whole application is a single code repository which is built and deployed together.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Increase in Development and Deployment Time:</strong> Having all the components as one single codebase will increase the development time. Since this is a big application, it's possible that different teams would be working on different components of the system at any point in time. So all the teams need to take care of code consistency, code quality and also have to spend time in resolving merge conflicts since active development will be going on. This adds to the development time. Also with bigger codebase it takes more time to build and deploy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As seen above there are many problems if we go with a monolith architecture for the given problem statement. We need to divide the application into multiple components like Invoice Generation Service, Invoice Generation Service Worker, Account Service, PDF Generation Service etc.</p>
<p>Let's see how diving this into multiple services &amp; having a message queue to communicate between them will solve these problems.</p>

<h3 id="what-problems-do-message-queues-solve">What Problems Do Message Queues Solve?</h3>
<p>With micro services architecture, the architecture would look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1605508126047/PhUZ4K-mV.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="imageedit_2_2135728654.png"></p>
<p>In this architecture the Invoice Generation Service will create a message for every customer account. This message would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>{
    <span>"account_id"</span>: <span>12345</span>,
    <span>"invoice_start_date"</span>: <span>"2020-10-01"</span>,
    <span>"invoice_end_date"</span>: <span>"2020-10-31"</span>
}
</code></pre><p>Therefore if we have 1000 accounts there will be 1000 messages pushed into the queue. The worker service will contain multiple workers. Each worker will pickup a message and start processing it. All the workers will be running concurrently. Each of these workers will talk to Account Service, Billing Service and PDF Generation Services which are micro services themselves.</p>
<p>Now let's see how each of the problems mentioned above will be solved with this architecture.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong> Fault Tolerance</strong>: If one of the component fails the other will work seamlessly. Let's say if Invoice Generation Service Worker is down for reasons, Invoice Generation Service will continue to work and keep pushing messages into the queue. It is not dependent on whether Worker service is up or not. If Invoice Generation Service is down, Worker service will continue to pull the messages from the queue and continue to generate invoices. So now there is fault tolerance in the system.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Scalability:</strong> Now since the components are independent of one another they can be scaled independently too. All the heavy weight work is being done by the Worker service and Invoice Generation Service is just creating and pushing the messages into the message queue. So we need more computing power for the Worker service. So we can have powerful machines to run Worker service and we can add more tasks if the number of accounts increase in the future. Whereas the Invoice Generation Service can be run on less powerful machines. With this architecture we're able to scale the different components independently.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Freedom of Language:</strong> Having multiple components like this will give us the freedom to implement different components in different programming languages and frameworks. For example: Invoice Generation Service can be implemented in Java. Worker can be implemented in GoLang.
And if let's say we have another service which is responsible for generating invoice pdf, this can be implemented in Python. So having multiple components like this and having a message queue for communication between them will give us the flexibility over languages used in the architecture.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Improved Developer Productivity &amp; Deployment Time:</strong> Since different components can be developed independently, the developer productivity will increase since they don't have to spend more time in co-ordinating when adding new features, resolving merge conflicts etc. Also the codebase of each of the component or service will be lighter and will have a separate deployment pipeline. So the quality, build and deployment time will decrease.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-properties-of-message-queues">Other Properties Of Message Queues</h3>
<p>Different message queuing services offer different message queues with properties like visibility timeout, message retention period, message size etc based on the popular use cases in the industry.</p>
<p>AWS provided message queuing service is called SQS (Simple Queue Service).</p>
<p>Let's discuss about SQS provided message queues and their properties in this section which gives you an idea on the different types of properties available with message queues in general.</p>
<p>AWS SQS offers two types of message queues:</p>
<h4 id="standard-queue">Standard Queue:</h4>
<p>Amazon SQS offers standard as the default queue type. Standard queues support a nearly unlimited number of API calls per second, per API action (SendMessage, ReceiveMessage, or DeleteMessage). Standard queues support at-least-once message delivery. However, occasionally (because of the highly distributed architecture that allows nearly unlimited throughput), more than one copy of a message might be delivered out of order. Standard queues provide best-effort ordering which ensures that messages are generally delivered in the same order as they're sent.</p>
<h4 id="fifo-queue">FIFO Queue:</h4>
<p>FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queues are designed to enhance messaging between applications when the order of operations and events is critical, …</p></div></div>

Meanwhile, China exported goods valued at nearly eight times as much. China’s top exports included products such as electrical machinery, appliances and equipment. While raw materials and products requiring less sophisticated manufacturing composed the majority of India’s exports.</span></p><p id="viewer-f2041"><span><strong>Mineral products, chemical products and precious metals and stones</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-9sv1v"><span>India’s top exports are dominated by mineral products (16 percent), chemical products (14 percent) and precious metals (12 percent). Mineral products include mineral fuels and oils, such as Manufacturing in India vs. Chinapetroleum.</span></p><p id="viewer-4t78m"><span>Chemical products include various organic and inorganic chemicals, soaps, tanning dyes, fertilizers, explosives and, most notably, pharmaceuticals.

Some of India’s leading exports in food and beverage include:</span></p><ul><li id="viewer-citq4"><p>Basmati rice</p></li><li id="viewer-8o9ls"><p>Carabeef or meat of bovine animals</p></li><li id="viewer-f7e4l"><p>Frozen shrimp and prawns; and</p></li><li id="viewer-bqua5"><p>Refined sugar</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-3737a"><span>India’s broader agricultural sector accounts for 17 percent of the country’s economy and employs more than 60 percent of the population.</span></p><p id="viewer-7ql2u"><span><strong>Garments and textiles</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-bcu8t"><span>The garment and textiles industry is one of India’s fastest growing. Overall textiles exports were valued at $39 billion in 2018 and are expected to more than double by 2021.</span></p><p id="viewer-9shou"><span>Part of the growth comes from various government initiatives, such as a 2018 increase in basic customs duties from 10 percent to 20 percent on more than 500 textile products. Another contributor is India’s robust production of relevant input materials, such as cotton, which lend supply chain and cost advantages.</span></p><p id="viewer-faukb"><span>These exports include knitted, woven and crocheted textiles and apparel, carpets and textile floor coverings and man-made filaments.</span></p><p id="viewer-7r4hg"><span>Despite China’s current dominance in export value, India’s government is making serious efforts to invest in the country’s manufacturing sector. Though the manufacturing sector now contributes only 16 percent to India’s gross domestic product (GDP), the “Make in India” initiative aims to boost that contribution to 25 percent by 2022.</span></p><p id="viewer-caorn"><span>And companies like Chinese smartphone maker OnePlus are investing heavily in R&amp;D in India. “Our success in India has proven to be a great model for our growth in other regions,” says OnePlus CEO Pete Lau. “…We are now closer to making India as our second headquarters.”</span></p><h2 id="viewer-6tjmf"><span>COST AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED LABOR IN INDIA AND CHINA</span></h2><p id="viewer-fp3rq"><span>Differences in manufacturing wages, size and skill level of the labor force should be at the forefront of your decision to move production from China to India. Depending on your product type, some of these factors may highlight clear advantages for remaining in China.</span></p><p id="viewer-6tdee"><span><strong>Manufacturing wages</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-7q1sj"><span>Labor represents one of the main costs of manufacturing goods. And importers have watched China’s labor costs soar in recent decades, often growing by 10-15 percent annually. China’s minimum wages, which now range from about US$140 to US$346 per month, are set at the provincial level.</span></p><p id="viewer-5u605"><span>India’s minimum wages similarly vary across states and range from about US$66 to US$202. Mounting U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods over the past year have only strengthened the case for India as a cost-effective manufacturing alternative. And importers of labor-intensive products, like garments and textiles, are in the best position to realize cost savings by moving to India.</span></p><p id="viewer-2dtbl"><span><strong>Labor force size and skill level</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-5d337"><span>Among the many manufacturing locations opposing China, India is unmatched in the size of its labor force. According to September 2019 data from the World Bank, India’s labor force numbers about 519 million. China’s labor force is still much larger with 783 million strong. But Indonesia’s labor force, with 134 million workers, is a distant third for the region.</span></p><p id="viewer-fh5j3"><span>India falls behind many of its neighbors with regard to factors the World Economic Forum use to rank countries in their human capital report. India ranks 103rd overall, while China ranks 34th.</span></p><p id="viewer-3umpt"><span>One area where India suffers a deficiency is in “know-how”, which includes the breadth and depth of specialized skills at work. We see this directly at play in the quality and complexity of the country’s top export products. This metric also measures employers’ perceived ease at filling job vacancies.</span></p><p id="viewer-8obvp"><span>India also has room to grow with regard to its labor development rank. This rank considers access to and enrollment in formal education, opportunities to upskill and how well the education system fits the needs of a competitive economy.</span></p><p id="viewer-6aqg0"><span>Some have attributed the low development rank to India’s shortage of vocational schools.</span></p><p id="viewer-crl8q"><span>The relatively low labor participation rate in India—just 67 percent among the 25-54 age group as of 2017—also hurt the country’s human capital rank. India’s employment gender gap, one of the world’s largest, was another major contributor. In contrast, China achieved a labor participation rate of 88 percent for the same age group.</span></p><p id="viewer-3r1pr"><span>On the positive side, India has performed relatively well in terms of quality of education, staff training and economic complexity.</span></p><p id="viewer-aa1e7"><span>Read further at <a href="https://www.intouch-quality.com/blog/manufacturing-in-india-vs-china" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>https://www.intouch-quality.com/blog/manufacturing-in-india-vs-china</u></a></span></p><p id="viewer-1hgbn"><span><em><strong>If you are looking forward to source high-quality metal jewelry then reach out to us at </strong></em><a href="mailto:info@aliajewelery.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><strong><u>info@aliajewelery.com</u></strong></em></a><em><strong> &amp; we'll provide you with a free quote as per your requirement.</strong></em></span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

    <h3 id="are-we-living-in-a-simulation"><strong>Are we living in a simulation?</strong></h3>

<p>With the evident success of computer technologies 
this question raises more and more frequently.</p>

<p>Tech people mostly agree that this is a possible scenario, 
it could even be that we live in a multiple layers of simulations -
a simulation that runs in another simulation and so on.</p>

<p>While there is probably no way to disprove this hypothesis 
I argue that believing in such thing has a negative psychological effect 
on an individual and a society in general.</p>

<h3 id="what-do-we-mean-by-simulation"><strong>What do we mean by simulation?</strong></h3>

<p>In a process of simulation we are trying to model and imitate some real phenomena with the purpose of predicting or imposing the future outcomes. An imitation is generally much cheaper to perform than a real process. So we can trial a lot of different scenarios to find the best strategy before implementing it in reality.</p>

<p>It can be a computer modeling of a physical process or experiment. A repetition of some upcoming performance. Or even a thought process when we try to imagine a tree of possible events and our possible responses.</p>

<p>Virtual reality or a computer game also can be considered as a simulation since we model some elements of our real world (with some fictional elements, though) in a controllable and cheaper environment.</p>

<p>In general, all simulations are irrelevant when the best strategy is found.</p>

<p>But observe that in any case simulation is still part of the reality. Every completed game, no matter how useless it was, is still part of our world. And due to the butterfly effect every tiny event can have a huge impact in the future.</p>

<p>So, a simulation is always real, even if it predates the <em>real action</em>. It’s just way less important.</p>

<h3 id="why-would-we-prefer-to-think-that-we-live-in-a-less-important-world"><strong>Why would we prefer to think that we live in a less important world?</strong></h3>

<p>The simple answer is — people tend to downgrade what they see if they don’t like that. An irresponsible and childish person became a president of a powerful country? A girl has to tell to world leaders what to do with the Earth’s climate? No, this doesn’t imply that we live in some kind of game, or a part of a show. There are explanations and they are real. We just don’t know or understand them.</p>

<p>Another reason could be that the world became so big and interconnected that we feel ourselves in much less control. There are too many information, too many factors, too many actors. Also the pace of change is not making us more certain about the future. The world is less predictable than ever today.</p>

<p>Finally, downgrading reality is a psychological way to flee from our responsibilities in life. Why bother to do something if everything is not important?</p>

<h3 id="the-effects-of-such-belief"><strong>The effects of such belief</strong></h3>

<p>Believing that the world is just a simulation implies that we, our feelings and our actions are not that important either.</p>

<p>The is a huge amplifier of depression if a person has already lost their sense and purpose in life. Or this could be an excuse to live a meaningless life.</p>

<p>Now imagine that you live in a society that think the world around is not that important, including you, obviously. 
You could be an NPC (non-player character) in this game, after all. Just an AI script written by a programmer from the <em>true world</em>. Would you like to live in such community?</p>

<h3 id="conclusions"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>

<p>Do not downgrade <em>the reality</em> of what you see simply because you don’t like it, don’t understand or don’t control it. All your actions, your feelings, your views and your life in general are <em>matter</em>, as well as the life of others.</p>

  <section>
    <p>This is the 1967 Turing award lecture by Maurice V. Wilkes. From <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">Wikipedia</a>, Wilkes is best known as the builder and designer of the EDSAC, the first computer with an internally stored program. This lecture does a wide survey of computer as they were in 1968 and makes many accurate predictions. Yellow highlights/annotations are my own. <a onclick="disableHighlight()" href="#">You can disable them.</a></p>

<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>Reminiscences on the early developments leading to large scale electronic
computers show that it took much longer than was expected for the first of
the more ambitious and fully engineered computers to be completed and prove
themselves in practical operation. Comments on the present computer field
assess the needs for future development.</p>

<p>I do not imagine that many of the Turing lecturers who will follow me will
be people who were acquainted with Alan Turing. The work on computable
numbers, for which he is famous, was published in 1936 before digital
computers existed. Later he became one of the first of a distinguished
succession of able mathematicians who have made contributions to the
computer field. He was a colorful figure in the early days of digital
computer development in England, and I would find it difficult to speak of
that period without making some references to him.</p>

<h2 id="pioneering-days">Pioneering Days</h2>

<p>An event of first importance in my life occurred in 1946, when I received a
telegram inviting me to attend in the late summer of that year a course on
computers at the Moore School of Electrical Engineering in Philadelphia. I
was able to attend the latter part of the course, and a wonderful experience
it was. No such course had ever been held before, and the achievements of
the Moore School, and other computer pioneers, were known to few. There were
28 students from 20 organizations. The principal instructors were John
Mauchly and Prosper Eckert. They were fresh from their triumph as designers
of the ENIAC, which was the first electronic digital computer, although it
did not work on the stored program principle. The scale of this machine
would be impressive even today  – it ran to over 18,000 vacuum tubes.
Although the ENIAC was very successful – and very fast  – for the
computation of ballistic tables, which was the application for which the
project was negotiated, it had severe limitations which greatly restricted
its application as a general purpose computing device. In the first place,
the program was set up by means of plugs and sockets and switches, and it
took a long time to change from one problem to another. In the second place,
it had internal storage capacity for 20 numbers only. Eckert and Mauchly
appreciated that the main problem was one of storage, and they proposed for
future machines the use of ultrasonic delay lines. Instructions and numbers
would be mixed in the same memory in the way to which we are now accustomed.
Once the new principles were enunciated, it was seen that computers of
greater power than the ENIAC could be built with one tenth the amount of
equipment.</p>

<p>Von Neumann was, at that time, associated with the Moore School group in a
consultative capacity, although I did not personally become acquainted with
him until somewhat later. The computing field owes a very great debt to yon
Neumann. He appreciated at once the possibilities of what became known as
logical design, and the potentialities implicit in the stored program
principle. That von Neumann should bring his great prestige and influence to
bear was important, since the new ideas were too revolutionary for some, and
powerful voices were being raised to say that the ultrasonic memory would
not be reliable enough, and that to mix instructions and numbers in the same
memory was going against nature.</p>

<p>Subsequent developments have provided a decisive vindication of the
principles taught by Eckert and Mauchly in 1946 to those of us who were
fortunate enough to be in the course. There was, however, a difficult period
in the early 1950s. The first operating stored-program computers were,
naturally enough, laboratory models; they were not fully engineered and they
by no means exploited the full capability of the technology of the time. <mark>It
took much longer than people had expected for the first of the more
ambitious and fully engineered computers to be completed and prove
themselves in practical operation.</mark> In retrospect, the period seems a short
one; at the time, it was a period of much heart searching and even
recrimination.</p>

<p>I have often felt during the past year that we are going through a very
similar phase in relation to time sharing. This is a development carrying
with it many far-reaching implications concerning the relationship of
computers to individual users and to communities, and one that has stirred
many people’s imaginations. It is now several years since the pioneering
systems were demonstrated. Once again, it is taking longer than people
expected to pass from experimental systems to highly developed ones that
fully exploit the technology that we have available. The result is a period
of uncertainty and questioning that closely resembles the earlier period to
which I referred. When it is all over, it will not take us long to forget
the trials and tribulations that we are now going through.</p>

<p>In ultrasonic memories, it was customary to store up to 32 words end to end
in the same delay line. The pulse rate was fairly high, but people were much
worried about the time spent in waiting for the right word to come around.
Most delay line computers were, therefore, designed so that, with the
exercise of cunning, the programmer could place his instructions and numbers
in the memory in such a way that the waiting time was minimized. Turing
himself was a pioneer in this type of logical design. Similar methods were
later applied to computers which used a magnetic drum as their memory and,
altogether, the subject of optimum coding, as it was called, was a
flourishing one. I felt that this kind of human ingenuity was misplaced as a
long-term investment, since sooner or later we would have truly
random-access memories. We therefore did not have anything to do with
optimum coding in Cambridge.</p>

<p>Although a mathematician, Turing took quite an interest in the engineering
side of computer design. There was some discussion in 1947 as to whether a
cheaper substance than mercury could not be found for use as an ultrasonic
delay medium. Turing’s contribution to this discussion was to advocate the
use of gin, which he said contained alcohol and water in just the right
proportions to give a zero temperature coefficient of propagation velocity
at room temperature.</p>

<p>A source of strength in the early days was that groups in various parts of
the world were prepared to construct experimental computers without
necessarily intending them to be the prototype for serial production. As a
result, there became available a body of knowledge about what would work and
what would not work, about what it was profitable to do and what it was not
profitable to do. While, looking around at the computers commercially
available today, one cannot feel that all the lessons were learned, there is
no doubt that this diversity of research in the early days has paid good
dividends. It is, I think, important that we should have similar diversity
today when we are learning how to construct large, multiple-access,
multi-programmed, multi-processor computer systems. <mark>Instead of putting
together components and vacuum tubes to make a computer, we have now to
learn how to put together memory modules, processors, and peripheral devices
to make a system</mark>.<label for="sn-1"></label>
<span>
S: What we now call as <em>computer architecture</em>.
</span>
I hope that money will be available to finance the
construction of large systems intended for research only.</p>

<p>Much of the early engineering development of digital computers was done in
universities. A few years ago, the view was commonly expressed that
universities had played their part in computer design, and that the matter
could now safely be left to industry. I do not think that it is necessary
that work on computer design should go on in all universities, but I am glad
that some have remained active in the field. Apart from the obvious
functions of universities in spreading knowledge, and keeping in the public
domain material that might otherwise be hidden, universities can make a
special contribution by reason of their freedom from commercial
considerations, including freedom from the need to follow the fashion.</p>

<h2 id="good-language-and-bad">Good Language and Bad</h2>

<p><mark>Gradually, controversies about the design of computers themselves died down
and we all began to argue about the merits or demerits of sophisticated
programming techniques; the battle for automatic programming or, as we
should now say, for the use of higher level programming languages, had
begun.</mark> I well remember taking part at one of the early ACM meetings – it
must have been about 1953 – in a debate on this subject. John Carr was also
a speaker and he distinguished two groups of programmers; the first
comprised the “primitives,” who believed that, all instructions should be
written in octal, hexadecimal, or some similar form, and who had no time for
what they called fancy schemes, while the second comprised the “space
cadets,” who saw themselves as the pioneers of a new age. I hastened to
enroll myself as a space cadet, although I remember issuing a warning
against relying on interpretive systems, for which there was then something
of a vogue, rather than on compilers. (I do not think that the term compiler
was then in general use, although it had in fact been introduced by Grace
Hopper.)</p>

<p>The serious arguments advanced against automatic programming had to do with
efficiency. <mark>Not only was the running time of a compiled program longer than
that of a hand-coded program, but, what was then more serious, it needed
more memory.</mark> In …</p></section></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This blog has never been a money-making endeavor. I’ve had a series of jobs in software engineering and leadership that have paid my rent since 2009. Nevertheless, it’s interesting to tinker with ways how this blog could pay for its own domain name renewal fees.</p><h3 id="itunes--amazon-2016-2018">iTunes &amp; Amazon (2016-2018)</h3><p>For a few years, I had affiliate links on the site, for iTunes and Amazon links. The <a href="https://appleservices-console.partnerize.com/login/appleservices/en_us">Apple partner program</a> is relatively unknown but was pretty easy to use. Sticking <code>&amp;at=1010lmEW</code> at the end of links to the iTunes store tagged them with your website as an origin, and they give some low percentage of application and music sales. In the time I used it, the total was around $30.</p><p>Amazon Affiliates is the most famous program of its type on the internet. For a while, whenever I linked to Amazon, I’d use those links. It yielded slightly more than iTunes, in total around $60 over the course of three years, or $20 a year.</p><p>I removed all of these links in 2018. Disclosing that <em>this site uses affiliate links</em> on the About page felt a little grimy, and the idea that I might be linking to something just to earn a buck – though it was never true – felt like something to be entirely avoided. Plus, linking to Amazon meant enriching a company that’s <a href="https://www.revealnews.org/article/the-truth-about-injuries-at-amazon/">really</a>, <a href="https://themarkup.org/2020/07/30/congressional-antitrust-tech-hearing-recap-facebook-amazon-alphabet-google-apple">really</a>, not on the right side of history.</p><h3 id="brave">Brave</h3><p>I set up this site with <a href="https://brave.com/">Brave</a>’s rewards system in mid-2019. Brave, the browser, has a pretty complicated ecosystem around it: a <a href="https://basicattentiontoken.org/">cryptocurrency, BAT</a>, a <a href="https://publishers.basicattentiontoken.org/">publisher-side interface</a>, and a bunch of details that they’re lining up to eventually have the Brave browser itself serve ads on webpages that allow it.</p><p>Setting up a site with Brave Publishers involves a text file <a href="https://macwright.com/.well-known/brave-rewards-verification.txt"><code>brave-rewards-verification.txt</code></a>, to link your account with your website, and then setting up an account on <a href="https://uphold.com/">Uphold</a>, a sort of cryptocurrency wallet, to convert your money to USD, some other sort of cryptocurrency, or, in the rarest case, use it to buy something with crypto.</p><p><img alt="Brave Rewards" src="https://macwright.com/images/2020-11-15-mini-monetization-experiments-brave-rewards.png"></p><p>All-in-all, this site has earned 162 BAT, which, at $0.19 each, is about $30. <del>The reason <em>why</em> it makes any money from Brave is a total mystery to me. Sure, someone directly tipped 9.5 BAT, or about $2, but where did the rest come from? I didn’t use affiliate links to encourage people to use the Brave browser - I don’t use it myself at all, it seems fine though. The thing where Brave shows ads on webpages isn’t launched yet, as far as I can tell. It’s cool that money appeared somewhere, but it’s hard to say why.</del></p><p><a href="https://mostlysubjective.com/about/">Atanas Entchev</a> explains that Brave opens ads in separate tabs, which is where the ad revenue is coming from, and then those collected BAT tokens are distributed to sites like this one. Thanks!</p><h3 id="coil">Coil</h3><p>More recently, I set up <a href="https://coil.com/about">Coil</a> on this site. Like Brave, it requires you to sort of ‘confirm’ that you own the website and link it to your site. To do that, you get a sort of special code from Uphold and put that in a meta tag on the page:</p><div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;meta</span>
  <span>name=</span><span>"monetization"</span>
  <span>content=</span><span>"$ilp.uphold.com/Kk2HbEYgFH6K"</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Coil’s a very interesting sign of the times: a blockchain-powered technology behind a startup that is apparently trying hard to never mention blockchains or crypto. To me at least, that seems wise. The culture and thought around crypto and blockchains have been poisoned by scammers, techno-liberatarians, and all sorts of baddies.</p><p>I think the economics around Coil are a lot more straightforward than Brave: people install a browser extension or use the Puma Browser, and they pay $5 a month to fund websites that support it. It’s much newer and less popular than Brave, and as a result, so far…&nbsp;it earns about $0.04 a week.</p><h3 id="ko-fi">Ko-fi</h3><p>Finally, I’ve had a <a href="https://ko-fi.com/">Ko-fi</a> link up on the /about page for a while. It’s been nice, and is the simplest and most straightforward sort of option: every once in a while, someone enjoys an article and sends a few dollars my way.</p><p>I think that it’s a nicer fit for someone like me who doesn’t have a fixed topic or schedule. I write just when I feel strongly about something, or have something I think is interesting to share. I don’t want to crank out a weekly or month post about JavaScript or React or maps in order to fit a schedule, and disconnect my enthusiasm with my output.</p><h3 id="how-its-going">How it’s going</h3><p>My goal with monetization is to cover domain name registrations for this site and to keep a finger on the pulse of this “indieweb monetization” idea to see if it ever yields something worthwhile. I’m nearly paying for the domain names, but web monetization is still a pretty nascent field.</p><ul><li>Brave is neat because people passively fund your site, but it’s really opaque about where money comes from.</li><li>Ko-fi is great, very casual, and pretty low-tech: it’s just a fancy way to accept PayPal.</li><li>Coil is interesting and doesn’t try to do a fancy multi-sided market like Brave does, but very few people use it.</li></ul><p>What Brave and Coil have in common is a pretty high level of inefficiency and semi-hidden fees.</p><ul><li>When you get paid out for Brave’s rewards system, Brave takes a 5% fee that they bury in the UI.</li><li>When you’re paid from Coil, Uphold takes a 1.2% fee that they round up to the nearest penny, which in my case rounds it up to 16%.</li><li>You can’t spend BAT, the Brave currency, so you need to convert it to USD or another cryptocurrency, which means another fee, <a href="https://uphold.com/en-gb/get-started/service-fees">implemented as a spread</a>, that’s at least a few percent of the transaction.</li></ul><p>Ko-fi, which uses no crypto technology, charges zero fees on their transactions.</p><p>My goals for this site are very modest. If I were aiming higher, then I’d look to <a href="https://substack.com/">substack</a> or try writing on Medium or a syndicated blog. But I don’t want to lock away content, or lock myself into a publishing schedule or another set of expectations. So for those constraints, it seems like these systems for micropayments and little gratitudes will do the trick, without affiliating this site with a monopoly.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[A Short History of Romaji]]>

November 15, 2020 | https://www.dampfkraft.com/romaji-history.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.dampfkraft.com/romaji-history.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently created a tool called <a href="https://github.com/polm/cutlet">cutlet</a> for converting Japanese to romaji.
While working on cutlet I was surprised at the difficulty of finding a good
guide to the difference between romaji systems, particularly their history and
usage, so I wrote this up.</p>
<h2 id="a-romaji-refresher"> A Romaji Refresher</h2>
<p>There are three relatively well-defined romaji systems. For a quick overview of
some of their differences:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>新橋</th>
<th>お茶漬け</th>
<th>富士山</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>Shinbashi (or Shimbashi)</td>
<td>ochazuke</td>
<td>Fujisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyazuke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>Sinbasi</td>
<td>otyaduke</td>
<td>Huzisan</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is the most widely used outside Japan, Kunreisiki is officially taught
to children in Japan. Nipponsiki is similar to Kunreisiki but older. Technically
Hepburn uses macrons for long vowels while Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki use
circumflexes, but usage isn't consistent and there's no difference in meaning
between them.</p>
<p>In recent years "wapuro" romaji, based on input when typing Japanese, are also
relatively common, but it's not systematized (except in as far as programs
either take or don't take certain sequences) and isn't used in any kind of
formal writing.</p>
<h2 id="particle-comparison"> Particle Comparison</h2>
<p>As another refresher, here's how non-phonetic particles are represented in the
various systems.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Japanese</th>
<th>は</th>
<th>を</th>
<th>へ</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Hepburn</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Kunreisiki</td>
<td>wa</td>
<td>o</td>
<td>e</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Nipponsiki</td>
<td>ha</td>
<td>wo</td>
<td>he</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Hepburn is phonetic except for <em>wo</em>, Kunreisiki is strictly phonetic, and
Nipponsiki is strictly orthographic.</p>
<h2 id="early-romaji"> Early Romaji</h2>
<p>Japanese was first written in the Latin alphabet in the 1600s, mainly by
Christian missionaries. It was used by the missionaries for recording and
learning the language, and also used in texts they produced to try to spread
Christianity. Since Christianity was later supressed in Japan, these forms of
romaji never had wide adoption, though they influenced later efforts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-hepburn-system"> The Origins of the Hepburn System</h2>
<p>In 1867, missionary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Curtis_Hepburn#Missionary_work_in_Japan">James Curtis Hepburn</a> published a
Japanese-English dictionary in Yokohama. Naturally he needed some way to write
Japanese words for people who couldn't read Japanese, so he devised a system of
representing Japanese that reflected the pronunciation of English consonants.
His system wasn't designed from the ground up, but developed based on his
knowledge of existing systems by other missionaries as well as his own
knowledge of Japanese.</p>
<p>Somewhat later, in 1885, an organization known as the
<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E8%AB%96#%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%9E%E5%AD%97%E4%BC%9A">羅馬字会</a>
(Romajikai) was established. Mainly a society of Japanese academics, it was
interested in promoting the use of romaji as a replacement for kana and kanji.
Some motivations for getting rid of native writing systems included easier
international communication and improved domestic literacy. The principle
founders were <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ry%C5%8Dkichi_Yatabe">Ryoukichi Yatabe</a>, a botanist and the first Japanese graduate of Cornell, and <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E5%A4%96%E5%B1%B1%E6%AD%A3%E4%B8%80">Masakazu Toyama</a>, a <a href="https://ii.umich.edu/cjs/history-of-cjs.html">graduate of the University of Michigan</a> who
later occupied a high post at what would eventually become Tokyo University.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/4d041d6a/max-moritz-romaji.jpg"><img src="https://www.dampfkraft.com/by-id/4d041d6a/img/max-moritz-romaji.jpg.l.jpg"></a><figcaption>The Romajikai published books to promote romaji, including this translation of Max and Moritz, titled "Wampaku Monogatari". This edition was reprinted in 1978. via <a href="https://www.wul.waseda.ac.jp/kotenseki/html/he22/he22_07214/index.html">Waseda University</a>
</figcaption></figure>
<p>In 1886 the Romajikai published <a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/862485">a romaji system</a>. Also in 1886
Hepburn published the third edition of his dictionary, which roughly used the
system.  I've had trouble finding the exact nature of the influence between
Hepburn's system and the Romajikai, but they were on friendly terms and
cooperating. Hepburn's dictionary's third edition took off, the romaji system
mainly came to be called by his name, and it became widely established,
particularly among foreigners dealing with Japan.</p>
<p>If you're interested in learning more about Hepburn's dictionaries, a <a href="http://www.meijigakuin.ac.jp/mgda/waei/">wealth
of information</a> is available via Meiji Gakuin University
Library, including a comparison of romaji in all published versions and
manuscripts.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-the-nipponsiki-system"> The Origins of the Nipponsiki System</h2>
<p>Around the time the Romajikai was established, one of the members, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanakadate_Aikitsu">Aikitu
Tanakadate</a>, developed his
own romaji system, based on some existing informal conventions, that was
specifically designed to mirror the structure of Japanese kana without regard
to foreign pronunciation.</p>
<p>In 1885 Tanakadate proposed this new system to the Romajikai, but they
ultimately rejected his proposal in favor of keeping Hepburn. As a result
Tanakadate left the Romajikai and promoted Nipponsiki on his own. Before
becoming known as "Nipponsiki" this style of Romanization was known as
"Tanakadatesiki".</p>
<p>The disagreement between Tanakadate was only the first in a long series of
arguments between Hepburn and Nipponsiki proponents.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was around 30 when he invented this system, and most of his later
career was in physics. He worked with Lord Kelvin in Scotland and helped bring
about the adoption of the metric system in Japan. He used romaji in personal
writings and promoted it throughout his life. We'll be seeing him again later.</p>
<h2 id="standard-form-and-the-romaji-hirome-kai"> Standard Form and the Romaji Hirome Kai</h2>
<p>In 1905 the ローマ字ひろめ会 (Romaji Hirome Kai, "Society for the Advancement
of Romaji") was established. They published a magazine, called simply "Rômaji",
to create more reading material in romaji and spread its use within Japan.  By
this point Toyama and Yatabe had both passed away, and it's unclear if the
original Romajikai still existed in any capacity. An important early member of
the new society was <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E8%97%A4%E5%B2%A1%E5%8B%9D%E4%BA%8C">Katsuji Fujioka</a>, who wrote the
<a href="https://dl.ndl.go.jp/info:ndljp/pid/942994">羅馬字手引</a> (Romaji Tebiki), a kind of romaji dictionary.</p>
<p>Shortly after it was founded the Romaji Hirome Kai proposed a slightly modified
Hepburn and called it 標準式, or "Standard Form". Note that this is "Standard
Form" in general, not "Standard Hepburn", suggesting this was some kind of
official standard romanization system; this may have been a response to
Tanakadatesiki becoming known as "Nipponsiki", which could imply that other
romaji systems were "foreign". As we'll see in a bit, this rhetorical trick
ultimately didn't help official adoption.</p>
<p>I haven't been able to track down the original document with Standard Form, but
the Romaji Tebiki was already using it in 1906.</p>
<p>Standard Form replaced macrons with circumflexes and always romanized ん as
"n", rather than sometimes using "m" depending on the following consonant.</p>
<p>Tanakadate was still around and joined the Romaji Hirome Kai at some point, but
got fed up with their use of Hepburn, left, and founded his own organization in
1914.</p>
<h2 id="the-origins-of-kunreisiki"> The Origins of Kunreisiki</h2>
<p>In 1930 the government formed a committee to evaluate various romaji systems
for official government use. At this point Tanakadate was a member of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_of_Peers_(Japan)">House of Peers</a>, and Romaji Hirome Kai member and Hepburn proponent
Fujioka was not a politician, but had political influence due to his long and
prominent career as a linguist. Both were involved with the government
committee.</p>
<p>While the system used at this point varied considerably by government agency,
Hepburn was more popular, so it seemed slated for official adoption.  However,
in 1935 Fujioka died of illness. In 1937, following a recommendation from the
committee, a slightly modified version of Tanakadate's Nipponsiki, dubbed
Kunreisiki, was established as the official government romaji system.</p>
<p>The main difference between Kunreisiki and Nipponsiki is that kana that are not
pronounced differently in standard modern Japanese are spelled as their more
common counterpart (づ and ず are both <em>zu</em>), though there are other
differences, like how particles are represented, and how ambiguous phonetic
boundaries are written.</p>
<h2 id="the-war"> The War</h2>
<p>Despite the recent official adoption of a government-approved romaji system,
around 1938 a number of more radical romaji proponents were arrested as
potential (or actual) anti-nationalists. One example was Esperantist and
language researcher <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%96%8E%E8%97%A4%E7%A7%80%E4%B8%80">Hidekatsu Saitou</a>, who contracted tuberculosis in
prison and died in 1940.</p>
<p>Following World War 2, the occupying American forces rescinded the law making
Kunreisiki official and ordered the use of Hepburn for public signage and
documents. During the occupation, an American educational commission
<a href="https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=pur1.32754081234191&amp;view=1up&amp;seq=28">recommended native Japanese writing be replaced with romaji</a>.
This never happened, though romaji became a standard component of post-war
education.</p>
<p>Post-war the development of romaji became less dramatic, as serious proponents
of replacing Japanese writing systems with romaji mostly disappeared. There
have been a number of laws and rules issued by the government over the years,
as well as a few special systems like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSL_romanization">unique system</a> developed for a
textbook called "Japanese: The Spoken Language", but Hepburn and
Nipponsiki/Kunreisiki remain the major systems.</p>
<p>There is also much to be written about interaction of romaji with computers,
but that's best left for another time.</p>
<h2 id="what-about-revised-hepburn%3F"> What About Revised Hepburn?</h2>
<p>Sometimes you'll see references to "Revised Hepburn", but nobody knows what
this is. It is used to mean, variously:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hepburn's system in his third edition, in contrast to earlier editions</li>
<li>the 1905 version by the ローマ字ひろめ会 (properly 標準式 or "standard form")</li>
<li>a version introduced with Kenkyuusha's "New Japanese-English Dictionary" in 1954, subsequently <a href="https://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/romanization/japanese.pdf">adopted by the American Library of Congress</a></li>
<li>other minor variants proposed at different times</li>
</ul>
<p>While the Library of Congress is surely consistent in their romaji usage, their
choice of a particular 1954 dictionary is a bit odd, and distinguishing it from
the similar 1905 system is a source of confusion. At one point it seemed like
Hepburn might become an ANSI standard, but instead Kunreisiki was adopted, and
that standard (Z39.11-1972) has since been deprecated. This lack of an official
standard contributes to inconsistency in what "Revised Hepburn" means.</p>
<p>In contrast, "traditional Hepburn" is somewhat reliably used to refer to the
system used in Hepburn's third edition as opposed to later forms.</p>
<p>Another common variant, "passport Hepburn" refers to the system previously
mandated for names on Japanese passports, which included some exceptions to
normal Hepburn, but those requirements are <a href="https://www.mofa.go.jp/mofaj/toko/passport/pass_4.html#q17">no longer strictly in force</a>,
and you can use any romanization you want (such as "George" for what would be
"Jouji" in Hepburn) if you have …</p></div></div>

<p><a href="https://www.iphoneincanada.ca/news/privacy-concerns-emerge-following-apple-ocsp-server-outage/">Following privacy concerns from Mac users after Apple’s Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) server went down, </a>thus causing third-party applications unable to open on Macs, Apple has now responded to the situation,&nbsp; exacerbated by a recent blog post by Jeffrey Paul.</p>	
	
	
	
<p>An Apple spokesperson told<em> iPhone in Canada</em> it had updated its support document, ‘Safely open apps on your Mac’, to now further detail its privacy protections.</p>
<p>“Gatekeeper performs online checks to verify if an app contains known malware and whether the developer’s signing certificate is revoked,” <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202491">explains</a> Apple. “We have never&nbsp;combined data from these checks with information about Apple users or their devices. We do not use data from these checks to learn what individual users are&nbsp;launching or running on their devices,” clarified the company.</p>
<p>“Notarization checks if the app contains known malware using an encrypted connection that is resilient to server failures,” says Apple, further emphasizing, “These security checks have never included the user’s Apple ID or the identity of their device. To further protect privacy, we have stopped logging IP addresses&nbsp;associated with Developer ID certificate checks, and we will ensure that any collected IP addresses are removed from logs,” details Apple.</p>
<p>On top of this, Apple says “over the next year we will introduce several changes to our security checks,” specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>a new encrypted protocol for Developer ID certificate revocation checks</li>
<li>strong protections against server failure</li>
<li>a new preference for users to opt out of these security protections</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple also gave some further technical information on the situation to <em>iPhone in Canada.</em> Certificate revocation checks occur to verify that Developer ID certificates used to sign an app have not been revoked by the company. The move is critical for security since a certificate may be pulled if a developer suspects it has been compromised by third parties, or is being used to sign malicious apps.</p>
<p>The industry-standard online certificate status protocol (OCSP) is used by macOS to verify that the Developer ID code signing certificate issued to an app developer has not been revoked. This OCSP request does not include the Apple ID of the user, or reveal a device or app being launched.</p>
<p>Apple says since OCSP is used to check other certificates, including those used to encrypted web connections, these requests happen over unencrypted HTTP, as normal throughout the industry.</p>
<p>HTTP is used to prevent&nbsp;situations where verifying the validity of the certificate that secures the connection to an OCSP server would potentially depend on the result of a request to that same&nbsp;OCSP server, creating a loop that would make it impossible to resolve the request, according to Apple.</p>
<p>Apple says on macOS Catalina and later, by default, all apps running are notarized by the company to note they have been checked by Apple for known malicious software. When an app launches, macOS will check to verify that the app has not been labeled as malicious by Apple since it was first notarized. These checks happen over an encrypted connection—and are resilient to server failures. Which is what happened the other day and users saw their apps hang and take forever to launch.</p>
<p>What caused the OCSP server problem? Apple says it was due to a server-side misconfiguration that specifically interfered with macOS being able to cache OCSP responses for Developer ID. This configuration error, along with an unrelated content delivery network (CDN) misconfiguration, is what caused the slow performance for apps to launch.</p>
<p>Apple explained to <em>iPhone in Canada</em> it has already fixed this performance issue through a server-side update, that will now allow macOS to cache Developer ID OCSP checks for a longer period. macOS users do not need to do anything to benefit from this Apple update.</p>
<p>App notarization checks are used to verify that apps being launched in macOS have not been found to be malicious by Apple, since they were first notarized. Apple says these checks take place over an encrypted connection and are immune to server failures. Notarization checks were not affected by the server-side issue that caused OCSP requests to fail.</p>

November 15, 2020 | https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/100-paying-customers/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/100-paying-customers/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><span></span>
<span>172</span>
</p>
<p>Yesterday, we got our 100th paying customer for Hyvor Talk. As an independent bootstrapped product, this is a huge milestone.</p>
<h2>History of Hyvor Talk</h2>
<p>In 2018, I was learning web development and wrote my journey on my blog. I wanted to add comments to that blog and the most popular option was Disqus. I went with it, and Disqus started showing ads on my website after a while. That was not nice. I didn’t like Disqus’s UI either. And, Disqus has <a href="https://talk.hyvor.com/blog/move-away-from-disqus/">serious privacy concerns</a>. So, I coded my own commenting system. I didn’t have any plans to make it a SaaS product – I just needed commenting functionality for my blog. However, if someone wanted, I added an option to log in and use the system on their website.</p>
<p>I bought the <strong>hyvor.com</strong> domain a long time ago, having the dream of creating a successful brand called “Hyvor”. Even I wasn’t sure this side project was the way to build this brand, I published it as a product of Hyvor, naming it Hyvor Talk. Until 2020, it was free and a few bloggers used it. I published it on a few startup directories and got a little traction. But, the product wasn’t attractive at this time. And, it was just a side project with no intention of making money from it.</p>
<h2>Working Full-time and Adding Subscriptions</h2>
<p>In January this year (2020), I started working full-time on Hyvor Talk with my partner, Ishini. Both of us were just 19 years old, finished school, no much work to do. So, we could completely focus on Hyvor Talk. We added some cool features and created a better landing page.</p>
<p>The next thing was adding subscriptions. Here we stuck. Paypal and Stripe don’t support Sri Lanka. One option was registering the business in the US and using Stripe, which was expensive for us. However, thankfully, we found Paddle.com, which is built only for SaaS (We won’t be here without Paddle!)</p>
<p>Then, we added two paid plans: $40/month and $1000/month (Yes, not flexible). We worked so hard on the product (almost 16-18 hours a day) in January, sharing on forums, spamming on Facebook Groups. Nothing worked. At this time, we had zero knowledge of marketing. So, we struggled.</p>
<h2>It’s March, 1000s of Hours of Work, 0 Paid Users</h2>
<p>It was March. We’ve worked endless hours of work. No paid customers. Only a few free plan users, who just tested the system and went away. Maybe we were doing something wrong? Maybe the product wasn’t so good? Maybe there wasn’t a market for a new commenting platform? So many things came up to our minds. At this time, I was freelancing to make money and spending that for hosting, paid promotions, etc.</p>
<p>We made $0 in two months. In the first week of March, I asked Ishini “should we continue this?”. We were like yes, no, yes, no, yes, no… However, we decided not to give up because we believed in ourselves and our product. We made more features. Changed landing pages, tried different acquisition channels, and did everything we could.</p>
<h2>The First Paying User</h2>
<p>March 23rd was the day! We got our first paid customer who subscribed to our $40/month plan. We celebrated this like we just won the whole world. Now, we spend $5 for hosting and earn $40 per month. Yay, profitable (kind of). This made us feel very happy. Yes, $35 cannot do much, but if you are a bootstrapper, you know how it feels.</p>
<h2>Changing Pricing &amp; Growth</h2>
<p>We also made pricing more flexible in April. We added two types of plans called Premium (from $5/month) and Business (from $35/month). We got a few free plan users and paid customers. Still, we were on the edge of the sword. However, we started to see a growth in organic traffic to our articles on this blog.</p>
<p>Then, in May, our first employee, Rohitha, joined our team for content marketing. This had a huge impact on our growth. I could focus on the development part, Ishini did the designing and graphics, Rohitha worked on content writing, which is a great funnel for a small team like us.</p>
<p>At this moment, most of the new users come through Google. Besides that, we also see a lot of users directly coming to our website, starting the trial, and subscribing to paid plans on the first day of trial. Even I’m not sure, I think this is “word of mouth”.</p>
<h2>Removing the Free Plan</h2>
<p>When September started, we had 53 paying customers. At this point, we were fully profitable. After a lot of discussions, we made the decision to remove the free plan for some reasons. Since the start, we thought we would remove the free plan someday. However, it happened earlier than we thought because our free plan user base started to grow faster, and converting them to paid is a huge hassle (I’ll explain why it’s hard to have a free plan for a pageviews-based pricing model in a future post).</p>
<p>We removed the free plan on September 5th. And, our growth since then is tremendous. We had 56 customers then (from March to September, 6 months). We almost doubled the number in just 2 months.</p>

<h2>What to take from this story?</h2>
<p>If you are reading this article, probably you are an <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/start">indiehacker</a>, or willing to be one someday. Here are some things I believe as a bootstrapper, which might be helpful for you.</p>
<ul><li><strong>Learn but don’t imitate</strong>: Read other’s stories. But, do not imitate them! Create your own story. For example, product X shared their story to 1m ARR in 2 years. You don’t have to do the same thing. Do it at your own pace in your own way. Try everything and find the best way that fits you. Most importantly, don’t give up.</li><li><strong>Make decisions carefully</strong>: I turned down AppSumo promotion, multiple investing requests just to be fully independent. Also, removing the free plan (a very hard decision) accelerated our growth. You don’t have to do the same. Do what you think is correct. Don’t be afraid to make hard decisions in the first couple of months.</li><li><strong>Improve your product</strong>: Get feedback from your customers and improve the product. For example, we have a great discord community of ~100 website owners who give us feedback to improve our product. Our best features were suggested by these users.</li></ul>
<p>Finally, I want to thank each of our customers for believing in us throughout this journey. Leave any questions below in the comments section.</p>
<p>PS: We do not disclose our MRR/ARR.</p>

			<p>Do you remember the Guardian article written by a robot? It was the work of the new and powerful GPT-3.</p>
<h2><strong>What is GPT-3?</strong></h2>
<p>GPT-3 is a text generation technology developed by OpenAI, a well-known artificial intelligence research company founded by Elon Musk.</p>
<p>At the moment, not everyone can get access to it. OpenAI wants to ensure that no one misuses it. This is why it is available to only selected people.</p>
<p>As an SEO professional, I was excited to use GPT-3 in ways that can help the people in the SEO industry.</p>
<p>Before wasting any time, I decided to do whatever it takes to get my hands on GPT-3.</p>
<h2>Here is how I got access to GPT-3:</h2>
<h3><strong>OpenAI API waitlist form</strong></h3>
<p>I first applied for GPT-3 API through OpenAI’s official Waitlist form. On the form, I mentioned the intended purpose and the details about my project.</p>
<p><img src="https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access.jpg" alt="OpenAI API Access - How I Got Access to GPT-3 and How Can You too!" width="1868" height="851" srcset="https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access.jpg 1868w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-300x137.jpg 300w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1024x467.jpg 1024w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-150x68.jpg 150w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-768x350.jpg 768w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-500x228.jpg 500w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-800x364.jpg 800w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1280x583.jpg 1280w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1536x700.jpg 1536w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-848x386.jpg 848w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1140x519.jpg 1140w, https://digitallyup.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/OpenAI-API-Access-1170x533.jpg 1170w" sizes="(max-width: 1868px) 100vw, 1868px" title="How I Got Access to GPT-3 and How Can You too!"></p>
<p>After applying, I anxiously waited to get a response. Two days had passed, but no response came.</p>
<p>I sent a follow-up email. Still, no reply… A week had gone, though, no progress was made.</p>
<h3><strong>Go the extra mile and show that you are serious</strong></h3>
<p>My frustration was growing. But I thought there must be something missing. So, I thought of exploring Twitter and seeing if any users got access to it.</p>
<p>There, I read the tweets of a few people who were able to get GPT-3 access. Their advice was to ‘go the extra mile’ so that the OpenAI engineer or the Chairman can get your attention, and they can see that you are serious.</p>
<p>So, this is what I did:</p>
<ul><li>Purchased a fancy domain for my intended project.</li>
<li>Designed a demo landing page along with a small animation – just to give a glimpse of what’s in store. And how my idea can benefit people.</li>
<li>Tweeted about my project with a video and tagged OpenAI chairman. After only 10 minutes, I received a reply from him asking me for my email. And boom, I got access.</li>
</ul><blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en"><a href="https://twitter.com/gdb?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">@gdb</a> Hi Greg. My <a href="https://t.co/iibYGMW3Xv" rel="nofollow">https://t.co/iibYGMW3Xv</a> project is still awaiting GPT-3 access.</p>
<p>Is there a way that you maybe able to expedite the process? <a href="https://t.co/J2NeDvbgHF" rel="nofollow">pic.twitter.com/J2NeDvbgHF</a></p>
<p>— Ashar Jamil (@Asharjamil) <a href="https://twitter.com/Asharjamil/status/1317163403681693699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" rel="nofollow">October 16, 2020</a>
</p></blockquote>

<p>It took some effort, but it was worth it. Filling the application form with beneficial intended purposes will not be enough. You will have to make an extra effort and show that you mean business.</p>
<p>If you are struggling to get access to GPT-3, my advice will be to showcase your project demo; and invest a little in your project so that it looks professional. It will increase your chances of getting access.</p>
<p>The bottom line is that you have to work for it.</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>Automatic dependent surveillance–broadcast&nbsp;(ADS-B) technology enables aircraft to&nbsp;determine their position via satellite and periodically broadcast this location information. An ADS-B receiver system can be used to decode this broadcast signal to track airplanes. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png" alt="" width="473" height="266" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-system.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 473px) 100vw, 473px"><figcaption>The ADS-B System</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various components of an ADS-B station, why they matter, and how to make improvements. </p>



<h2><strong>ADS-B Receiver</strong></h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/10/21/the-best-ads-b-receiver-for-2020-2021/">this article we previously discussed the different ADS-B receivers</a> on the market today. Systems like the one from <a href="https://amzn.to/36E08h1">Garmin</a> are completely closed and fully integrated and there’s not much opportunity to understand how they work or improve them. The best you can do is use them as per the manufacturer’s recommendation and that should result in the best performance for this product.</p>







<p>On the other hand, there’s plenty of opportunity to learn from open systems based on  either the <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> or the <a href="https://amzn.to/3kzQa59">Stratux ADS-B receivers</a>. </p>







<p>Both these systems use <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as foundational building blocks. There’s a wealth of information online on the internal architecture and various experiments conducted on these products to understand their specifications, performance and how best to use them. There’s also a large online community to learn from and contribute to. </p>



<h2>How Much ADS-B Signal Do You Really Need?</h2>



<p>In general when a receiver processes signals, there is a range of optimal signal level over which it performs best. Anything lower will result in performance degradation – in other words, you will see fewer airplanes. Anything greater will have the same effect. </p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png" alt="" width="495" height="327" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-1024x677.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-300x198.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS-768x508.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ADS-B-SIGNAL-LEVELS.png 1202w" sizes="(max-width: 495px) 100vw, 495px"><figcaption>Different ADS-B Signal Ranges </figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the very extreme, signal levels higher than a certain level will damage the ADS-B receiver. The trick then is to optimize the signal level such that you can get to within the sweet spot of the ADS-B receiver. </p>



<h2><strong>A Note on Measuring Signals </strong></h2>



<p>In general, it is very difficult to predict actual wireless signal strengths received without making a measurement. Typically a spectrum analyzer is used to make signal measurements at any given frequency. However, not everyone can afford a spectrum analyzer or has access to one. Fortunately it is possible to use an application like SDR# with your receiver to determine how strong or weak various received signals actually are and the impact they might be having on performance.</p>



<p>Here is an example of signal measurement with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> as viewed in SDR#. The two views shown are the FFT view and the waterfall or spectrogram below it.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="593" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-1024x593.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-1024x593.jpg 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-300x174.jpg 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before-768x445.jpg 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/FM-before.jpg 1916w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>FM signals measured with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>As you experiment with different antennas and other components below, tune across the frequency range of <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a> to check out various signals and their strengths in the waterfall view. This will give you an idea of how your changes impact performance. It will for instance tell you approximately how much gain you need to add up front. It will also tell you if you actually need any amplification at all. In general avoid doing anything that increases the <strong><span>RED</span></strong> levels as these are very strong signals. </p>



<p>Now let’s take a look at the various parts of the ADS-B system and how they impact performance.</p>



<h2>Antennas</h2>



<p>The antenna is at the very front-end of your ADS-B system. You will need an effective <a href="https://amzn.to/3cyPXNr">antenna for ADS-B</a> as it is key to good signal reception. As is often said, garbage in, garbage out. If you use a lousy antenna, a good receiver isn’t going to compensate for it. You can read our complete <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/04/19/best-antennas-for-ads-b-reception/">review of ADS-B antennas</a>. The best antenna requires some effort for installation and optimization but it’s well worth the time spent. </p>



<h2>RF Cables</h2>



<p>If you’re looking to mount your antenna on your rooftop or on a tower for better reception, you will need to take the length of the RF cable from the antenna to your ADS-B receiver into consideration. Why is that?</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png" alt="" width="553" height="311" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Installing-an-antenna-on-rooftop.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 553px) 100vw, 553px"><figcaption>Installing an Antenna on your Rooftop</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As the frequency of the signal increases, so do the signal losses or attenuation due to any given length of cable. For instance, if you were to use <a href="https://amzn.to/36DJJcj">LMR-400 cable</a>, the loss at 30 MHz is only 0.7 dB for every 100 ft of cable. For the same length of cable, the loss at 1090 MHz is around 4 dB. This signal loss directly impacts the sensitivity of the system by 4 dB and therefore reduces the range of your ADS-B receiver by more than half relative to if you were to use a very short length of cable. That is quite significant.</p>



<h2>Amplifiers</h2>



<p>Fortunately there is a way to compensate for this degradation in sensitivity due to cable loss. It involves the use of a low noise amplifier (LNA). In general, any LNA with sufficiently low noise figure (typically less than 1 dB) and the required amount of gain can be used. </p>



<p>So the first question is – what is the required gain? </p>



<p>The answer depends on several factors some of which are:</p>



<ul><li>Amount of cable loss at 1090 MHz</li><li>Other RF signals are present in your environment – in particular strong ones</li><li>The dynamic and operating range of your ADS-B receiver</li></ul>



<p>As discussed, cable loss can be overcome with the use of an LNA. However, an LNA will amplify everything within its range of operation. It will amplify AM, FM and other signals. Consider a situation where an FM signal is stronger than the ADS-B signal of interest. The amplified signal will saturate the receiver if it exceeds the dynamic range. The signal will also possibly damage the receiver if you’re operating at signal levels that exceed the range of the receiver. The receiver will not be able to process the ADS-B signal of interest in either case.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png" alt="Block diagram showing ADS-B signal amplified" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Amplifying an ADS-B signal</figcaption></figure>



<p>A solution to this problem is to use a Filtered LNA. This is an LNA with a filter integrated along with it as shown in the picture below.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png" alt="Filtered LNA for ADS-B" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2-1536x864.png 1536w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/LNA-2.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Filtered Low Noise Amplifier for ADS-B</figcaption></figure>



<p>The LNA is usually the first component and it is followed by a filter specific to the band of interest – in this case 1090 MHz for ADS-B. This product will reject all signals outside the ADS-B frequency range. For instance it will reject strong FM signals, 4G signals from cellular base stations, signals at 2.4 GHz from your Wi-Fi access point and more. </p>



<p>Here are a couple of ADS-B filtered LNAs that will work depending on your setup.</p>







<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-dual-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-30-db-gain">this Filtered LNA with 30 dB gain</a> if you have a very long cable run and need to compensate for significant signal loss. Using the calculation for LMR400 above, this Filtered LNA can compensate for 700 ft of cable loss. </p>



<p>Use <a href="https://gpio.com/collections/filtered-low-noise-amplifier/products/ads-b-filtered-low-noise-amplifier-lna-with-15-db-gain">this Filtered LNA that provides 15 dB gain</a>, if you have a shorter cable run. </p>



<h3><strong>How to Install an LNA</strong></h3>



<p>It is best to place the LNA very close to the antenna. This will help minimize the noise figure and improve the sensitivity of your ADS-B receiver system. Since it’s difficult to get a power source or supply at the top of an antenna, <a href="https://www.onesdr.com/2020/01/19/what-is-a-bias-tee/">a bias tee system</a> can be used. A bias tee at the receiver is used to send the DC voltage up to the LNA over the RF cable connecting the two. At the LNA there is a reciprocal bias tee that splits the DC and RF signals. The DC is used to power the LNA. The block diagram below shows a situation where the SDR has a built-in bias tee. This is indeed the case with <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">the RTL-SDR</a>.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-300x169.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1-768x432.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bias-tee-modules-1.png 1280w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Use a Bias Tee to Power a Remote LNA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Sometimes when an LNA is connected the results look like in the following picture – amazing results with a tripling of the number of planes observed!</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="940" height="529" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement.jpg 940w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/ads-b-improvement-768x432.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 940px) 100vw, 940px"><figcaption>Improvement in Number of Planes Tracked</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At other times, the addition of an LNA degrades performance and you will not be able to see any airplanes. Why does this happen? Let’s assume that your LNA is connected properly with the RF input end connected to the antenna and that it is powered correctly. There are then two possibilities:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Too much cable loss</strong> and the amount of LNA gain cannot help overcome this degradation. In this situation more gain is required and you can simply add another LNA. Remember to place the first LNA as close to the antenna as possible so as to minimize noise figure. Remember also to check signal levels so you can adjust the amplitude to be within the optimal range. </li><li><strong>Too much gain </strong>and you are likely saturating your receiver with strong signals. Note that even when using a filtered LNA, if the FM signals in your area are very strong, the out-of-band attenuation due to the filter might not be adequate to prevent receiver saturation. Once again you can check what’s going on with the spectrum analyzer view in SDR#. </li></ul>



<h3><strong>How to Optimize the Signal Levels into the RTL-SDR</strong></h3>



<p>There are three methods by which you can optimize signal levels going into the RTL-SDR after the addition of a Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>In the event that you have strong out-of-band signals, they should be attenuated to a reasonable level. The easiest way to do this is by adding an additional <a href="https://www.tindie.com/products/gpio/ads-b-bandpass-filter-band-pass-1090-mhz-ads-b/">ADS-B bandpass filter</a> after the Filtered LNA.</p>



<p>Another way to optimize gain is to reduce the signal level across the band with an attenuator. Connect <a href="https://amzn.to/2K4a4IY">an inline fixed attenuator</a> to the output of the LNA. You can experiment with different values such as 30 dB, 20 dB, etc. until you start seeing output by way of planes. </p>







<p>The third method is to adjust the gain in the Flightaware stick digitally. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> stick is essentially an <a href="https://amzn.to/3f0RHjH">RTL-SDR</a> and utilizes an R802T chipset. Below is a block diagram of the R802T.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png" alt="" width="540" height="363" srcset="https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-1024x689.png 1024w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-300x202.png 300w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block-768x517.png 768w, https://www.onesdr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/R820T-block.png 1498w" sizes="(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px"><figcaption>R802T Architecture</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>As you can see the user has the ability to modify the Variable Gain Amplifier (VGA). The range over which this can be varied is nearly 50 dB. The <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> powers up with maximum amplification in the system. So you essentially have to adjust it to a point where you get the best reception. <a href="https://discussions.flightaware.com/t/for-beginners-how-to-set-change-gain/30201">Here are instructions on how to modify the gain</a>. </p>



<p>Many experiments have been conducted and reported on the <a href="https://amzn.to/3f4pJUk">FlightAware</a> discussion site. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://discussions.flightaware.com/t/gain-adjustment/18376/7" target="_blank">Here is one such discussion</a>. In the plot below, user BartJr has reported an improvement in reception with increase in amplification.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two days ago, macOS users experienced worrying hangs when opening applications not downloaded from the Mac App Store. Many users suspected hardware issues with their devices, but as they took to social media, they found it was a widespread problem. And it was no coincidence that it was happening so soon after the launch of macOS “Big Sur”.</p>

<p>Eventually, <a href="https://twitter.com/lapcatsoftware/status/1326990296412991489">a tweet by Jeff Johnson</a> pinpointed the underlying issue. Apple’s “OCSP Responder” service was overloaded, therefore macOS was unable to verify app developers’ cryptographic certificates.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-tweet.png?style=centerme" alt="Jeff Johnson's tweet"></p>

<p>But why are OCSP Responders in the critical path of apps launching? This post will briefly discuss code signing, how Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) works, why it’s deeply flawed, and what are some better alternatives. Unlike other posts on this incident, I want to emphasise the practical crypto aspects (at a high level) and offer a balanced perspective.</p>

<h3 id="code-signing">Code Signing</h3>

<p>On their developer portal, Apple explain <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/code-signing/">the purpose of code signing</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Code signing your app assures users that it is from a known source and the app hasn’t been modified since it was last signed. Before your app can integrate app services, be installed on a device, or be submitted to the App Store, it must be signed with a certificate issued by Apple.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, if developers want their apps to be trusted on macOS, they must sign them using their own certificate keypair. Keychain is used to generate a unique “Developer ID” certificate, which includes a private key for the developer to use, and a public key for distribution. After Apple have signed the Developer ID certificate, the developer can use the private key to produce cryptographic signatures on their apps as part of their release process.</p>

<p>When you run an app, its signature is verified against the public key of the developer’s certificate. Then, the certificate itself is verified, by checking that it hasn’t expired yet (certificates are typically valid for 1 year), and that it’s ultimately signed by Apple’s root certificate. There may also be intermediate certificates as part of the chain up to the root certificate. A “chain of trust” has been created, because the developer ID certificate signed an app, an intermediate certificate signed the developer ID certificate, and Apple’s root certificate signed the intermediate certificate. Any Apple device can verify this chain of trust and therefore approve an app to run.</p>

<p>This is similar to the TLS Public Key Infrastructure used on the internet. But it’s also fundamentally different since Apple has total control over its own chain of trust. Other certificate authorities are not allowed to issue valid certificates for code signing as all certificates must chain back up to Apple.</p>

<p>If the verification process wasn’t successful, then users will see a scary dialogue which is difficult to bypass:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-failed-verify.png?style=centerme" alt="Apple failed to verify popup"></p>

<h3 id="revocation">Revocation</h3>

<p>What happens when a developer is found to be breaching Apple’s rules, or loses control of their private key? A certificate authority needs to be able to instantly nullify bad certificates they’ve issued. If a certificate is being used maliciously, it’s not acceptable to wait days or months until it expires naturally, otherwise a leak of a high-profile private key would render the whole system useless.</p>

<p>This is where certificate revocation comes in. It’s an additional step in the signature verification process, which involves finding out from the certificate authority if a certificate is still valid.</p>

<p>Originally, at least on the web, this was done the simplest way you can imagine. The certificate authority would give you a Certificate Revocation List (CRL), containing serial numbers of all revoked certificates, and you could check the certificate you are currently verifying is not on the list. However, this approach stopped being used by web browsers since the list got longer and longer and failed to scale. Especially after terrifying exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed">Heartbleed</a> demanded mass revocation of certificates.</p>

<p>Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) is an alternative allowing real-time checking of certificates. Each certificate can include a baked-in “OCSP Responder”, a URL that you can query that will report whether the certificate has been revoked. In Apple’s case, that’s “ocsp.apple.com”. So now, in addition to verifying the cryptographic validity of the signature, each time you launch an app you’re performing a real-time check with Apple (subject to some caching) to ensure they still think the developer’s ID certificate is legitimate.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-availability-problem">OCSP’s Availability Problem</h3>

<p>There’s a huge problem with OCSP: it makes an external service a single point of failure. What happens if the OCSP Responder is down or unreachable? Do we just refuse to verify the certificate (hard-fail)? Or do we pretend that the check was successful (soft-fail)?</p>

<p>Apple are forced to use the soft-fail behaviour, otherwise apps wouldn’t work when you’re offline. As it happens, all major browsers also implement the soft-fail behaviour, since OCSP Responders have traditionally been unreliable, and browsers want to keep displaying websites even if certificate authorities’ responders are temporarily down.</p>

<p>But soft-fail isn’t great, because it means that an attacker with network control can block requests to the responder, and the revocation check will be skipped. In fact, that was the hotfix widely shared on Twitter during this incident: blackhole traffic to “ocsp.apple.com” by adding a line to <em>/etc/hosts</em>. A lot of people won’t be removing that line anytime soon, since disabling OCSP doesn’t cause any noticeable problems.</p>

<h3 id="the-incident">The Incident</h3>

<p>If Apple’s OCSP check was built to soft-fail, then why did apps hang when the OCSP Responder was down? Probably because this was actually a different failure case: the OCSP Responder was not completely down, it was performing badly.</p>

<p>Due to the load added by millions of users worldwide upgrading to macOS “Big Sur”, Apple’s servers slowed to a crawl, and although they weren’t properly answering OCSP queries, they were working just enough that the soft-fail didn’t trigger.</p>

<h3 id="ocsps-privacy-problem">OCSP’s Privacy Problem</h3>

<p>In addition to OCSP’s availability problems, the protocol wasn’t initially designed with privacy in mind. A basic OCSP query involves an unencrypted HTTP request to the OCSP Responder with the serial number of the certificate. Therefore not only can the responder figure out what certificate you are interested in, but so can your ISP and anybody else intercepting packets. Apple could use this to build a timeline of which developers’ apps you are opening, as could third parties.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.cryptohack.org/assets/images/apple-ocsp-wireshark.jpg?style=centerme" alt="OCSP packet in wireshark"></p>

<p>Adding encryption is possible, and there’s a better, more private version called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OCSP_stapling">OCSP stapling</a>, but Apple is not using either of these things. In fact OSCP stapling wouldn’t make sense in this scenario, but it illustrates how OCSP needs improvements to not leak data by default.</p>

<h3 id="a-better-future">A Better Future</h3>

<p>This incident has started a lively debate in the software community, with one side proclaiming <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">“Your Computer Isn’t Yours”</a> and the other arguing that <a href="https://www.security-embedded.com/blog/2020/11/14/application-trust-is-hard-but-apple-does-it-well">“application trust is hard but Apple does it well”</a>. This post aims to show that whichever side you agree with, OCSP is a terrible way to manage certificate revocation, and will lead to more availability and privacy incidents in future. In my opinion, it was a poor engineering decision for Apple to make app launching dependent on OCSP. In the short term at least they have mitigated the damage by <a href="https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/ocsp.html">increasing the time that responses are cached</a>.</p>

<p>Fortunately, a better revocation method is reaching maturity. CRLite is a way to shrink down lists of all revoked certificates to a reasonable size. <a href="https://scotthelme.co.uk/crlite-finally-a-fix-for-broken-revocation/">Scott Helme’s blog</a> gives a good summary of how CRLite uses Bloom Filters to make the Certificate Revocation List approach – which OCSP superseded – feasible again.</p>

<p>Theoretically, macOS devices could pull updates to this list periodically and do certificate revocation checking on the device itself, addressing the availability and privacy problems with OCSP. On the other hand, since the list of revoked Developer ID certificates is much smaller than the list of all revoked PKI certificates, it’s worth asking why Apple haven’t opted to use CRLs in the first place. Perhaps they don’t want to reveal any information about which certificates they’ve revoked.</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>Overall, the incident this week was a good time to reflect on the trust model that has been promoted by organisations like Apple and Microsoft. Malware has grown in sophistication and most people aren’t in a position to judge whether it’s safe to run particular binaries. Code signing seems like a neat way to leverage cryptography to determine whether or not to trust applications, and to at least associate apps with known developers. And revocation is a necessary part of maintaining that trust.</p>

<p>However, by adding several mundane failure modes to the verification process, OCSP spoils any cryptographic elegance the code signing and verifying process has. While OCSP is also widely used for TLS certificates on the internet, the large number of PKI certificate authorities and relaxed attitude of browsers means that failures are less catastrophic. Moreover, people are accustomed to seeing websites become unavailable from time to time, but they don’t expect the same from apps on their own devices. macOS users were alarmed at how their apps could become collateral damage for an infrastructure issue at Apple. Yet this was an inevitable outcome arising from the fact that certificate verification depends on external infrastructure, and no infrastructure is 100% reliable.</p>

<p>Scott Helme also has concerns about the power that Certificate Authorities gain when certification revocation actually works effectively. Even if you aren’t bothered about the potential for censorship, there will be occasional mistakes and these must be weighed against the security benefits. As one developer discovered when <a href="https://blog.charliemonroe.net/a-day-without-business/">Apple mistakenly revoked his certificate</a>, …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

Professional investors “pattern match” and since there are not many successful black founders, the problem is accentuated. A prominent Silicon Valley investor has said he mostly invests in twenty-something white males with no social life because that has been his formula for success.</p></li></ul><ul><li id="viewer-94jh"><p><strong>Home Equity Funding</strong>: She likely will not have a house or enough home equity, from which to take out a loan.

The situation is similar for black-owned businesses when seeking clients and customers.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In his video message on his prayer intention for November, Pope Francis emphasizes that progress in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) be oriented “towards respecting the dignity of the person and of Creation”.</p><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><b><i>By Vatican News staff writer</i></b></p> 
<p>During the month of November, Pope Francis draws our attention to the epochal change that humanity is experiencing thanks to advances in artificial intelligence. &nbsp;He, therefore, invites us to pray that this progress always “serve humankind,” respecting human dignity and taking care of Creation.</p> 
<h2><b>True progress</b></h2> 
<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made exponential advances, as evidenced by its many applications in different fields of knowledge. Today, 37% of organizations in the world have implemented AI in some way (which represents a 270% increase in the past four years).</p> 
<p>In “<a href="https://thepopevideo.org/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">The Pope Video</a>” this month, Pope Francis clarifies that this progress in robotics and AI “can make a better world possible if it is joined to the common good.” &nbsp;In this sense, he hopes for technological progress that does not increase the inequalities in society.&nbsp; If it does, the Pope says, it will not be “true progress”.&nbsp; Such progress does not take into account the dignity of the human person and care for Creation.</p> 
<h2><b>Benefits</b></h2> 
<p>AI is capable of addressing many problems facing humanity, such as in evaluating the learning capacity of students, in order to detect opportunities for improvement.&nbsp; It can help people with visual or hearing impairments by developing better communication tools (such as converting text to speech or speech to text).&nbsp; AI can also speed up the collection, processing and diffusion of health data to improve the diagnosis and treatment of patients, especially those living in remote areas.</p> 
<p>The same applies to the field of ecology. Through AI, it is possible to analyze data on climate change and create models that can help predict natural disasters. It can also be used to create intelligent and sustainable cities by reducing urban spending, improving the resilience of highways and increasing energy efficiency.&nbsp; There are vast possibilities for using this technological progress for the common good, and “The Pope Video” uses images from the Italian Institute of Technology and the Italian multinational energy company, Enel, to show some of these benefits.</p> 
<h2><b>Serving humanity&nbsp;</b></h2> 
<p>“Innovation,” says Enel’s CEO, Francesco Starace, “has placed at our disposition extraordinary tools that we need to be capable of using in the best possible way.”&nbsp;</p> 
<p>He continues, “As Pope Francis reaffirms, it is our task to ensure that the resulting benefits are distributed fairly and create opportunities and wellbeing.” Starace says, “In order to give a positive orientation to our actions and choices regarding the present and the future, we must put respect for people and for the environment at the centre, adopting a vision based on sustainability. Only in this way can technological evolution be an ally of humanity and create opportunities which, up until a few years ago, we couldn’t even imagine.”</p> 
<p>The Pope’s <a href="https://www.popesprayer.va/" rel="external">Worldwide Prayer Network</a> is responsible for the diffusion of the Pope’s monthly prayer intentions. &nbsp;In comments on the Holy Father’s prayer intention for November, the network’s international director, Jesuit Father Frédéric Fornos also speaks of the need to channel these rapid technological changes for the “good of all.”</p> 
<p>“This month’s prayer intention,” he says, “reinforces the idea that the benefit that humanity has obtained (and will continue to obtain) from technological progress must always take into account as well, and in parallel, ‘adequate development of responsibility and values’.”&nbsp; This, Fr Fornos says, has been underscored by the Pope in his encyclical <i>Laudato si’ </i>and now in his third encyclical, <i>Fratelli tutti,</i> where he says, “How wonderful it would be if the growth of scientific and technological innovation could come with more equality and social inclusion!”</p> 
<p>AI, robotics, and other applications of technology, says Fr Fornos, open great challenges for ethics and social justice. “This is why the Pope’s most recent petition is important: to pray that this progress will always ‘be human.’”</p> 
<p><b>The text of the November 2020 prayer intention:</b></p> 
<p><i>Artificial intelligence is at the heart of the epochal change we are experiencing.&nbsp; Robotics can make a better world possible if it is joined to the common good.&nbsp; Indeed, if technological progress increases inequalities, it is not true progress.&nbsp; Future advances should be oriented towards respecting the dignity of the person and of Creation.&nbsp;</i></p> 
<p><i>Let us pray that the progress of robotics and artificial intelligence may always serve humankind… we could say, may it “be human.”</i><br> </p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
      <div><p>If you're a lover of indoor gardening and still a newbie who don't understand how indoor gardening works, you first need to find different materials to learn from, right?</p><p>Well, during this learning process, you'll discover that indoor growth requires one piece of very essential equipment: <a href="http://www.medicgrow.com/" target="_blank" title="Medic grow led grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer">LED grow light</a>. Since these plants are grown in-house, they need a LED grow light that can mimic sunlight and drive photosynthesis.</p><p>You will see that many lights call themselves "best grow light," but there are actually four main types of these lights: Fluorescent grow lights, MH, HPS Bulbs, and LED lights.</p><p>If you read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grow_light" target="_blank" title="wikipedia grow light article" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia article about grow lights</a>, you'll find that LED&nbsp;lighting are by far the best ones. Needless to say, the first few traditional lamps have their own advantages; for example, they are cheap and can be bought just about anywhere. But their shortcomings are also obvious, like they emit too much heat, or the spectrum does not meet the needs of plants etc.</p><p>For some plants that require a lot of light to grow, those traditional lights&nbsp;can not compete with&nbsp;LED ones in some respects. In this blog we will list some basic knowledge on choosing a&nbsp;perfect&nbsp;LED plant-growth lighting.</p></div>
<h2>8&nbsp;Key Features&nbsp;You Should Know About&nbsp;LED Grow Lights</h2>
<h3><strong>1. PAR</strong></h3>
<p>PAR stands for "photosynthetic active radiation". <span>&nbsp;</span><span>It</span><span>&nbsp;is a metric used for plants while lumens are for humans.&nbsp; So plants don't care how bright your light fixture appears to you.&nbsp;PAR in lighting is the wavelength within the visible range of 400 to 700 nanometers (nm), and plants use this range to&nbsp;photosynthesise or grow.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/par-measurement.jpg?v=1605057977" alt="LED grow light PAR"></span></p>
<h3>
<br><strong>2. PPF&amp;PPFD</strong>
</h3>
<div><p>There are two phases related to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR). These are photosynthetic photon flux (PPF) and photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD).</p><p>PPF simply describes the number of photons that led grow lamp produces in the PAR wavelength range within one second.</p></div>
<div><p>PPF is measured in units called micromoles (umol). You can use PPF to determine whether your grow light is "powerful enough" for your plants.</p><p>PPFD is the number of photons that hit the plant canopy in a given second. This is measured in micromoles (umols). The bigger of this value, the better.</p><p>The difference between PPF and PPFD is that PPF is the intensity of light when measured at the light source, while PPFD is the light intensity when measured at the surface of the plant.</p></div>

<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/ppf_and_ppfd_600x600.jpg?v=1605063210" alt="LED grow light PPF and PPFD"></p>
<h3>
<p><strong>3. Photon Efficacy</strong></p></h3>
<p>Photon efficacy is the measure of how well a light source produces visible light. The unit for efficacy is Joule per second (J/s). If you know the PPF and the input wattage of a light, you can easily calculate photon efficacy. The higher this number is, the more efficient a grow light is at converting electricity into photons. So be sure to check this out with a lighting manufacturer.</p>
<h3>
<br><strong>4. LED Chips</strong>
</h3>
<p><br>Chips are the most necessary and basic aspect of an LED grow lighting. Therefore, the manufacturing of chips must keep durability and efficiency in mind.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/products/IMG_20201023_152418_600x600.jpg?v=1604388543" alt="led chip"></p>
<div><p>The suitable LED chip will hardly show color inconsistency while maintaining voltage and intensity. A carefully crafted chip can produce effective and uniform LED lights that can support a variety of crops.</p><p>There are many LED chip brands you can pick from, such as Bridgelux, Philips, Epistar, CREE, or Osram. Among these, CREE and Osram are favored by many users due to their chip's durability and efficiency.</p></div>
<h3>
<br><strong>5. Spectrum</strong>
</h3>
<p>The spectrum refers to the electromagnetic wavelength of light generated by the light source to promote plant growth. In order to perform photosynthesis, plants use light in the PAR (photosynthesis active radiation) region, and the wavelength of this region (400nm-700nm) is measured in nanometers (nm).</p>
<div><p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/spectrum_600x600.jpg?v=1605063737" alt="LED grow light full spectrum"></p><p>The LED lighting stimulates the colors of the sunlight range from red and yellow to blue and violet, and plants use this full spectrum to undergo the process of photosynthesis.</p><p>The red and blue lights are the most critical for plants. Blue is for the vegetative stage while red is for blooming.</p></div>
<p>Other wavelengths besides red and blue are also beneficial for certain phases of plant growth.</p>
<p>Ultraviolet helps protect the plants from insects and diseases, and a bit more infrared light than normal makes your plants think they are covered by something so they need to grow taller to get more light.</p>
<div><p>Green light can penetrate farther into plants leaves and farther below the canopy than other wavelengths.</p><p>The ideal spectrum can help accelerate vegetation, increase flowering, speed up growth, etc. Whether or not the light source is supplementary (as with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenhouse" target="_blank" title="greenhouse" rel="noopener noreferrer">greenhouse</a>) or the sole one will also affect which light spectrum should be used.</p><p>Therefore, getting an LED grow light with a full spectrum for your indoor plants means that it provides all the wavelengths present in natural light. All you need to do is switch the amount of light exposure the plants need during the different growth phases.</p></div>

<h3><strong>6. Heat Dissipation</strong></h3>
<p>Although LEDs emit less heat than other traditional grow lights, putting many LEDs together, they still need a heat dispassion system to keep the body cool at all times. Some best LED lights on the market have a heat sink to release extra heat. That means no noisy fans, and no wasted electricity by powering them.</p>
<h3>
<img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/Heat_Dissipation_600x600.jpg?v=1605065892" alt="LED grow light heat dissipation"><p><strong>7. Lighting Coverage</strong></p></h3>
<p>Each LED grow light you consider should have information regarding the lighting coverage. This refers to the coverage area, which is usually measured in square footage, of the light that falls onto the plants.</p>
<p>A good coverage area is essential, not only do the size and lenses of your LED grow light determine your coverage area, but so does hanging height. The further the distance between your lights and plants, the greater the footprint, but the lower the PPFD.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopifycdn.net/s/files/1/0278/2330/8909/files/led_grow_light_coverage_2_600x600.jpg?v=1605081160" alt="LED grow light coverage"></p>
<p>Let's say you have a lamp hanging at a 12-foot distance from your canopy. Then, you increase the hanging height to a distance of 24 feet. You will now have a light intensity that is&nbsp;much less of what it was before.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is why it's very important to pay attention to hanging height and coverage area when selecting an LED light.</p>

<h3><strong>8. Wattage</strong></h3>
<p>When it comes to LED grow-light wattage, this metric refers to two things. A 550w LED light can either indicate that it can truly pull 550w energy from the wall or it can deliver an equivalent power in brightness to a 550wMH/HID grow light.</p>
<p>So pay attention to exactly what is meant by an LED grow light's stated wattage. Our<a href="https://medicgrow.com/products/medic-grow-fold-8-led-grow-light" target="_blank" title="fold 8 led grow light" rel="noopener noreferrer"> LED grow light</a> can actually deliver what it says online.</p>
<h2>
<br>Conclusion</h2>
<div><p>If you're on a tight budget, you will need to pay attention to 1, 2, and 3. But if you have extra cash to spend, you can choose the best metric from 1 to 8. For indoor plants, artificial lighting is crucial as they have no access to natural sunlight.</p><p>Good lighting is an important factor that determines the yield of your plants as well as other factors, such as the strains you use and your planting experience etc.</p></div>
<p>If you focus on the above factors when picking an LED grow light, you can definitely get the best LED grow light for your plants. A suitable LED grow light will get the most bang for your buck when it comes to minimizing electrical costs while maximizing plant health.</p>

<p><strong>October 28, 2020</strong></p>
<hr>
<h2 id="toc1">Overview</h2>
<p>The Office of the Privacy Commissioner of Canada (<abbr>OPC</abbr>), Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner of Alberta (<abbr>OIPC AB</abbr>) and the Office of the Information and Privacy Commissioner for British Columbia (<abbr>OIPC BC</abbr>), collectively referred to as “the Offices” commenced a joint investigation<sup id="fn1-rf"><a href="#fn1"><span>Footnote </span>1</a></sup>,<sup id="fn2-rf"><a href="#fn2"><span>Footnote </span>2</a></sup> to examine whether The Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited (<abbr>CFCL</abbr>) was collecting and using personal information of visitors to its Canadian malls, without valid consent, via:</p>
<ol>
<li><!-- i. -->Anonymous Video Analytics (<abbr>AVA</abbr>) technology installed in “wayfinding” directories; and</li>
<li><!-- ii. -->mobile device geolocation tracking technologies.</li>
</ol>
<p>Our findings in respect of these two issues are detailed below.</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> collected and used personal information, including sensitive biometric information, via the <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology without valid consent.</strong></p>
<p>The <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology: (i) took temporary digital images of the faces of any individual within the field of view of the camera in the directory (retained in computer memory briefly during processing); (ii) used facial recognition software to convert those images into biometric numerical representations of the individual faces (sensitive personal information that could be used to identify individuals based on their unique facial features); and (iii) used that information to assess age range and gender.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> represented that the numerical representations were not retained beyond processing. However, our investigation revealed that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> service provider had collected and stored approximately 5 million numerical representations of faces on <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s behalf, on a decommissioned server, for no apparent purpose and with no justification.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> explained that it collected information via <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> for purposes of monitoring foot traffic patterns and predicting demographic information about mall visitors. We found no evidence that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> had used the biometric information, including any of the retained numerical representations, for identification purposes.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> also retained approximately 16 hours of video recordings, some including audio, which it had captured during a calibration (or testing) phase of the technology at two malls.</p>
<p><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> asserted that to the extent that it required consent, such consent was obtained via its privacy policy. We found that this was inadequate. Firstly, an individual would not, while using a mall directory, reasonably expect their image to be captured and used to create a biometric representation of their face, which is sensitive personal information, or for that biometric information to be used to guess their approximate age and gender. As such, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> should have obtained express opt-in consent. Further, we reviewed <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s privacy policy and determined that the language was overly broad, and buried in the middle of a 5,000 word document, which would not be easily accessible to individuals while they are engaging with a mall directory. We found that the privacy policy language was not sufficient to support meaningful consent for <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> practices.</p>
<p>Finally, we noted that while shoppers were directed, by stickers displayed at mall entrances, to visit guest services to obtain a copy of <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s privacy policy, when we asked a guest services employee at one of <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s malls for that policy, they were confused by the request.</p>
<p>As a result of these findings, we made several recommendations. We recommended that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> either: (i) obtain meaningful express opt-in consent and allow individuals to use its mall directories without having to submit to the collection and use of their sensitive biometric information; or (ii) cease use of its <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology. While <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> expressly disagreed with our findings, it advised that it had ceased use of the technology in July 2018, and that it had no current plans to resume that use. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> has also, pursuant to further recommendations by our Offices, deleted the numerical representations of faces and audio/video recordings in its possession which were not required for legal purposes. It has confirmed that what information has been retained will not be used for any other purposes outside of those required for compliance with the law. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> also provided privacy-related training to guest services employees. As a result, we found the matter to be <strong>well-founded and resolved</strong>.</p>
<p>Our Offices asked <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> to provide a commitment to follow our recommendations with respect to ensuring valid consent if they were to resume use of <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology in the future. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> indicated that if it did resume use of the <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology, it would obtain adequate consent, “in accordance with the applicable privacy legislation and consistent with the <em>Guidelines for obtaining meaningful consent</em>”. However, it refused to commit to obtaining <strong>express opt-in</strong> consent consistent with our recommendations. We find this concerning given that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> disagreed with our analysis and interpretation of the law in this case. For example, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> continues to maintain, contrary to our findings, that they were not collecting personal information via the <abbr title="Anonymous Video Analytics">AVA</abbr> technology.</p>
<p><strong><abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> <em>did not</em> collect the location information of identifiable individuals via mobile device tracking technology in its malls, such that it did not require consent for the practice.</strong></p>
<p>We found that the information collected from mobile devices of shoppers, who were not logged into Wi-Fi in <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> malls, did not constitute personal information. More specifically, the hashed and randomized <abbr title="Media Access Control">MAC</abbr> address (device identifier), coupled with non-granular “zone” geolocation information collected using Wi-Fi triangulation, did not constitute personal information in this context, as there was not a serious possibility that this information could be linked, either alone or with other available information, with the mobile device holder.</p>
<p>With respect to individuals who log in to <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s free Wi-Fi service, via a process that required them to provide personal information, we originally understood, based on the evidence gathered during our investigation, including from <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> and its Wi-Fi service provider, that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> was collecting triangulated device geolocation information and linking it with identifiable device users’ Wi-Fi accounts. We therefore made certain preliminary recommendations to <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> with respect to the consent we would expect for this practice. However, in response to a preliminary report issued by our Offices, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> clarified, and its third-party Wi-Fi service provider verified, that the geolocation information described above could not in any practical manner be associated with, or linked to, logged-in Wi-Fi accounts, such that it was not personal information in that context. We therefore determined the matter to be <strong>not well-founded</strong>.</p>
<p>We did note, however, that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> was seeking consent for “special location-based offers”, despite the fact that it was not engaged in the practice. Further to our recommendation, <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> did remove such language from its privacy policy, and added language making clear what limited location information is collected and associated with Wi-Fi accounts (i.e., only the <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> property in question).</p>
<p>Finally, we note that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr>’s third-party Wi-Fi service provider offers the option to associate triangulated “zone” information to accounts, and that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> did include, in its privacy policy, the prospect of using geolocation information to deliver location-based offers. We therefore recommended that <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> commit to implementing our preliminary recommendations should it decide to activate this functionality and associate geolocation information with Wi-Fi accounts in future. Specifically, we would expect <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> to: (i) support express consent for such geolocation practices via a clear and prominent notice on the Wi-Fi log-in page; and (ii) provide a clearly explained and easily accessible opt-out option. <abbr title="Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited">CFCL</abbr> again refused, claiming that these recommendations were speculative.</p>

<ol start="1">
<li><!-- 1. -->This report of investigation examines The Cadillac Fairview Corporation Limited’s (“<abbr>CFCL</abbr>”) compliance with Canada’s <em>Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act</em> (“<abbr>PIPEDA</abbr>”), Alberta’s’ <em>Personal Information Protection Act</em> (“<abbr>PIPA AB</abbr>”), and British Columbia’s <em>Personal Information Protection Act</em> (“<abbr>PIPA BC</abbr>”) – referred to collectively as the “Acts”.</li>
<li><!-- 2. --><abbr>CFCL</abbr> is one of the largest owners, operators and developers of offices, retail and mixed-use properties, including shopping malls, in North America.</li>
<li><!-- 3. -->This joint investigation was launched in the wake of numerous media reports that raised questions and concerns about whether <abbr>CFCL</abbr> was collecting, using and/or disclosing personal information using facial analytics technology, via in-mall directories, without adequate consent. The technology, which <abbr>CFCL</abbr> referred to as Anonymous Video Analytics (“AVA”) technology,<sup id="fn3-rf"><a href="#fn3"><span>Footnote </span>3</a></sup> was installed on digital wayfinding directories, which are effectively touch screen digital map systems that allow visitors to locate stores and find their way through <abbr>CFCL</abbr> shopping malls.

<p>Corporate Development, Strategic Business Development, Corporate Business Development, or any other amalgamation – are likely all the same teams with small caveats. Traditionally, CorpDev’s mandate was to buy companies. That’s traditional. But it’s 2020 and we can all attest that business models have changed over the past years. These days CorpDev isn’t simply a team being told from the top-down what to go find and buy. More often than not it’s an assortment of functions baked into a multi-faceted team who brings the outside-in, from education to execution. This takes the form of helping business lines execute strategic partnerships, take stakes in venture investments, and yes the vanilla M&amp;A. That team could also be tasked with helping draft corporate strategy by informing business unit leaders of emerging threats given their overweighted exposure to the startup ecosystem. It’s exciting work!</p>

<p>This is why it’s disappointing to hear people say ‘don’t talk to CorpDev unless you’re ready to sell.’ (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://paulgraham.com/corpdev.html" target="_blank">Enter Paul Graham’s essay</a>) It’s short-sighted. It’s akin to having a VC reach out to a founder, ask for a conversation, and the founder says, “no thanks, we’re not currently raising.” The most likely response from the VC would be, “cool, I wasn’t looking to invest but wanted to create a connection.” </p>



<p>All of it is a relationship-driven business.  Executing partnerships, investments and acquisitions are more likely to happen if you previously knew the founders or investors in advance. And you don’t need to wait to talk to VCs or CVCs or ‘CorpDev’ until you’re ready – talk to them when you have mutual interests that could be beneficial to both parties.  Talk to them when you’re looking to network.  Don’t wait to talk to them until, and only until you’re ready to begin a raise or be sold. If you do so there’s a chance you’ll get a response like the following, “thanks for reaching out and happy to still connect, but we just did X 3 months ago and would have loved to connect back then.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>CorpDev benefits regardless if their company grows through in-organic ways. And if it’s a legit team, they’re involved regardless in everything of strategic value that’s in-organic. Outside engagement with the startup ecosystem is what that usually looks like. Even more so, transactions in my experience have happened by having existing relationships. This is the same team sitting at the leadership table adjacent to the business unit heads with a purview into the organization’s strategy – they know the players involved, and what is necessary to get something executed. If they’re good, they’ll be frank on timing and engagement strategy. For example, “our process takes 5 weeks to execute from soup to nuts, and you’ll know in the next week if X is possible.”</p>



<p>Additionally, having pre-existing relationships with CorpDev can help outside startups and companies bypass red-tape or headaches. I see this a lot: a Series A-C startup working with an individual at the firm already for the past two months, only to find out that that person who’s ‘in’ the business needs to go through procurement which includes an RFP process to get a contract signed off on. That individual didn’t know because it was the first time they were engaged in something like that, regardless of their passionate intentions. What the startup’s sales executive thought would be signing of the account in a quarter quickly turned into a 12-18 month procurement process that they now have the chance of losing. This usually comes to fruition as pen needs to be signed to paper and the individual who ushered them in is not the individual who’ll be signing off on the $50,000 PoC to test validity leading to production.</p>



<p>Having a contact at the firm’s CorpDev team can always quickly hash something like the aforementioned out over a 15-minute phone call at the beginning, providing a black and white picture of what they should expect and the best way to close. CorpDev understands who’s inside the organization.  CorpDev can help ‘herd the sheep’.  And if they’re good (respected) CorpDev can influence without direct authority.</p>



<p>Talk to CorpDev.   Talk to them when you’re curious.   Talk to them when you’re about to start raising.   Talk to them when you’re kicking off direct sales, auctions, and more.   Don’t wait. </p>

November 15, 2020 | https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>In my previous article about <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS&nbsp;14</a>, I counted the number of built-in apps in iOS using Swift and SwiftUI. Several readers asked if I could provide a percentage rather than an absolute number.</p>
<p>In this new article, I will answer this question by measuring the total number of binaries in iOS. I will go one step further and also count the number of binaries using other programming languages: Objective-C, C++ and C.</p>
<p>Finally to be as complete as possible, I ran this analysis on all major iOS releases, from iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 to iOS&nbsp;14. This will provide a detailed overview of the evolution of the different programming languages over more than a decade of iOS development.</p>

<p>Before jumping into the analysis, let's clarify the scope. First I only analyzed what is commonly called ‘iOS’, i.e. everything above the kernel. The XNU kernel and low-level firmwares (SecureROM, Baseband, …) are not included in this analysis. On the other hand, I counted the frameworks located inside the dyld shared cache, a cache mechanism introduced in iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3.1 and still used in iOS&nbsp;14.</p>
<p>Another point is that you may note the absence of Objective-C++. The approach I used can't really detect binaries using Objective-C++. So I counted such binaries as using both Objective-C and C++.</p>
<p>Finally you should take this analysis with a grain of salt. While I believe the overall picture to be accurate, my approach has some limitations due to the simple fact that I don't have access to the iOS source code and relied on imprecise compilation artifacts.</p>

<p>The first problem to tackle was to count the number of binaries in iOS. Because I ran the analyses off‑device, I could not rely on the permissions being properly set.</p>
<p>Instead I used the fact that a binary has to be a Mach-O file to be executable. Checking if a file is a Mach-O binary is trivial by using the <code>file</code> command line tool in a Bash script:</p>
<pre><code>#---------------------------------------------------------------------
# Function to check if a file (passed as argument $1) is an executable
# It returns the number of occurrences of the string 'Mach-O' returned by
# the output of the file command. File would generally return a line like
# - Mach-O 64-bit executable arm64e (/usr/bin/sysdiagnose)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library arm64e (/usr/lib/libobjc-trampolines.dylib)
# - Mach-O 64-bit bundle arm64e (/usr/lib/xpc/support.bundle/support)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamic linker arm64e (/usr/lib/dyld)
# - Mach-O 64-bit kext bundle arm64e (/System/Library/Extensions/AppleIDV.kext/AppleIDV)
# - Mach-O 64-bit dynamically linked shared library stub arm64e (/Applications/FTMInternal-4.app/libMobileGestalt.dylib)
#---------------------------------------------------------------------
isExecutable ()
{
	file $1 2&gt;/dev/null | grep -o "Mach-O" | wc -l
}
</code></pre>
<p>I ran this script through all the files of each major iOS release to count the number of binaries and to obtain the evolution over time:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/Binaries.png" alt=""></p>
<p>As you can see, iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 contained quite a small amount of binaries. But iOS has become more and more complex and iOS&nbsp;14.0 now contains 20 times more binaries than iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0.</p>

<p>In my previous article on <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">Apple’s use of Swift and SwiftUI in iOS&nbsp;14</a>, I counted the built-in apps using Swift and SwiftUI. For this article I decided to go one step further and also count the number of binaries using Objective-C, C++ and C.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you can mix different programming languages to create a binary. One example is to create an app that uses C++ for the low-level engine and Objective-C for the UI. Another good example is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/clatters/id1480930237">Clatters</a> where I use some code written in Swift, SwiftUI, Objective-C and C, the most appropriate programming languages being used to solve each specific problem.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-swiftui">Detecting SwiftUI</h2>
<p>In my <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/0927-state-of-swift-ios14/">previous post</a>, I explained how to detect if a binary uses SwiftUI by checking if it dynamically links against <code>/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI.framework/Versions/A/SwiftUI</code>. This can be implemented in a Bash script like:</p>
<pre><code>isSwiftUI=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/System/Library/Frameworks/SwiftUI\.framework/SwiftUI" | wc -l )
</code></pre>
<p>Although SwiftUI is not really a programming language but rather an user interface toolkit, I decided to include it in this article.</p>
<h2 id="detecting-swift">Detecting Swift</h2>
<p>Detecting the use of Swift can be done using a similar method, as <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2016/1101-apples-use-of-swift-in-ios-10-1-and-macos-10-12/">described in an older post in 2016</a>. The script is however slightly more complex due to the fact that the Swift libraries have been moved to different locations during the history of iOS:</p>
<pre><code>isSwift=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/swift/" | wc -l )
if [ ${isSwift} == 0 ]
then
	# On iOS 11, the Swift dylib were inside "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Swift/"
	isSwift=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Swift/" | wc -l )
	
	if [ ${isSwift} == 0 ] &amp;&amp; [[ $1 != */libswiftUIKit.dylib ]]
	then
		# On iOS 9, the Swift dylib were built into the app
		isSwift=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "@rpath/libswiftUIKit\.dylib" | wc -l )
	fi
fi
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-objective-c">Detecting Objective-C</h2>
<p>Detecting if a binary uses Objective-C is pretty simple as explained in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/objective-c_runtime">Apple's documentation</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Objective-C runtime is a runtime library that provides support for the dynamic properties of the Objective-C language, and as such is linked to by all Objective-C apps. Objective-C runtime library support functions are implemented in the shared library found at /usr/lib/libobjc.A.dylib.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A simple line can thus detect all apps using Objective-C:</p>
<pre><code>isObjectiveC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libobjc\." | wc -l )
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-c">Detecting C++</h2>
<p>Similarly to Objective-C, we can rely on the fact that apps using C++ have to use the C++ standard library. On modern iOS versions, the C++ standard library libc++ is located at <code>/usr/lib/libc++.1.dylib</code>. On iOS&nbsp;7 and earlier, the gcc's libstdc++ was used and located at <code>/usr/lib/libstdc++.6.dylib</code>.</p>
<p>In case you are wondering why the exact path is not used in the script below, the reason is to mark <code>libc++abi.dylib</code> as using C++. <a href="http://libcxxabi.llvm.org/">libc++abi</a> is the low level support for the standard C++ library and appears to be written in C++.</p>
<pre><code>isCPP=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libc++" | wc -l )
if [ ${isCPP} == 0 ]
then
	isCPP=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libstdc++" | wc -l )
fi
</code></pre>
<h2 id="detecting-c-1">Detecting C</h2>
<p>Without entering into complex details, Objective-C and C++ are a superset of C. This means that an Objective-C or C++ app is using C code. So we can't know if an Objective-C or C++ app is using some pure C code. However some apps are written entirely in C. These are generally low-level command line tool, like <code>/usr/bin/zprint</code>.</p>
<p>How to detect such binaries? If a binary doesn't link neither to the Objective-C runtime library nor to the C++ standard library, but uses the standard C library <code>libc</code> located at <code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib</code>, then we can assume that this binary is entirely written in C. To detect apps entirely written in C, I ended up with these lines:</p>
<pre><code>isC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/libSystem\." | wc -l )
if [ ${isC} == 0 ]
then
	isC=$( echo "${otoolOutput}" | grep -o "/usr/lib/system/" | wc -l )
fi
</code></pre>
<p>You will also notice that I hardcoded all the dynamic libraries located inside <code>/usr/lib/system/</code> as being written in C. These low-level libraries don't link to <code>/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib</code> but are most likely written in C.</p>
<h2 id="special-cases">Special cases</h2>
<p>In the final script, you will see a couple of special cases:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>/usr/lib/libobjc-trampolines.dylib</code>:
This library is entirely written in assembly and you can read its arm64 source code in this file <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/objc4/objc4-781/runtime/objc-blocktramps-arm64.s">objc-blocktramps-arm64.s</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/usr/lib/dyld</code>:
dyld is the dynamic linker and is a really special binary. Since <a href="https://opensource.apple.com/source/dyld/">it is open source</a>, we can easily confirm that it contains C++ code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.xpc/sdk.dylib</code> and <code>/System/Library/Caches/com.apple.xpcd/xpcd_cache.dylib</code>:
These 2 libraries seem to be autogenerated libraries and part of dyld.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>/System/Library/Extensions/*</code>:
There are a couple of (kernel?) extension used by iOS like <code>/System/Library/Extensions/AppleIDV.kext</code>. All these binaries appear to use C++.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>You can <a href="https://blog.timac.org/2020/1019-evolution-of-the-programming-languages-from-iphone-os-to-ios-14/detectBinaries.sh">download here the complete script</a> that loops through all the files of a folder. This script prints the paths of all the binaries found and tells you the programming languages used, like:</p>
<pre><code>/Applications/AccountAuthenticationDialog.app/AccountAuthenticationDialog |Objective-C
/Applications/ActivityMessagesApp.app/ActivityMessagesApp |Objective-C
/Applications/ActivityMessagesApp.app/PlugIns/ActivityMessagesExtension.appex/ActivityMessagesExtension |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AnimojiStickers.app/AnimojiStickers |Objective-C
/Applications/AnimojiStickers.app/PlugIns/AnimojiStickersExtension.appex/AnimojiStickersExtension |Objective-C
/Applications/AppSSOUIService.app/AppSSOUIService |Objective-C
/Applications/AppStore.app/AppStore |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AppStore.app/PlugIns/ProductPageExtension.appex/ProductPageExtension |Objective-C|Swift
/Applications/AppStore.app/PlugIns/SubscribePageExtension.appex/SubscribePageExtension |Objective-C|Swift
[...]
</code></pre>

<p>I ran this script on all major releases of iOS from iPhone&nbsp;OS&nbsp;1.0 to iOS&nbsp;14.0. If you are interested by the raw data, you can download them here:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><div><div><p>A few months back I was running down the San Francisco Bay, looking out over the dry docks and concrete factories, pondering organization structures… as you do.</p><p>I was wrestling with two pieces of seemingly contradictory management advice:</p><ol><li>In order to optimize communication structures, particularly in fast-paced environments, organizations should remain as flat as possible.</li><li>Managers shouldn’t have too many reports, if you want them to be able to adequately support their team.</li></ol><p>Having worked in a range of different sized organizations the first piece of advice intuitively resonated. As you add layers of hierarchy, coordination becomes more complex and information gaps start to emerge. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as the “<a href="https://corporate-rebels.com/iceberg-of-ignorance/" rel="noopener" target="_self">Iceberg of Ignorance</a>,” where executives only see 4% of the problems experienced by front-line staff. So, aiming to reduce hierarchy where possible made sense.</p><p>But how do you balance that with the second piece of advice? If you reduce the number of direct reports each manager has, you inherently increase the depth of the hierarchy.</p><p>Experience from managing a team that grew from 20 to 60 told me that managers should really work with fewer than 8 reports, and that’s assuming no other responsibilities. If you’re expected to spend time coding, for example, I felt that it should be no more than five. But, having recently talked to a couple of managers with 25 reports each, I was starting to worry I was off base and wondered whether companies were in reality favoring high number of reports and flat org charts.</p><p>I resolved to gather more data, and went out to my network on Twitter and LinkedIn.</p><h3>Lucky Sevens</h3><p>I sent out a Google Form and after a couple of weeks had 129 responses. The majority came from people in leadership roles: 15 CXOs, 17 VPs, 26 directors, 42 managers. Many were from engineering functions — though there were a number of designers and people ops folks.</p><p>Responses spanned startups, public companies, and not-for-profits, with the largest segment being “growth stage” startups. One-third of respondents were at companies with under 150 people, while 10 were from 70,000+ person organizations.</p><p>It turned out that the average number of reports for both respondents and the respondent’s manager was 7, with a standard deviation of 5. Directors came in slightly higher than other roles with an average of 9 reports.</p><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/54e1aa9e9da8ce47df281654551a12c22b372f8f-1130x685.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Average reports"></p><p>The biggest surprise was that when asked about the ideal number of reports — not for themselves, but as a general rule of thumb — the average was also 7, with a standard deviation of only 2.</p><p>This answer was pretty consistent across roles, with only CXOs and ICs offering a slightly lower number of around 6 reports per manager — which is perhaps a function of experience. When I dug deeper into these numbers, It wasn’t that people were self-reporting their own situation as being ideal, but on average it did mean that for this dataset the status quo was somewhat close to the perceived ideal.</p><blockquote>Across seniority levels, people reported that seven was the ideal number of reports and that 11 was an upper limit for most situations.</blockquote><p>In terms of maximum number of reports, most felt that 10 to 12 was an upper limit, with ICs reporting that 8 or 9 was the maximum number for a manager to be effective.</p><div><section><div><div><div><h3>Keep your team better connected</h3><p>Sign up for the Range newsletter</p></div></div></div></section></div><p><img src="https://cdn.sanity.io/images/e422uarq/production/ce6a95de968e00fde739deae8430b437aa305ffc-1130x685.png?fm=jpg&amp;w=660&amp;dpr=2&amp;q=40" alt="Max reports"></p><h3>Nitty-gritty</h3><p>Many respondents noted that these “magic numbers” lack nuance.</p><p>There are no absolute rules and situational factors need to be considered when identifying the ideal ratio for your team: type of work, team structure, seniority of managers, how much hands-on work the manager is expected to contribute, etc.</p><p>Kean Wong, former VP Software Engineering at Pebble said:</p><blockquote>_Reporting relationships and the number of sustainable direct reports are directly related to the company structure, culture, size, and the team dynamics, and the other responsibilities of the manager. The magic number, skills and structures that worked effectively at Palm, Facebook, Pebble, Intel varied dramatically, and the number I could effectively manage also depended on factors like the locality of my reports and their teams, and my own responsibilities to the broader organization. This is why there is no single magic number of reports that works for every situation._</blockquote><p>Some respondents felt that senior reports required less attention, which would therefore give managers more capacity. Though several explicitly called this out as a common myth, including this Director of Engineering at a 200 person startup:</p><blockquote>_While some reports are "easy" it doesn't mean that you can lump on more and more reports. I find that easy and hard reports all need about the same amount of time just to ensure they are getting the attention and support they need._</blockquote><p>There are other practical constraints. Jason Goldman — former Chief Digital Officer for the White House — pointed out that 1:1s are a cornerstone managerial technique in modern organizations, and thus quickly becomes the most constraining factor.</p><p>Eight 30 minute 1:1s a week consumes 10% of your work week. It is possible to switch to every other week, but at around 12 to 15 even this starts to fall apart. Jason went on to say that he strongly believes that once you’re no longer having regular 1:1s with someone you’re not actually managing them.</p><h3>Doing the calculus</h3><p>Going back to the original question that plagued me during my dock-side run, how do these data points on manager reporting ratios affect organizational depth?</p><p>Using the above rule of thumb, let’s say that we want our leaders to average 7 direct reports. New managers may have 2-3 reports, while some managers will end off closer to 10 or 11 reports before needing to delegate some of their responsibilities.</p><p>With these ratios a team can get to nearly 60 people with two layers of management: VPE → Manager → Engineer. In my experience, this can still feel pretty flat, if you are intentional about communication and planning. Adding a Director layer gets you to 400 people, by which point you've crossed the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%27s_number" rel="noopener" target="_self">Dunbar number</a> and are dealing with a whole new set of issues.</p><p>For larger organizations, the challenge really becomes how and when to subdivide in order to provide a feeling of alignment and cohesion. Four layers of management will get you to nearly 3,000 people, but this number of people laddering up to a single business unit or product division will cause alignment and communication issues that go beyond those that stem from just the deep management chain.</p><h3>Alternative reality</h3><p>When I joined Google in 2005 I reported to a Director with over a hundred direct reports. This certainly made the reporting hierarchy look flat, but the org chart didn’t reflect reality. Multiple products rolled up to this Director. I was on Gmail, and we broke out into backend and frontend teams; I think at that stage there was also a dedicated SRE team and a delivery team.</p><p>While situations such as this are hopefully relegated to historical anecdotes, it is increasingly true that the org chart does not reflect the real work. Teams are becoming increasingly cross-functional and it is becoming common for individuals to contribute to multiple efforts.</p><p>This is leading more companies to decouple their organizational structure from the management hierarchy. Which in turn is making it possible to maintain a relatively flat team hierarchy — or “hierarchy of purpose” — while ensuring supportive management structures are also in place.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Organizing people is hard, it’s a constant process of balancing different trade-offs and there really is no one size fits all solution. But there are principles, discovered through others’ real world experiences, we should learn from.</p><p>So if you see a manager with more than eight reports ask yourself: is this situation really serving everyone? And it may be that you need to look for other solutions to the communication challenges posed by deeper hierarchies.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

  <p>You can read this post in Spanish <a href="https://stanete.com/es/compound-returns-engineering-excellence">here</a>.</p>

<p>I see a lack of honesty in our industry when we share knowledge. Every post is intented to sell the legend because we are as great as the legend we create.</p>

<p>I’m going to try to be honest and share with you a simple initiative I’m trying out with my team. My objective is to solve some of the problems we have and improve our <strong>Engineering Excellence</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-engineering-excellence">What is Engineering Excellence?</h2>

<p>The truth is… nobody really knows. So nobody will give you a right answer. I went on <a href="https://twitter.com/stanete">twitter</a> and asked the community, I read a bunch of Medium posts and I had conversations with other technical leaders. Only to arrive at the conclusion that <strong>Engineering Excellence can only be improved; it cannot be achieved</strong>.</p>

<p>I found out that <strong>Engineering Excellence</strong> is about how a <em>Product Engineering</em> team approaches problems, breaks them into steps that add value, implements those steps and learns from how the solution is performing at a <em>Business</em>, <em>Product</em> and <em>Engineering</em> level. In three words: plan, build and learn.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/engineering_excellence.png" alt=""></p>

<p><strong>Compound Returns on Engineering Excellence</strong> is just a mental model. A metaphor. A way of giving meaning to my quest of trying to improve my team by telling an interesting story. Compounding is about taking advantage of the returns your investments already generate by reinvesting them again. In other words, <a href="https://www.elkinvest.com/blog/compounding-returns-the-eighth-wonder-of-the-world-use-it-or-lose-it">compounding</a> is where you earn a return on returns that are already earned and reinvested.</p>

<p>With time, an <em>Engineering</em> team will improve their practices and systems if well though improvements are implemented. Every consecutive improvement will benefit from the last one. You must find your own story and give it the meaning your team needs. I work at a fintech so <em>compounding</em> seemed the right metaphor for us.</p>

<h2 id="its-dangerous-to-go-alone">It’s dangerous to go alone!</h2>

<p>In the the very first cave of <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>, an old man says: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/It%27s_dangerous_to_go_alone!">It’s dangerous to go alone! Take this</a>. He gives Link a sword to help him on his quest to defeat Ganon and rescue Princess Zelda.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/mojo_jojo_thinking.png" alt=""></p>

<p>There is no way you can accurately find out what the team needs to improve by yourself. I picked up three of the people I trust most. They don’t have to be the most Senior Engineers; they only have to be people others can look at and see as role models. They will help you find out what the team needs to improve. They will also help you create a plan, lead initiatives and inspire others to join in your quest.</p>

<p>But before starting the journey, I shared the initiative with the people I trust. I tried to enlist them, make space for them so they can grow and that way I tried to build trust. You do that last one by being honest and transparent about the problems you will encounter on your jorney.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-improve">What to improve?</h2>

<p>There are many ways you can lead the people you have chosen to help you find it out. But the main idea is drawn from the <a href="https://www.thesprintbook.com/">Design Sprint</a> methodology: diverge and converge. You need to find spaces where you can together explore many possibilities, find out what others think, set clear objectives, ask for feedback, give everyone a role and make decisions. Other book that talks about how to approach a problem as a team, explore possible solutions and make a decision is <a href="https://www.amazon.es/Mastering-Collaboration-Working-Together-Productive/dp/1492041734">Mastering Collaboration: Make Working Together Less Painful and More Productive</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/engineering_excellence_diagram.png" alt=""></p>

<p>You will lead one initiative yourself to give example. But each one of those people you’ve chosen will also lead one. This is important because it will allow them to shine, inspire and involve other members of the team. Leading does not mean doing. It means persuing, involving others and making sure it happens.</p>

<h2 id="what-are-we-improving">What are we improving?</h2>

<p>After a couple of weeks of brainstorming, debating, analysing and asking for feedback, we decided to focus on three aspects we must improve in the short term:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Vertical Continuous Delivery</em>. The team’s ability to break big problems into small pieces so every step makes sense, adds value and reduces risk.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Quality</em>. The team’s ability and processes to build simple yet testable, readable, maintainable and evolvable code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Observability &amp; Monitoring</em>. The team’s mindset to think and learn about what happens to the code after it is in one of the dark corners of the internet.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The journey is broken down into three phases: <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari">Shu-Ha-Ri</a>. Nobody <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/ShuHaRi.html">explains this</a> better than Martin Fowler so I’m not going to even try to do a better job.</p>

<p>Every team needs to improve different aspects of its <em>Engineering Excellence</em> throughout its life. Your team will have to follow its own path and battle its own demons.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/shu_ha_ri.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Make sure you have checkpoints along the journey so you can adjust your plans for the needs your team has. Also, make sure you can escape from the chaos and day to day histeria so you can have some time to think and reflect on the changes happening because this initiative.</p>

<h2 id="what-could-possibly-go-wrong">What could possibly go wrong?</h2>

<p>Everything. One of the most famous quotes in business is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What if you’re starting to improve your team’s <em>Engineering Excellence</em> but you are not <a href="https://leaddev.com/scaling-software-systems/primer-engineering-delivery-metrics">measuring</a> anything yet (quantitatively or qualitatively)? Keep going. You don’t have time to measure first and improve later. You’ll need to do both at the same time. Actually, make the team understand why <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/can-you-measure-developer-productivity/">measuring themsleves is so damn important</a> as part of the journey.</p>

<p><img src="https://stanete.com/images/mojo_jojo_bunny.png" alt=""></p>

<p>If you know something about <em>Engineering</em> teams and people in general you know there is no guarantee this initiative will succeed. But I would love to have a chat if you try this or something similar.</p>

<h2 id="what-to-do-when-you-finish">What to do when you finish?</h2>

<p>You never finish. When you do, if you do, you start over. But make sure you assess your team has actually improved their <em>Engineering Excellence</em> from time to time.</p>

<div itemprop="text">

<p>There are tons of interview myths floating around about the technical hiring process, mostly because it’s usually a black box to candidates. The inherent stress, inexperienced interviewers, tiring challenges, and unresponsive companies are valid reasons for candidates to have a negative view of hiring. Some of these myths work against a good interview experience and the candidates’ chances to get hired, so I’d like to call them out and refute them.</p>
<h2 id="about-me"><span id="About_me">About me</span></h2>
<p>I’ve interviewed a few hundred software engineering candidates in the past 10+ years and designed hiring processes. I’ve been supporting software engineers for 6+ years, working with ~40 engineers as their engineering manager. My experience is limited to startups and mid-sized companies, so take everything you read here with that in mind.</p>
<p>You might also be interested in <a href="https://ochronus.online/acing-the-tech-interview/">my guide to ace technical interviews.</a></p>
<h2 id="now-let-s-see-the-myths-and-misconceptions-"><span id="Now_lets_see_the_technical_interview_myths_and_misconceptions">Now let’s see the technical interview myths and misconceptions.</span></h2>
<h3 id="you-can-never-be-late-"><span id="You_can_never_be_late">You can never be late.</span></h3>
<p>Without question, do you best to be at your interview on time and plan things accordingly, but don’t worry, we know sh*it happens. If you can please let us know you’ll be late or you’d like to reschedule the interview, I promise you it’ll be fine. Nobody in their right mind would try to relate whether you were punctual or not on a single occasion to your future job performance.</p>
<h3 id="don-t-do-research-ahead-of-time-because-the-interviewer-will-tell-you-everything-you-need-to-know-"><span id="Dont_do_research_ahead_of_time_because_the_interviewer_will_tell_you_everything_you_need_to_know">Don’t do research ahead of time because the interviewer will tell you everything you need to know.</span></h3>
<p>False, for two reasons. While your interviewer will do their best to give you all the information&nbsp;<em>they</em>&nbsp;think is essential for you, there’s no way of exactly knowing what that is! The other reason is that if you don’t know anything about the company and the role, you’ll seem like someone who doesn’t care where they work and what they do. You probably don’t want that. You don’t need to overdo it and spend hours looking up who the founders’ grandparents were. Just make sure you understand the company’s market, look at the product(s) we offer (if you have time and you’re interested, even try them – we all love feedback!), and read the job description.</p>
<h3 id="they-are-looking-for-the-perfect-candidate-"><span id="They_are_looking_for_the_perfect_candidate">They are looking for the perfect candidate.</span></h3>
<p>No, we aren’t. We’re looking for a reasonably competent candidate with the right mindset who’s willing to take this journey of constant growth with us.</p>
<h3 id="it-s-not-ok-to-send-a-follow-up-email-after-my-interview-"><span id="Its_not_OK_to_send_a_follow-up_email_after_my_interview">It’s not OK to send a follow-up email after my interview.</span></h3>
<p>Sure it is! I even tell candidates explicitly to feel free to reach out to me if they have further questions or feedback! I really do value when folks reach out. I don’t mean “thank you” emails, but actual questions or feedback. Please, no brown-nosing, though – that’s really awkward for both of us and won’t get you anywhere.</p>
<h3 id="they-make-candidates-wait-a-lot-so-they-can-weigh-them-against-each-other-"><span id="They_make_candidates_wait_a_lot_so_they_can_weigh_them_against_each_other">They make candidates wait a lot so they can weigh them against each other.</span></h3>
<p>Hell, no we don’t! One quality of a good hiring process is that it should be able to help us decide whether we want to hire that specific candidate independently of others or not. As a hiring manager, I always do the interviews with my mind being set on that if we’re a good match, an offer is going out (unless, of course, headcounts changed in the meantime, but then we communicate that). If you’re waiting too long for us to come back to you, please, by all means, ping us! We might have dropped the ball somewhere – maybe someone is out sick and didn’t have time to ask others to help out, or we simply forgot something. It happens and we’re sorry – don’t assume malice, ask us, please. We should be proactively telling you when you can expect to hear from us and about the next steps, by the way! We do our best to keep those promises.</p>
<h3 id="recruiters-ghost-me-because-i-performed-badly-in-the-interview-"><span id="Recruiters_ghost_me_because_I_performed_badly_in_the_interview">Recruiters ghost me because I performed badly in the interview.</span></h3>
<p>While I can’t speak on behalf of all recruiters, in my experience, this is not the case! It should not happen. Sure, mistakes happen (recruiters are, believe it or not, humans, too), but the norm is that you get a timely answer whatever the interview outcome was. If you’re not getting that, ping them. Or ping the hiring manager. Probably someone dropped the ball on something. It happens. Ideally, we should be telling you when to expect us to come back to you, so you can know if we’re late or you’re just impatient 😉 – if you’re not getting that information from us, just ask at the end of the interview.</p>
<h3 id="if-my-interviewer-is-having-a-bad-day-i-will-probably-fail-the-interview-"><span id="If_my_interviewer_is_having_a_bad_day_I_will_probably_fail_the_interview">If my interviewer is having a bad day, I will probably fail the interview.</span></h3>
<p>Hopefully not. Sure, we are all humans, and our mood influences how we think and act, but a well-designed hiring process should protect against this. Unless I’m actively malicious (and why would I be?! I WANT to hire engineers!), my bias will be called out by other interviewers in the same step or another step, and I’ll need to argue for not hiring you. Honestly, even a good scorecard (the thing we fill out with some standard, guiding questions after the interview) will make me realize I’m just in a bad mood and then I can deal with it. If you only meet 1-2 interviewers during your process, the risk of bias is much higher. While you have no control over who interviews you, you can take a hint from this. While the scene might not yet be 100% rosy, companies are trying their best to stay competitive in the job market, and more and more realize that structured, unbiased, and humane interviews are one key to this.</p>

<h3 id="smaller-companies-blindly-copy-faang-hiring-methods-"><span id="Smaller_companies_blindly_copy_FAANG_hiring_methods">Smaller companies blindly copy FAANG hiring methods.</span></h3>
<p>Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Google have some (in)famous hiring methods. While some companies probably blindly copy those, most don’t. It’d be stupid. They play on a different field with different goals and have a much higher volume of candidate influx. One example is focusing on algorithm and data structure knowledge – most FAANG technical interviews test this. It probably makes sense for them while it doesn’t make much sense for most other companies. Not only that, but it can have a negative effect (other than scaring away good candidates) – being biased towards two kinds of applicants: engineers who are working a lot with algorithms and data structures and fresh graduates, who still have muscle memory of this.</p>
<h3 id="culture-fit-we-want-people-exactly-like-us-"><span id="Culture_fit_we_want_people_exactly_like_us">Culture fit == we want people exactly like us.</span></h3>
<p>When we say “cultural fit”, we mean “value/principle fit”. I try to say that, by default, but industry terms die hard. We’re looking for teammates who believe in most of the same basic principles as we do, that’s all. Some examples of these principles are (for us, here at Contentful): transparency, growth mindset, customer focus and teamwork. I can reason why these are important and how they also relate to job performance and how they lead to a happy and scalable organization. It’s not fluffy stuff.</p>
<h3 id="my-resume-is-really-important-"><span id="My_resume_is_really_important">My resume is really important.</span></h3>
<p>Yes and no – yes, to get your foot in the door. It’s also a conversation starter but I’ll be interested in your stories instead when we talk. I look at resumes of candidates already in the loop only to find more information about them – things to talk about, to get some context. One thing about your resume though – it is also a piece of work from you, a signal for me. If it is seriously lacking in some aspect (eg it has serious spelling mistakes), I may see it as a sign of you not paying attention to your work’s quality or not asking for feedback (for someone to review it). By the way, there’s an excellent new book from Gergely Orosz in town about engineering resumes that can help you stand out to the next recruiter or hiring manager –&nbsp;<a href="https://thetechresume.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Tech Resume Inside Out</a>. If you don’t have too much time for this, just update your LinkedIn profile (a good move anyway!) and export your CV from LinkedIn – it is going to be much better than if you try to put it together in one evening alone.</p>
<h3 id="telling-the-recruiter-i-m-also-in-the-process-elsewhere-is-a-bad-move-"><span id="Telling_the_recruiter_Im_also_in_the_process_elsewhere_is_a_bad_move">Telling the recruiter I’m also in the process elsewhere is a bad move.</span></h3>
<p>You might think we’ll feel you’re not dedicated to us – but why would you be?! We just started talking 🙂 Nobody’s expecting you to focus on one company! On the other hand, if we really like you and you signal urgency we’ll have the chance to speed things up or even be more generous with our offer to convince you to join us 😉</p>

<p>Yup, after a few hundred interview sessions I still practice conversations in my head, I still worry I’ll make a bad impression and that I’ll mess things up. Many other people you will meet are doing much fewer interviews than me. I’m representing both myself and my company in each and every interview. I feel personally responsible for providing a good experience for you and I want you to remember the interview as “Well that was surprisingly good!”.</p>

<p>Nobody in the hiring process will think of you like that! Trust me on this one. And yes, please do try again! The fact that you made it to the Nth step this time means that we see potential in you. If you reach out I’m more than happy to give tips and advice on where and how to grow.</p>
<h3 id="we-are-matchmakers-not-judges-"><span id="We_are_matchmakers_not_judges">We are matchmakers, not judges.</span></h3>
<p>My goal is to find a good match between the role I’m hiring for and the candidate applying. This truly goes both ways. I do my best to make sure the candidate would be successful and happy if we hired them.</p>

<div itemprop="text">

<p>Even though interviewing for a software engineering job can be intimidating and frustrating (with whiteboard exercises, remote coding challenges, and even full days of onsite interviews), it’s a lot easier when you know what to expect and are well-prepared.</p>
<p>I’ve interviewed a few hundred software engineering candidates in the past 10+ years and designed hiring processes. My experience is limited to startups and mid-sized companies, so take everything you read here with that in mind. My advice may not get you into <a href="https://www.facebook.com/careers/facebook-life/how-we-hire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://careers.google.com/how-we-hire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google</a> but will definitely increase your chances at mid-sized companies with a good culture!</p>
<p>In the first part of this article, I’ll give some context, then give you an actionable list to improve your experience and chances in your next interview</p>
<p>If you’re only interested in the actionable list, feel free to skip ahead to it.</p>

<h2 id="what-you-think-about-the-technical-interview-might-be-incomplete"><span id="What_you_think_about_the_technical_interview_might_be_incomplete">What you think about the technical interview might be incomplete</span></h2>
<p>First and foremost, a technical interview is almost never only technical. Up to a certain (and honestly, very useful!) level growing as a ‘coder’ is not that complicated. Many candidates perform pretty well if we purely look at their coding skills.</p>
<p>The thing is, you’ll rarely work alone in isolation on your own codebase. You’ll have teammates, you’ll need to agree on things with them, you’ll build on others’ code and others will build on your code. You’ll need to build solutions with a certain level of quality, in a future-proof way, for extensibility, and with performance in mind. Depending on your role and level, you’ll need to architect systems. You’ll need to mentor other engineers. You’ll need to onboard new team members. You’ll need to proactively reach out to other teams in the company and understand their points of view and problems. You’ll talk to product managers, UX researchers, designers, even customers sometimes. You’ll need to manage projects, make tradeoffs and decisions, and align other engineers with that.</p>
<p>Read my article about&nbsp;<a href="https://ochronus.online/technical-interview-myths/">the most common 11 technical interview myths</a> – you’ll get a better view of how people think on the other side of the table.</p>
<h2 id="types-and-stages-of-technical-interviews"><span id="Types_and_stages_of_technical_interviews">Types and stages of technical interviews</span></h2>
<p>Most companies use a combination of these steps:</p>
<ul><li>Screening call with a recruiter – We’re interested in your basic motivations; we’d like to have a gut feeling about what you’re looking for and do some sanity check here. You might get asked about your salary requirements, support you need for visa or relocation, timelines (when could you start, etc.). Some recruiters will also ask you whether you have applied elsewhere, so they know how urgent this is for them and you.</li><li>Screening call with the hiring manager – Expect some deeper dive into your experience on multiple fronts – tech and ‘soft skills’ alike. As a hiring manager, I’ll prepare by checking out your CV for talking points, maybe even your LinkedIn profile, and definitely GitHub. I’m not trying to judge you; I’m just looking for points of connection. I’ll answer any questions you have about the role, the company, the culture, potential teams you’d be joining, etc. My ultimate goal with this is twofold: would we be a good match for your (and vice versa) and whether I think you’d be successful in the role.</li><li>Remote technical screening – An alternative, or at some places precursor to the online coding exercise. This is with a human on the other end of the line – solving tech problems together; usually, you walk them through your solution.</li><li>Online coding exercises (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.) – I know you all hate this. We need such a step to filter out people who can’t even code at all early on. You’d be surprised about the number of such applicants. I avoid algorithm/data structure exercises here and try to come up with somewhat interesting ones. Some companies use a much heavier set of exercises and judge your technical skills solely on this. While I disagree with that strategy, you need to get prepared for this, too.</li><li>Take-home assignment – this is one of the most polarizing interview steps for engineers. Some hate it, claiming it’s just free labor for the companies, and it takes too much time. Others love it because they feel they have the freedom to give it much time, really showing off their skills in their own comfortable environment. <a href="https://levelup.gitconnected.com/take-home-assignment-mistakes-which-will-guarantee-someone-else-gets-the-job-36bcee1cec1d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whichever camp you’re in</a>, you can expect some companies requiring this. You usually get a somewhat specified problem to solve, and you’re given different levels of freedom on how to solve it – some companies don’t mind you choosing whichever stack you like; others will even specify the framework.</li><li>Onsite workshop / remote workshop – I think this is the most interesting of all steps (well, for me, at least). It’s about solving problems together with people from the company in a simulated environment. You’ll need to show your communication, decision-making, and even prioritization skills here. Sure, people will look at your code’s quality, too, but ‘soft skills’ are just as important here. We’ll get strong signals about how it would be to have you on the team.</li></ul>

<p>Take the guesswork out of the equation. If you feel you don’t have enough information to prepare for your technical interview, just ask for more! We’re here to help you succeed. I really mean it. Sometimes we aren’t doing a great job with sharing enough information proactively about the interview steps but that’s not intentional! I’m always happy to help you prepare better – ask about anything, please. You’re doing both of us a favor with that. Simply ask during the previous technical interview step or just drop me or the recruiter an email at any time.</p>

<p>Make sure you arrive at your technical interview on time. If you can’t, for some reason, please let us know, we’ll happily reorganize for another time, no hard feelings (sh*t happens). Showing up on time isn’t only about respecting each other’s schedule – interview time slots are usually 100% utilized and by arriving 10 minutes late you’re reducing your own chance to be successful. You’re also making it more stressful for yourself than necessary. If you need time for commute or for your Zoom/Google Meet setup, think ahead and give yourself a buffer before the start. You’ll also love the extra 10 minutes before the interview to tune in and get calmer.</p>

<p>The biggest mistake you can do is thinking you understand the problem or what’s asked of you and jumping right into coding in the technical interview. Take your time, carefully read the problem statement, distill it, don’t think of solutions just yet. When you feel you understand what’s asked of you or when you thought about clarifying questions to ask, communicate. <a href="https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/paraphrasing-summarizing.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paraphrase</a> what you understood from the problem statement so you can verify it with your interviewers. Only when you’re on the same page can you shift into solution mode. Even if you come up with the best solution ultimately if you skip this step I’ll remember and have doubts about how it’d be to work with you. Thinking aloud is really useful here – it will help you and help me too to understand what’s on your mind.</p>

<p>Even if you know your trade and you’re the best engineer in the world, if you fail to communicate clearly during the technical interview we’ll have no way of knowing. This takes practice for most people, so take your time and prepare! Use standard terms that other engineers can relate to, avoid passive voice, and be able to articulate what’s going on in your mind while you’re thinking. If you need some time to think quietly, say so, don’t just fall silent suddenly. We’re trying our best to communicate our expectations around this but it might be a bit late when you’re in the interview. Trust me on this one, practice here goes a long way.</p>

<p>While you’d think the technical interview is about you answering questions, expect that you will need to ask a lot of them, too! When you are in the interview and something is not clear don’t default to thinking “Oh god, I should know this, I should understand” – sometimes we are interested in how you behave in such situations, and sometimes we’re just simply not good enough in giving enough context. If you’re stuck, a good technique is to ask for clarification! It’s also 100% OK to say things like “I didn’t quite get that. Could you rephrase please?” or “I’m not sure I understand what you’re asking”. These are good signals! I expect my team members to behave like this. These are not signals of you failing. I know it feels like that, but trust me, it’s just your brain playing tricks on you. I highlight this during the interview several times, to make sure the candidate feels safe asking such questions. Another technique I wholeheartedly welcome is paraphrasing – e.g. “What I understood from what you said is that I should implement this using co-monads” (said nobody ever).</p>

<p>Make us see that you’re deeply proficient in at least one technology. This can be a programming language, for example. Also, demonstrate that you know the adjacent technologies – most companies are looking for so-called <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidmichels/2019/09/27/going-pi-shaped-how-to-prepare-for-the-work-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">T-shape</a> engineers. This means that mentioning other aspects of the problem and the solution goes a long way. For example, if you’re asked to implement a service in NodeJS, mention how you’d deploy, monitor, and scale it, even if that’s not explicitly asked. No need to go into too many details (unless people ask you). If you’re only focused on a single piece of the puzzle I’ll have a hard time seeing how you’d perform well in a changing environment (where you’ll need to make connections and work on multiple zoom levels and be ready). This is a very generic statement and might not be true in the case of highly specialized roles, of course. On the other hand, …</p></div></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Consider a team of engineers building a feature API for Snapchat. Let’s call them Ovah’s team. They’re facing two big problems: how to build it, and how long would it take.</p>

<p>If they can’t figure out how to build it, the feature is dead already. If they take too long to build it, the feature is as good as dead: Instagram would copy it before they’ve built it.</p>

<p>This post contains 4 different perspectives to look at the two problems. As you read through the perspectives, notice the tension in the examples. Both problems are vastly different, and some perspectives are better for one problem, and worse for another problem.</p>





<h2 id="the-outside-view">The Outside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_outside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the outside view, Ovah’s team compares this feature to other similar features they’ve built in the past. They built earlier features using Flask, and it took them 1 month to do it.</p>

<p>The outside view says that a good estimate for how long it would take is 1 month as well.</p>

<p>Further, the outside view says that a good estimate for how to build it is how you built it in the past: using Flask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The outside view looks for similar problems in different contexts. It’s a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behaviour level model</a>: you look at things only from the outside. How things change from the outside are hints to what’s important on the inside.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that figuring out how long it takes might do well with the outside view, but the API design decisions - not so much. What’s different between the two problems?</p>

<p>Taking the outside view on API design decisions is like building a truck using a car model. Just because it has 4 wheels and behaves the same as a car doesn’t mean it’s used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>On the flip side, not taking the outside view for figuring out how long it would take is a fallacy. Daniel Kahneman writes about the outside view in <a href="https://amzn.to/3eVmTkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-inside-view">The Inside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_inside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the inside view, Ovah’s team looks at the components of the problem. They look at the requirements for the feature, and come up with a good design tailored exactly for this use case. It’s unique. They decide to go with Django instead of Flask, since it gets them authentication and other nice things out of the box.</p>

<p>The team figures that with Django, most things are done for them already, so it should take about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The inside view looks at specifics of the problem. It’s a gears level model: you understand how things tick. You figure out how each component would work.</p>

<p>Taking both, the inside and outside view is better than just taking one. It’s like going to the eye doctor, where they show you unreadable letters on a lit-up screen. They add one lens on your eyes, and you begin to distinguish <code>o</code> and <code>e</code>. Then they add a second lens, and now you can even tell the difference between <code>h</code> and <code>n</code>! They add a third spherical lens, and the dots become sharper - you can now even see the dots over the i’s as circles, not blobs. Each lens is a perspective that sharpens your view. It helps you realise that you’re looking at <strong>e</strong>va<strong>n</strong>’s team, not <strong>o</strong>va<strong>h</strong>’s team: and then everything clicks.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>In this case, using Django was a good decision. However, it took much longer than 2 weeks: unexpected things went wrong, and the team’s imagination was limited by how things can go right.</p>

<p>I think engineers are better at designing APIs than they are at figuring out how long it would take, which hints at them being better at taking the Inside View. This makes taking the Outside View even more important: if no one else is thinking like you, you have a sharp lens no one else has, which makes all the difference.</p>

<p>At the same time, you need to beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maslow’s Hammer</a>: If you only take the Outside View on every problem, you’ll end up with a bad API design.</p>

<h2 id="the-birds-eye-view">The Bird’s eye View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_bird.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the bird’s eye view, Evan’s team looks at how this API should connect to other teams and clients. What are the other components involved? How can we best design things to work seamlessly with existing workflows?</p>

<p>The bird’s eye view looks at the problem as a part of a system, a part of other problems. This is different from the outside view, since it’s still the same problem in the same setting, but being looked at as an interface: how it connects to other things and other problems.</p>

<!-- Sometimes, tweaking the bigger picture can improve the interface, and subsequently the problem in the specific box you were working. -->

<p>Amazon is a company that internalises the bird’s eye view: Every team talks via interfaces! Every other team is their customer. You can’t go to your friend and ask them to open a backdoor for internal calls: it needs to be part of an interface anyone in the company can call. This means, not just clients, but also their colleagues and friends face the pain when the interfaces are hard to use.</p>

<p>What would it mean to take the bird’s eye view for the second problem? Evan’s team looks at how long their dependent teams would take, and when customers would be most likely to upgrade. So, they decide to launch with the next filters release, using that as a guiding factor: if the feature won’t get done by this time, build a smaller feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-worms-eye-view---genchi-genbutsu">The worm’s eye View - Genchi Genbutsu</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_worm.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genchi_Genbutsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genchi Genbutsu</a> means to “go and see”. Go to the problem, and see why it’s a problem.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For Evan’s team, this means looking at the team dynamics, and figuring out if Evan or others are somehow holding the team back. It also means figuring out if they have the required expertise in the team, and if not, how can they build it.</p>

<p>Like how the bird’s eye view zooms out to the interface between other teams, the worm’s eye view zooms in to the interface between people in the team. It’s one layer deeper than the problem of designing the API: it’s about how the team will go about it. You’re looking at the problem as a single engineer among other engineers working on the same problem.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>I’ve noticed that the Inside View, and the Bird’s eye view comes more naturally to people, while Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View are rarer. The more uncertainty and unknown unknowns involved in a problem, the more important Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View become.</p>

<p>The importance of taking these different perspectives shows up when you’re facing hard problems without an obvious solution: with the right combination of lenses, a blur turns into a sharp dot.</p>

But that’s not really the question patients want answered. Patients want to know how much longer they can expect to live if they take a statin every day for the rest of their lives. Is it weeks? months? years? decades?</p><p>Considering that statins do have known side effects, with muscle pain being the most common and widely recognized, and considering that many people think it’s annoying to have to take a pill every day, they generally want to know the size of the benefit before they decide whether to take the drug or not. Unfortunately, the answer to that question is hard to extrapolate from the studies, due to the way in which they have been designed. Saying that a drug decreases your risk of dying by x over five years doesn’t really tell you anything about how much longer you can actually expect to live.</p><p>In 2015, a group of researchers looked at the data from the statin trials and re-calculated the effect in terms of increased longevity. The <a href="https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/5/9/e007118.long" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">study was published in the British Medical Journal</a>, and it was funded by the University of Southern Denmark. One of the authors had significant conflicts of interest, having received money from multiple different pharmaceutical companies that produce statins.</p><p>All randomized trials comparing statins to placebo, and that also fulfilled the following three criteria, were included: They had to have at least 1,000 participants, they had to follow patients for at least two years, and they had to provide a survival curve. The reason a survival curve was necessary was because the increase in longevity was extrapolated by calculating the area between the survival curves for the statin group and the placebo group. I think the other two criteria are also reasonable – statin studies looking at mortality with less than 1,000 participants and that don’t even follow patients for two years are leaving too much up to chance.</p><p>The authors identified eleven studies that fulfilled the criteria, of which six were investigating statins for primary prevention (i.e. to treat people without known atherosclerotic disease) and five were investigating statins for secondary prevention (i.e. to treat people who had already had heart attacks, or in some other way clearly manifested atherosclerotic disease). These eleven studies together included a total of 92,135 patients, so the data are robust. Participants in the studies were followed for between two and six years. Most of the major statin trials (4S, WOSCOPS, ALLHAT, LIPID, ASCOT-LLA, JUPITER) were included in the analysis.</p><p>So what were the results?</p><p>Life was prolonged by between -5 and 19 days in the primary prevention trials (yes, that’s -5, as in minus five. In one of the studies people taking a statin lived five days shorter than people taking a placebo). In the secondary prevention trials life was prolonged by between -10 and 27 days (yes, again that’s -10, as in minus ten).</p><p>When everything is averaged out, people taking a statin for primary prevention lived three days longer than people in the placebo group. People taking a statin for secondary prevention lived four days longer than people in the placebo group. The average follow-up period in these studies was around four years, so if you assume that statins have a linear life-prolonging effect that grows with time (rather than petering off after a while, which is likely), then you can expect to live around one day longer for each year of treatment.</p><p>Huh? That’s disappointing. You take a drug dutifully, which your doctor has told you is vitally important, and it prolongs your life by mere days. The results are especially disappointing when you consider that most of the eleven trials were industry funded, and industry funded trials usually show better results than are seen in the real world. So most likely the real world benefit is even smaller than the tiny benefit found in these trials.</p><p>And remember, this analysis was done by people with financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry. If even people who are friendly with industry say that statins only prolong life by mere days, we can probably trust that the benefit really is that tiny.</p><p>As mentioned at the beginning of the article, statins are not completely free of side effects. So even if you are willing to take a drug every day that has an extremely marginal effect on longevity, then that benefit needs to be weighed against the risk of side effects.</p><p>You might also enjoy my article <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/07/28/do-statins-save-lives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about whether statins save lives</a>, or my article <a href="https://sebastianrushworth.com/2020/09/08/is-the-cholesterol-hypothesis-dead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">about whether the cholesterol hypothesis is dead</a>.</p><section id="blog_subscription-17"></section><div><div><p> I am a practicing physician in Stockholm, Sweden.

        <h4>What is the demo doing?</h4>
        <p>Neural networks achieve superhuman performance in many areas, but they are easily fooled.</p>
        <p>In the demo above, we can force neural networks to predict anything we want. By adding nearly-invisible noise to an image, we turn "1"s into "9"s, "Stop" signs into "120 km/hr" signs, and dogs into hot dogs.</p>
        <p>These noisy images are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adversarial_machine_learning#Specific_Attacks_Types">adversarial examples</a>. They break the integrity of machine learning systems, and the illusion of their superhuman performance.</p>

        <h4>Why does this matter?</h4>
        <p>Our world is becoming increasingly automated, yet these systems have strange failure modes.</p>
        <p>If machine learning systems are not properly defended, attackers could:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Impersonate others in facial recognition systems</li>
          <li>Force autonomous vehicles to misrecognize street signs &amp; obstacles</li>
          <li>Bypass content moderation and spam filters in social networks</li>
          <li>Inject adversarial bytes into malware to bypass antivirus systems</li>
          <li>Digitally alter numbers on a check in a mobile banking app</li>
          <li>(and more)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Is this limited to image classification with neural networks?</h4>
        <p>No. Adversarial examples exist for almost every machine learning task: <a href="https://nicholas.carlini.com/code/audio_adversarial_examples">speech recognition</a>, <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.07998.pdf">text classification</a>, <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3308558.3313533">fraud detection</a>, <a href="https://www.ericswallace.com/imitation">machine translation</a>, <a href="https://adversarialpolicies.github.io/">reinforcement learning</a>, ....</p>
        <p>Moreover, all machine learning models (not just neural networks) are vulnerable. In fact, simpler models such as logistic regression are <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1412.6572.pdf">even more easily attacked</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally – beyond adversarial examples – there are many more adversarial attack vectors, including data poisoning, model backdooring, data extraction, and model stealing.</p>

        <h4>How do I defend against adversarial examples?</h4>
        <p>There are several proposed defenses, including adversarial training and admission control.</p>
        <p>However, no defense is universal and many have proven ineffective, so work with an expert to quantify your risks and invest in defenses appropriately.</p>
        <p>(What happens if someone can make your system predict anything they want?).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h3>Getting Things Done</h3><p><time datetime="2020-11-09"><small>9 Nov, 2020</small></time></p><p>I'm writing this blog post at 21:45 on a weekday after an intense day at work and a full evening of looking after my daughter and cooking pizza. I was in three video conferences and chatted with two colleagues in Teams, all while having my kid run around me all day because the daycare is closed. Now's the time to do something for <strong>me</strong>. Wouldn't it be nice to have some help to juggle all these different things and not feel overwhelmed?</p><p>In the next weeks, I'm trying out the Getting Things Done (GTD for short) method. I have tried GTD for short periods off and on over some years. Without knowing the concept, I used <a href="https://culturedcode.com/things">Things</a> but abandoned it after some time. That was over 10 years in my studies. A few years back, I read the original book and re-read it last year. So why try again? Didn't I learn my lesson?</p><p>No - I didn't :-). Although I've never completely adopted it, I've soaked up more and more of its practices. This time around I'll try to apply <em>all</em> its techniques as well as I can and see where that leads me.</p><h2 id="gtd-in-a-nutshell">GTD in a nutshell</h2><p>Quoted with small changes from the book:</p><ol><li>Capture all the things that might need to get done or have usefulness for you - now, later, someday, big little, or in between -- in a logical and trusted system outside your head and off your mind.</li><li>Direct yourself to make front-end decisions about all of the "inputs" you let into your life so that you will always have a workable inventory of "next actions" that you can implement or renegotiate in the moment.</li><li>Curate and coordinate all of that content, utilizing the recognition of the multiple levels of commitments with yourself and others you will have at play at any point in time.</li></ol><p>There are already many concise and complete introductions to the basics of GTD, so I won't repeat them here. Read <a href="https://hamberg.no/gtd">Erlend Hamberg's well-structured one: GTD in 15 minutes</a>. It's a quick and well-written guide.</p><p>In a sense, GTD is very American because I have the feeling (North) Americans are obsessed with lists. Many clickbait articles you come across have titles like "top X things" where X is more often than not simply the number somebody came up with. Although I must admit the last example was from a German site <a href="https://t3n.de/news/wordpress-hosting-anbieter-vergleich-604474/">13 WordPress-Anbieter</a>.</p><p>GTD has a list of the next actions one wants to look at. This is different from a todo list in that there are stricter rules on what a good entry can be. For example, it has to be a physical action and not a whole project. GTD also prescribes reviews (every day and every week) to keep on top of these lists. There's a comfort to know you'll triage a pressing question or inspiring article the next day or at least at your weekly review. This relief is at the heart of GTD: knowing that nothing will fall through the cracks you can relax from time to time.</p><p>One pays for a generally more relaxed general outlook by following a couple of small practices very closely. To capture all things, David Allen means that all emails or collected snippets are processed and collected too. I found it especially significant that one should collect references and notes on everything that might come in handy later. Collecting things comes <strong>very</strong> naturally to me; as a kid, I liked to collect buttons -- of all things -- and to keep many books around. When at long last I got my own computer I immediately started collecting <em>all the things</em>. My <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> accounts probably had more than a thousand collected links when it was shut down. GTD emphasizes to collect references for later usage. A lot of input is not useful at the moment and only potentially later at some point, but still, you can rely on your system to keep it for you.</p><h2 id="is-gtd-for-everybody%3F">Is GTD for everybody?</h2><p>David Allen originally "discovered" it in his work as a consultant and executive coach. I would argue that it's useful when you're already pretty organized. If you're in a routine job with little need for interaction with others it might be overkill for you. A simple todo list and some basic tricks to fight procrastination could be enough. There are fewer and fewer routine jobs. Most office workers are expected to be as "agile" when shifting many responsibilities as executives two decades ago.</p><h2 id="besides-gtd">Besides GTD</h2><p>In summary, I've mentioned that a convenient "setup" serves me better than vague "hacks". It can increase motivation and/or remove distractions. For my productivity, I still find it crucial to avoid news sites as much as possible. I've replaced them with a collection of RSS feeds from newspapers and some blogs. With a configured update interval of four hours, refreshing it every few minutes is less attractive. Turning off communication tools, the popular Pomodoro technique or simply walking to another room, still help me. I like that you can still apply many other ideas and still refine my <em>personal</em> system. If I had <strong>nothing</strong> to procrastinate on, that would be sad too, right?</p><p>I think getting rid of distractions is more important than having the perfect productivity system/todo tool. Cal Newport's ideas from his books (especially <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/deep-work/">"Deep Work"</a> and <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/books/digital-minimalism/">"Digital Minimalism"</a>) and his <a href="https://www.calnewport.com/blog/">blog</a> immediately come to mind. <a href="https://www.taniarascia.com/everyday-systems/">Here are some ideas from developer Tania Rascia</a> that I can relate to.</p><h2 id="how-to-implement-gtd">How to Implement GTD</h2><p>You have to decide if you want to go analog or digital. David Allen suggests in his book to keep lists and folders analog first. Digital tools realize GTD with more or less sophistication. I've never tried to use only paper although I tried working a lot with my Moleskine notebook. At some point, I had also used Things but only used it as a fancy todo list.</p><p>For me a very text-centric simple note-taking app called <a href="https://nvultra.com/">nvUltra</a> has worked well. It lets me write lists in different files synced between my laptop and smartphone. It's not very adapted to GTD but I like that it is an excellent reference system too. nvUltra is the commercial successor to the excellent open-source <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvAlt</a>. This in turn evolved from <a href="http://notational.net/">Notational Velocity</a>. There are also cross-platform implementations such as <a href="https://github.com/cpbotha/nvpy">nvPY</a>.</p><p><a href="https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/getting-things-done">todoist</a> is a sophisticated tool for GTD too. <a href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus/">OmniFocus</a> has been around very long and has been refreshed over time. Other general-purpose note-taking tools can be adapted for GTD too, such as Evernote, Notion, or OneNote. <a href="https://orgmode.org/">Org-mode</a> is an alternative plain text file format that's more powerful than Markdown. It's mostly used with the Emacs editor and supports notes and todos as well.</p><h2 id="gtd-horizons">GTD horizons</h2><p>One distinguishing feature of GTD on top of todo management is more abstract and longer-term levels of focus. rom the day-to-day "ground" level, David Allen introduces the level of longer projects at horizon 1 and goes up to the purpose of your life with horizon 5. In his <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2015/05/podcast-01-david-allen-talks-about-the-new-edition-of-getting-things-done/">podcast</a>, David Allen mentions that for many it takes years to reach these longer-term perspectives. It takes a long time to integrate them into the system. He suggests one should start off with the day-to-day and form long-term plans bottom-up.</p><p>GTD horizons with their increased abstraction remind me of Eastern religions such as buddhism. In stoicism as well one works towards a very distant ideal of "enlightenment". This is not far-fetched as David Allen is a black belt karateka and used his experience in the conception of GTD. The book mentions having a "mind like water" to be ready for anything that may come to you as a concept from martial arts. There's also a blog by David Allen with <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/2019/05/10-reasons-gtd-is-like-karate/">10 more similarities</a>.</p><h2 id="is-it-simply-self-exploitation%3F">Is it Simply Self-Exploitation?</h2><p>"Increasing productivity" also has a stale 19th century factory worker exploitation aspect to me. At least the basis of management "science" had very questionable origins. Managers "scientifically" noted how long some workers took to complete a task. They noted the fastest and decided to increase work quotas for everybody. Even then short-term exploitation didn't have long-term lasting positive effects.</p><p>One could argue that a personal productivity system only serves as self-exploitation. Where managers exploited industrial workers, we do it ourselves now. I haven't read or though much about this, but a <a href="https://dev.to/tinmanjk/the-curious-case-of-self-exploitation--303j">dev article by Ivan Petrov raises some interesting points</a>. They emphasize:</p><blockquote><p>What I have learned and forgotten and re-learned is that the power NOT to do (negative potency) seems to be the only weapon.</p></blockquote><p>This at least we can take to heart by filtering out many actions. We can also try to move away from "outside" areas of (work) focus and focus on our own values and vision.</p><h2 id="trial-period">Trial Period</h2><p>For the next month until December 6th, I'm implementing GTD and revisiting its techniques. For me some questions still remain unanswered:</p><ul><li>When to "uncover" the following project "next action"? As soon as a previous one is done? At the daily or weekly review?</li><li>Should I track project "next actions" in the same list of individual "next actions"? Wouldn't this create a lot of extra overhead to copy tasks from files to files?</li><li>Can I effectively attach project and action reference material with my bare-bones plain-text system? nvUltra doesn't have support to easily attach images or other files.</li><li>Should I keep some references available for all completed actions for later reference?</li><li>Are the tickler files something I can implement digitally? Should I use it for habits and routines?</li><li>Will I have the discipline to postpone work tasks (that often overwhelm my todo list)?</li><li>Should I copy information from other tracking tools that I use with others, e.g. JIRA?</li><li>How exactly to keep track of deadlines (with tickler files or also in projects)?</li><li>Should I handle personal or professional tasks differently after all?</li><li>What are my higher horizons like "areas of responsibility", "objectives", "vision" and "purpose"?</li></ul><h2 id="references">References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://forum.gettingthingsdone.com/">Official GTD Forum</a></li></ul><h3 id="overview%2Fintroduction">Overview/Introduction</h3><ul><li><a href="https://hamberg.no/gtd">GTD in 15 minutes</a></li><li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done</a></li><li><a href="https://www.43folders.com/2004/09/08/getting-started-with-getting-things-done">Merlin Mann's Intro with further links</a></li></ul><h3 id="references-2">References</h3><ul><li><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190602235428/http://wiki.43folders.com:80/index.php/GTD">Merlin Mann's wiki via Wayback Machine</a></li></ul><h3 id="scientific-evaluation">Scientific Evaluation</h3><ul><li><a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/Papers/GTD-cognition.pdf">"Getting Things Done: The Science behind Stress-Free Productivity"</a></li></ul></article></div>]]>

  <blockquote>
<p>Mr. Bezos. I’m all in favor of a clean fulfillment center, but tell me: Why do you sweep? Why do you not instead eliminate the source of dirt? - Unknown “insultant”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Does DevOps pass the “so what?” test? When you start to follow the history of DevOps from Agile, Lean, TOS, TQM, TPS, and beyond; doesn’t it lead to plain old critical thinking? Is it anything special? If it’s so simple, if anyone can do it, then why on earth would the worlds richest person <a href="https://youtu.be/O4MtQGRIIuA?t=1250">pay an “insultant” to teach him</a>? Jeff seems to understand that eliminating waste is important, that you should never pass a defect down the line, but he seems to discard the sweeping question as too abstract, and not useful.</p>
<p>Las Cruces Public Schools (LCPS) may be a perfect example of an organization that’s proud of their ability to <a href="https://www.lcsun-news.com/story/news/education/lcps/2020/11/14/las-cruces-public-schools-what-ransomware-attack-taught-us/6296955002/">scale up sweeping operations in response to a ransomware incident</a>. Why are they so proud of their investment of resources, to deal with ransomware? <a href="http://www.lcps.net/district-overview/">How does that support their mission</a>? Who’s their customer? Ransomware? If DevOps is just critical thinking and LCPS’ value statement is “<a href="http://www.lcps.net/district-overview/">our expectation is that our schools are diverse, equitable, and provide opportunities for the development of critical thinking and democratic ideals</a>”, then shouldn’t we hold them accountable for critical thinking?</p>
<p>Nobody gravitates towards DevOps when everything is working. DevOps isn’t valuable in environments where waste is cheap, it’s valuable where waste isn’t cheap. I’d have to think it’s valuable in any public school system that’s struggling to meet demand within their budget. Maybe it’s too late to help LCPS avoid ransomware, but maybe we can help another school system through a little critical thinking exercise.</p>
<p>Most of what people assume is “DevOps” is just repackaged teaching from an Isreali physicist who wrote a book for the business world in 1984. That book, The Goal, <a href="https://slate.com/business/2012/06/the-goal-eli-goldratts-gripping-thriller-about-operations-theory.html">is still popular in business schools</a>. If there’s one thing Eliyahu Goldratt, the author of The Goal, consistently talks about in all of his teaching, it’s understanding cause and effect. Goldratt advocates for the use of what he calls <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_reality_tree_(theory_of_constraints)">Current Reality Tree</a> (CRT) to map out the cause and effect of a problem, the conflict, and where to focus resources on resolution.</p>
<p>Let’s try it out with Ransomware, it may look something like this if we simply map out the cause and effect relationships of what we know about a <a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/">ransomware incident</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-1.png" alt="simple cause and effect"></p>
<p>Make sense? Now let’s look at a full current reality tree, where we go beyond the ransomware incident, and start to look at how a ransomware opportunity was created.</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-2.png" alt="full crt">
<a href="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-2.png">Full Image</a></p>
<p>It balloons out when we start to understand all the vectors of how they get on our network, and what they do, once they get there.</p>
<p>Vectors:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://thedfirreport.com/2020/11/05/ryuk-speed-run-2-hours-to-ransom/">Phishing</a></li>
<li><a href="https://blog.malwarebytes.com/security-world/business-security-world/2018/08/protect-rdp-access-ransomware-attacks/">Perimeter System: Compromised Credentials</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/black-kingdom-ransomware-hacks-networks-with-pulse-vpn-flaws/">Perimeter System: Missing Patch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Once they get on the network they’ll deploy a <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/09/24/cobalt_strike_cisco_talos/">command and control</a> (C&amp;C) tool that enables them to drop additional tools and start hunting domain admins. They’ll search for servers or computers <a href="https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound">where they can login, and where the domain admin is logged in</a>. Once they find that system they grab either the domain admin’s password, or their session information (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pass_the_hash">just as good as a password</a>), then it’s game over. They now have keys to the kingdom and can delete backups and encrypt systems.</p>
<p>Now that you know how it works, and the cause and effect: Did LCPS eliminate the source of dirt?</p>
<p>This is the only statement that covers what they learned, and how they changed:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Since then, we have installed firewalls, updated our systems, invested in our teachers and improved our infrastructure so we can protect ourselves.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If we go back to our current reality tree we can ask:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does a firewall address the conflict points? It’s not clear if they’re talking about a new fancy next-gen perimeter firewall, improved network segregation, or host firewalls. Segregation and host firewalls could help if they prevent the bad actor from logging into a shared system where domain admin is logged in.</li>
<li>Was the problem updated systems? Possible vector if they’re not patching, but it doesn’t address the core conflict.</li>
<li>Invested in our teachers and improved our infrastructure. Great. Keep it up, but it still doesn’t address the core conflict.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is the core conflict:</p>
<p><img src="https://ericalexander.org/20201115-crt-3.png" alt="core conflict"></p>
<p>The number of domain admins is the core conflict. It’s rarely necessary to have any domain admins, but most organizations have much more than zero when it’s easier to give somebody domain admin access, than it is to take the time to give them only the access they need to do their job. Plain old Least Privilege. Plain old <a href="https://www.cisecurity.org/controls/controlled-use-of-administrative-privileges/">#4 on the CIS Top 20 security controls</a>.</p>
<p>Did LCPS go back and fix the core conflict, or are they still passing a defect downline? What should they have done prior to the Ransomware breach? What can you do now? Evaluate your blast radius. Your InfoSec and/or IT teams should be following the advice of <a href="https://adsecurity.org/">adsecurity.org</a>. They should be running tools like <a href="https://github.com/PlumHound/PlumHound">Plumhound</a> or <a href="https://www.guardicore.com/infectionmonkey/">Infection Monkey</a> to understand and reduce blast radius.</p>
<p>You don’t have to be an IT or InfoSec expert to get a glimpse into your ransomware risk. You’re at less risk, possibly near zero, if your organization isn’t using Active Directory; but if they are, you can run the powershell below from your computer to evaluate blast radius.</p>
<pre><code># This will install AD tools on Windows 10
Add-WindowsCapability -Online -Name Rsat.ActiveDirectory.DS-LDS.Tools~~~~0.0.1.0
# This will list all domain admins
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Domain Admins" -Recursive | %{Get-ADUser -Identity $_.distinguishedName -properties *} | Select Name, Enabled, LastLogonDate, logonCount, PasswordLastSet
# This will list all enterprise admins
Get-ADGroupMember -Identity "Enterprise Admins" -Recursive | %{Get-ADUser -Identity $_.distinguishedName -properties *} | Select Name, Enabled, LastLogonDate, logonCount, PasswordLastSet
</code></pre>
<p>That powershell will list user accounts ransomware teams are interested in, the ones they’ll go after once they land on your network. Ideally that list is zero. It’s not zero? Shocker! How about passwords? Are they being rotated quickly? Ideally every 7 days or less. What’s the logon count look like? Is it in the hundreds? Ouch, somebody is running around with scissors.</p>
<p>Concerned? Send that output to your IT or InfoSec teams. Ask them if they understand the advice of adsecurity.org or Plumhound. Maybe they have it under control, but maybe they need a little poking to remind them it’s important.</p>
<p>Interested in learning more about the so what of DevOps, and how it applies to Information Security? I’m writing a book. Send me an <a href="https://ericalexander.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#5e3a3b28312e2d703c3131351e3b2c373d3f323b263f303a3b2c70312c39612d2b3c343b3d2a633c313135783f332e653c313a2763123b2a7b6c6e333b7b6c6e353031297b6c6e29363b307b6c6e372a792d7b6c6e312b2a">email</a> or connect on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ericalexanderorg">LinkedIn</a> if you’re interested in the book.</p>

The most important update is obviously the announcement from Pfizer that they had developed a vaccine offering ‘90% protection’ against COVID-19. The stock market reacted accordingly, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average opening up 1,500 points on Monday morning, and the Russell 2000 Small Cap Value Index rocketing 7% higher for the&nbsp;<em>day.&nbsp;</em>Now, the ironic part of all this is that the positive vaccine news is coming at a time when we are seeing exponential growth in cases around the country. On Friday the United States hit another daily record for COVID cases at 184,514 reported cases.</p>
<p>However, knowing that there is now a light at the end of the tunnel I want to use today’s post to focus on some of the silver linings and unintended&nbsp;<em>positive</em> consequences of past crises, crashes, and darkest hours in history. While there is much to be negative about in a time of pandemics and politics, there will be certainly be knock-on effects that have a positive effect on society, markets, and business.</p>
<p>For instance, a recent example that was pointed out to me was the return on investment for London’s considerable investment in the city’s infamous 19th century sewage system, as described below:</p>
<p>London was a rapidly growing city with a population that had reached two million by 1840, having doubled since the beginning of the century and it had a big sewage problem. Before the construction of proper sewers, most of London’s sewage was recycled as fertilizer. Individual houses had cesspools (though often these were just the cellars). The solid waste or ‘night-soil’ was collected from these by well-paid ‘nightmen’ (they were only allowed to work at night) who transported it to the market gardens surrounding the city. The wastewater either seeped into the ground or flowed through the streets into the old natural rivers, which had become public sewers. These all eventually flowed out into the River Thames.</p>
<h4>London’s Water Supply Problem</h4>
<p>Supplying clean drinking water was another serious problem. Some of London’s water came from shallow wells within the city and was delivered by the bucketful. More prosperous areas had piped water provided by private water companies from springs in the hills around London or, most dangerously, from the Thames itself.</p>
<p>The invention of the flush toilet or water closet at the end of the eighteenth century made things worse. Well-off households that could afford a proper water supply could now dispense with a smelly cesspool and simply flush all their waste away – and out into the Thames.</p>
<h4><strong>Cholera Arrives</strong></h4>
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/sites/www.open.edu.openlearn/files/ole_images/the_silent_highwayman_800.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="460"></p><p>Death rows on the polluted River Thames in a cartoon from Punch Magazine (1858)</p></div>
<p><strong>Cholera is a deadly disease. The primary symptom is acute diarrhea, which drains the body of nutrients and fluids. In 1831, there was a global outbreak. It had originated in India but had spread across Europe and arrived in Britain. This outbreak killed over 6,000 people in London. At the time, the cause of the disease was a mystery. The link between the disease and the contamination of drinking water by human sewage was suspected by some. It was obvious that Thames water, when seen through a microscope, was far from clean and it was a subject of wonderful campaigning cartoons in the London newspapers and the satirical magazine Punch.</strong></p>
<p>However, at this time the dominant opinion was the ‘miasmatic theory’, that the disease was spread by ‘fould air’. It wasn’t the polluted water that was deadly, but the very smell of it…</p>
<p>In 1848 the government had established a Metropolitan Commission of Sewers. After issuing a general invitation to engineers to submit proposals for dealing with London’s sewage, an engineer with a background in land drainage methods, Joseph Bazalgette, was hired. In 1855, the Metropolitan Local Management Bill was put through Parliament. This attempted to centralise some aspects of the administration of London. It created the <strong>Metropolitan Board of Works</strong>, one of whose duties was to ‘make such sewers and works as they may think necessary for preventing all and any part of the sewage of the Metropolis from flowing into the River Thames in or near the Metropolis’.</p>
<p>Joseph Bazalgette was appointed chief engineer for the Board of Works. He took his duties very seriously, reviewing 137 different proposals and producing a detailed plan for a scheme of intercepting sewers collecting London’s sewage and discharging it into the Thames 10 miles further downstream (which could be interpreted as being ‘near the Metropolis’)…</p>
<p>Bazalgette’s scheme was an extraordinary feat of engineering. It involved the construction of major new ‘intercepting sewers’ that would collect sewage from the existing piecemeal array of sewers and move it down river. On the north bank, sewage would be carried eastwards as far as Beckton, eight miles east of St Paul’s Cathedral, to be stored and then discharged on the outgoing tide. On the south bank, the sewage would flow as far as Crossness, two miles further downstream, where the same would happen.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>Most of the scheme was very carefully designed to flow by gravity, but at critical points, all of the sewage would have to be pumped to a higher level using huge steam pumps. Those installed at Deptford in 1864 were at the time the largest ever built. One of these pumping stations was at Abbey Mills, where much of the sewage from London’s East End had to be pumped up into the enormous Northern Outfall Sewer which flowed across the marshland towards the discharge point at Beckton. This was a prestige project and the buildings above ground, such as the pumping stations, were lavishly decorated.</p>
<div><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.open.edu/openlearn/sites/www.open.edu.openlearn/files/ole_images/crossness_pumping_station_-_800_2.jpg" alt="" width="657" height="378"></p><p>The restored interior of the pumping station at Crossness</p></div>
<p>Bazalgette replaced 165 miles of old sewers as well as constructing 1100 miles of new ones. It required the excavation of 3.5 million cubic yards of earth by hand – there were no mechanical diggers at the time. The construction consumed 318 million bricks and demand was such that it forced up the price of them in London by about 50%. The need for more bricklayers meant that wages had to be increased from 5 shillings (25 pence) per day to 6 shillings (30 pence) or more. It consumed nearly a million cubic yards of concrete. A special mill was built at Crossness to produce this, together with a railway to distribute it</p>
<p>The project made pioneering use of Portland cement, which was water resistant, rather than conventional lime mortar. Because its manufacturing process was so new, Bazalgette insisted on a draconian regime of quality control, with every batch being tested before it was used. The southern drainage scheme was completed in 1865 and the northern one in 1868. Most of the pumping stations were opened by Royalty, and some of the enormous sewage pumps were even named after members of the royal family.</p>

<p>While the project was an incredibly costly one, we can only imagine the impact that this improved sewage system had on the city in terms of preventing widespread and frequent cholera outbreaks going forward. Like the theme of today’s post, this positive outcome stemmed from a dark period in London that was filled with disease and death. This impressive engineering feat offered a real silver lining.</p>
<p>Now let’s dive in!</p>

<p>For those that survived, the Black Death was a godsend for serfs in Europe as the decimated labor supply suddenly gave them some leverage at the bargaining table with Lords of vast manors that suddenly had little to no laborers to till their land. Despite the atrocity that was the bubonic plague, the dissolution of serfdom across large swathes of Europe offers a silver lining.</p>
<p><em>‘After the Black Death, serfdom disappeared in Western Europe while making a resurgence in Eastern Europe. What explains this difference? I argue that serfdom was against the interests of the sovereign and was only imposed when the nobility, most of whom needed serfdom to maintain their economic and social standing, had leverage to impose their will. One way the nobility gained this power was through financing the military. Using data from the fourteenth to through the eighteenth centuries, I show that serfdom was imposed in areas where sovereigns had few other resources to pay for war or defense. This paper addresses the causes of a historical institution that scholars from Moore (1966) to Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) have argued played an important role in the development, or lack thereof, of democracy and long-term economic growth.’</em></p>

<p>July 12<sup>th</sup>, 2020</p>
<p>Believe it or not, Twitter can be a very useful source of information and news. Or, it can waste your time and make you sad. It’s all in how you use it. Here I’ll show you how to make Twitter work for you, instead of against you.</p>
<p>There are many things you can do to turn Twitter into a useful tool, but there is one central concept that is more important than everything else combined. If you absorb and apply this idea, you will transform Twitter from a source of pointless irritation into a veritable lifehack.</p>
<p>The secret is to completely separate the concepts of <em>following</em> and <em>reading</em>.</p>
<p>Let me explain: the person finally giving in and signing up for Twitter looks for instruction and advice on how to get started and how to use it. This advice, either from helpful writers on the internet or from Twitter itself, goes something like this:</p>
<p><strong>Look for people who are interesting to you;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Follow them;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Observe your timeline, where their tweets will appear.</strong></p>
<p>If you follow this advice, you will be doing it wrong. This is the exact opposite of how you should use Twitter. The problems with this approach are:</p>
<p>You may see the tweets not always in the order in which they were tweeted, but in some other order that Twitter creates for you;</p>
<p>You will see “promoted tweets” interpolated between the tweets you signed up to see. This is paid advertising;</p>
<p>You will see random other things you didn’t ask for;</p>
<p>You will be inundated with “suggestions” from Twitter about people to follow, trending topics to keep on top of, and other irrelevant nonsense;</p>
<p>You will never see some of the tweets tweeted by the people you are following. They simply will not appear in your timeline;</p>
<p>Everyone can see the list of people you follow. You may or may not want this;</p>
<p>You will discover that the people you followed because you admire them have nothing interesting to say, only tweeting cat pictures and worn-out memes.</p>
<p>In short, you will be fed tons of stuff you never signed up for, and not get what you wanted.</p>
<p>You can’t turn <em>any</em> of this off. Twitter lets you tell it that you want to see <em>less</em> of some kinds of things, but there are no actual settings to turn off advertising or suggestions about fascinating hashtags.</p>
<p>The first step in fixing Twitter for yourself is to understand what following is really for. You don’t follow an account because you want to read their tweets. Twitter is “social media”, and following is a social signal. When you follow someone you are declaring that you approve of that person. Whether or not this is what you intended, this is how your decision to follow someone will be interpreted. If you are, for example, a journalist researching neo-Nazis, and part of your research involves tracking what they are saying on Twitter, you may not want to be seen as endorsing these people.</p>
<p>Obviously, you may want to read certain people’s tweets without following them. And you can! Twitter allows you to create private <em>lists</em> of accounts that you can track without following. You can see all their tweets scroll by without appearing to have endorsed them. The composition of your private lists, and even their existence, will remain secret. The people you add won’t know you’re adding them, nor that you’re seeing their tweets, unless you choose to interact with them. In addition, the tweets will appear in chronological order, with no interpolated advertising nor any other junk, unlike in your timeline. But you must not forget to mark the lists as private. In the picture below, one arrow points to the widget for creating a new list, and another points to the all-important checkbox for making the list private. You should only make private lists; there is no reason to make public lists, and, in fact, some people object to being placed in them (for some reason that escapes me, but behavior on Twitter is weird in many ways).</p>
<p>&nbsp;<img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/newlist.png" alt="Making a list"></p>
<p>Make as many lists as you want, as fine-grained or as general as you think will be useful to you. You can have an astronomy list, or a list just with people who talk about astrophotography with iPhones. You can make a list for local news, and one for international news. You can put accounts in more than one list, so the exact composition of a list is not a crucial decision. This is how you separate the concepts of reading and following. You follow when you want to let people know you are following (hi, Mom), and you want everyone else to know, too. When you become famous and have a million followers, you can follow others to amplify their signals. Until then, follow to encourage, to lend support, and to let others know where you stand. If you also want to read the tweets of someone you follow (and you might not), put that person in one of your lists in addition. Your followee’s tweets will also appear in your timeline, but you won’t see them there, because <em>you will never look at your timeline</em>. Of course, you literally don’t have to follow a single person. Following is public. Aggregating accounts into lists is your private business.</p>
<p>Lists become most useful when there is an interface for conveniently seeing what’s on them. The regular Twitter clients are not very good for this, but Twitter has an alternative client that is made for it. Use <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-use-tweetdeck">TweetDeck</a>. It divides your twitterverse into columns. Each column can contain the tweets from one of your lists; in addition, you can create columns that track search terms, individual accounts, hashtags, your notifications, your direct messages, and more. By default, it will have a column with your timeline, but you can delete that, because, as I hope is clear by now, your timeline is a waste of time.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://lee-phillips.org/howtotwitter/tweetdeck.jpg" alt="Tweetdeck. Picture by Ruben Schade">
</figure>
<p>This interface, although not perfect, helps a great deal in making Twitter more useful. If you keep it open, it can be a low-distraction way of monitoring recent tweets from low-traffic lists. You can delete columns you don’t care about today, and add them back in tomorrow.</p>
<p>Lists and search terms, combined with the avoidance of the timeline and the use of TweetDeck, already turns Twitter from a cesspool with advertising into a useful news feed. But by combining this with a few other practices, you can make Twitter even better.</p>
<p>First, control yourself. Use the platform as a source of timely information, and as a way to be helpful with others by offering information or advice. Do not, ever, no matter how strongly you feel that someone is <em><a href="https://xkcd.com/386/">wrong</a></em>, get into an argument on Twitter. I have often failed to heed this advice myself; do what I say, not what I do. Twitter can be a fantastic source of news from all over the world; it is often the first place you will hear about something, and sometimes the only place. It can be a very useful platform for receiving and offering technical information, such as links to papers. I recently contributed a scrap of code, in a tweet, for a maintainer of the venerable linux utility <code>curl</code>; the result is in <a href="https://github.com/curl/stats/commit/ac6ae20082fd5e61aa7122b1d4c6030e48ba52a9">this commit</a>. This kind of interaction is satisfying, but trying to have an actual discussion or argument never is, because it is impossible to do with this platform. At best, you will score points against someone not as clever as you; and that and $2.50 will get you a cup of coffee.</p>
<p>Next, use the muting function. Even members of your carefully curated lists will sometimes decide to spend a week talking incessantly about their new sneakers. Mute them until they get over it. <a href="https://lee-phillips.org/makeTwitterBetter/">Mute words and phrases</a>, too, for those times when a bunch of people are talking about something that you don’t care to see in your feeds (NBA playoffs, political debates, you name it).</p>

                The Guinness Book of World Records says that Deinococcus radiodurans is the worldâ€™s most extremophile bacterium. As its name suggests, this bacterium can deal with radiation. It has even been found on the inside walls of nuclear reactors.
            </p>

            <div><h3>Fascination with these survivors</h3>

<p>Scientists have been fascinated by these tough bacteria for years. The <a href="https://www.micropia.nl/en/discover/microbiology/microbes/">microbes</a> can deal with extreme cold, lack of water, vacuums and high acidity. And how is it that it can also withstand extreme radiation despite the fact that radiation does not occur in the natural world?</p>

<h3>Back-up against mutations</h3>

<p>Since they started researching its genome, scientists have discovered various mechanisms in the bacterium which protect it against mutation. <em>D. radiodurans</em> has within it, for example, multiple copies of its genome. If just one of these remains unchanged, it can survive. <em>D. radiodurans</em> also has an extremely efficient <a href="https://www.micropia.nl/en/discover/microbiology/dna/">DNA</a> repair mechanism.</p>

<h3>Learning from bacteria</h3>

<p>Genetic mutations have major consequences for mankind. Human cells only have one copy of the genome and do not have <em>D. radioduransâ€™</em> quick and efficient DNA repair mechanism. It is possible that we could learn a lot from this bacterium. For example, research into the micro-organism could lead to medical applications to protect people better against the terrible results of radiation poisoning.</p>

November 15, 2020 | https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.3/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.3/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a while since we released v0.2 of <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a> and that I have posted about it <a href="https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.2-and-future">here</a>.</p>
<p>In that post I gave a view about the potential future of <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a>. We finally released v0.3 and the future is now the default.</p>
<p>Just listing all the changes we made would probably be quite boring and therefore I want to create a neat animation along the way and explain some parts of the awesome Fourier series.</p>
<p>I think quite a lot of people have heard about the Fourier series but didn't fully understand it. I'm quite sure I'm still part of that crew. Others might not know what I'm talking about and I don't know whether it's a good idea to read this post as your introduction but I'll give my best.</p>
<p>Additionally, I envy the latter group because Fourier series is something extremely fascinating.</p>
<p>This blog is mostly for readers who are interested in <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a> and JuliaLang so I'll start with the changes we did for v0.3.</p>

<h2 id="changes_in_v03_on_a_higher_level"><a href="#changes_in_v03_on_a_higher_level">Changes in v0.3 on a higher level</a></h2>
<p>We finally have a version for transposing a matrix or I prefer to say general morphing capabilities as transposing only works sometimes 😄 Nevertheless, I'll make a post about that shortly after this one. (Okay let's say in November... hopefully)</p>
<p>Something that unfortunately didn't make it into v0.3 though is the ability to have layers but we are getting there. We conceptually have a plan for it but haven't found the time to code it yet. There might be also some tweaks to the concept.</p>
<p>The next point from the list of <a href="https://opensourc.es/blog/javis-v0.2-and-future">the previous post</a> is "Renaming stuff".</p>
<p>We did rename quite a few things and I hope a bit that you either haven't used v0.2 of Javis 😂 OR that you are adaptable and are happy with the changes we made.</p>
<p>Let's just list a few of them:</p>
<p><code>Action</code> and <code>SubAction</code> are now called <code>Object</code> and <code>Action</code> respectively. This is due to the fact that the <code>Action</code> before describes more the object itself and doesn't have the capability to actually move the object now. It had the option before but we decided to remove it. We did this to simplify the codebase and make the distinction much clearer.</p>
<p>Next up we simplified <code>BackgroundAction</code> to <code>Background</code>. No more comments on that 😄</p>
<p>Finally we removed <code>Translation</code>, <code>Rotation</code> and <code>Scaling</code> and introduced <code>anim_translate</code>, <code>anim_rotate</code>/<code>anim_rotate_around</code> as well as <code>anim_scale</code> because working with functions instead of structs seems to be more natural and the naming specifies that we do some animation here and not a static translation.</p>
<p>Our last mayor change was to get rid of the <code>javis</code> function and the weird design I started with. It was a huge mess with these weird arrays.</p>
<p>One now defines the video, objects and actions just line by line and renders the video in the end.</p>
<p>Just to give you an example</p>
<pre><code>using Javis
function ground(args...)
    background("black")
    sethue("white")
end

video = Video(800, 400)
Background(1:100, ground)
ball = Object((args...)-&gt;circle(O, 100, :fill), Point(-500, 0))
rolling = Action(anim_translate(Point(1000, 0)))
act!(ball, rolling)

render(video; pathname="rolling_ball.gif")</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/rolling_ball.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/rolling_ball.gif" alt="Rolling ball 1"></a></p><p>I think one can clearly see what is defined where besides maybe a few quirks... 😄</p>
<p>The <code>circle</code> function takes the center point and the radius as well as the action (here <code>:fill</code>). Why do I define it at the center center? I could have defined it at <code>Point(-500, 0)</code> but I like to think of objects being centered and then move them around. Maybe it's just me but it has the advantage that it's easy to scale objects correctly and makes rotations easier.</p>
<p>It's not really possible to see a rotation of a circle (currently we don't rotate it). How about adding something to the circle such that we can differentiate between a rotating circle and a moving one.</p>
<pre><code>using Javis
function ground(args...)
    background("black")
    sethue("white")
end

function my_circle(args...)
    circle(O, 100, :fill)
    sethue("black")
    line(O, Point(100, 0), :stroke)
end

video = Video(800, 400)
Background(1:100, ground)
ball = Object(my_circle, Point(-500, 0))
translating = Action(anim_translate(Point(1000, 0)))
rotating = Action(anim_rotate(0.0, 2*2π))
act!(ball, [translating, rotating])

render(video; pathname="rolling_ball_2.gif")</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/rolling_ball_2.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/rolling_ball_2.gif" alt="Rolling ball 2"></a></p><p>That one is clearly rolling. Okay I might have gotten a bit distracted with that one 😄 but we can reuse that for later.</p>
<p>Now in v0.2 it would be quite hard to make the line inside the circle grow longer with time I think. Actually this was possible with v0.2.2 but I haven't written about it yet so this is the time of <strong>change</strong>.</p>
<pre><code>using Javis
function ground(args...)
    background("black")
    sethue("white")
end

function my_circle(args...; line_length=0)
    circle(O, 100, :fill)
    sethue("black")
    setline(2)
    line(O, Point(line_length, 0), :stroke)
end

video = Video(800, 400)
Background(1:100, ground)
ball = Object(my_circle, Point(-500, 0))
translating = Action(anim_translate(Point(1000, 0)))
rotating = Action(anim_rotate(0.0, 2*2π))
changing_len = Action(change(:line_length, 0 =&gt; 100))
act!(ball, [translating, rotating, changing_len])

<p>We basically try to combine simple waves (sine waves) and add them up to create a square wave.</p>
<p>Importantly there is nothing special about the square function. This works with every function. One just needs to add quite a lot of the functions together. For the actual result we need infinitely many. </p>
<h3 id="lets_quickly_change_to_2d"><a href="#lets_quickly_change_to_2d">Let's quickly change to 2D</a></h3>
<p>I actually want to draw something in 2D though instead of this 1D function. 2D is much more interesting when you ask me.</p>
<p>BTW this entire idea of using <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a> to visualize the Fourier series came from <a href="https://github.com/ric-cioffi">Riccardo Cioffi</a>, who I like to call the first user of <a href="https://github.com/Wikunia/Javis.jl">Javis</a>. He also coded it himself without us knowing about this until we saw <a href="https://discourse.julialang.org/t/fourier-draws-the-julia-logo/47309">his post</a> about it on the JuliaLang discourse. Please check it out!</p>
<p>It was done using a previous version of Javis so the code doesn't work anymore.</p>
<p>I'll wait here for a couple of minutes while you enjoy his stunning visualization.</p>
<p>Let's start with some building blocks that make sense to understand the Fourier series in 2D. I'll start with circles and complex numbers.</p>
<p>In general I'll basically go through the stuff that Grant Sanderson explained beautifully on his YouTube Channel 3blue1brown <a href="https://youtu.be/r6sGWTCMz2k">But what is a Fourier series?</a>. There are some more references at the end of this post 😉</p>
<p>You've seen some circles before but let's have a look at how to work with them using complex numbers.</p>
<p>I here refer to the usage of the formula</p><p>
\[
e^{2\pi i t}
\]
</p><p>where t is our variable ranging from <code>0</code> to <code>1</code> and <code>i</code> is the imaginary unit.</p>
<p>This therefore computes a complex number when we give it some \(t\). We plot that by simply using the real component of our complex number on the x-axis and the complex component on the y-axis.</p>
<p>In this visualization the circle is drawn up to a certain point at each frame and completes the circle with <code>t=1.00</code></p>
<p><a href="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/circle.gif"><img src="https://opensourc.es/assets/blog/2020-11-12-javis-v0.3/images/circle.gif" alt="Circle path"></a></p><p>This is just something to keep in mind for the rest of the post. </p>
<p>Next up we start with a shape let's say a star that we want to draw using circles rotating around circles as circles are the sine waves of 2D space.</p>
<p>I think this is best explained visually so I'll show you what we are trying to achieve first and then show you how to get there. </p>
<h3 id="what_we_want_to_create"><a href="#what_we_want_to_create">What we want to create</a></h3>
<p>This is kind of what we want to achieve but we will have a look at more complicated shapes later. For that we will use more circles though and then it's hard to grasp what's going on.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Over the years I have observed that many engineers tend to attribute much of the success or failure of a company to the technical choices made. I know I’m often guilty of this too. And while it is often justified, I would argue that for the vast majority of startups out there, the choice of programming language, framework, or even database doesn’t matter that much. This seems especially true during the early stages.</p><h2>Through the engineering lens</h2><p>This perception is understandable, we as engineers tend to look at the world from a specific lens, and are often biased by what we know best. Our daily activities may include things such as debugging CI pipelines, implementing new features, pairing with colleagues, or migrating the always present legacy codebase. The environment that surrounds us makes it easy to believe that it all boils down to those things that we see and understand. It’s an illusion that makes us feel like we’re fully in control of what makes or breaks the product.</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, it can be a huge advantage for many companies to make their product 3x more efficient than competitors, or to have elegant, composable code. But you might be focusing on the wrong problems if nobody cares about the product you’re actually building, and sooner or later your business will hit this wall.</p><p>I’m not saying that software doesn’t matter. A solid foundation for your startup goes a long way. If investing in this allows you to build better features faster than your competitors, more power to you. But finding the right balance is highly dependent on what you’re trying to solve and the resources you have at hand. There’s no right or wrong way to do it, and as usual, it mainly comes down to tradeoffs.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/lenses.png" alt="Different lenses"></p><h2>Boring makes me happy</h2><p>I believe aiming for a healthy balance of risk vs reward when it comes to your technical choices is something to strive for. In particular, if it decreases the chances you get stuck on the wrong problems down the road.</p><p>This is why I have come to appreciate ideas such as <a href="https://mcfunley.com/choose-boring-technology">Choose Boring Technology</a>. This is often interpreted as “picking old technologies over newer ones”, but it doesn’t necessarily mean that. For me, this comes down to using proven technologies in which the ways it can fail are mostly known, but occasionally experimenting with different, possibly newer tools that might suit me better.</p><p>Maybe you want to gain more experience by using the latest framework or programming language, or you just want to have some fun. You do what makes you happy. But if you’re trying to make a decision to increase the odds that your product or business will succeed, it’s worth stepping back and considering your options.</p><p>For me, mainly choosing software that has been around for longer is not about it being boring or older, it’s about the fact that the ways in which it fails are better known. There are fewer unknowns for you to deal with and this maximizes your chances of actually shipping the project.</p><p>For example the other day I had an issue with my Django app, and a quick search led me to tens of answers to this problem in various forums and websites. It took me at most 10 minutes to get back on track and that was the end of this issue.</p><p>I experienced the exact opposite a few years ago with a popular, but not so battle-tested Scala library my team had been using for a while. We were probably among the first to encounter the issues we were facing, and it seemed nobody had walked down this path before. Maybe it sounds like a fun challenge or a great chance to contribute back to OSS (which I’m happy to), but once you solve it, do your customers really care about it? How many days, weeks, or even months are you willing to invest in such issues? In my case, I’d rather use that time to ship new features or improve the existing ones.</p><h2>Proven tech vs new tools</h2><p>I try to follow an 80/20 distribution when it comes to my choice of tools. This means my stack consists of about 80% software I already know well, but I do allow myself 20% of the stack to explore tech I have less experience with. The exact ratio is not what’s important here, it’s more the fact that you should lean towards using proven technologies.</p><p>This also resonates with how <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit">Multi-armed bandits</a> work. You try to maximize your expected gain by taking advantage of what worked well in the past, while sometimes exploring new things to avoid missing out on a possible goldmine.</p><p><img src="https://panelbear.com/static/img/blog/bandits.png" alt="Balance new vs proven"></p><p>A more recent example of mine is <a href="https://panelbear.com/">Panelbear</a>, it started as an embarrassingly simple Django app with no charts, all metrics were rendered on a plain HTML table, and all data was stored on a SQLite database. Took literally a weekend to get it up and running including manually deploying to a $5/mo VM. Low risk and high reward for my needs at the time.</p><p>Fast forward and as I added more features and began handling more page views for various websites, I started to notice that the codebase could use some refactoring. It also became increasingly repetitive to do things like deploying to new instances, issuing SSL certs, and keeping the DNS records up to date in case the IP address of my instances changed.</p><p>As a second iteration, I upgraded to a docker-compose setup plus lots of glue code. But soon enough I found myself reinventing what other tools already do well. There are multiple ways to solve each of these pain points, but in my case, it came down to using a tool I am very familiar with from my full-time job: Kubernetes.</p><p>Yes, I am well aware Kubernetes is an absolute overkill for a lot of projects out there, and I could have gotten away with a more traditional solution. But it allowed me to simplify the operational aspects tremendously, and I feel comfortable working with it after having the pleasure of putting down multiple production fires for my employer over the years. That’s why I wouldn’t bindly recommend it to everyone. Do what you know best.
As an added benefit, it also made it trivial when I migrated from DigitalOcean to Linode, and most recently to AWS (each migration took mostly an evening of changing my Terraform files and deploying them - I’m being serious). But that’s for another post.</p><p>Another case in which it paid off once again, was when I wanted to experiment with using Clickhouse for data ingestion and the aggregation queries. It took me less than 10 minutes to write a basic deployment manifest and have it up and running. This included automated SSL certs, in-cluster service discovery, and unified logging/monitoring out of the box. It was a huge win since it allowed me to try things out faster than before.</p><p>Even better, I can deploy any container and operate it the exact same way as I deploy anything else on my cluster. Need more volume storage with zero downtime? It’s a simple manifest change, commit and deploy. Same thing when I needed Redis for caching, I was up and running in minutes, without increasing my costs or adding operational complexity.</p><h2>Focus on shipping</h2><p>My point is, I moved into these technologies as the pain with the previous solution was higher than dealing with the new tech. But more importantly, it helped me ship features even faster to my customers while reducing the operational overhead for me.</p><p>If I had started with the more advanced setup from day one, I might have lost all motivation before I would have had the first version of Panelbear. The key is to solve the problems that are getting between you and your goals, not potential issues you believe one day will be yours.</p><p>Hope you enjoyed this blog post. I plan on writing more about Panelbear’s tech stack, and lessons learned along the way. So stay tuned!</p></div></div></div>]]>

                <p>The software development world is crowded with different practices, metrics, methodologies, tools and techniques.  But what unites them all?</p>

<p>The Risk-First perspective is that all of these practices and methodologies have at their heart the job of managing different <em>software development risks</em>.  Risk isn’t something that just appears in a report, it actually drives everything we do.</p>

<p>Risk-First is split into three main parts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://riskfirst.org/thinking/Start">Part 1: Thinking Risk-First</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://riskfirst.org/risks/Start">Part 2: The Risk Landscape</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://riskfirst.org/practices/Start">Part 3: Practices</a>  <em>(Under Construction)</em></li>
</ul>

<p>However, if you want a brief overview of what this is all about, the articles in this section give you a short taster.</p>

<p>The ongoing debate over copyright in the digital age is clouded by so many layers of new-age malarkey and overblown, political banner-waving that it’s easy to lose sight of the behavioral realities behind all the self-serving theories of bloggers, legal scholars, corporate interests, and futurists. Take a very common activity like watching movies online via torrents or other sites that enable free viewing (aka piracy).&nbsp; My kids’ generation, growing up around this behavior as a norm, will hear words to describe this kind of movie viewing as contrarily <i>theft</i> or <i>sharing</i>.&nbsp; What are they to make of it?&nbsp; Certainly, I’ve taught them to share and not to steal.&nbsp; For the sake of their cultural and psychological growth, however, I’d suggest for the purposes of discussion, that this kind of media overconsumption is, if nothing else, dumb.</p>
<p>For context, we need to admit that the majority of unlicensed, online movie viewing is done by young, middle-class, generally privileged Americans, who are watching mainstream, Hollywood-produced fare. Search for top movies viewed through torrent sites, for example, and you’ll find that the lists will comprise tentpole films produced by the big studios who represent the part of the industry most vilified for efforts to mitigate piracy. If that hypocrisy is not enough to raise your brows, though, the very nature of these films is then used as a justification for the pirate-enabled viewing in itself. We typically hear some combination of the following:&nbsp; “So much of the mainstream stuff is junk that it doesn’t deserve to be paid for.&nbsp; These films already make millions. I would never pay to see it anyway, so it’s not like they’re losing a sale.”&nbsp; If my own kids presented me with these rationales, we’d have a serious talk because this is corrupt thinking no matter what the law, the technologists, or the economic theories say.</p>
<p>Consolidate these oft-repeated positions into the declarative, first person, and the stupid shines through a little clearer:&nbsp; “I’m going to spend hours of my life watching movies I probably won’t like, but because I expect not to like them, I’m not going to pay for them.”&nbsp; And as a kicker, “I am going to help put money in the pockets of the people who stole the movies in the first place.”&nbsp; Bloggers like Mike Masnick will try to argue the new and bizarre economics of free media; and scholars like Mr. Lessig will argue that there is something intellectually or culturally constraining about “permission culture.” Then, these purely academic theories trickle down to the ears of my kids and their contemporaries, who translate it all into the aforementioned rationale. But as a parent living in the real world, what I’ve just heard my kids say is that they’re shoplifting cartons of potato chips at the corner store, which doesn’t matter because chips aren’t real food anyway.&nbsp; Hence, my kids now have both a moral <i>and</i> a health problem.</p>
<p>With regard to movies (or any creative media) the first thing I’d tell my own children is that their lives are not at all enriched by watching scores of films they probably won’t like. To the contrary, when they make time for media consumption, they should develop a critical sense for what kind films might be worth the investment of their time and attention. What matters is not the fifty films they’ll forget within hours of viewing, but the five this year that will change their lives in some way. It doesn’t matter that the sale for the producers of the tentpole is zero whether my kid watches it through a torrent or doesn’t see it at all; what matters is making the decision that if it isn’t worth paying for, it probably isn’t worth the equally valuable resources of time and attention. In short, it’s not only okay to let some things go, you don’t really have a choice.</p>
<p>It is a valuable component of cultural experience for the individual to pay attention to what kind of art or media affects him and to seek out that which fulfills these emotional connections.&nbsp; Nobody can watch, read, listen to, or experience everything; so there is not only nothing wrong with scarcity, it is an absolute necessity for an individual’s cultural development. Those who promote the idea of abundance as some sort of digital-age renaissance are not really contributing to a more enlightened, more cultured generation so much as they’re breeding a new crop of agitated media junkies. Remove for a moment the questions of legality or creators’ rights, and we’re still living in an era of media obesity and don’t yet know what this means for the future of culture in general.</p>
<p>Many of the filmmakers whose works have touched my life and the lives of my contemporaries were dead before the Internet was even built.&nbsp; We somehow managed to experience their films without this technology and without in any way contributing to IP theft. Through pre-Internet experiences, I have seen motion pictures that I doubt my own children will ever know existed; and still, in over thirty years of loving this medium, I know that there are dozens, if not hundreds, of films that I will not see in my lifetime. This is true for my children as well, despite the overblown promise of technology to put “the world at their fingertips.” So, what I’ll tell my kids is simply this:&nbsp; “You can’t consume it all, you shouldn’t try, and whatever is worth your time is also worth your money.”</p>

This utility is not meant for normal users or even sysadmins. It provides
  unabstracted access to capabilities which are normally handled for the user
  automatically when changing the security policy through GUIs such as Startup
  Disk in macOS Recovery. It is possible to make your system security much
  weaker and therefore easier to compromise using this tool. This tool is not to
  be used in production environments. It is possible to render your system
  unbootable with this tool. It should only be used to understand how the
  security of Apple Silicon Macs works. Use at your own risk!
<p><code>bputil</code> performs actions by calling the
    BootPolicy library. This modifies the security configuration of the system,
    which is stored in a file called the LocalPolicy. This file is digitally
    signed by the Secure Enclave Processor (SEP). The private key which is used
    to sign the LocalPolicy is protected by a separate key which is only
    accessible when a user has put in their password as part of a successful
    authentication. This is why this tool must either have a username and
    password specified on the command line, or via the interactive prompt.</p>
<p>By design, the SEP application which is responsible for making
    changes to the LocalPolicy will inspect the boot state of the main
    Application Processor (AP). It will only allow the below
    security-downgrading operations if it detects that the AP is in the intended
    boot state. When System Integrity Protection (SIP) was first introduced to
    Macs, it was decided that requiring a reboot to macOS Recovery would provide
    intentional friction which would make it harder for malicious software to
    downgrade the system. That precedent is extended here to detect the special
    boot to macOS Recovery via holding the power key at boot time. We refer to
    this as One True Recovery (1TR), and most of the below downgrade options
    will only work when booted into 1TR, not when called from normal macOS. This
    helps ensure that only a physically-present user, not malicious software
    running in macOS, can permanently downgrade the security settings. The below
    CLI options specify what boot environments a downgrade can be performed
    from.</p>
<p>The SEP-signed LocalPolicy is evaluated at boot time by iBoot.
    Configurations within the LocalPolicy change iBoot's behavior, such as
    whether it will require that all boot objects must be signed with metadata
    specific to the particular machine (a "personalized" signature,
    which is the default, and the always-required policy on iOS), or whether it
    will accept "global" signatures which are valid for all units of a
    specific hardware model. The LocalPolicy can also influence other boot or OS
    security behavior as described in the below options.</p>
<dl>
  <dt><a href="#u,"><code id="u,">-u,</code></a>
    <code>--username</code> <var>username</var></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Used to specify the username for a user with access to the
        signing key to authenticate the change.</p>
    <p>If this is specified the below password option is required
        too.</p>
    <p>If this is not specified, an interactive prompt will request
        the username.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#p,"><code id="p,">-p,</code></a>
    <code>--password</code> <var>password</var></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Used to specify the password for a user with access to the
        signing key to authenticate the change.</p>
    <p>If this is specified the above username option is required
        too.</p>
    <p>If this is not specified, an interactive prompt will request
        the password.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#v,"><code id="v,">-v,</code></a>
    <code>--vuid</code>
    <var>AABBCCDD-EEFF-0011-2233-4455667788990</var></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Specify the APFS Volume Group UUID of the OS intended to have
        its policy changed. If no option is specified, the default value will be
        set to the APFS Volume Group UUID of the running OS. The Volume Group
        UUID for a given OS can be found with 'diskutil apfs
      listVolumeGroups'.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#l,"><code id="l,">-l,</code></a>
    <code>--debug-logging</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Enables verbose logging to assist in debugging any issues
        associated with changing the policy.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#d,"><code id="d,">-d,</code></a>
    <code>--display-policy</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Display the detailed contents of the LocalPolicy. This will
        show specific 4-character "tags" in the Apple Image4 data
        structure which is used to capture the customer-specified security
        policy. More details about the displayed entries are available in the
        "Apple Platform Security" website documentation. If the system
        has multiple bootable volumes, an interactive prompt will ask to select
        a volume to display the policy for.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#f,"><code id="f,">-f,</code></a>
    <code>--full-security</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Changes security mode to Full Security. This option is
        mutually exclusive with all options below which cause security
        downgrades. Full Security is effectively a LocalPolicy which is in its
        default state, lacking all available security downgrades. Full Security
        also performs an online check at software install and upgrade time to
        ensure that only the latest version of software can be installed. This
        prevents accidentally installing old software which has known
        vulnerabilities in it. If the security is downgraded away from Full
        Security, and then re-upgraded to Full Security, the online check will
        be performed, and if the software is no longer the latest available, it
        will not be possible to set it to Full Security again. Because online
        checks are only performed at software installation, upgrade, and Full
        Security policy setting time, it is possible for an OS to report that it
        is Full Security despite not being the latest software version. Full
        Security only indicates the state as of the latest install or
      upgrade.</p>
    <p>Boot environment requirements: None.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#g,"><code id="g,">-g,</code></a>
    <code>--reduced-security</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Selecting this option will make your system easier to
        compromise!</p>
    <p>This changes the security mode to Reduced Security. Reduced
        Security will use the "global" digital signature for macOS, in
        order to allow running software which is not the latest version. Thus
        anything other than the latest software therefore may have security
        vulnerabilities. At a high level, Reduced Security does not necessarily
        require the latest software, but it does still require all software be
        digitally signed by Apple or 3rd party software developers. Passing this
        option will explicitly recreate the LocalPolicy from scratch, (i.e. it
        does not preserve any existing security policy options) and only the
        options specified via this tool will exist in the output local
      policy.</p>
    <p>Boot environment requirements: software-launched macOS
        Recovery or 1TR.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#n,"><code id="n,">-n,</code></a>
    <code>--permissive-security</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Selecting this option will make your system easier to
        compromise!</p>
    <p>This changes the security mode to Permissive Security.
        Permissive Security uses the same "global" digital signature
        for macOS as the above Reduced Security option, in order to allow
        running software which is not the latest version. Thus anything other
        than the latest software therefore may have security vulnerabilities. At
        a high level, Permissive Security allows configuration options to be set
        to not require all software to be digitally signed. This can allow users
        who are not part of the Apple Developer program to still be able to
        introduce their own software into their system. Additionally, especially
        dangerous security downgrades may be restricted to Permissive Security,
        and only available via CLI tools for power users rather than GUIs.
        Passing this option will explicitly recreate the LocalPolicy from
        scratch, (i.e. it does not preserve any existing security policy
        options) and only the options specified via this tool will exist in the
        output local policy.</p>
    <p>Boot environment requirements: 1TR.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#k,"><code id="k,">-k,</code></a>
    <code>--enable-kexts.</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Because this option automatically downgrades to Reduced
        Security mode if not already true, selecting this option will make your
        system easier to compromise!</p>
    <p>The AuxilaryKernelCache is a SEP-signed boot object which can
        be verified and loaded into kernel memory before that memory is
        restricted to being non-writable by a "Configurable Text Read-only
        Region" (CTRR) hardware register. Introducing 3rd party kernel
        extensions can introduce architectural or implementation flaws into the
        kernel, which can lead to system compromise. In order to achieve
        iOS-like security properties, 3rd party kexts must be denied by default,
        and only loadable if the customer consciously opts in to lowering their
        security from 1TR.</p>
    <p>Boot environment requirements: 1TR.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#c,"><code id="c,">-c,</code></a>
    <code>--disable-kernel-ctrr</code></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Because this option automatically downgrades to Reduced
        Security mode if not already true, selecting this option will make your
        system easier to compromise!</p>
    <p>This disables the enforcement of the "Configurable Text
        Read-only Region" (CTRR) hardware register that marks kernel memory
        as non-writable. This is sometimes required for performing actions such
        as using dynamic DTrace code hooks to profile kernel behavior or perform
        3rd party kernel extension debugging. However, the lack of CTRR
        enforcement makes it much easier for an attacker to modify the kernel
        with exploits.</p>
    <p>Boot environment requirements: 1TR.</p>
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="#a,"><code id="a,">-a,</code></a>
    <code>--disable-boot-args-restriction</code></dt>

    <p>Because this option automatically downgrades to Reduced
        Security mode if not already true, selecting this option will make your

<p>The basic installation format for users who install packages via <code>pip</code> is
the wheel format. Wheel names are composed of four parts: a
package-name-and-version tag (which can be further broken down), a Python tag,
an ABI tag, and a platform tag. More information on the tags can be found in
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425">PEP 425</a>.  So a package like NumPy
will be available on PyPI as <code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-win_amd64.whl</code> for 64-bit
windows and <code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-macosx_10_9_x86_64.whl</code> for macOS. Note
that only the plaform tag <code>win_amd64</code> or <code>macosx_10_9_x86_64</code> differs. </p>
<p>But what about Linux? There is no single, vendor controlled, "Linux platform"
e.g., Ubuntu, RedHat, Fedora, Debian, FreeBSD all package software at slightly
different versions. What most Linux distributions do have in common is the
glibc runtime library, and a smattering of various additional system libraries.
So it is possible to define a least common denominator (LCD) of software
expected to be on a Linux platform (exceptions apply, e.g. non-glibc
distributions).</p>
<p>The decision to converge on a LCD common platform gave birth to the
<a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0513/">manylinux1</a> standard. Going back
to our example, numpy is available as
<code>numpy-1.19.2-cp36-cp36m-manylinux1_x86_64.whl</code>.</p>
<p>The first manylinux standard, manylinux1, was based on CentOS5 which has <a href="https://endoflife.software/operating-systems/linux/centos">been
obsolete</a> since
March 2017. The subsequent manylinux2010 standard is based on CentOS6, which
will hit end-of-life in December 2020. The manylinux2014 standard still has some
breathing room. Based on CentOS7, it will reach end-of-life in July 2024.</p>
<p>So what is next for <code>manylinux</code>, and what <code>manylinux</code> should users and package
maintainers use?</p>
<!-- TEASER_END -->

<h3>If <code>manylinux1</code> is obsolete, why are there still manylinux1 wheels?</h3>
<p>Wheels are typically consumed by Pip via <code>pip install</code>. Manylinux wheels are
used for projects that require compilation, otherwise they would ship
pure Python wheels with the "none" platform tag, meaning they are compatible with
any platform. So say you are a library author and want to make it convenient
for users to install your package. If you ship a manylinux2014 wheel, but the
version of Pip your users have is too old to support manylinux2014 wheels, Pip
will happily download the source package and compile it for them. Havoc ensues:
Windows users typically cannot compile, prerequisites will be missing. Pip has
a <code>--only-binary</code> option to prevent it from downloading source code and
compiling, and a <code>--prefer-binary</code> option to prefer older binary packages over
compiling from source, but neither is on by default.</p>
<p>Pip began supporting manylinux2010 wheels with <a href="https://github.com/pypa/pip/blob/master/NEWS.rst#190-2019-01-22">version
19.0</a>,
released in Jan 2019. The version of Pip that is officially shipped with Python 3.6, via
the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/library/ensurepip.html">ensurepip</a> module, is
version 18. Python 3.7 ships pip 20. It is easy enough to upgrade, but to be on
the safe side, and prevent havoc, library authors will ship a manylinux1 wheel
for Python 3.6 support.</p>
<h3>What happens now that Python 3.6 is falling out of favor?</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0494">Python 3.6 is no longer in active
development</a>. In fact, the scientific
Python community has decided to stop actively supporting Python 3.6 <a href="https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html#support-table">from
July 2020</a>.
So I would expect to see projects begin to drop the older manylinux1 format,
and drop support for Python 3.6 sooner rather than later, meaning that
<strong><code>manylinux2014</code> may soon become the only option</strong> for new versions.</p>
<h3>What about Conda packages?</h3>
<p>Conda does not use the same kind of wheel format provided by PyPI and Pip. Conda's
build system is internally consistent, and Conda packagers build a binary
package for each supported OS, thus they are not bound to the manylinux
designation. Conda does not have a declared policy around deprecating Python
3.6 yet. Conda does support <code>pip</code> (but try not to mix <code>conda</code> and <code>pip</code>
usage!), and the Pip provided should be version 20 or later. If needed,
<code>conda upgrade pip</code> should get you a modern version, so here too
<code>manylinux2014</code> will soon become the only option.</p>
<h3>What comes after manylinux2014?</h3>
<p>The glibc used in manylinux2014 is defined as the one used by CentOS7. This OS
was released in June 2014. This manylinux standard, for the first time,
declared support for non-x86 hardware systems like ARM64 (aarch64), Power
(ppc64) and S390X.  However the ARM platform has grown greatly since 2014, and
glibc has moved from version 2.17 to 2.31, fixing many bugs. Since the real
driver for platform compatibility is glibc, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0600/">PEP
600</a> defined a "perennial manylinux
spec" that is based on the glibc version number. A lot of work has <a href="https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/542">already
taken place</a> to support the next
version. Now we need to take the dive: decide what the base OS for the next
manylinux tag will be, roll out a Docker image and tooling around it, and
convince library packaging teams to adopt it. This is needed to allow libraries
like NumPy to confidently use the glibc routines fixed after 2014. For
instance, <a href="https://github.com/numpy/numpy/issues/15763">this issue</a> is
preventing NumPy from properly supporting <code>np.float128</code> on Power and S390X.</p>
<h3>What about non-x86 machines and Linux?</h3>
<p>As mentioned before, starting with manylinux2014 <code>pip</code> and <code>wheel</code> supports
non-x86 architectures like ARM64. Many packages are just now starting to roll
out support for these architectures, as the CI systems that support open source
projects (like TravisCI) have only recently made those platforms available.
It might be easier for users to adopt Conda and the <code>conda-forge</code> channel
since conda-forge has support for non-x86 architectures today.</p>
<h3>OK, so what is the bottom line?</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use pip v20 or later to make it easier on libarary packagers: modern pip
  versions will take the latest manylinux package they can support and will be
  forward-compatible with the PEP 600 perennial manylinux standard.</li>
<li>Manylinux1 and Python 3.6 are going away. Update your systems.</li>
<li>For people looking to move PEP 600 forward, the next step is to dive into the
  <a href="https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel">auditwheel</a> repo to define and support
  the next manylinux version. </li>
</ul>

<h3>raidz vs draid<a href="#raidz-vs-draid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>ZFS users are most likely very familiar with raidz already, so a
comparison with draid would help. The illustrations below are
simplified, but sufficient for the purpose of a comparison. For example,
31 drives can be configured as a zpool of 6 raidz1 vdevs and a hot
spare: <img alt="raidz1" src="https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/_images/draid_raidz.png"></p>
<p>As shown above, if drive 0 fails and is replaced by the hot spare, only
5 out of the 30 surviving drives will work to resilver: drives 1-4 read,
and drive 30 writes.</p>
<p>The same 30 drives can be configured as 1 draid1 vdev of the same level
of redundancy (i.e. single parity, 1/4 parity ratio) and single spare
capacity: <img alt="draid1" src="https://openzfs.github.io/openzfs-docs/_images/draid_draid.png"></p>
<p>The drives are shuffled in a way that, after drive 0 fails, all 30
surviving drives will work together to restore the lost data/parity:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>All 30 drives read, because unlike the raidz1 configuration shown
above, in the draid1 configuration the neighbor drives of the failed
drive 0 (i.e. drives in a same data+parity group) are not fixed.</p></li>
<li><p>All 30 drives write, because now there is no dedicated spare drive.
Instead, spare blocks come from all drives.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Normal application IO: draid and raidz are very similar. There’s a
slight advantage in draid, since there’s no dedicated spare drive
which is idle when not in use.</p></li>
<li><p>Restore lost data/parity: for raidz, not all surviving drives will
work to rebuild, and in addition it’s bounded by the write throughput
of a single replacement drive. For draid, the rebuild speed will
scale with the total number of drives because all surviving drives
will work to rebuild.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dRAID vdev must shuffle its child drives in a way that regardless of
which drive has failed, the rebuild IO (both read and write) will
distribute evenly among all surviving drives, so the rebuild speed will
scale. The exact mechanism used by the dRAID vdev driver is beyond the
scope of this simple introduction here. If interested, please refer to
the recommended readings in the next section.</p>

<h3>Recommended Reading<a href="#recommended-reading" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Parity declustering (the fancy term for shuffling drives) has been an
active research topic, and many papers have been published in this area.
The <a href="http://www.cse.scu.edu/~tschwarz/TechReports/hpca.pdf">Permutation Development Data
Layout</a> is a
good paper to begin. The dRAID vdev driver uses a shuffling algorithm
loosely based on the mechanism described in this paper.</p>

<h2>Using dRAID<a href="#using-draid" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First get the code <a href="https://github.com/openzfs/zfs/pull/10102">here</a>,
build zfs with <em>configure –enable-debug</em>, and install. Then load the
zfs kernel module with the following options which help dRAID rebuild
performance.</p>

<h3>Create a dRAID vdev<a href="#create-a-draid-vdev" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Similar to raidz vdev a dRAID vdev can be created using the
<code><span>zpool</span> <span>create</span></code> command:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span># zpool create &lt;pool&gt; draid[1,2,3][ &lt;vdevs...&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Unlike raidz, additional options may be provided as part of the
<code><span>draid</span></code> vdev type to specify an exact dRAID layout. When unspecific
reasonable defaults will be chosen.</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span><span># zpool create &lt;pool&gt; draid[1,2,3][:&lt;groups&gt;g][:&lt;spares&gt;s][:&lt;data&gt;d][:&lt;iterations&gt;] &lt;vdevs...&gt;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<ul>
<li><p>groups - Number of redundancy groups (default: 1 group per 12 vdevs)</p></li>
<li><p>spares - Number of distributed hot spares (default: 1)</p></li>
<li><p>data - Number of data devices per group (default: determined by
number of groups)</p></li>
<li><p>iterations - Number of iterations to perform generating a valid dRAID
mapping (default 3).</p></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Notes</em>:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The default values are not set in stone and may change.</p></li>
<li><p>For the majority of common configurations we intend to provide
pre-computed balanced dRAID mappings.</p></li>
<li><p>When <em>data</em> is specified then: (draid_children - spares) % (parity +
data) == 0, otherwise the pool creation will fail.</p></li>

<p>There are two logical hot spare vdevs shown above at the bottom:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The names begin with a <code><span>s&lt;id&gt;-</span></code> followed by the name of the parent
dRAID vdev.</p></li>
<li><p>These hot spares are logical, made from reserved blocks on all the 53
child drives of the dRAID vdev.</p></li>
<li><p>Unlike traditional hot spares, the distributed spare can only replace
a drive in its parent dRAID vdev.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The dRAID vdev behaves just like a raidz vdev of the same parity level.
You can do IO to/from it, scrub it, fail a child drive and it’d operate
in degraded mode.</p>

<h3>Rebuild to distributed spare<a href="#rebuild-to-distributed-spare" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When there’s a failed/offline child drive, the dRAID vdev supports a
completely new mechanism to reconstruct lost data/parity, in addition to
the resilver. First of all, resilver is still supported - if a failed
drive is replaced by another physical drive, the resilver process is
used to reconstruct lost data/parity to the new replacement drive, which
is the same as a resilver in a raidz vdev.</p>
<p>But if a child drive is replaced with a distributed spare, a new process
called rebuild is used instead of resilver:</p>

<p>The scan status line of the <em>zpool status</em> output now says <em>“rebuilt”</em>
instead of <em>“resilvered”</em>, because the lost data/parity was rebuilt to
the distributed spare by a brand new process called <em>“rebuild”</em>. The
main differences from <em>resilver</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The rebuild process does not scan the whole block pointer tree.
Instead, it only scans the spacemap objects.</p></li>
<li><p>The IO from rebuild is sequential, because it rebuilds metaslabs one
by one in sequential order.</p></li>
<li><p>The rebuild process is not limited to block boundaries. For example,
if 10 64K blocks are allocated contiguously, then rebuild will fix
640K at one time. So rebuild process will generate larger IOs than
resilver.</p></li>
<li><p>For all the benefits above, there is one price to pay. The rebuild
process cannot verify block checksums, since it doesn’t have block
pointers.</p></li>
<li><p>Moreover, the rebuild process requires support from on-disk format,
and <strong>only</strong> works on draid and mirror vdevs. Resilver, on the other
hand, works with any vdev (including draid).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although rebuild process creates larger IOs, the drives will not
necessarily see large IO requests. The block device queue parameter
<em>/sys/block/</em>/queue/max_sectors_kb* must be tuned accordingly. However,
since the rebuild IO is already sequential, the benefits of enabling
larger IO requests might be marginal.</p>
<p>At this point, redundancy has been fully restored without adding any new
drive to the pool. If another drive is offlined, the pool is still able
to do IO:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				
				<div>
				
				
				<p><h2>Small, portable laser pointers could be used to guide lightning strikes, with a study suggesting the technology may prevent bolts from sparking wildfires, a researcher told AFP Thursday.</h2></p>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div>
				
				
				<div><p>A team of international scientists have shown storm clouds could be “short-circuited” by using a hollow laser — like a pipe of light — to deliver particles into the clouds and draw lightning strikes, research co-author Professor Andrey Miroshnichenko from the University of New South Wales in Canberra told AFP.</p>
<p>In lab tests, the team — which also included scientists from the Australian National University (ANU) — successfully used a laser tractor beam to direct the path of an electrical discharge to specific targets, Miroshnichenko said.</p>
<p>In the past, high-powered lasers were needed to achieve similar results, making the technique dangerous, costly and inaccurate.<span>&nbsp;</span></p></div>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div>
				
				
				<p><iframe title="Bushfires in Australia: What ignited the deadly crisis" width="1080" height="608" src="about:blank" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-l28KQ8dJDM?feature=oembed" data-no-lazy="1" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
				
			</div><div>
				
				
				<div><p>But the new research suggested that small, hand-held lasers could be used in the field within the next decade, he said.</p>
<p>“It turns out that to deliver particles, you do not need high-intensity lasers, even low intensity like your laser pointer will be already enough,” Miroshnichenko said.</p>
<p>Using a tractor beam with a hollow centre, micro-particles in the air could be heated up and delivered to a specific point and trigger an electrical discharge.</p></div>

				<p>The electrical discharge induced by a heated microparticle.</p>
			</div> <!-- .et_pb_text --><div>
				
				
				<div><p>Although it is yet to be tested outside a lab, the technique could potentially be used to control dry lightning strikes, infamous for sparking large blazes including several major <a href="https://www.breakingasia.com/trending/social-media-fakes-australia-bushfire-disinformation/">bushfires in Australia</a> and the western US in the past year, Miroshnichenko added.</p>
<p>“We can imagine a future where this technology may induce electrical discharge from passing lightning, helping to guide it to safe targets and reduce the risk of <a href="https://www.breakingasia.com/trending/makeshift-hospital-saving-dozens-of-koalas-injured-in-bushfires/">catastrophic fires</a>,” co-researcher Vladlen Shvedov, from the ANU Research School of Physics, said.</p>
<p>The research, published in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-19183-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nature Communications last month</a>, also involved Texas A&amp;M University in Qatar and the University of California in Los Angeles.<span>&nbsp;</span></p></div>

Let's take a walk through the core of it all: data structures. What are they and why are they so important? A 'hello' to a reader that might have missed our talk on <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/memory-management-deep-and-shallow-copying">Memory management</a>, where we delved into what happens to our code in variable assignment. Do take a look, even if it's a refresher you're looking for.</p>
<p>Alright then. What is a data structure?</p>
<p>It's a way of organizing data. Say we have a couple of friends coming over for our fortnightly game night( ah...the things on our to-do list). We need snacks, a number of people expected to be there, a list of activities to partake. I can go on and on. So how do we organize this in say a program we want to implement to fix the hustle of planning? How do we store the things to be done or the items to be purchased? It's all data in the end. We need structure. We need data structures. The how of getting our data and manipulating it from these structures are our algorithms.</p>
<p>Right back to our game, who will do what? </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1604914703881/MPT41cxif.jpeg?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="adeolu-eletu-DqWEAOHsAvc-unsplash.jpg"></p>
<p>How do we decide what comes before what in terms of structuring this data? Does our simple program make it easy to retrieve this information? Is it fast enough? What about efficiency?</p>
<p>Whatever kind of application we are talking about, we need a data structure(s) that will allow traversing, insertion, searching, deletion( in case the last casserole was outright nasty), sorting, or merging of bits of data. Call it CRUD with extra steps.</p>
<p>As from the Memory management article, we got data, then collections of data. It's all data. While memory allocation might not be something we think of with javascript of even Python, it holds water when doing <strong>C</strong> or <strong>C++</strong>. So keep this in mind. </p>
<p>Broadly speaking, we group data structures, much like data types in itself, as:</p>
<p>a) Primitive</p>
<p>b) Non-primitive</p>
<p>Primitive structures would hold primitive data types; that is the <em>chars</em>, the <em>int</em> the <em>float</em>. Basically, data types that hold a single value.</p>
<p>Non-primitive structures, on the other hand, break down to <strong>linear</strong> (which holds data in a sequence) and of course <strong>non-linear</strong>. Hold your breath in case you lost it a moment there. We'll go into the details soon enough.</p>
<p>As of now, you have a general idea, a scope if you may, of what structures involve.
They are quite a number.</p>
<p>Over the course of the next couple of weeks, we'll be covering some of these structures. Unraveling them to bits and pieces. Finding what makes them tick as so and getting why many a time, developers new and old alike, have challenges addressing them. Stick a while, I cannot wait for our next piece in this!</p>

  <p><time>10 Nov 2020</time>
  </p>
  <p>Haskell’s type classes and deriving facilities are a killer feature for type safety and extensibility.
Over nearly 30 years they’ve acquired quite a bit of cruft and language extensions.
With <code>DerivingVia</code>, we now have the ability to dramatically simplify the deriving story.</p>

<p>This post outlines a change to the <em>language</em> that would hopefully be adopted with the next version of the language standard.
They get less reasonable and more dramatic as the post goes on.</p>



<p>GHC has a ton of extensions that only serve to unlock additional type classes to the “stock” deriving strategy.
<code>Derive{Functor,Foldable,Traversable,Generic,Lift,etc}</code>.
We can remove all of these extensions by folding them into the <code>stock</code> deriving strategy.</p>



<p><code>DeriveAnyClass</code> is a footgun.
It allows you to write any type class in a <code>deriving</code> clause.
It pastes in an “empty” instance, relying on <code>DefaultSignatures</code> to fill in the values.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- With DeriveAnyClass:</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>
  <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span>

<span>-- Without:</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>X</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p><code>DefaultSignatures</code> is used to give a single default implementation of a type class if the underlying type matches a more restrictive constraint.
This is primarily used to provide <code>Generic</code>-based implementations with very little syntax.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span> <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>

<span>-- with DefaultSignatures:</span>

<span>class</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>a</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Value</span>
    <span>default</span> <span>toJSON</span> <span>::</span> <span>(</span><span>Generic</span> <span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>GToJSON</span> <span>(</span><span>Rep</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Value</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>=</span> <span>gtoJSON</span> 

<span>instance</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>X</span>

<span>-- without DefaultSignatures:</span>

<span>class</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>a</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>::</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Value</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>X</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>toJSON</span> <span>=</span> <span>gtoJSON</span>

<p>By privileging a single default, it makes any other possible defaults less useful and less discoverable.</p>

<p>The <code>DeriveAnyClass</code> utility is subsumed by <code>DerivingVia</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>newtype</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>a</span>

    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>This extension is subsumed by <code>DerivingVia</code>, also.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- with GeneralizedNewtypeDeriving</span>

</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Now that there’s only two strategies, we can get rid of <code>DerivingStrategies</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- Before</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>stock</span> <span>(</span><span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span><span>)</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span><span>)</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>

<span>-- After</span>
<span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>

    <span>deriving</span> <span>(</span><span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span><span>)</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>Currently, you must write the complete type in a <code>DerivingVia</code> clause.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span> 
    <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>X</span>

<span>newtype</span> <span>Y</span> <span>=</span> <span>Y</span> <span>Text</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Text</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This can be cumbersome for a very large type.</p>

<pre><code>newtype App a = App (ExceptT () (StateT () (ReaderT () IO)) a)
    deriving
        ( Functor
        , Applicative
        , Monad
        , MonadReader ()
        , MonadError ()
        , MonadState ()
        )
      via
        ExceptT () (StateT () (ReaderT () IO))
</code></pre>

<p>It’s also annoyingly repetitive, and can lead to errors.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span> 
    <span>deriving</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>Foo</span>

<span>-- copy/paste error</span>

    <span>deriving</span> <span>ToJSON</span> <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>Foo</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>A wildcard can be used to indicate either:</p>

<p>a. The underlying type of a <code>newtype</code>, or 
b. The type of the <code>data</code> declaration.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span>

<p>There are two ways to derive things: <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> and attached deriving.
Attached deriving is redundant, but convenient.
<code>StandaloneDeriving</code> is more powerful, but less convenient.
Attached deriving clauses don’t work with <code>GADTs</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>-- Before:</span>

</code></pre></div></div>



<p>The problem with the above proposal is that it carries a significant syntax cost.
The keyword <code>deriving</code> is repeated for each instance, the keyword <code>instance</code> is repeated, the <code>via _</code> clause is repeated, and the type name is repeated.
Multiple instances should be derivable with the same context.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Foo</span> <span>=</span> <span>Foo</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>Foo</span> 
    <span>(</span> <span>Generic</span>
    <span>,</span> <span>via</span> 
        <span>(</span><span>Generically</span> <span>_</span><span>)</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>ToJSON</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span>
        <span>)</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this block, we define the <code>ToJSON</code> and <code>FromJSON</code> instances using the same <code>Generically</code> viatype.
We can still use <code>_</code> to refer to the type, since we know the type we’re deriving for: <code>Foo</code>.
This recovers the syntax convenience of “attached deriving.”</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>newtype</span> <span>App</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>App</span> <span>...</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>App</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>instance</span> 
            <span>(</span> <span>Functor</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>Applicative</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>Monad</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadReader</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadError</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>,</span> <span>MonadState</span> <span>()</span>
            <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This also recovers the convenience of attached deriving.
Let’s look at the main <em>point</em> - GADTs.
Otherwise we could just remove <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> (with the nice benefit/tragedy of banning orphan derived instance).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>Some</span> <span>::</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span>

<span>-- old</span>
<span>deriving</span> 
    <span>instance</span> <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>Some</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- new</span>
<span>deriving</span> <span>Some</span>
    <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>

<span>-- generally,</span>
<span>deriving</span> <span>SomeGadtType</span>
    <span>(</span><span>SomeContextOn</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Eq</span><span>,</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span>
        <span>)</span>
        <span>(</span><span>_</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>_</code> refers to the type name, without any variables applied.
So you need to apply the type variables in the instance head.
That’s a bit annoying, but maybe it’s fine</p>



<p>GHC provides a <code>newtype Stock a = Stock a</code> that hooks in to <code>DerivingVia</code> somehow.
Now we’re down to one deriving strategy.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>X</span>

<span>deriving</span> <span>X</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>Stock</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>Eq</span><span>,</span> <span>Show</span><span>,</span> <span>Generic</span> <span>)</span>
    <span>via</span> <span>Generically</span> <span>_</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>ToJSON</span><span>,</span> <span>FromJSON</span> <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This “deprivileges” the <code>Stock</code> deriving classes.</p>



<p>OK, so maybe you don’t like getting rid of attached deriving.
Let’s get rid of standalone deriving instead.
We need <code>StandaloneDeriving</code> for two reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Orphan derived instances (shame on you)</li>
  <li>Specifying a context for GADTs and allow application of type variables</li>
</ol>

<div><div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span> <span>where</span>
    <span>Some</span> <span>::</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>f</span> <span>a</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Some</span> <span>f</span>
    <span>deriving</span>
        <span>(</span> <span>(</span><span>forall</span> <span>a</span><span>.</span> <span>Show</span> <span>a</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>Show</span> <span>(</span><span>f</span> <span>a</span><span>))</span>
            <span>=&gt;</span>
            <span>Show</span>
        <span>,</span> <span>-- generally,</span>
            <span>(</span><span>SomeContext</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>
            <span>=&gt;</span>
            <span>SomeClass</span>
        <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The type variable <code>f</code> is in scope from the <code>data</code> declaration.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/quickdudley/status/1328068260659482624">@quickdudley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nnotm/status/1327998875563683845">@nnotm</a> have correctly pointed out that you also want to be able to define instances of a class at the definition module of a class.
These are perfectly valid instances, and so we must keep <code>StandaloneDeriving</code>.</p>



<p>Alright, post is done.
These ideas are certainly controversial and Bad, but <em>man</em> wouldn’t it be nice to have a simpler story around deriving and type class instances?
The current story is so complex, and I think we can genuinely simplify Haskell-the-language by trimming some fat here.</p>

<p>EDIT: <a href="https://twitter.com/am_i_tom/status/1327992136151789568">@i_am_tom</a> posted a reference to the <a href="https://github.com/tysonzero/ghc-proposals/blob/concrete-class-dictionaries/proposals/0000-concrete-class-dictionaries.md">Concrete Class Dictionaries</a> GHC proposal, which subsumes a lot of this.</p>

    <p>It's November 2020. There is no cure for coronavirus. What can we do to prevent the disaster?</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at several simulations of the spread of the virus.</p>
    <p>I recommend to visit website from desktop for better experience. Phone may has performance issues.</p>
    <h3>Simulation rules</h3>
    <h4>Assumptions</h4>
    <p>Desease lasts a long time: <strong>2 to 5 weeks.</strong></p>
    <p><strong>30%</strong> of people develop severe symptoms. They are especially vulnerable in a case of a lack of medical care due to overwhelmed medical facilities or weak healthcare systems.</p>
    <p><strong>3%</strong> of people are destined to die. <a href="https://bestpractice.bmj.com/topics/en-gb/3000168/pdf/3000168/COVID-19.pdf" target="_blank"> [Source]</a>. It is due to genetic and age reasons. We are assuming we can save the people through vaccination or isolation. Unfortunately as of November 2020 there are no vaccines approved for public use.</p>
    <h4>Possible states of a person</h4>
    <p><span id="guide-healty"></span> - a healthy person.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-ill"></span> - a sick person. They infect other individuals in a small area around them.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-serious"></span> - a seriously sick person with severe symptoms. They die if the medical system is overloaded. We assume the healthcare system  can handle a maximum of 200 patients at a time. Also, severely ill patients move much slower than other people.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-dead"></span> - a dead person.</p>
    <p><span id="guide-immunity"></span> - a recovered perso. We assume they have developed an immunity and can not get reinfected.</p>
    <h4>Modificators</h4>
    <div>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-mask"></span> - a person with mask. <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/10/22/national/science-health/japan-masks-block-coronavirus/" target="_blank">Mask retains up to 50% of exhaled viruses</a>. Also it retains up to 40% of inhaled viruses. If both persons
            wear masks a synergy effect appears.</p>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-screen"></span> - a person with screen. Screen additionally protects against infection.</p>
        <p><span id="guide-healty-both"></span> - a person with screen and mask.</p>
    </div>
    <h2>Let's get started</h2>
    <h3>Virus in a small virtual city</h3>
    <p>There is a virtual city with population of 2 000 people. People contact each other as usual. No measures are taken. What could go wrong? Check it.</p>

          <div id="game-simulation-small-city">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-small-city" onclick="startButton('small-city', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-small-city">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-small-city" onclick="resetButton('small-city')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>    
    <p>At the end of simulation you will see that everyone get desease. Results may vary, but I had a disaster my first simulation. I have got up to 1500 sick people at same time and
        600 dead people at the end. These are 75% and 30%, respectively. Each person with severe symptoms died.</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people</h3>
    <p>We have not taken any measures to protect people. Obviously, we can isolate patients in hospitals. Let's be honest, complete isolation is not possible. Patients will still
        be in contact with service personnel, such as doctors, janitors, couriers. So the virus can be passed on, but it happens less likely.</p>
    <p>Let's see how this affects the spread of the virus. <strong>It is a perfect scenario!</strong> Be prepared it takes long time. I recommend to move ahead after 90th day,
        there is nothing interesting in the following days.</p>

          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-small">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-small" onclick="startButton('isolate-small', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-small">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-small" onclick="resetButton('isolate-small')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>    
    <p>Wow! In my simulation there were so few infections that medical care was enough for everyone. Over time, the number of people with immunity increased. At some point, the
        patients were in contact only with people with immunity and could not spread the virus further.</p>
    <p>My result is 70 people who died over 498 days of pandemy. Exactly 3% that are in the genetics of people. So, what is your result?</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people in real life</h3>
    <p>Sadly, not all people observe isolation. And alas, not all sick people know that they are ill. There is no scientific work reporting how many people are asymptomatic. In my
        city one clinic said 25% of its positive tests were from people with no signs of illness. Let's take this number as a basis. <strong>25% of those infected will not show
            symptoms and will move freely around the city.</strong></p>
          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-part-small">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-part-small" onclick="startButton('isolate-part-small', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-part-small">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-part-small" onclick="resetButton('isolate-part-small')">Reset</a>

</div>        <p>Well, the burden on the healthcare system is still less than in the very first scenario. But a cemeteries are overcrowded again.</p>

    <h3>Isolation of sick people in real life. But with masks and screens</h3>
    <p>May be masks and screens will help? Of course not all people wear them. Let's say <strong>10% of people wear screens and 50% of people wear masks</strong>.</p>
          <div id="game-simulation-isolate-part-small-masks">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-isolate-part-small-masks" onclick="startButton('isolate-part-small-masks', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-isolate-part-small-masks">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-isolate-part-small-masks" onclick="resetButton('isolate-part-small-masks')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>Hmm. Although the effect is small, it is there. Why masks have not worked? Actually they worked. But if you have chance of infection as 5%, 20 contacts turns it to 74%,
        that's it! How many contacts do you have in pub or in club? Do you consider you are breathing the same air with all the pub visitors?</p>
    <h3>Isolation + masks + screens + self-isolation</h3>
    <p>So, our goal is to reduce the number of contacts. It's time for self-isonation. Don't forget to build houses for everyone in our virtual city in advance.</p>
    <p>In this case we have a chance to isolate people who do not know they are ill. One more modification in this simulation is prevention of infection through the walls.</p>
    <p>I live in Russia. So I will draw on the experience of my country. The Moscow mayor's office has obliged business to send <strong>30% of employee to work from home</strong>.
        Let's check what happens when this order is respected.</p>
          <div id="game-simulation-selfisolate-part-small-masks">
    <p><a id="start-pause-button-selfisolate-part-small-masks" onclick="startButton('selfisolate-part-small-masks', this)">Start</a>
        <span id="no-ill-selfisolate-part-small-masks">No sick people left. Pandemy is over.</span>
        <a id="reset-button-selfisolate-part-small-masks" onclick="resetButton('selfisolate-part-small-masks')">Reset</a>
    </p>
    <p>Hint: game field is scrollable</p>
    
</div>        <p>This set of measures has shown maximum efficiency. About 70% of people did not even get infected by the end of the simulation.</p>
    <p>This is most effective step in fight with epidemy. </p>
    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3% of people are destined to die due to their genetics</li>
        <li>30% of people need medical attention due to their genetics</li>
        <li>there is NO cure for the virus.</li>
        <li>Virus control is about probabilities</li>
        <li>We must reduce human contact to reduce the probability of infection</li>
        <li>Forced contacts should be protected with masks, screens, antiseptics.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I hope you drew the right conclusions. Please, help me convey information to more people. Share this page to somewhere.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>It’s time for the holidays and what better way to share love and memories with your family than to create an old-school, vintage movie? You don’t need a time-machine to go back to the 50s or 60s to rmake your homevideo look like a vintage movie. All you need is FFmpeg, some imagination, and perhaps the rest of this guide 🙂 </strong></p>



<p>Let’s take a look at how you can use FFmpeg to make your videos look like old-school/vintage/retro-styled movies, shall we?</p>



<hr>



<h2>What’s Do I Mean By A Vintage Movie?</h2>



<p>Well, good question! </p>



<p><strong>My definition of an old-school movie is a movie with a low frame-rate (like 15 fps), lots of scratches and film-grain to give an aged look, and a sepia tint to it!</strong></p>



<p>Let’s see how we can achieve all of this using FFmpeg.</p>



<p>For this tutorial, I shall be using the “Touchdown Pass” sequence from <a href="https://media.xiph.org/video/derf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xiph</a> to illustrate the steps. It’s a 20 second video, but for the sake of this tutorial, I’ll be cutting it to 10 seconds using FFmpeg (<a href="https://ottverse.com/trim-cut-video-using-start-endtime-reencoding-ffmpeg/">here’s how to do that</a>).</p>



<p>Let’s get started! </p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 1: Changing the Frame Rate using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>The first step is to “speed” up the video. Let’s take the video back to pre-30fps or pre-60fps days and take it all the way down to 10 fps. This gives the video an old-school look right off the bat! </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i td-10sec.mp4 \
-filter:v fps=fps=10 \
td-fast.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here is the sped-up video. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479524704" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 2: Give The Video a Vintage Look using FFmpeg’s filters</h2>



<p>Next, let’s change the rich, wonderful colors and bring a sepia-link tint to the entire video. This can be done using FFmpeg’s in-built <code>curves</code> filter. You can use the <code>curves</code> filter to change the amount of R, G, B in a frame and specify the “curves” that govern the change or shift in colors. </p>



<p>Luckily for us, FFmpeg has a pre-defined <code>vintage</code> filter that works pretty well, I must say! Here is the commandline to convert our sped-up video into a “vintage” looking video. Simple, right?</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i td-fast.mp4 \
-vf curves=vintage \
td-vintage-fast.mp4</code></pre>



<p>Here’s the result of the <code>curves=vintage</code> filter on our footall video.</p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479525304" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>



<hr>



<h2>Step 3: Getting a Film Grain Overlay and Resizing It</h2>



<p>As the final step, let’s add a lot of film-grain and “scratches” to make our video look like something that was shot on film, stored in a dusty old cupboard, and discovered 40 years later! </p>



<p>I found a fantastic “old school” film overlay on YouTube (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J_MZb7qTenE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">source link</a>) with a download link. </p>



<figure><div>
<p><span><iframe width="1200" height="675" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_MZb7qTenE?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-US&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></span></p>
</div></figure>



<p>The video’s size is <code>1440x1080</code> pixels and so I had to resize it to <code>1920x1080</code> to match the size of my input video. </p>



<p>Here is the command to resize a video using FFmpeg using the the <code>scale</code> filter. I’ve stored the output video as <code>oldFilm1080.mp4</code>.</p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg -i old-film-grain.wmv \
-vf scale=1920:1080,setsar=1:1 \
oldFilm1080.mp4</code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>Step 4: Add the Overlay To Your Video</h2>



<p>Now we have two videos with us – </p>



<ol><li>our old-school film-grain-scratchy video</li><li>our vintage-looking, sped-up football video. </li></ol>



<p>Now all that’s left to do is to overlay them on each other and enjoy the fruits of <s>our</s> FFmpeg’s labor! </p>



<p>Here’s the commandline to achieve that. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe \
-i oldFilm1080.mp4 \
-i td-vintage-fast.mp4 \
-filter_complex "[0]format=rgba,colorchannelmixer=aa=0.25[fg];\
[1][fg]overlay[out]" \
-map [out] \
-pix_fmt yuv420p -c:v libx264 -crf 18 \
touchdown-vintage.mp4</code></pre>



<p>So, what’s going on here? </p>



<ul><li>we provide two input videos to FFmpeg </li><li>using <code>filter_complex</code>, we use <code>colorchannelmixer</code> to overlay by modifying the alpha channel of the film-grain video that is referred to as <code>[0]</code> and and let’s call the output <code>[fg]</code>. It’s black and white, so modifying only the alpha is good enough for our use case. The syntax is as follows <code>colorchannelmixer=rr:rg:rb:ra:gr:gg:gb:ga:br:bg:bb:ba:ar:ag:ab:aa</code>. </li><li>we are modifying only the alpha, and so, we modify only the <code>aa</code> (output’s alpha) to <code>0.25</code>.</li><li>then, we use the vintage-looking football video (referred to as <code>[1]</code>) and overlay them both using the <code>overlay</code> filter to create an interim output stored in a variable called <code>[out]</code>. This is shown in the commands –&gt; <code>[1][fg]overlay[out]</code></li><li>then, we encode the interim output to give us the final video using H.264 with <code>crf=18</code> which should give us a good quality video.</li></ul>







<p><strong>Here is what the final output looks like! Cool, isn’t it? </strong></p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479529512" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>







<p>And, here’s how it looks side-by-side the original video. </p>



<p><iframe frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/479529447" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="></iframe></p>







<p>Now you can change the opacity of the alpha channels, use a different film grain video, or use a different <code>curves</code> function, but, the process won’t change much. </p>



<p>Hope you all have a lot of fun making “<strong>vintage</strong>” videos this holiday season and please let me know in the comments how it went! Please create some fun videos, share them with your loved ones, and have a few laughs 🙂 </p>

                </div>
                <p>Properties are a really nice feature of modern languages, and I've recently
                    gotten attached to them in Kotlin. For a while
                    I wasn't comfortable with the idea of 'fields' performing arbitrary computation,
                    but having used them for a few months now I'm really enjoying the simplicity -
                    <em>especially</em> when moving back to Java!</p>
                <p>Having given it some thought, I wanted to lay out a case in support of
                    properties which highlights their benefits over directly accessing fields (which
                    is mostly about getters/setters, but nonetheless), and how we can establish some
                    guidelines on when properties should not be used to avoid the issue of
                    arbitrary computation causing side effects or other unexpected behavior.</p>
                
                <p>In short, a property is <abbr title="Features which aid readability or ease of use but do not impact semantics.">syntax sugar</abbr> for getter/setter methods that look
                    like fields. Instead of having to use the methods <code>item.getQuantity()</code> and
                    <code>item.setQuantity()</code>, we can access the property <code>item.quantity</code> and set it
                    using <code>item.quantity = 1</code>, exactly like a field. The compiler transforms property
                    access and assignment to use the appropriate getters/setters (hence, syntax sugar).
                </p>
                <p>The most noteworthy consequence of this is, in my opinion, allowing <em>validation
                    on assigment</em>. For example, <code>item.quantity</code> may be defined as follows (in Kotlin):</p>
<pre><span>class</span> <span>Item</span> {
    <span>var</span> <span>quantity</span>: <span>Int</span> = <span>0</span>
        <span>set</span>(value) {
            require(value &gt;= <span>0</span>) <span>//throws if negative</span>
            <span>field</span> = value
        }
}
</pre>
<pre><span>
  <i onclick="openDemo('item-property', this)"></i>
</span>item.<span>quantity</span> = <span>-10</span>;
</pre>
                
                <p>The largest benefit of properties is replacing field use, which has a massive
                    amount of drawbacks, with methods instead. In languages like C++ and Java that
                    don't have properties, the best practice is to keep all fields private and
                    manually create getters and setters. More modern languages, like C# and Kotlin,
                    use properties for this instead which can do that automatically.</p>
                <p>Most of the following points are also benefits of using getters/setters over
                    fields, and then properties step in to provide the extra bit of syntax sugar icing on
                    the cake.</p>
                <div>
                    <div>

                <ol>
                    <li>Property getters/setters can have different <abbr title="public/private and friends">access modifiers</abbr>, allowing for
                        fields which are read-only for external use but still mutable within the class.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: In Kotlin, <code>val&nbsp;counter&nbsp;=&nbsp;0&nbsp;private&nbsp;set</code>
                                defines a <code>counter</code> field that can be publicly accessed but not modified (unless within the class).
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>Getters/setters can be used to maintain <abbr title="A (mathematical) property which is expected to hold true in all cases

For example, a unit vector (3D) has the invariant x² + y² + z² == 1.">invariants</abbr> and perform other
                        validation work, such as <code>quantity&nbsp;&gt;=&nbsp;0</code> in the opening example.
                    </li>
                    <li>Since getters/setters are methods, the implementation can be changed without
                        breaking either <abbr title="Application Programming Interface

The interface of the *source* code">API</abbr> or <abbr title="Application Binary Interface

The interface of the *compiled* code">ABI</abbr> compatibility.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: A <code>Vector</code> class could have <code>x/y/z</code> properties, but
                                change the implementation to use a component array <code>[x, y, z]</code> instead without issue.
                            </li>
                            <li>Additionally, getters/setters can be inlined during optimization to speed up performance at the cost of ABI compatibility.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Properties can be used in interfaces since they're backed by methods, while fields require getters/setters to be defined for them. Notably, these getters/setters would still need to have fields defined in the implementing class to handle their values, while a property can handle that automatically.
                    </li>
                    <li>Properties can be used for methods which often behave like fields, but
                        cannot be implemented with one due to subtypes requiring computation or
                        other restrictions.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Example: <code>List#size()</code> generally doesn't need computation and returns the
                                value of a field, but some implementations (such as a <abbr title="A form of linked list which doesn't track its size, comes from Lisp

Honestly google it, this text box can't do it justice">cons list</abbr>) might.
                            </li>
                            <li>Whether <code>List#size()</code> should be a property is certainly debatable, but with how frequently collections are used I think it's almost a necessity.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                
                <ol>
                    <li>Properties are a <em>single unit</em>. Getters/setters are located in the same
                        location in the source code as the property declaration, making it easier to
                        fully understand a field as opposed to having them defined in separate locations.
                    </li>
                    <li>Properties almost always have syntax sugar for providing default
                        implementations of <code>get/set</code> (if it's not already done automatically). In Kotlin, <code>val property</code> provides a default
                        getter while <code>var property</code> provides both a getter and setter.
                    </li>
                    <li>Debugging properties is possible without a dedicated debugger by using
                        getters/setters. This may be minor for large languages, but if your language
                        doesn't have an IDE or still in development this is <em>extremely</em> useful.
                    </li>
                    <li>Readability is often increased, albeit debatable. I personally find <code>item.quantity&nbsp;=&nbsp;1</code> to
                        be more readable than <code>item.setQuantity(1)</code>, especially in large chains.
                    </li>
                    <li>Generally, properties imply 'simple' behavior, like fields, as opposed to complex
                        computation that some methods may perform. We'll talk about this in detail soon.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                                </a>

                            <span>So what are the downsides?</span>
                        </h2>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>I think there are two notable downsides to having properties. First, the
                    performance difference between field access and method calls can be significant,
                    especially in low level languages. Second, field access has clear, well-defined
                    behavior while a method call could effectively do anything, thus making it
                    harder to reason about code. Let's dig in to both of these.</p>
                
                <p>Field access is almost always language primitive, and is therefore faster than
                    doing the work of a method call (which then has to access <em>something</em> anyways).</p>
                <p>That said, compiler optimizations like <abbr title="Replacing a method call with it's implementation">inlining</abbr> can easily resolve this for
                    simple properties. In more complex cases, this is actually where properties are
                    most useful - a field itself wasn't sufficient, so the alternative would have
                    been a method call or sacrificing validation anyways.</p>
                <p>In low level languages where memory layout is often important, knowing a field
                    access corresponds to a memory lookup (and not arbitrary computation) can be
                    important. In higher level languages, particularly Object Oriented ones that
                    often encapsulate fields behind methods anyways, I don't believe this
                    distinction is as necessary.</p>
                <div>
                    <div>
                        <h3 id="problem-2-arbitrary-computation">
                            <span>
                                <a href="#problem-2-arbitrary-computation">
                                    <i></i>
                                </a>
                            </span>
                            <span>Problem 2: Arbitrary Computation</span>
                        </h3>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <p>Finally, we've made our way to what I believe is the core issue: since
                    properties can perform arbitrary computation, it is unclear what potential
                    behavior getting/setting a property may have. The extreme example here, of
                    course, is deleting the entire file system. Fields on the other hand have
                    clearly defined behavior - get or set the value, nothing more.</p>
                <p>However, these type of assumptions are not unique to properties. We apply the
                    same assumptions to methods (and honestly everything) as well. I often presume
                    that <code>getX()</code> and <code>setX(x)</code> have 'simple' behavior, but they could use lazy
                    initialization, have unexpected validation checks, or cause side-effects and
                    other unexpected behavior
                    like a database <code>getConnection()</code>. Naming is one of the two hard problems in computer science,
                    likely because we carry assumptions with us that may not always fit.</p>
                <p>That said, these assumptions …</p></article></div>

<p>Most programmers I know started programming out of sheer curiosity and joy. Joy is what keeps one motivated to keep up with the changing landscape of technology. It’s what keeps one happy. That is why I am recommending these 10 best books for programmers, books I really enjoyed reading. These are the books that I keep picking up and coming back to or have fond memories of. These are also the books that I hardly see recommended elsewhere, except for a few classics that are certainly worth repeating. And now I would like to share these books with you.</p>



<p><em>This post contains affiliate links where applicable. If you’re planning to buy any of these books yourself you can support this blog by buying it with the links</em> provided in the titles.</p>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/36ALozx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Pragmatic Programmer<br></a><sub>Your Journey to Mastery, 20th Anniversary Edition</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="230" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-pragmatic-programmer-230x300.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>I would recommend any programmer to read this book. It contains a lot of wisdom, tips, and advice. Most of it is pretty basic but therein lies the beauty. The first edition released in 1999 and was getting pretty dated. Despite it being old it was still highly recommended. To my surprise they released a new edition 20 years later, all up-to-date! Now you’ve got no excuses left to not read this book. A wonderful book that you surely will be referring back to over and over again, I know I do.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.learninpublic.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Coding Career Handbook<br></a><sub>Guides, Principles, Strategies, and Tactics – from Code Newbie to Senior Dev</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-coding-career-handbook-196x300.jpg" alt="" width="200" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-coding-career-handbook-196x300.jpg 196w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-coding-career-handbook.jpg 311w" sizes="(max-width: 196px) 100vw, 196px"></figure></div>



<p>Similar to the The Pragmatic Programmer , I consider this book a must-read. It focuses on the bigger picture and your career, not just about writing code. This book is the reason I started this blog in the first place! A great book for any ambitious programmer and want to take your career to the next level.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/36ulPQI">Apprenticeship Patterns<br></a><sub>Guidance for the Aspiring Software Craftsman</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="229" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apprenticeship-patterns-229x300.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apprenticeship-patterns-229x300.jpeg 229w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/apprenticeship-patterns.jpeg 260w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px"></figure></div>



<p>If you’re new to programming, making the same mistakes as the programmers that have gone before you can be costly and detrimental for your career. Let this book guide you on avoiding these same mistakes. This book is similar to the ones mentioned above and makes for a nice addition. It’s split up into smaller sections that can be read in any order you’d like, this makes it a fun and easy read.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/3prQVAU">Beginning C++ Through Game Programming</a></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="243" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/beginning-c-through-game-programming-243x300.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/beginning-c-through-game-programming-243x300.jpg 243w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/beginning-c-through-game-programming.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 243px) 100vw, 243px"></figure></div>



<p>This is the book that taught me how code and was the first book I read on the subject of programming. It made learning new programming languages that much easier. Ever since I read this book it seems I’ve always been one step ahead of the herd. This book is about learning the fundamentals of programming and C++ and less about games. It merely uses games as an example to reinforce programming concepts. This book was a lot of fun to read and because it uses games as a theme it keeps one motivated.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/35sQDSE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Programming Game AI by Example</a></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="201" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/programming-game-ai-by-example-201x300.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/programming-game-ai-by-example-201x300.jpg 201w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/programming-game-ai-by-example.jpg 335w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px"></figure></div>



<p>To be honest I have not read this book in it’s entirety yet as I currently lack the time to do so. But I am really excited about this one and can’t wait to read it in combination with learning a new programming language: Rust. This book makes use of C++ but I’d figure these languages are similar enough as to implement the same ideas in Rust. I’ve put this book on this list because of the pure excitement it makes me feel. I would recommend to at least peruse this book to see if it resonates with you.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/3nrDlfj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Phoenix Project<br></a><sub>A Novel about IT, Devops, and Helping Your Business Win</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="201" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-phoenix-project-201x300.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-phoenix-project-201x300.jpg 201w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/the-phoenix-project.jpg 334w" sizes="(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px"></figure></div>



<p>This is a book I got recommended, I read it, I loved it. I recommended it to a friend, and he loved it. And now I recommend it to you! It’s a really fun read and I could hardly put it down. This book really is written like a novel and packed with great lessons. Go read it! There is also a part two of sorts: The Unicorn Project. I hear it contains much of the same lessons, only told with a different story. I have yet to read it but will certainly do so in the near future.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/3ktXAae" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Designing Data-Intensive Applications<br></a><sub>The Big Ideas Behind Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Systems</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/designing-data-intensive-applications-229x300.jpg" alt="" width="229" height="300" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/designing-data-intensive-applications-229x300.jpg 229w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/designing-data-intensive-applications.jpg 381w" sizes="(max-width: 229px) 100vw, 229px"></figure></div>



<p>So you’ve learned how to code and now can write decent software. It’s time to focus on the bigger picture and learn about systems architecture and scaling, where do you start? This book is the answer. It will teach you all about designing data-intensive applications and serves as a great resource to prep for your systems design interviews.</p>

<p>I adore this book. It’s a book I keep coming back to over and over. It’s about programming patterns with a game theme once again. Note that the patterns here are not only for games! Some of them are game specific but most of them aren’t. It’s a fun read with beautiful hand drawn diagrams. Bob Nystrom clearly has put a lot of love in his book. You can read the web version for free <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/contents.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>!</p>

<p>You’re a back-end developer and are responsible for fending of hackers? This is the book for you. It will arm you with the knowledge of how hackers actually hack your web applications and what you can do about it! And if you ever want to make a career switch to become a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bug_bounty_program" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bug Bounty Hunter</a>, this is the #1 book recommendation within that field.</p>




</div></div>



<div><div>
<h2><a href="https://amzn.to/3ly5xfO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cracking the Coding Interview<br></a><sub>189 Programming Questions and Solutions</sub></h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="211" height="300" src="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cracking-the-coding-interview-211x300.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cracking-the-coding-interview-211x300.jpeg 211w, https://codingwizardry.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cracking-the-coding-interview.jpeg 243w" sizes="(max-width: 211px) 100vw, 211px"></figure></div>



<p>A classic for coding interview prep. I’ve read this book after seeing it recommended everywhere and I must say I’m glad I did. It teaches you all about data-structures and has a ton of example coding interview questions and their answers. This is a must-read for any programmer.</p>

<p>I spent a few hours spread over the last couple of weeks to learn every single one of VSCode’s keyboard shortcuts, specifically the 149 shortcuts from the <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/shortcuts/keyboard-shortcuts-windows.pdf">official keyboard shortcuts reference</a>. These are also present in <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">KeyCombiner’s searchable table of VSCode shortcuts</a>.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I started this challenge to write a blog post about it afterward and as a way to promote <a href="https://keycombiner.com/">KeyCombiner</a> via content marketing. The blog post I had in mind would be similar to my previous one, <a href="https://tkainrad.dev/posts/how-i-learned-50-new-keyboard-shortcuts-in-42-minutes/">documenting my process of learning 50 new web application shortcuts in 42 minutes</a>.</p>
<p>But, as it usually happens only in romantic comedies, my intentions changed over time. This article turned out much different. It is not about the learning process but about how this challenge changed some of the developing habits I had for many years. Workflows that I grew used to during many projects, different IDEs, and even varying programming languages suddenly evolved.</p>

<p>As software engineers, we like to think that we are continually learning and improving our skills. This is certainly true when it comes to the technologies we are using. However, our development habits, such as which features of our IDEs we use, are much more rigid. I believe most of our core workflows are formed early on and very hard to change.
I don’t have data to back this up, but when I look at myself, my co-workers, and other developers I know, this certainly seems true. If you think about it, it is not surprising, the same thing happens in other areas of life. For this very reason, you will find that developers who have studied or worked together will often use similar shortcuts, similar IDE features, and have similar limitations in their workflows.</p>
<p>The usual way to combat this is reading books, blog posts, attending conferences, well, everything that is used in our industry to extend our knowledge. However, with fundamental developing habits, I have found that this works poorly. You might read about a neat feature of your IDE, or see someone demo their workflow, but when you are eventually sitting in front of your screen and writing code, it is easy to fall back to what we already know, what is already set up, and proven to work.</p>
<p>After this experiment, I am convinced that keyboard shortcuts are the main factor in how we form our developing habits, and they can also stop us from evolving our habits.
Even before this challenge, I felt that I was good with shortcuts. I knew quite a few refactoring shortcuts, knew how to pause and stop program executing during debugging, was decent at jumping around between files, searching through my project, and all the other usual stuff. When I saw a co-worker using a shortcut that I didn’t know, I was quick to incorporate it into my workflow, too. After all, I was enough into shortcuts that I built a whole side-project around learning them.
<strong>The thing is, all new shortcuts that I learned were the ones that would augment my existing habits.</strong></p>
<p>This is a hen and egg problem; if you don’t know the shortcuts, you will not start to change your habits and use new IDE features because without shortcuts, they are too tedious to use or not at all usable. But if you don’t form new habits, you will not learn the shortcuts.</p>
<p><strong>Without intending it, I think I found a way to break out of this cycle:
Learning all IDE shortcuts very well <em>before</em> getting back to work. By learning <em>all</em> shortcuts, you are not limited to what somebody shows you and might not be compatible with your situation. You can naturally include what makes sense, in addition to your existing skills.</strong></p>
<p>The next section shows how this worked for me.</p>

<p>I started the learning process as it is usually done with KeyCombiner: By importing some shortcuts from the <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collections/vscode/">public collection of VSCode shortcuts</a> into a personal collection. Intuitively, I started with the ones I already knew and some additional that seemed most useful to me. Back then I was still trying to show that I could learn all shortcuts very quickly with KeyCombiner. I didn’t expect that shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing workflows will be the real deal.</p>
<p>Some of the first combinations that I picked and that I did not know previously were <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>w</kbd>/<kbd>r</kbd>/<kbd>c</kbd> for toggling find options (match whole word, regex, case sensitivity) because I was already using those features. This went on for a few days. I did a couple practice runs every day and added new shortcuts whenever KeyCombiner was saying that I mastered all of the previous ones.</p>
<p>Eventually, I knew all shortcuts that seemed useful for how I was using VSCode back then. So I had to start adding shortcuts that had nothing to do with my existing habits. This brought up an interesting misconception. Often keyboard shortcuts are seen as a way to do things faster, compared to using the mouse. While that is true, I think there is an even more aspect to shortcut usage in IDEs: Many features are not used at all, if you don’t know the shortcut!</p>
<p>As I was learning new VSCode shortcuts every day, I started to use features that I previously didn’t even know of. One of the first things that suddenly made a lot of sense was <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd> as default binding, especially when combined with regex search. I was so excited about it, that I even <a href="https://twitter.com/ThomasKainrad/status/1305608337799761920">tweeted a Gif</a> showing how I use it to modify the CSV files that are the source for KeyCombiner’s public collection tables.</p>
<p>The process worked both ways: Sometimes, while I was practicing a shortcut on KeyCombiner, it seemed apparent that this was useful and that I should include it into my workflow. Sometimes it hit me while coding that I had just learned a shortcut that can make the current task more efficient.</p>
<p>In the following, I describe the most significant changes in my daily development habits. The list is far from complete though; there are many more small things that I picked up and frequently use now.</p>
<p><strong>Editor and Panel Management</strong><br>
Since knowing all the shortcuts to switch focus between panels and move editors around, I am using VSCode’s powerful layouting capabilities much more. I have 3-5 editor panels open at pretty much all times, seeing many related pieces of code at once. Working this way by using the mouse is very impractical.
I switch between editor panels with keyboard shortcuts and move editors from one group to the other.</p>
<p>There is one negative side-effect, though: I am starting to get annoyed when I use other IDEs (PyCharm, Eclipse), because they lack far behind VSCode when it comes to using multiple editors.</p>
<p><strong>Multi-cursor Editing</strong><br>
If you don’t know the shortcut to add additional cursors, I doubt you will ever use this incredibly powerful feature of VSCode. It is a typical feature that only blends into your habits once you know the shortcuts.
The basic commands are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Down</kbd>/<kbd>Up</kbd> for adding cursors above/below. However, I found the commands to <em>Insert cursor at end of each line selected</em> (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>i</kbd>), and the above-mentioned <em>Select all Occurences of Find Match</em> (<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>) even more powerful. These commands are why I frequently paste text snippets into VSCode, apply a few operations, and then copy-paste it back into whatever application I was using.</p>
<p><strong>Opening views by shortcut</strong><br>
I sometimes tried to do this before, but it never stuck. Now I finally switch to all views (Explorer, Debug, Search, Problems, etc.) with dedicated keyboard shortcuts. These shortcuts translate very nicely to other IDEs. After learning the VSCode default bindings, which are <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>&lt;char&gt;</kbd>, I set the same bindings also for Eclipse and PyCharm. Especially <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd> for switching to the explorer view and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>d</kbd> for switching to the debug view are among my most used shortcuts now.</p>
<p><strong>Making Selections</strong><br>
I hate to admit it, but I did not use shortcuts to expand and shrink AST selections before. AST stands for <em>abstract syntax tree</em>, which means that the IDE will take the current language’s syntax into account for modifying the selection. Finally, I picked up <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>left</kbd>/<kbd>right</kbd> to shrink and expand selections. Not all IDEs handle this in the same way, which can be a bit annoying, but it works well for the most frequent tasks, such as expanding the selection to enclose the current string, method, class, or HTML tag.</p>
<p><strong>Folding</strong><br>
I have started to use folding much more. For years, I have rarely used this feature that all IDEs support to a great extent. Now, I do it frequently. Folding is one of these things that are just not feasible with the mouse. Of course, if you need to fold code, <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-problem-with-code-folding/">chances are that you need to structure your code better</a>. Many organizations even apply automatic code linters that will complain when methods or classes are too long. However, I have never seen someone recommend splitting up blog posts into multiple files. The same goes for other non-code file types, such as JSON. All we have there is folding.</p>
<p>I am not saying these are the things you should start to learn now, far from it. These are the things I personally integrated deep into my workflows after doing this challenge, without choosing them deliberately, but naturally. Who knows what you will pick up.</p>
<p>Of course, some of the shortcuts I learned still seem a bit, let’s say nonessential, but a little useless knowledge never killed nobody.</p>

<p>In addition to finally breaking out of old habits and experience a real evolution of my IDE usage, there were some additional, less significant, but still delightful second-order effects.</p>
<p>As a shortcut enthusiast, I often had the problem that I needed to decide which binding to use for a particular operation and application pair. KeyCombiner’s public shortcut search helps to find out which binding is the convention for a particular operation, but it can still be tricky. For example, take the frequently used <em>Step Over</em> operation used for debugging. <a href="https://keycombiner.com/collecting/collections/public/search/?description=step+over&amp;keys=&amp;mac_keys=&amp;submit=Search">KeyCombiner shows that VSCode, Eclipse, and JetBrains IDEs all use a different default binding</a>(<kbd>F6</kbd>,<kbd>F8</kbd>,<kbd>F10</kbd>). Learning every single VSCode shortcut has freed me from this mental load of deciding what the best …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Python is one of the languages that is witnessing incredible growth and popularity year by year. In 2017, Stack overflow calculated that python would beat all other programming languages by 2020 as it has become the fastest-growing programming language in the world.</p>
<p>Python is one of the most popular general-purpose, high-level programming languages in modern times. It is an elementary and widely used programming language because of its code readability. </p>
<p>The term <strong>general-purpose</strong> means that Python can be used for a variety of applications. And the term <strong>high-level language</strong> means it's close to human language. The main advantage of high-level languages is that they are easier to read, write, and maintain. Programs written in a high-level language must be translated into machine language by a compiler or interpreter. Python is an interpreted language because, during execution, each line is interpreted to the machine language on-the-go.</p>
<h2 id="history">History 📜</h2>
<p>Python was created in the late 1980s as a successor to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABC_(programming_language)" target="_blank">ABC language</a>. It was developed by <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Guido van Rossum</a> and was first released in 1991. While Guido van Rossum was implementing Python, he read the published scripts from Monty Python’s Flying Circus. </p>
<p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063929/">Monty Python’s Flying Circus</a> is a BBC Comedy TV series from 1969+. It is a highly viewed TV series and is rated 8.8 on IMDB.
Python programming language is highly rated too. According to a recent <a target="_blank" href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2020#most-popular-technologies">Stack Overflow survey</a>, Python has overtaken Java in popularity.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/egu2Nzo.png" alt="python overtaken"></p>
<p>Fig: Python has overtaken Java in popularity</p>


<p>Python is named after the comedy television show Monty Python’s Flying Circus. It is not named after the Python snake.</p>
<h2 id="philosophy">Philosophy 🧠</h2>
<p>The language's core philosophy is summarized in the document <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python">The Zen of Python</a>, which includes aphorisms such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Beautiful is better than ugly.</li>
<li>Explicit is better than implicit.</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex.</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated.</li>
<li>Readability counts.</li>
</ul>
<p>Rather than having all of its functionality built into its core, Python was designed to be highly extensible. This compact modularity has made it particularly popular as a means of adding programmable interfaces to existing applications.</p>
<h2 id="features">Features 💼</h2>
<p>As a programming language, the features of Python brought to the table are many. Some of the most significant features of Python are:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/u4OfzKl.jpg" alt="https://i.imgur.com/u4OfzKl.jpg"></p>
<p>Fig: Features of Python</p>


<h3 id="easy-to-learn">🎯 Easy to Learn</h3>
<p>Python is a very developer-friendly language, which means that anyone can learn to code it in a couple of hours or days.</p>
<h3 id="readability">🎯 Readability</h3>
<p>One of the biggest reasons for Python’s rapid growth is the simplicity of its syntax. The language reads almost like plain English, making it easy to write complex programs. Here is an example</p>
<pre><code>a = <span>1</span>
b = <span>1</span>
<span>if</span> a <span>is</span> b:
    print(<span>"Hi"</span>)
a = <span>2000</span>
print(<span>"Yeah!"</span>) <span>if</span> a % <span>2</span> == <span>0</span> <span>else</span> print(<span>"No!"</span>)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="object-oriented-language">🎯 Object-Oriented Language</h3>
<p>Python is <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">Object-Oriented languages</a>. The term object-oriented means it supports the concept of classes, method, object encapsulation, and many more. Here is an example code of OOP</p>
<pre><code><span><span>class</span> <span>Car</span>:</span>
    <span><span>def</span> <span>__init__</span>(<span>self, color, model, year</span>):</span>
        self.color = color
        self.model = model
        self.year = year
</code></pre>
<h3 id="free-open-source-and-cross-platform">🎯 Free, Open Source and Cross-Platform</h3>
<p>Python is an open-source programming language, which means that anyone can create and contribute to its development. Python has an online forum where thousands of coders gather daily to improve this language further. Along with this, Python is free to download and use in any operating system, be it Windows, Mac, or Linux.</p>
<h3 id="graphical-user-interfaces">🎯 Graphical User Interfaces</h3>
<p>Python supports a wide array of GUIs which can easily be imported and make the results more visual. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/">PyQt5</a> is the most popular option for creating graphical apps with Python.</p>
<h3 id="dynamic-memory-management">🎯 Dynamic Memory Management</h3>
<p>Python supports automatic memory management, which means the memory is cleared and freed automatically. You do not have to bother clearing the memory.</p>
<h3 id="exception-handling">🎯 Exception Handling</h3>
<p>Python supports exception handling, which means we can write fewer errors in code and test various scenarios that can cause an exception. Here is an example code</p>
<pre><code><span>try</span>:
    a=<span>5</span>
    b=<span>0</span>
    <span>print</span> (a/b)
<span>except</span> TypeError:
    print(<span>'Unsupported operation'</span>)
<span>except</span> ZeroDivisionError:
    <span>print</span> (<span>'Division by zero not allowed'</span>)

-------------output ----------------------
&gt; Division by zero <span>not</span> allowed
</code></pre>
<h3 id="highly-dynamic">🎯 Highly Dynamic</h3>
<p>Python is one of the most dynamic languages available in the industry today. It means that the type of a variable is decided at the run time and not in advance. Due to this feature's presence, we do not need to specify the variable's type during coding, thus saving time and increasing efficiency. Here is an example code in the C language</p>
<pre><code><span>#<span>include</span> <span>&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span>

<span><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> </span>{
    <span>int</span> a = <span>1</span>;
    <span>printf</span>(<span>"%d"</span>, a);
    <span>return</span> <span>0</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Let's see the same code in Python.</p>
<pre><code>a = <span>1</span>
print(a)
</code></pre>
<h3 id="large-standard-library">🎯 Large Standard Library</h3>
<p>Python has a large standard library which provides a rich set of module and functions, so you do not have to write your own code for every single thing. There are many libraries present in python for such as regular expressions, unit-testing, web browsers, etc.</p>
<h3 id="portable">🎯 Portable</h3>
<p>If you are running Python on Windows and you need to shift the same to either a Mac or a Linux system, you can easily achieve the same in Python without worrying about changing the code.</p>


<p>Apart from learning, Python is a very efficient language used in almost every sphere of modern computing. This makes a strong case for learning Python, even for non-programmers. Some of Python’s main applications are highlighted below:</p>
<p><img src="https://imgur.com/qg46Qqy.jpg" alt="https://imgur.com/qg46Qqy.jpg"></p>
<p>Fig: Applications of Python</p>

<h3 id="web-development">📌 Web Development</h3>
<p>Python can be used to make a web application at a rapid rate. That because the frameworks like <a target="_blank" href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/">Flask</a> are uses to create these applications. Python frameworks are known for their security, scalability, and flexibility.</p>
<h3 id="game-development">📌 Game Development</h3>
<p>Python is also used in the development of interactive games. There are libraries such as <a target="_blank" href="http://www.lesfleursdunormal.fr/static/informatique/soya3d/index_en.html">PySoy</a>, a 3D game engine supporting Python 3, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted">PyGame</a>, which provides functionality, and a library for game development. Games such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2">Battlefield 2</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://civilization.com/civilization-4/">Civilization IV</a>, Disney's Toontown Online, and many more have been build using Python.</p>
<h3 id="artificial-intelligence">📌 Artificial Intelligence</h3>
<p>A major advantage of using Python for AI is that it comes with inbuilt libraries. Python has libraries for almost all kinds of AI projects. For example, <a target="_blank" href="http://numpy.org/">NumPy</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>, <a target="_blank" href="http://matplotlib.org/">matplotlib</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nltk.org/">nltk</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://simpleai.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SimpleAI</a> are important inbuilt libraries of Python.</p>
<h3 id="machine-learning">📌 Machine Learning</h3>
<p>Machine learning and artificial intelligence are the most promising careers for the future. We make the computer learn based on past experiences through the data stored or, better yet, create algorithms that make the computer learn. Python has libraries for almost all kinds of ML projects. Libraries like <a target="_blank" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://scikit-learn.org/stable/">Scikit-learn</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">TensorFlow</a>, and many more.</p>
<h3 id="data-science-and-data-visualization">📌 Data Science and Data Visualization</h3>
<p>Creating visualizations really helps make things clearer and easier to understand, especially with larger, high dimensional datasets. Libraries such as <a target="_blank" href="https://pandas.pydata.org/">Pandas</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://numpy.org/">NumPy</a> help you in extracting information. You can even visualize the data libraries, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://matplotlib.org/">Matplotlib and</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</a>, which help plot graphs and much more.</p>
<h3 id="desktop-gui">📌 Desktop GUI</h3>
<p>Python an excellent choice for developing desktop-based GUI applications. Python offers many GUI toolkits and frameworks that make desktop application development a breeze. <a target="_blank" href="https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro">PyQt</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">PyGtk</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://kivy.org/">Kivy</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html">Tkinter</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://wxpython.org/">WxPython</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cosc.canterbury.ac.nz/greg.ewing/python_gui/">PyGUI</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="http://pyside.github.io/docs/pyside/">PySide</a> are some of the best Python-based GUI frameworks that allow developers to create highly functional Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs).</p>
<h3 id="business-application">📌 Business Application</h3>
<p>Enterprise-level software or business applications are strikingly different from standard applications, as the former demands feature like readability, extensibility, and scalability. This is where Python can make a significant difference. Python high performance, scalability, flexibility, and readability are just the features required for developing fully-functional and efficient business applications.</p>
<h3 id="web-scrapping">📌 Web Scrapping</h3>
<p>A python is a nifty tool for pulling a large amount of data from websites, which can help in various real-world processes, including job listings, price comparison, and so on. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">BeautifulSoup</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.selenium.dev/">Selenium</a>, and <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.html">Urllib</a> are some of the best Python-based web scraping tools.</p>
<h3 id="image-and-video-processing">📌 Image and Video Processing</h3>
<p>Image Processing is thus the process of analyzing and manipulating a digital image primarily aimed at improving its quality or for extracting some information from it, which could then be put to some use. Python offers many libraries, such as <a target="_blank" href="https://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_imgproc/py_table_of_contents_imgproc/py_table_of_contents_imgproc.html">OpenCV</a>.</p>
<h3 id="embedded-application">📌 Embedded Application</h3>
<p>Python can be used to create <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embedded_C">Embedded C</a> software for embedded applications. The most well-known embedded application could be the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>, which uses Python for its computing. We can also use it as a computer or like a simple embedded board to perform high-level computations.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion 👌</h2>
<p>In conclusion, Python is capable of handling almost any development requirement. No matter what field you take up, Python is rewarding. In the last few years, Python applications have gained newfound traction in Data Science, particularly in Machine Learning. Python is a great way to start a developer's journey. </p>

<p>One day, his boss came with a new project. “We need to build a new complex application for our new important customer.” Nice, our hero loves challenges! “But we need to do it fast, as we have a short deadline because they have an important marketing event!” Ok, how fast do we need to build an app? “It needs to be ready for yesterday. And it needs to be real-time and scalable!”</p>

<p>The new project is a big challenge for our hero, as he never did that kind of project. Can he even do it?</p>

<p>“You can do it,” his boss says. “I also hired a famous consultant to help you.” That’s awesome! Challenge accepted.</p>

<p>After a full-day meeting with the consultant, and a whiteboard full of weird diagrams, the plan was simple: “Just use Kubernetes!”</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/02-consultant.png" alt=""></p>

<p>But our hero doesn’t know Kubernetes. And there’s no time to learn it now. What should he do?</p>

<p>He started wondering if he is the only one who doesn’t know Kubernetes. Is he good enough for this job?</p>

<p>Our hero spent a sleepless night in front of his computer with his faithful sidekick, a rubber duck. He tried to learn as much as he can about this new technology. But he ended up more confused and tired.</p>

<h2 id="you-should-try-serverless-graphql">You should try Serverless GraphQL</h2>

<p>In the middle of the night, our hero’s faithful sidekick said, “you should try serverless GraphQL.”</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/04-try-serverless-graphql.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Was he dreaming? And what the heck is serverless GraphQL? He knows what serverless is, but what’s GraphQL?</p>

<h3 id="whats-graphql">What’s GraphQL</h3>

<p>Do you remember when Mark Zuckerberg <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2012/09/11/mark-zuckerberg-our-biggest-mistake-with-mobile-was-betting-too-much-on-html5/">said</a>, “our biggest mistake was betting too much on HTML5?” It was a long time ago, back in 2012, when HTML5 was in its early days.</p>

<p>At that moment, the Facebook mobile app was an HTML5 web app embedded in the native mobile shell. They served all the news feed updates as HTML data from the server. However, HTML5 was in its early days, and the mobile web views were not performant enough, so the app wasn’t stable and scalable enough.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/05-fb-mobile-app.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In 2012, Facebook’s engineering team started rebuilding their mobile and switching to the native iOS and Android apps. They evaluated different options for delivering the news feed data, including RESTful services  and Facebook Query Language (FQL).</p>

<p>In the <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/09/14/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/">“GraphQL: A data query language”</a> article in 2015, Lee Byron wrote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We were frustrated with the differences between the data we wanted to use in our apps and the server queries they required. We don’t think of data in terms of resource URLs, secondary keys, or join tables; we think about it in terms of a graph of objects and the models we ultimately use in our apps like NSObjects or JSON.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This frustration led the Facebook engineering team to rethink the way they serve data to their mobile application. Instead of returning a full model with a lot of unnecessary data, they tried to develop a new system to return only the data the application needed.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/06-data.png" alt=""></p>

<p>In 2015, they <a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/09/14/core-data/graphql-a-data-query-language/">announced</a> GraphQL, an open-source data query language. The idea behind GraphQL was simple, the client defines the data structure, and the server provides a JSON response with precisely the same format.</p>

<p>For example, the client wants to get the user with a specified ID. However, the application needs only the user’s name, a profile photo with a specific size, and the first five friend connections. Instead of sending two or three different requests to the RESTful API, with GraphQL, you can send a request similar to the one in the image below. And the response will be the JSON with the same structure, as you can see on the right side of the same image.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/07-an-example.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>That sounds nice and smart. But why should our hero care about GraphQL? He doesn’t have the same problem Facebook had.</p>

<p>The problem Facebook’s engineering team had was the leading cause for inventing GraphQL. However, that’s not the only problem GraphQL solves. If you have one of the following symptoms, GraphQL might be the cure for the problems your application faces, too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Distinct front end clients for multiple platforms, such as web and mobile, have different data requirements.</li>
  <li>Your back end serves data to your client apps from different sources. For example, your app has SQL and NoSQL databases, and it connects to some external systems.</li>
  <li>Your app has a complex state and caching managements for both front end and back end.</li>
  <li>Slow pages, especially on mobile, caused by multiple dependant HTTP requests.</li>
</ul>

<p>This list is not complete, and GraphQL can bring even more benefits to your application. Some of the main characteristics of GraphQL are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It defines a data shape. The request always specifies the response’s form, which makes requests more predictable and easier to use.</li>
  <li>It’s hierarchical. Its strict relation between objects with graph-structured data simplifies getting data from multiple sources.</li>
  <li>It’s strongly typed. It can give you descriptive error messages before you run a query.</li>
  <li>It’s a protocol, not storage. Each GraphQL field is backed by a function on the back end, which allows you to connect it to any storage you want in the background.</li>
  <li>It’s introspective. You can query the GraphQL server for the types it supports. This gives you built-in documentation and also a base for a powerful toolset.</li>
  <li>It’s version free. The shape of the data is always defined by the client’s request, which means adding additional fields to your model will not affect your client application until you change the query itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>To combine data from multiple sources using RESTful API, you often send multiple HTTP requests and then connect data on the client-side. This works fine in perfect conditions. However, users don’t always use your app in ideal conditions. They are often on mobile with a limited or unstable network. Or they live in Australia, and each request is a few hundred milliseconds slower.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/08-multiple-data-sources.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>With GraphQL, you can archive the same with a single request. This will push a bit more load to the server-side, but that works just fine in most cases. It’s even better when you don’t own the server.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/09-graphql-request.gif" alt=""></p>

<h3 id="where-to-start-with-graphql">Where to start with GraphQL</h3>

<p>With GraphQL, you start by shaping your data using types. For example, if you are building a blog, you will have an author and a post, similar to the following code snippet. Each post will have its id, a name, a title, and an author. Authors have their ids, names, and a list of their posts.</p>

<p>As you can see, types also define a relation between an author and posts.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>
  </span><span>name</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>posts</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Post</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Post</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>
  </span><span>title</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>text</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>
  </span><span>author</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once you have types, you can build your GraphQL schema. In the code snippet below, we define two queries: get author by ID and get posts by title. Each of these queries defines input parameters with their types and a return type.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>type</span><span> </span><span>Query</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>getAuthor</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Int</span><span>):</span><span> </span><span>Author</span><span>
  </span><span>getPostsByTitle</span><span>(</span><span>titleContains</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>String</span><span>):</span><span> </span><span>[</span><span>Post</span><span>]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>

</span><span>schema</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>query</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>Query</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>As GraphQL is not storage but a protocol, we need to tell GraphQL where and how it can read the data by creating resolvers. In the following code snippet, we define two resolvers: one for the author that connects to the SQL database and one for a list of posts sends an HTTP request to the blog platform API.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>getAuthor(_, args){
  return sql.raw('SELECT * FROM authors WHERE id = %s', args.id);
}

posts(author){
  return request(`https://api.blog.io/by_author/${author.id}`);
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we can run the query. As we defined queries, we can ask for an author by their ID. Relations allow us to get a list of all author’s posts in the same request. And if we ask for the author’s name for each blog post, that name will be the same as the author’s name above because it points to the same author.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>getAuthor</span><span>(</span><span>id</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>5</span><span>){</span><span>
    </span><span>name</span><span>
    </span><span>posts</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>title</span><span>
      </span><span>author</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
        </span><span># this will be the same as the name above</span><span>
        </span><span>name</span><span>
      </span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Once we run the query, GraphQL will parse the request, then validate the types and data shape, and finally, if the first two steps are correct, it will run the query and our resolvers. Once we receive the data, it’ll look similar to the following JSON data:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Slobodan"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"posts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>[{</span><span>
    </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"The power of serverless GraphQL with AppSync"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"author"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Slobodan"</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>},</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
    </span><span>"title"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Handling webhooks with EventBridge, SAM and SAR"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>"author"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
      </span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Slobodan"</span><span>
    </span><span>}</span><span>
  </span><span>}]</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>By GraphQL specification, queries read the data. GraphQL specification also defines mutations and subscriptions. Mutations modify the existing data (i.e., add a new author or edit post), and subscriptions can notify you whenever the data is changed (i.e., it’ll run whenever the post is published).</p>

<h3 id="why-do-we-need-serverless-graphql">Why do we need serverless GraphQL?</h3>

<p>“You can always deploy your GraphQL using Kubernetes and write your resolvers by hand,” the rubber duck said, “but there’s an easier way.”</p>

<p>GraphQL makes retrieving your data from the client-side effortless, but you still need to manage and scale your infrastructure. And now, you have one central place that controls all of your requests. Unless you do the same you do with the other web applications – make your application serverless. Serverless GraphQL brings the best of both worlds: GraphQL makes you client-to-server connection effortless, and serverless simplifies maintenance of your infrastructure.</p>

<p><img src="https://serverless.pub/img/the-power-of-serverless-graphql/10-scaling.png" alt=""></p>

<p>“Interesting, but how do I make GraphQL application serverless?”</p>

<p>“There are many ways to do that,” the rubber duck said. “You can do that manually using the familiar serverless services. For example, on AWS, you can use Amazon API …</p></div></div></div></div>

<![CDATA[Why the Release of Ruby 3 Will Be Monumental]]>

<br/>
November 15, 2020 | https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ruby3.dev/the-art-of-code/2020/11/12/ruby-3-monumental/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’ve been living in the shadow of Ruby 2 for seven years now. Seven! <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2013/02/24/ruby-2-0-0-p0-is-released/">Ruby 2 was released in 2013</a> (which incidentally is the same year as the initial public release of React 0.3.0!).</p>

<p>In that span of time, Ruby performance has improved <em>significantly</em> and many, many enhancements to the language have benefited a great many people and projects. We’ve seen companies using Ruby and in many cases Rails become bedrocks of developer and consumer internet infrastructure. GitHub. Shopify. Stripe. Square. AirBnB.</p>

<p>But there has also been some consternation along the way. Is Ruby really a top-tier programming language able to compete with the likes of Javascript, Python, PHP, Go, and beyond? Or was it just a DHH-fueled hype-cycle doomed to inevitable relative obscurity as other technologies and frameworks ascended in its wake? (I don’t actually believe anyone seriously thinks this any more, but you still see the stray head-scratcher whiz by on Hacker News.)</p>

<p>Now we are mere weeks away from a major new Ruby release: version 3. While Ruby 3 is an exciting update with lots of features that make it interesting both now and in the future with various point updates promising even more goodies, I think it’s the <strong>psychology</strong> of turning over from major version 2 to 3 that is most vital to the future health of the community.</p>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just a new version. <strong>It’s a new era.</strong></p>

<p>What does this era represent? Let’s list a few talking points I hope we’ll start to push <em>hard</em> and <em>often</em> as Rubyists:</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-fast">Ruby 3 is Fast</h3>

<p>No, I don’t mean Ruby 3 suddenly got a whole lot faster than Ruby 2.7. I mean that Ruby 3 is <em>fast compared to Ruby 2</em>. It’s unfortunate that much of the “Ruby is slow” meme has been a laggard perspective stemming from people’s experiences <em>years ago</em> with the language, or an old version of Rails, or Jekyll, or…the fact is it just wasn’t the zippy experience we’re pleased to enjoy today.</p>

<p>Do we still want even better performance? Of course! But at this point, Ruby is plenty fast as compared to many other “scripting” languages. Most of the time it’s on par with Python. It’s even on par with Javascript. (What? Don’t believe me? <a href="https://css-tricks.com/comparing-static-site-generator-build-times/">Check out how similar Jekyll and Eleventy perform as static site generators.</a>) And as Nate Berskopec often reminds us, your Rails app can perform quite well with just a bit of fine-tuning, and often the typical bottlenecks lie elsewhere in the stack (database, web server, etc.)</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-easy">Ruby 3 is Easy</h3>

<p>These days, you don’t need to wrestle with gem dependency hell or pray to the gods to get Ruby or a Ruby extension to compile. That was “old Ruby”. New Ruby is using a fancy-pants version manager like <code>rbenv</code> combined with Bundler 2.</p>

<p><strong>It just works.</strong></p>

<p>Truly, Ruby is the first thing I install on any new Mac or Linux machine I operate and getting things set up is a piece of cake. Installing Rails. Installing Bridgetown. Installing…whatever. It. Just. Works.</p>

<p>We also have things like Docker and WSL to make things <em>much</em> easier to accomplish on Windows machines if you get stuck wrestling with Win-native Ruby. Heck, you can upload your entire dev environment into the cloud now and use VSCode with remote extensions.</p>

<p>Are there ways Bundler and the ecosystem around Ruby versions/dependencies could be improved? No doubt. But it’s in no way any more complicated or fiddly than the world of npm/yarn, and you don’t see the angry hordes trying to burn down the barn doors over there (except maybe the Deno folks 😉).</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-sleek">Ruby 3 is Sleek</h3>

<p>Ruby isn’t the best choice for all problem domains. It just isn’t. But when it comes to “standard” web development, it often <em>is</em> the best choice. It really is! Spend a few days writing NestJS + TypeORM Typescript code and then come back to Rails. It’s like a breath of fresh, sweet air. And that’s not just when you’re writing controllers or models…it goes all the way up and down the stack.</p>

<p>Ruby just makes everything <em>better</em>. Less code. Less boilerplate. Less ceremony. More streamlined. More properly object-oriented. More polished and pleasurable to read and write. Certainly one could posit there are other web frameworks/languages which have much going for them as well. Laravel is popular with PHP devs, and for good reason. Django is popular with Pythonistas. But can anyone say with a straight face that, all things being equal, PHP is a “superior” programming language to Ruby? Can anyone say that Python—taken as a whole—is more suited to building a website than Ruby is?</p>

<p>I think not. While Ruby wasn’t originally invented as a way to supercharge web development, it found its niche in the rise of such amazing projects as Rails, Rack, Jekyll, plus great APIs by Stripe and many others. It rode much of the early wave of Web 2.0 hits, and that heritage continues to benefit us today.</p>

<h3 id="ruby-3-is-here-to-stay">Ruby 3 is Here to Stay</h3>

<p>Ruby 3 isn’t just another notch on the belt of recent Ruby releases. It’s <strong>Ruby 3.0</strong>. That means we can look forward to 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and beyond. This is the beginning of a whole new era. New innovations. New patterns. Exciting ideas fusing concepts from other technologies with The Ruby Way. Fresh blood coming into the ecosystem. (Anecdotally, I’m seeing newbies plus returning old-timers jumping into Ruby-based forums and chat rooms <em>all the time</em>, and the pace of interesting new Ruby gems bursting onto the scene finally seems to be increasing after a few years of ho-hum incremental progress.)</p>

<p>The takeaway is this: Ruby 3 represents a moment when we should stand proud as Rubyists and unabashedly proclaim to the bootcamps and engineering departments of the world that we’re open and ready to do business large and small. Sure you could pick something other than Ruby with which to build the next great internet success story. But you’ll definitely be in good company if you do pick Ruby. After all, it’s more likely than not your code will be living in a repository overseen by Ruby (GitHub), you’ll be communicating with your fellow colleagues via Ruby (Basecamp &amp; HEY), you’ll be asking for support via Ruby (Discourse forums), you’ll be researching the latest developer news and techniques via Ruby (Dev.to), and you’ll be spinning up your dev machine while wearing that l33t geek t-shirt you got from an indie vendor via Ruby (Shopify)—that is, after you paid for it via Ruby (Stripe). And when you’re exhausted from all that coding and need to unwind at a private cottage by the beach, Ruby will help you out there too (AirBnB).</p>

<p><em>Excelsior!</em></p>

<p>
or <b>Better Digital Living By Making Things Harder For Yourself</b><br>
or <b>I spent a Year Without Facebook and Google - Here's What Happened Next</b><br>
</p>

<p><em>Autumn 2020</em></p>


<p>
It's easy to grow disillusioned with tech, even to the point that it 
appals you. I've been using computers since 1988 and the net since 1995
and over time, something's happened. During the last decade or so, my 
mind has increasingly been preoccupied with the following thoughts:
</p>

<ul>
<li>I'm no longer in control of my computer and my OS.</li>
<li>The modern web is a cesspool of tracking scripts, ads, 
malware and clickbait designed to suck you in and make you stupid.</li>
<li>Even the most premium commercial software and hardware more often
than not comes with contraptions to spy on you.</li>
<li>"Cloud apps" are replacing programs I'd much rather run natively.</li>
<li>Thus, we sacrifice our privacy and intellects for faux conveniences.</li>
<li>The Idealist Net we fondly remember is long dead and unlikely to come
back.</li>
<li>...but there are still pockets of sanity left.</li>
</ul>

<p>
As a child of the home computer boom, I'm used to general purpose 
machines that do my bidding without interference from neither the 
manufacturer nor some unknown other wanting to sell me Depends and 
Bitcoins. That's what I want my computing to <i>still</i> be like.
</p>

<p>
The Man wants something different, though. The Man wants you to log in, 
click accept, sell your soul and Buy More Stuff. Hence, working to avoid 
that must be some level of subversive computing: Sticking it to The Man, 
one bit at a time.
</p>

<p>
In this text, I'll try to outline how I do my best to achieve that. Fair 
warning: it doesn't come without what some would call sacrifice, because 
you can't have the cake and eat it. This "sacrifice", however, might 
ultimately turn out to be beneficial.
</p>

<h2>What I absolutely do not use</h2>

<h3>Facebook</h3>

<p>
This is a dead giveaway, of course. No facebook and no facebook services 
(E.G. instagram, whatsapp, messenger, etc).
</p>

<p>
Quitting was, considering the circumstances, very easy. I'd had a 
facebook account since 2007 and I used to live there, sometimes posting 
several times a day and checking in much more often. In the summer of 
2019, I wrote a goodbye post and the day after, I closed my account. 
This is more than a year ago now and I don't miss it.
</p>

<p>
I had an Instagram account for a while, but only used it for maybe a 
month or two. It's the second stupidest "service" available on the net 
right now, and that's saying a lot: It is, quite literally, a site 
where millions of people post daily photos of their dinners. To put it 
as nicely as I can: Instagram has absolutely zero content of any kind of 
real importance to anyone.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None, really. It turns out that people who are 
interested in meeting with or talking to you will send an email or text 
or perhaps even call you. I'm also particularly thankful I didn't have to
witness the COVID-19 debacle unfold on social media.
</p>

<h3>Twitter</h3>

<p>
Beating Instagram, Twitter is currently the stupidest site on the net. 
Best described as a slowly decomposing swamp of infighting and political 
bickering, it's full of people who will not yield a millimeter in any 
direction and will never, ever change their opinions about anything.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> None. Ditching twitter is something I advice 
everyone to do, even those who will gladly sell their DNA for a bit of 
"free" online convenience. You'll feel much more at peace with the world 
without it.
</p>

<h3>Google</h3>

<p>
If facebook is a dead giveaway, this is the truly crucial part of the 
concept. Facebook deals with distractions - Google deals with 
infrastructure. No longer one of many actors on the net, their monopoly 
quite simply dictates what goes and what doesn't. A recent reminder was 
when their domain blacklisting suddenly identified 
pouet.net, an innocent site for discussing the demo scene, as a spreader 
of malware. Things were, as usual, only resolved because someone knew 
someone who worked at Google. To discourage their thuggish, predatory 
behavior, we should avoid them in any way possible.
</p>

<p>
I closed down my Google account together with my Facebook account. I 
haven't missed that one, either. I also switched to searching with 
DuckDuckGo. The major point here is to <i>not</i> find a "replacement 
Google", such as Office 365 and Onedrive. That's not taking back control 
over your data, that's just handing it to the next buffoon for continued 
mining.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I now pay for my email. A mom-and-pop hosts it 
all for a very reasonable yearly fee and they throw in some pretty 
decent web hosting, too. Complete self-hosting would of course be ideal 
from a privacy standpoint, but I'm happy with this solution. I can also 
mount the home directory through sshfs, which makes it an excellent 
"cloud drive". When I've been in contact with their customer support,
they've been timely, friendly, efficient and professional.
</p>

<p>
All things considered, it's probably nowhere near as safe 
from third-party intrusion and reliable against service outage as 
the Google equivalent, but then again I didn't use Google Drive for
anything important, either. That's what my hard drives and USB sticks are for. 
Don't hand over the stuff that matters to third parties if you can avoid 
it.
</p>

<p>
<b>Caveat:</b> Some people might actually need Google Docs for work, because 
employers like to force their employees into certain ecosystems. I'm 
forced into other ecosystems by mine, see
<a href="#tacs">Tradeoffs and Concessions</a>
below. The best option in these cases is of course to use it exclusively for 
work, exclusively on your work computer and in a separate web browser if
possible.
</p>

<h3>Many more sites</h3>

<p>
There are tons of sites, services and apps I don't use, for example 
Paypal and Dropbox. In fact, I avoid most sites where I have to register 
an account.
</p>

<h3>Phone Apps</h3>

<p>
My employer supplies me with a smartphone. On it I keep only the apps I 
need for work and banking. When commuting was still a thing, I also 
listened to Spotify. Other than that, I try to use it as little as 
possible these days. I do carry it with me, though: it mostly works fine 
as a phone and mobile phones are pretty damn convenient.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> I've never been fond of having a lot of apps.
Most of them are pointless and solve completely invented problems.
</p>

<h3>My local newspaper</h3>

<p>
I used to pay for an online subscription, until I just decided to stop 
one day. Apart from the poor quality of journalism, the biased reporting and 
the insipid editorial texts, I was basically paying money to keep feeding 
the online ad machine. That's a no-go.
</p>

<p>
<b>Coping strategy:</b> It's probably a reasonable idea to keep somewhat 
informed about current events. <a href="#news">See "News" below.</a>
</p>

<h2>Things I do use</h2>

<h3>Linux</h3>

<p>
In terms of user empowerment, even Canonical's Ubuntu with its telemetry 
and mysterious snap packages is so far a much better choice than any 
proprietary home computer OS on the market. From a privacy standpoint, 
other distributions, such as Debian and Slackware, are of course even 
better.
</p>

<h3>Native software</h3>

<p>
Turns out there are plenty of good programs that can be used completely 
offline and will let you store your files locally. They're not even hard 
to find. A few tips: Abiword, GNumeric, The Gimp, WordGrinder, 
Audacious.
</p>


<h3>The Web</h3>

<h4>The web, method one: Links2</h4>

<p>
The web still has good parts and I want to get at those good parts. 
Turns out the really good parts are usually remnants of The Old Web, 
consisting of HTML and great content.
</p>

<p>
I try to do as much web browsing as possible in Links2. It's a fast, 
lean browser with zero support for JavaScript and CSS. The latter means 
some sites look a bit funky. The former means some sites won't work at 
all. My usual strategy for sites that won't render without JavaScript is 
to simply ignore them. If they can't produce something worthwhile 
without scripting, it's probably not worthwhile at all.
</p>

<p>
On the plus side, no JavaScript means that most trackers and other spy- 
and malware just won't run at all. Since Links doesn't save <i>any</i> 
cookies between sessions, other means of tracking will at least be kept 
somewhat confused. The flip side is that it's probably an extremely 
unique browser fingerprint.
</p>

<h4>The web, method two: RSS and native applications</h4>

<p>
You can subscribe to Youtube channels, subreddits and pretty much every 
blog out there using RSS. There are also plenty of specialized TUI:s and 
CLI:s for interfacing with various popular websites such as Youtube and 
Reddit.
</p>

<h4>The web, method three: Firefox with UBlock Origin</h4>

<p>
For some things, like banking and filing taxes, the Internet really has 
made things so much more convenient I don't want to live without them. 
Although my bank could easily provide the services I use completely 
without a single line of JavaScript, they have decided not to. This also 
goes for most online shopping. For these types of sites, I use Firefox.
</p>

<h3>Youtube</h3>

<p>
There's still plenty of worthwhile content published on Youtube, not 
least recordings of demo scene productions for obscure hardware.
</p>

<p>
I watch Youtube using my own <a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/yt">tube script</a> in 
combination with a media player. It's not ideal, since Google will be 
able to infer a bit about my habits through my IP (although that could 
of course be mitigated using a VPN) and some videos don't work due to 
various restrictions imposed by their creators (or copyright laws). 
Somewhere around 90% of them do though, especially the interesting 
ones such as Computerphile and Numberphile. The upside is freedom from 
ads and algorithmic "recommendations": I watch only the videos I really 
want to watch.
</p>

<h3>Wikipedia</h3>

<p>
Still a useful and usable site.
</p>

<h3 id="news">News</h3>

<p>
Most of the content produced by news media is either clickbait or some 
kind of "commentary" by "experts" on actual headline news, which can 
then be milked for another couple of days. More often than not, the 
reporting is either misinformed, or biased, or both. Still, keeping 
somewhat updated can be beneficial for private decision making and 
overall …</p></div></div>

<p>While contributing to a big OSS project it’s quite useful to know how to do a Git rebase. And more importantly: don’t be afraid of the Git force push. In this post I will write a little about the why and the how.</p>



<h2>The Backstory</h2>



<p>Finally, your change is ready for the world to see. You have gathered the courage to open that PR and hope it will get merged soon. Unfortunately reality is that your PR might be sitting there for a while. Meanwhile, development goes on and the branch you are targeting with your PR gets updated. </p>



<p>While this happens, conflicts may arise. These are conflicts between your code changes in the PR and other changes that got merged into the target branch. What you could do is merge the changes from the target branch into your PR branch. That will however give a lot of merge commits and isn’t very clean. Another way is to do a rebase.</p>



<p>To make the example more specific. On the Xamarin.Forms repository we might ask you to do a rebase whenever there are conflicts. Another reason might be that you have just opened the PR at a time where the tests or build were in a bad state. Or your code hooks into new code that is now added in the target branch. As you can see, there are a lot of reasons for a rebase.</p>



<h2>What is a Git Rebase exactly?</h2>



<p>This is where things start to get a bit scary, because it involves rewriting history due to force pushing. Let me expand on that. What will happen during a Git rebase is that the commits you want to add to the codebase are replayed on top of the target branch.</p>



<p>Imagine you want to add commits to the master branch. Since you opened the PR, new commits were added to the master branch. When you do a Git rebase you take that latest state of the master branch. Then commit by commit your changes are re-added on top of the latest state on master. After each commit is replayed there is a check if there are conflicts which you should then fix, but more on that later.</p>



<p>Have a look at the graphic below which will hopefully make it a bit more clear. On the left you see a merge, in the middle is your typically branching and on the right you can see a rebase. Imagine that the yellow dots are master and the purple ones are your branch/PR.</p>







<h2>Doing a Git Rebase</h2>



<p>Now on to the actual doing. While there are some tools that will do it with a great GUI, I will show you how to do it with the command-line. That will show what is actually going on under the hood. To make things a bit more visual I will use a GUI tool. I actually really like the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="GitHub Desktop client (opens in a new tab)" href="https://desktop.github.com/" target="_blank">GitHub Desktop client</a>, simple yet effective.</p>



<h3>RadioButton PR</h3>



<p>I have a PR that I am still working on to add a RadioButton to the Xamarin.Forms toolkit. I want to ultimately merge it into master. It has been sitting there for a while now while master has had several changes added. In the screenshot from GitHub Desktop below you can see the current state.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-852x1024.png" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-852x1024.png" alt="Screenshot of the commit history for the RadioButton branch" width="426" height="512" data-srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-852x1024.png 852w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-250x300.png 250w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-768x923.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled.png 998w" data-sizes="(max-width: 426px) 100vw, 426px" srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-852x1024.png 852w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-250x300.png 250w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled-768x923.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Untitled.png 998w"><figcaption>Commit history for the RadioButton branch</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>The commits marked in red at the bottom of the list are the latest changes on master at that time. Everything above that are the commits that hold the changes we want merged into master. You will see that Andrei made a great start with this PR and now I am taking over. If we take a quick look at the current state of the master branch, we will see the history as shown in the screenshot underneath.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141.png" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141.png" alt="Current state of the master branch" width="494" height="442" data-srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141.png 988w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141-300x268.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141-768x687.png 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 494px) 100vw, 494px" srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141.png 988w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141-300x268.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Aantekening-2020-01-07-092141-768x687.png 768w"><figcaption>Current state of the master branch</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>I’m just showing you this so you will have a reference point and you know what to look for during the rebasing process. Note the top commit here, we expect that to show up directly under our own commits in the new history.</p>



<h3>Git Rebase onto Master</h3>



<p>The first thing we will do is open a command-line window. I will be showing you this on Windows, but everything works just the same on Mac or Linux if you will. Open the command-line and point it to the folder of your local Git repository. Then you type:</p>



<p><code>git rebase -i origin/master</code></p>



<p>The <code>git rebase</code> part is probably clear, that is the actual command. Then, we have the <code>-i</code> option. Which means you want to do an interactive rebase. The only thing this does is show you which commits are going to be rebased. You even have the option to remove commits, squash them, etc. although that is not something we will be doing now. Lastly, you see the <code>origin/master</code> part. That is the target branch. What we are doing here is basically saying: give me the latest situation on <code>origin/master</code> and replay the commits interactively from the branch I’m currently on. Does that make sense?</p>



<p>When confirming this command, you will see output like in the screenshot below.</p>



<figure><img width="1024" height="568" src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1024x568.png" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1024x568.png" alt="Vim editor showing the commits we want to git rebase" data-srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1024x568.png 1024w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-300x166.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-768x426.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1536x852.png 1536w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase.png 1838w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1024x568.png 1024w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-300x166.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-768x426.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase-1536x852.png 1536w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/InteractiveRebase.png 1838w"><figcaption>Vim editor showing the commits we want to git rebase</figcaption></figure>



<p>You will notice that these are the same commits as we saw in the earlier screenshot. The commits in this list which are prefixed with <code>pick</code> will be the commits that are replayed on top of the target branch. You can see all other commands below. </p>



<p>If, for some reason, there are commits in this list that you would like to exclude, just delete the lines by tapping d on your keyboard. You could also put a # in front of the line to comment it out. Or you could put the letter d or word drop in front of the line to exclude it from the rebase.</p>



<h3>Escaping Vim</h3>



<p>Don’t be alarmed, I will tell you how to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="get out of here (opens in a new tab)" href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/05/23/stack-overflow-helping-one-million-developers-exit-vim/" target="_blank">get out of here</a>. But the interactive part has just opened Vim for you. After you have made all the changes, simply tap <strong>esc</strong> followed by typing <code>:qw!</code>. This will exit Vim (q), save the changes (w) and not ask for confirmation (!). </p>



<p>After you did, in the best case, your rebase is done! Hooray, congrats, high fives for everyone!</p>



<h3>Dealing with Conflicts</h3>



<p>In a less ideal case, like mine, you will encounter a conflict. The changes that came in from your target branch edits were made in the same places as you made changes. The output from our rebase shows us what happened. You can see it in the screenshot underneath.</p>



<div><figure><img width="1024" height="568" src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1024x568.png" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1024x568.png" alt="Console windows showing conflicts after rebase" data-srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1024x568.png 1024w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-300x166.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-768x426.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1536x852.png 1536w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict.png 1838w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1024x568.png 1024w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-300x166.png 300w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-768x426.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict-1536x852.png 1536w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Conflict.png 1838w"><figcaption>Conflicts after rebase</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>No worries, we got this! You can either fall back to your GUI tool and solve it there, or simply open the conflicted files with your favorite editor. Actual Visual Studio Code is very good with these conflicts.</p>



<p>In my case, I have a conflict in the <code>ButtonRenderer.cs</code> file, I will open it up in Visual Studio Code. With VS Code you can easily identify the conflict and it also provides you with some quick actions to resolve it easily, although you are free to blend the changes together and solve it that way. You can see my conflict opened in VS Code underneath.</p>

<h3>Continuing the Git Rebase</h3>



<p>After you have resolved the conflict you mark the conflict as resolved by running <code>git add {path to file}</code> or if you want to remove the file altogether, replace “add” with “rm” for remove.</p>



<p>Now note that this happened after a certain commit. So, not all commits in the list we’ve seen before, but this conflict happened after one certain commit out of that list. That means, that after we resolved the conflict, we continue the rebase by typing <code>git rebase --continue</code>. This will take the next commit from the list and apply that.</p>



<p>From that commit another conflict might emerge and you rinse and repeat until you are done. If you’ve lost faith, you can do <code>git rebase --abort</code> to undo the whole thing and go back to things as before we started this.</p>



<h3>Rewriting History</h3>



<p>Now our Git rebase is done. What I like to do is to inspect if everything went the way I expected. To do this, I look at the new commit history. You can see the history in my GUI tool in the screenshot below.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-962x1024.png" data-src="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-962x1024.png" alt="Rewritten history of commits after our Git rebase" width="481" height="512" data-srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-962x1024.png 962w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-282x300.png 282w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-768x817.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory.png 998w" data-sizes="(max-width: 481px) 100vw, 481px" srcset="https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-962x1024.png 962w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-282x300.png 282w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory-768x817.png 768w, https://blog.verslu.is/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/NewHistory.png 998w"><figcaption>Rewritten history of commits after our Git rebase</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Notice how the commits at the bottom, in red, are the ones that were the most recent on the current master branch. Everything above the red box, are the commits that I wanted to rebase. Effectively, we have rewritten history! </p>



<p>However, this means there is one last scary part to overcome… The Git force push.</p>



<h2>Git Force Push</h2>



<p>Because we did rewrite history our branch is in a weird state. Remotely things look differently than we have locally. Locally we suddenly have all kinds of new commits from master that are not on our remote PR branch. Because of the rebase, our local branch is the leading one. This has all the latest bits from our target branch <em>and</em> includes all of our changes.</p>



<p>To get it all back into sync, we need to do a force push. With a force push we simply push all our local changes and overwrite whatever is on the remote branch. It sounds scary and it is! Because we simply rewrite everything on the remote branch this is a destructive operation so you should handle with care. If there are commits on the remote branch that you do not have locally, they will be gone after a force push.</p>



<p>After this post was published, Steve Gordon tweeted with a thing he’d like to add to this. Since I think it was a good addition, I’ve added the tweet for you below.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Great post on Git rebasing! One thing I'd add is that this is fairly safe on a personal GitHub fork and/or where you're reasonably confident no one else has pulled the remote branch you plan to force push. In other cases, rewrite remote history with caution. <a href="https://t.co/eNLEuGPPFz">https://t.co/eNLEuGPPFz</a></p>— Steve Gordon (@stevejgordon) <a href="https://twitter.com/stevejgordon/status/1214847644033523718?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 8, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>On the other hand, it is not as scary if you’ve done it a couple of times. Especially when you get the hang of doing rebases, and do force pushes more often. You do need to pay attention though and make sure that you got all the changes and commits you want. That is why I like to keep my rebase operation interactive and then inspect the outcome in a GUI tool, looking at the history.</p>



<p>OK, enough with the warnings. When you are ready, simply run this command:</p>



<p><code>git push --force</code></p>



<p>That will push everything from local to remote and everything is back in sync. It’s done! Now you know how to rebase. You can do this immediately after the rebase, or first add some more changes to your branch and push them along with everything else.</p>

    <p>Consider a team of engineers building a feature API for Snapchat. Let’s call them Ovah’s team. They’re facing two big problems: how to build it, and how long would it take.</p>

<p>If they can’t figure out how to build it, the feature is dead already. If they take too long to build it, the feature is as good as dead: Instagram would copy it before they’ve built it.</p>

<p>This post contains 4 different perspectives to look at the two problems. As you read through the perspectives, notice the tension in the examples. Both problems are vastly different, and some perspectives are better for one problem, and worse for another problem.</p>





<h2 id="the-outside-view">The Outside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_outside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the outside view, Ovah’s team compares this feature to other similar features they’ve built in the past. They built earlier features using Flask, and it took them 1 month to do it.</p>

<p>The outside view says that a good estimate for how long it would take is 1 month as well.</p>

<p>Further, the outside view says that a good estimate for how to build it is how you built it in the past: using Flask.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The outside view looks for similar problems in different contexts. It’s a <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvK5QWRLk3H8iqcNy/gears-vs-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener">behaviour level model</a>: you look at things only from the outside. How things change from the outside are hints to what’s important on the inside.</p>

<p>You’ll notice that figuring out how long it takes might do well with the outside view, but the API design decisions - not so much. What’s different between the two problems?</p>

<p>Taking the outside view on API design decisions is like building a truck using a car model. Just because it has 4 wheels and behaves the same as a car doesn’t mean it’s used for the same purposes.</p>

<p>On the flip side, not taking the outside view for figuring out how long it would take is a fallacy. Daniel Kahneman writes about the outside view in <a href="https://amzn.to/3eVmTkk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking, Fast and Slow</a><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">2</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“People who have information about an individual case rarely feel the need to know the statistics of the class to which the case belongs”</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-inside-view">The Inside View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_inside.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the inside view, Ovah’s team looks at the components of the problem. They look at the requirements for the feature, and come up with a good design tailored exactly for this use case. It’s unique. They decide to go with Django instead of Flask, since it gets them authentication and other nice things out of the box.</p>

<p>The team figures that with Django, most things are done for them already, so it should take about 2 weeks.</p>

<p>The inside view looks at specifics of the problem. It’s a gears level model: you understand how things tick. You figure out how each component would work.</p>

<p>Taking both, the inside and outside view is better than just taking one. It’s like going to the eye doctor, where they show you unreadable letters on a lit-up screen. They add one lens on your eyes, and you begin to distinguish <code>o</code> and <code>e</code>. Then they add a second lens, and now you can even tell the difference between <code>h</code> and <code>n</code>! They add a third spherical lens, and the dots become sharper - you can now even see the dots over the i’s as circles, not blobs. Each lens is a perspective that sharpens your view. It helps you realise that you’re looking at <strong>e</strong>va<strong>n</strong>’s team, not <strong>o</strong>va<strong>h</strong>’s team: and then everything clicks.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>In this case, using Django was a good decision. However, it took much longer than 2 weeks: unexpected things went wrong, and the team’s imagination was limited by how things can go right.</p>

<p>I think engineers are better at designing APIs than they are at figuring out how long it would take, which hints at them being better at taking the Inside View. This makes taking the Outside View even more important: if no one else is thinking like you, you have a sharp lens no one else has, which makes all the difference.</p>

<p>At the same time, you need to beware of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_the_instrument" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Maslow’s Hammer</a>: If you only take the Outside View on every problem, you’ll end up with a bad API design.</p>

<h2 id="the-birds-eye-view">The Bird’s eye View</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_bird.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>To take the bird’s eye view, Evan’s team looks at how this API should connect to other teams and clients. What are the other components involved? How can we best design things to work seamlessly with existing workflows?</p>

<p>The bird’s eye view looks at the problem as a part of a system, a part of other problems. This is different from the outside view, since it’s still the same problem in the same setting, but being looked at as an interface: how it connects to other things and other problems.</p>

<!-- Sometimes, tweaking the bigger picture can improve the interface, and subsequently the problem in the specific box you were working. -->

<p>Amazon is a company that internalises the bird’s eye view: Every team talks via interfaces! Every other team is their customer. You can’t go to your friend and ask them to open a backdoor for internal calls: it needs to be part of an interface anyone in the company can call. This means, not just clients, but also their colleagues and friends face the pain when the interfaces are hard to use.</p>

<p>What would it mean to take the bird’s eye view for the second problem? Evan’s team looks at how long their dependent teams would take, and when customers would be most likely to upgrade. So, they decide to launch with the next filters release, using that as a guiding factor: if the feature won’t get done by this time, build a smaller feature.</p>

<h2 id="the-worms-eye-view---genchi-genbutsu">The worm’s eye View - Genchi Genbutsu</h2>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/different_perspectives_worm.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genchi_Genbutsu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genchi Genbutsu</a> means to “go and see”. Go to the problem, and see why it’s a problem.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">3</a></sup></p>

<p>For Evan’s team, this means looking at the team dynamics, and figuring out if Evan or others are somehow holding the team back. It also means figuring out if they have the required expertise in the team, and if not, how can they build it.</p>

<p>Like how the bird’s eye view zooms out to the interface between other teams, the worm’s eye view zooms in to the interface between people in the team. It’s one layer deeper than the problem of designing the API: it’s about how the team will go about it. You’re looking at the problem as a single engineer among other engineers working on the same problem.</p>

<figure>
    
    <img src="https://neilkakkar.com/assets/images/divider.jpg" alt="">
    
    
    
</figure>

<p>I’ve noticed that the Inside View, and the Bird’s eye view comes more naturally to people, while Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View are rarer. The more uncertainty and unknown unknowns involved in a problem, the more important Genchi Genbutsu and the Outside View become.</p>

<p>The importance of taking these different perspectives shows up when you’re facing hard problems without an obvious solution: with the right combination of lenses, a blur turns into a sharp dot.</p>

				<p>(Photo by <strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/@sulimansallehi?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Suliman Sallehi</a></strong> from <strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/grey-concrete-structure-1481829/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Pexels</a>)</strong></p><p>(<strong>Warning</strong>: This is not a climate denial post, it's my reflection on the state of current affairs)</p><p>The idea of Climate Change doesn't seem to have product-market fit. They've marketed it hard and for decades but it's not really taking off. They've held multiple conferences with a range of &nbsp;popular or obscure characters as keynote speakers, tried bundling it with other products, and made some pretty good cartoons and movies about. And yet society as a whole's doesn't seem to be buying it.</p><p>No one cares about the fact that Climate Change is happening and accelerating. Not really.</p><p>Don't get me wrong - there's lot's of talk <em>about</em> caring about Climate Change, but the real issue is not being seriously address by anyone. Let me explain.</p><h2 id="in-politics-climate-change-is-just-gang-sign-or-pom-poms-">In politics, Climate Change is just gang-sign. Or pom-poms.</h2><p>Climate change is often mentioned in political discussions and, for some reason, seems to be a largely partisan issue, specifically in the Western world. </p><p>It's an excellent tool to signal your affiliation. You see, if you paint it one colour, you can use it as a patch on your conservative jacket. Go Reds! When you paint it another, it's great insignia for your liberal banners. Go Blues! What colour words you use tells other people which gang you belong to.</p><p>For politicians Climate Change is mostly taken seriously as a tool too rile their base. It's very useful to shake around and manipulate your team's spirit. Rah-rah-rah!</p><p>For the conservatives, you're expected to doubt it's veracity, or at the very least, play down its seriousness. Conservative-lites, for instance, will very vaguely argue that technology and human ingenuity will eventually help us all coast this annoying artifact of progress. Full-fat conservatives will go whole-hog and <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/climate-skeptics-want-more-co2/">argue it'll be of net benefit to society</a>.</p><p>On the liberal side they have their own range of cheers. Liberal-lites are very keen on raising taxes on production, which they argue would somehow help cool down the world. Full-fat liberals try to use Climate Change as an argument for going communist, because we all know communist societies won't engage in any industrialised production.</p><p>But both sides merely skirt around the issue when it comes down to it. It's merely one string connected to the levers which make their supporters dance. And it's often used as a more palatable brand to be wrapped like a mask over schemes that try and force action of other, unrelated kinds, that they know would not have broader public appear.</p><h2 id="for-large-orgs-it-s-press-release-porn">For large Orgs, it's press release porn</h2><p>Then there's the giant multinationals and intergovernmental organisations. They love to throw around the words "Climate" or "Environmentally friendly" too. It's excellent press-release porn.</p><p>There's a regular, periodic drip of kumbaya-like statements from these hydras, with vague expressions of their "great concerns" and "action needing to be taken". The young folks loves that shit, right? </p><p>You see, a well-crafted press release is amazing for creating the illusion of action. It's excellent moral insurance cover. "We often spoke about our concerns, with quite a lot of words and various agreeable degrees of sternness."</p><p>Then there's the epic events. Climate Change is a pretty rad reason to organise those. They have them often. Fly a whole bunch of delegates to this expensive venue in that remote country. There's lots of food and freebies, well-lit stages, fancy hotels and banquets. The pamphlets and banners with their tastefully designed artwork make for excellent photo-op backdrops. The world needs to see how much these very important organisations and their people care. </p><p>For-profit organisations also know how to use Climate Change effectively. It's marketing gold - so hot right now! It's a very effective tool to justify asking for more money while giving less in return. Tell your customers it's for the good of the colony! That charger that you now need to buy separately will surely save us all.</p><p>My point is of course that when it comes to Climate Change<em>,</em> the leaders of our societies, even the ones that don't outright deny that it's happening, all shout out slogans, make speeches, and then recede into the shadows of bureaucracy.</p><p>"Showing support" is easy, cheap and keeps the masses content. No serious thought or action is being mustered into how we're <em>actually</em> going to deal with the arrival of this c<a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/new-climate-change-report-human-civilization-at-risk-extinction-by-2050-new-australian-climate/">ivilisation-ending threat</a>. </p><p>Some parts of some governments <em>are</em> actually thinking about it, <a href="https://www.vox.com/2020/2/24/21145687/climate-change-usa-military-book-interview">like the militaries,</a> but for the rest it's just lip service.</p><p>"COVID!", you might retort, "showed us that governments <em>can</em> take swift and decisive action! So there's hope! We just need to vote more and start grass-roots movements!"</p><p>Well, sure, governments did take action with COVID. But most of them took too little action too late. And let's not even go into the mad-surge of power grabbing that happened - the rights being sacrificed on the altar of Security. Or my own government taking the opportunity to elevate corruption and state-looting to new, ever-refined heights.</p><p>But sure, let's simplify it and just consider the fact that action was taken. The problem is that action was only taken when the sparks began to fly. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/jul/15/revealed-the-inside-story-of-europes-divided-coronavirus-response">Action was taken when the viruses were at the gate</a>. Rome had to fall before anyone felt bothered enough to get up.</p><p>Another example of when people collectively decided to take mass action was with the BLM protests. Or the recent electoral battle between the two old men in the US. Magnificent events, for sure. The people made their voices heard. </p><p>But on closer consideration, doesn't it simply add more evidence to my assertion that nobody really believes in Climate Change? It's clearly not deemed important enough to warrant similar such action.</p><p>Well, that's not really true, I guess. </p><p>There was the Climate Change protests in 2019, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_2019_climate_strikes#:~:text=The%20September%202019%20climate%20strikes,place%20from%2020%E2%80%9327%20September.&amp;text=The%2020%20September%20protests%20were,climate%20strikes%20in%20world%20history.">Global Week for Future</a>. Let's be honest though, nothing really came of that. Lot's of noise was made, lots of fun chanting. School was skipped, selfies were taken. Camaraderie was felt, but <em>actual</em> change was as good as being on holiday. And ever so swiftly, with the emergence of the virus shenanigans, Greta &amp; co also faded into the background.</p><p>Then there's the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extinction_Rebellion">Extinction Rebellion</a>. They're hard core. Excellent name too, really catchy. Too extreme for mainstream narratives though, too aggressive and offensive. You can't run feel-good stories after covering that lot. The responsible media can't support such hooliganism.</p><p>So I admit, there <em>were</em> social movements trying to rouse society into action, but they lost steam and fizzled out. Not enough traction. Not compelling enough. Just a fad. No product-market fit.</p><p>I've been thinking about this for quite a while. It's a recurring theme when reading some of the comments on Reddit and HackerNews when the weekly Climate horror threads bubble up. Is it hopelessness, disbelief, distant consequences or laziness? </p><p>Because i<a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3041/beating-back-the-tides/">t's</a> <a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/11/201109152241.htm">not</a> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/nov/13/rising-levels-of-carbon-dioxide-increasing-extreme-weather-events-in-australia-report-finds">due</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/hurricane-eta-storm-2020-climate-change-b892557.html">to</a> <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/arctic-sea-ice-level-climate-change-global-warming-siberia-b1345792.html">a</a> <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/10/08/russian-scientists-find-powerful-ever-methane-seep-arctic-ocean/">lack</a> <a href="https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3008/stunning-forecast-a-century-of-ice-loss-for-nearly-100000-glaciers/">of</a> <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-75481-z">evidence</a>. There's <strong>tons</strong> of evidence that things will unhinge pretty soon, and there has been for years. Never mind the fact that even the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/apr/13/climate-change-oil-industry-environment-warning-1968">oil companies knew what they were doing</a> in the 60s, or that even further <a href="https://daily.jstor.org/how-19th-century-scientists-predicted-global-warming/">back in the 19 century, some had started to suspect that things could get bad</a>. </p><p>Then there was also that fun little controversial book, written ages ago in 1972, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth#Conclusions">The Limits to Growth</a>. And what a page-turner it was! Thrilling stuff. </p><p>Here's a trailer.</p><figure><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCxPOqwCr1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>The Limits to Growth caused quite the stir. But not in a good way. It upset quite a lot of people. It dared suggest that our progress was, in fact, not that. And that we should maybe stop.</p><p>Sure, it could be argued that it was based on the results of an oversimplified model with oversimplified assumptions and oversimplified data. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/sep/02/limits-to-growth-was-right-new-research-shows-were-nearing-collapse">But in hind-sight it seems to have gotten quite a lot, scarily right.</a> </p><p>By all appearances,<a href="https://ec.europa.eu/environment/ecoap/about-eco-innovation/research-developments/eu/limits-to-growth-predictions-borne-out-analysis-finds_en"> we've been heading down the Business As Usual scenario</a> from that study, and things seem to be right on track for our interconnected global civilisation to hit that brick wall quite hard, quite fast.</p><p>And the book didn't even really deal with climate change per se, as we understand it today anyway. Only with regards too good 'ol generic resource overexploitation. </p><p>Now, the point of this post is not to lay out all the evidence and arguments to prove the veracity of the horrendous shit-show that is coming. That has been done millions of times before and is just a Google search away. </p><p>Neither is the aim to go through the all the specific claims of books and studies like the Limits of Growth with a fine-toothed comb to judge exactly how accurate they are. This is not necessary, because there've been enough different studies focussing on different aspects of our effect on the environment, and they all seem to come together as pixels of same picture.</p><p>Make no mistake, it sure looks like the apocalypse is coming. And society(and those driving it) has know this for quite a while. We either just don't care or we're paralysed with fear.</p><p>So how bad can it really? Well, here's a humorous little clip from way back in 2014, to set the scene.</p><figure><iframe width="459" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XM0uZ9mfOUI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>That's from the fictional show Newsroom. <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2014/11/climate-desk-fact-checks-aaron-sorkins-climate-science-newsroom/">MotherJones did a fact-check on the claims being made in the scene</a> and turns out, it's disturbingly accurate. </p><p>Note the reporter's response at 2:34.

If you have participated in a discussion about Elixir, you may have heard “you may not need Redis with Elixir”. Given that Redis has many use cases, this sentence may confuse developers as they try to match Elixir’s different features against Redis’ capabilities. This article aims to explore different scenarios where the above is true, when they are not, and which trade-offs you may want to consider. We will discuss four cases:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
<a href="#post-pubsub">Distributed PubSub</a>  </li>
  <li>
<a href="#post-presence">Presence</a>  </li>
  <li>
<a href="#post-caching">Caching</a>  </li>
  <li>
<a href="#post-async">Asynchronous processing</a>  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Before we start, I want to emphasize we find Redis a fantastic piece of technology. This is not a critique of Redis but rather a discussion of the different options Elixir developers may have available.</p>
<h2 id="post-pubsub">
  Case #1: Distributed PubSub</h2>
<p>
The first scenario where you may not need Redis with Elixir is Distributed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">PubSub</a>. Throughout this section, we will consider PubSub systems to provide <strong>at-most-once delivery</strong>: they broadcast events to the currently available subscribers. If a subscriber is not around, they won’t receive the message later.</p>
<p>
For this reason, PubSub systems are often paired with databases to offer persistence. For example, every time someone sends a message in a chat application, the system can save the contents to the database and then broadcast it to all users. This means everyone connected at a given moment sees the update immediately, but disconnected users can catch up later.</p>
<p>
Imagine that you have multiple nodes, and you want to exchange messages between said nodes. In Elixir, thanks to the Erlang VM, which ships with distribution support, this can be as simple as:</p>
<pre><code><span>for</span><span> </span><span>node</span><span> </span><span>&lt;-</span><span> </span><span>Node</span><span>.</span><span>list</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-1">(</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-1">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="8737372369-2">do</span><span>
  </span><span>send</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-3">(</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-4">{</span><span>:known_name</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>node</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-4">}</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>:hello_world</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-3">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="8737372369-2">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
In <a href="https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_pubsub/blob/master/lib/phoenix/pubsub.ex">200LOC or less</a>, you can implement a PubSub system that broadcasts to all subscribers within the same node or anywhere else in a cluster, without bringing any third-party tools. At best, you will need <a href="https://github.com/bitwalker/libcluster">libcluster</a> - an Elixir library - to establish the connection between the nodes based on some strategy (K8s, AWS, DNS, etc.).</p>
<p>
In other words, PubSub pretty much ships out of the box with Elixir. Technologies without distribution would need to rely on Redis PubSub, PostgreSQL Notifications, or similar to achieve the same.</p>
<p>
Of course, the above assumes your infrastructure allows you to directly establish connections between nodes, which may not be possible in some PaaS, such as Heroku. In those cases, you can use any of the technologies above (Phoenix <a href="https://dashbit.co/blog/github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_pubsub_redis/">has a Redis adapter</a> for its PubSub), or alternatively use platforms, such as <a href="https://www.gigalixir.com/">Gigalixir</a>, that make it trivial to setup a cluster.</p>
<h2 id="post-presence">
  Case #2: Presence</h2>
<p>
Presence is the ability to track who is connected in a cluster right now — the “who” may be users, phones, IoT devices, etc. For example, if Alice is connected to node A, she wants to see that Bob is also available, even if he has joined node B.</p>
<p>
Presence is one of the problems that are more complicated to implement than it sounds. For example, let’s consider implementing Presence by storing the connected entities in a database. However, what happens if a node crashes or leaves the cluster? Because the node crashed, all the users connected to it must be removed, but the node itself cannot do so. Therefore the other nodes need to detect those failure scenarios and act accordingly. But observing failures in a distributed system is also complicated: how do you differentiate between a temporarily unresponsive node from one that permanently failed?</p>
<p>
Another common approach to solve this problem is to frequently write to a database while users are connected. If you have seen no writes within a timeframe, you consider those users to be disconnected. However, such solutions have to choose between being write-intensive or inaccurate. For instance, let’s say that users become disconnected after 1 minute. This means that you need to write to the database every 1 minute for every user. If you have 10k users, that’s 167 writes per second, only to track that the users are connected. Meanwhile, the gap between a user leaving and having their status reflected in the UI is, in the worst-case scenario, also 1 minute. Any attempt at reducing the number of writes implies an increased gap.</p>
<p>
Given Elixir’s clustering support, we can once more implement <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html">Presence</a> without a need for third-party dependencies! We use a PubSub system to implement Presence, as we need to notify as users join and leave. Instead of relying on centralized storage, the nodes directly communicate and exchange information about who is around. This removes the need for frequent writes. When a user leaves, this is also reflected immediately.</p>
<p>
So while you can use Redis or another storage to provide Presence, Elixir can deliver a solution that is efficient and doesn’t require third-party tools.</p>
<h2 id="post-caching">
  Case #3: Caching</h2>
<p>
The solutions to previous cases were built on top of Erlang’s unique distribution capabilities. In the following sections, the distinguishing factor between needing Redis or not will be <strong>multi-core concurrency</strong>, so this discussion is more generally applicable. Therefore, when we say Elixir in this section, it will also apply to JVM, Go, and other environments. They will contrast to Ruby, Python, and Node.js, in which their primary runtimes do not provide adequate multi-core concurrency within a single Operating System process.</p>
<p>
Let’s start with the non-concurrent scenario. Consider you are building a web application in Ruby, Python, etc. To deploy it, you get two eight-core machines. In languages that do not provide satisfactory multi-core concurrency, a common option for deployment is to start 8 instances of your web application, one per core, on each node. Overall, you will have CxN instances, where C is the number of cores, and N is the number of nodes.</p>
<p>
Now consider a particular operation in this application that is expensive, and you want to cache its results. The easiest solution, regardless of your programming environment, is to cache it in memory. However, given we have 16 instances of this application, caching it in memory is suboptimal: we will have to perform this expensive operation at least 16 times, one for each instance. For this reason, it is widespread to use Redis, Memcached, or similar for caching in environments like Ruby, Python, etc. With Redis, you would cache it only once, and it will be shared across all instances. The trade-off is that we are replacing memory access by a network round-trip, and the latter is orders of magnitude more expensive.</p>
<p>
Now let’s consider environments with multi-core concurrency. In languages like Elixir, you start one instance per node, regardless of the number of cores, since the runtime will share memory and efficiently spread the work across all cores. When it comes to caching, keeping the cache in-memory is a much more affordable scenario, as you will only have to compute once per node. Therefore, you have the <em>option</em> to skip Redis or Memcached altogether and avoid network round-trip.</p>
<p>
Of course, this depends on how many nodes you are effectively running in production. Luckily, many companies report being able to <a href="https://dev.to/erlangsolutions/why-elixir-is-the-programming-language-you-should-learn-in-2020-5g00">run Elixir with an order of magnitude less nodes</a> than technologies they have migrated from.</p>
<p>
You can also choose a mixed approach and store the cache both in-memory and in Redis. First, you look up in memory and, if missing, you fallback to Redis. If unavailable in both, then you execute the operation and cache it in each. The critical part to highlight here is that multi-core environments give you more flexibility to tackle these problems while reducing resource utilization. In Elixir/Erlang, you can also keep the cache in memory and use PubSub to distribute it across nodes. You can see this last approach in action <a href="https://github.com/tompave/fun_with_flags">in the excellent FunWithFlags library</a>.</p>
<p>
Another trade-off to consider is that all in-memory cache will be gone once you deploy new nodes. Therefore, if you need data to persist across deployments, you will want to use Redis as a cache layer, as detailed above, or dump the cache in a storage, such as database, S3, or Redis, before each deployment.</p>
<h2 id="post-async">
  Case #4: Asynchronous processing</h2>
<p>
Another scenario you may not need Redis in Elixir is to perform asynchronous processing. Let’s continue the discussion from the previous case.</p>
<p>
In environments without or with limited multi-core concurrency, given each instance is assigned to one core, they are limited in their ability to handle requests concurrently. This has led to a common saying that “you should avoid blocking the main thread”. For example, imagine that your application has to deliver emails on sign up or generate some computationally expensive reports. While one of your 16 web instances is doing this, it cannot handle other incoming requests efficiently. For this reason, a common choice here is to move the work elsewhere, typically a background-job processing queue. First, you store the work to be done on Redis or similar. Then one of the 16 web instances (or more commonly a completely different set of workers) grabs it from the queue.</p>
<p>
In multi-core concurrent environments, requests can be handled concurrently regardless if they are doing CPU or IO work. Sending the email from the request itself won’t block other requests. Generating the report is not a problem, as requests can be served by other CPUs. These platforms typically get assigned as many requests as they can handle and they distribute the work over the machine resources. Even if you prefer to deliver emails outside of the request, in order to send an earlier response to users, you can spawn an asynchronous worker without a need to move the delivery to an external queue or to another machine. Once again, concurrency gives us a more straightforward option to tackle these scenarios.</p>
<p>
Note the Erlang VM takes care of multiplexing CPU and IO work without a need for developers to tag functions as async or similar. Workers in Erlang/Elixir are …</p></article></div></div>

November 15, 2020 | https://www.ungated.media/article/substack | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ungated.media/article/substack">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>’ll admit, I have a major soft spot for <a href="https://substack.com/" target="_blank">Substack</a>. It’s home to some of the most electrifying writing online, and I happily pay for a few newsletters myself. However, as someone who’s looking to <a href="https://www.ungated.media/article/introduction" target="_blank">build a long-term business around my own writing</a>, you couldn’t pay me to use the platform. The cost is too high, in more ways than one.</p><p>The critique that’s coming is going to be brutal. But first, a few acknowledgments, because Substack’s founders have indeed done something extraordinary. They’ve properly aligned the incentives between creators and consumers, unshackled some of the world’s best writing talent, and singlehandedly made the idea of paid newsletters cool again.</p><p>In a media ecosystem increasingly dominated by the loudest, most outrage-driven voices, Substack’s carved out a space where thoughtfulness reigns, and individual creators are rewarded for the depth of their contribution. It’s refreshing, and it gives me a glimmer of hope for the future of indie media.</p><p>Substack also deserves credit for how simple and frictionless their platform is. It’s the only tool I know where you can set up a paid newsletter in the next 20 minutes, even if you’re technologically illiterate. I doubt we’d have seen the explosion in quality writing this year had it not been dead simple to get started.</p><p>However, most of that praise comes from a consumer perspective. As a creator and entrepreneur, I’m perplexed and concerned by Substack’s seemingly endless list of shortcomings. Though it’s incredibly popular right now, I believe it’s important for ambitious creators to understand the downside before staking their claim on Substack.</p><h2>Who do I recommend Substack for?</h2><p>Before we get into the critique, I have to stress that Substack is not a bad piece of software. Though it’s a poor fit for serious creators, there are people who will get amazing value from Substack.</p><p><strong>For starters, it’s the obvious choice for hobbyists.</strong> If you’re looking for a place to write, unencumbered by expensive marketing and website tools with features you’ll never need, go for Substack. It’s free, simple, and so, so easy to maintain. Plus, you can always turn on subscriptions if you want to generate a bit of side income. Just beware, if your intentions shift towards building a business, you’re going have to deal with all of the limitations below.</p><p><strong>I’d also recommend it for creators who value simplicity and ease above all else.</strong> Personally, I enjoy <a href="https://www.ungated.media/article/membership-tools" target="_blank">getting into the weeds and finding the perfect tech</a> for the job. I don’t mind a bit of extra complexity if it results in a better business for me, or a richer experience for my fans. But if all you want is to write and get paid, and you don’t have the time or temperament to piece together various tools, go with Substack. I still hope you’ll read the rest of this article, though, because there are very real tradeoffs you’re making with this approach.</p><p><strong>Lastly, I’d recommend it for serious entrepreneurs who are looking to rapidly deploy an MVP for a paid newsletter</strong>. Maybe you’ve got a hypothesis for a newsletter you think would kick ass, but you’re not sure it’d work. Instead of investing the time to build your custom infrastructure up front, you can jump on Substack, publish a bit, do some marketing, and see if your hypothesis holds water or not.</p><p>I’m pretty sure that’s what <a href="https://rosieland.substack.com/" target="_blank">Rosie Sherry</a> is doing with her Substack. She used it to build a writing habit, validate that people will pay for great community-building content, and is now moving to a better set of tools.</p><figure id="w-node-22162e753f7d-377c2913"></figure><p>Just beware, the longer you stick with Substack, the harder it’s going to be to switch. So I’d recommend using it for a few months at most, then migrating to a set of tools more suited to building a business.</p><p>With all of that said, let’s now get into Substack’s shortcomings for serious creators.</p><h2>A pricing model that penalizes success</h2><p>How much would you reasonably pay for the service that Substack provides? I’m going to keep coming back to this simple question throughout the article. So keep it top of mind.</p><p>Substack, of course, is free to start. Only once you monetize do they take a flat 10% out of your earnings. (And hey, if you never charge, you’ve essentially got a forever-free newsletter/blog hybrid.)</p><p>Assuming you’re just getting started with subscription media, this is an <em>amazing</em> deal. You get full access to a platform that would likely cost $30-100/month were it priced as a traditional SaaS tool. And you never pay anything close to that in fees until you’re bringing in real money. </p><p>This is part of what makes Substack so seductive. It’s not only easy to get started, but it comes with the veneer of being a great bargain.</p><p>However, as you start growing a genuine business around your content, and that 10% creeps ever higher, it becomes less obvious what value you’re getting in return for Substack’s fee.</p><p>Here are a few examples that demonstrate this well.</p><p>When I first started planning Ungated, I briefly considered building on Substack. After all, that’s where all the cool kids were writing. Then I started doing the math.</p><p>The plan was (and still is) to build a $10/month publication, and within a year, have 1000 happy customers. Yep, a year from now, I plan to be living the Kevin Kelly dream.</p><p>That’s $120,000/year in top line revenue. Of that, Substack’s take would be $12,000 annually, or $1,000 a month. (Keep in mind, this is simplified math that doesn’t take into account the additional 2.9% + 30¢ from Stripe.)</p><p>That hypothetical $12K annual fee—how does it strike you? Does it feel like a fair exchange of value with Substack? Are you getting your money’s worth?</p><p>For me, the answer was a clear and unambiguous <em>hell no</em>. And you’ll see why as you move through the rest of this post.</p><p>Let’s step it up a notch, and use another real life example to drive home the point.</p><p>As of this writing, <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/" target="_blank">Matt Taibbi</a> has the third most popular paid newsletter on Substack’s leaderboard, with “tens of thousands” of subscribers. Now, by all accounts, Matt’s super happy with Substack, so this’ll be hypothetical. But it’s instructive nonetheless.</p><p>For the sake of easy math, let’s say he’s got 15,000 paid subscribers at $50/year. That translates to roughly $750,000 per year, without yet accounting for fees or churn or new subscribers.</p><p>That means, unless Substack cut him some kind of deal (which they’ve been known to do with high-profile journalists), Matt Taibbi’s singlehandedly paying $75,000 a year in fees.</p><p>Can we let that sink in for a moment? </p><p>That’s a year of tuition, room, and board at Yale University. That’s a middle manager’s yearly salary. That’s a brand new Tesla Model S. That’s an entry-level house in Detroit. Hell, that’s a full time employee—or several contractors—Matt could hire to help grow his media business (which he recently <a href="https://taibbi.substack.com/p/note-to-readers-6ea" target="_blank">expressed interest</a> in doing.)</p><p>Broken down, that’s $6,250 per month in fees. If Matt posts twice per week, he’s essentially paying Substack $781.25 every single time he publishes.</p><p>For what?</p><blockquote>Is Substack, as a platform, delivering a fraction of that much value on an ongoing basis? Sure, it’s easy and low-maintenance, but how much are those things truly worth? At what point are you flushing money—that you’ve rightfully earned by delivering value to your fans—down the toilet?</blockquote><p>Again, I would like you to consider the question: what would you reasonably pay for the service that Substack provides? $50 a month? $100 a month?</p><p>In 2020 as I write this, the market for “passion economy” software is exploding. Anyone can now piece together an email, membership, and website tech stack that is <em>far more capable</em> than Substack, and only pay $15-200/month. </p><p>For the creators who succeed on its platform, Substack really has to deliver something above and beyond to justify taking 10% in perpetuity. And I don’t see much evidence of that.</p><p>In fact, as we’re about to see, the sky-high fee is just the tip of a very depressing iceberg.</p><p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>After chatting with someone at Substack, it seems they do offer ongoing benefits to their higher-earning creators. It just isn’t advertised anywhere. Those benefits include things like health care, legal defense if you get sued, and design/marketing help, which are indeed hugely valuable. I’d hope for more transparency from Substack as to how creators can qualify for any of this, because right now, it’s very unclear.</em></p><h2>In a world that rewards uniqueness and personality, Substack forces sameness</h2><p>I’m subscribed to roughly eleventy thousand Substack newsletters. That number has actually grown since I started writing this article. I’ve clearly got an addiction, and someone should stage an intervention ASAP.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f5306248ae8615a2f258509/5f90860691026f7b7be523dd_HugeThoughtfulKagu-size_restricted.gif" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Jokes aside, the moment you subscribe to more than a handful of Substack newsletters, you’ll notice something rather alarming—they all start to blend together. </p><p>They all look and feel the same. The user experience is the same (and not very good, as I’ll detail later). And hell, the content itself is even starting to blur together, given that it’s mostly tech/media/politics folks on the platform.</p><p>Even the strongest, most thoughtful writers start blending in with one another, as they have almost no discernible brand. And in a landscape with more people becoming indie creators each day, that is a seismic fucking problem.</p><p>Let’s back up a moment.</p><blockquote>One of the core principles of succeeding in the modern creator economy is that your work needs to be <em>genuinely worthy of people’s attention</em>. We live in a world of media abundance, and if you want to be seen as signal in the noise, you need to be different or better in some way.</blockquote><p>A big part of that is honing in on a specific niche, or finding your “personal monopoly” as <a href="https://www.perell.com/" target="_blank">David Perell</a> would say. </p><figure id="w-node-0922ad6c2b70-377c2913"></figure><p>But another, equally important part is finding ways to inject your personality, values, and aesthetic sensibilities into everything you do. In other words, it’s about having a unique, discernible brand.</p><p>On Substack, you can kiss that possibility goodbye from day one.</p><p>In fact, Substack gives you so little control over your design and brand that it’s actually a bit comical. You get the …</p></div></div>

<![CDATA[Moving my serverless project to Ruby on Rails]]>

November 15, 2020 | https://frantic.im/back-to-rails | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://frantic.im/back-to-rails">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  </header>
  <p>I have a small side project: <a href="https://hacker.gifts/">digital gift cards for hackers</a>. It uses Shopify for all the store-related stuff: frontend, payments, refunds, reports, etc.</p>

<p>But unlike regular digital products (ebooks, videos) I wanted each card that the user purchases from the store to be unique. So I made a  script that generates personalized images and ran it manually for every order.</p>

<p>The next logical step was automating this process. I started with serverless AWS Lambda. At the time it was the hot new tech and I wanted to learn more. It seemed very fitting for my use-case: single-responsibility functions that can run at any time and don’t require server maintenance.</p>

<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/back-to-rails/simple-lambda.png" alt=""></p>

<p>It was super easy to get started. I built a JavaScript function and deployed it to AWS Lambda, added Shopify web hook and it all worked!</p>

<p>Early benefits of serverless (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Easy to get started</li>
  <li>Don’t have to configure or maintain servers</li>
  <li>Free for small loads</li>
</ul>

<p>In reality, writing the simple Lambda functions turned out to be only 10% of the work.</p>

<p>Time passed and my backend started getting more complex: I needed to store some state for each <a href="https://hacker.gifts/products/space-invaders">puzzle</a>, send confirmation emails, show an order details page. What started as a simple function, grew into a bunch of serverless functions, SNS topics, S3 buckets, DynamoDB tables. All bound together with plenty of YAML glue, schema-less JSON objects passed around and random hardcoded configs in AWS console.</p>

<p>I think it’s just a typical software development lifecycle: things grow organically, become a mess, and require some refactoring. Make it run first (discover market fit), then make it right (refactor to integrate the new discoveries).</p>

<p>But this time it was different. I couldn’t refactor things as easily as I used to in traditional monolithic apps. Here’s why:</p>

<p>When the building blocks are too simple, the complexity moves into the interaction between the blocks.</p>

<p>And the interactions between the serverless blocks happen <em>outside</em> my application. A lambda publishes a message to SNS, another one picks it up and writes something to DynamoDB, the third one takes that new record and sends an email…</p>

<p>I could test every single block in that flow, but I didn’t have confidence in the overall process. What if publishing fails, how would I know that? How would system recover? Can I rollback and try again? Where do the logs go?</p>

<p>Another swarm of problems was hiding in my configuration: bad Route 53 record, typos in SNS topics, wrong S3 bucket region. Tracing errors was a challenge, there’s no single log output I can look into.</p>

<p>With serverless, I was no longer dealing with my project's domain, I was dealing with the distributed system's domain.</p>

<p>At this point I felt fooled.</p>

<p>I came for the easy way to deploy code and not think about servers, but in the end had to design my system around the platform’s limitations.</p>

<p>Drawbacks of serverless (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hard to follow information flow</li>
  <li>Impossible to replicate production environment locally</li>
  <li>Slow iteration speed</li>
  <li>Lack of end-to-end testing</li>
  <li>Immature documentation (dominated by often outdated Medium posts)</li>
  <li>No conventions (have to make hundreds of unessential decisions)</li>
</ul>

<p>—</p>

<p>I was clearly not enjoying the serverless. So I decided to rewrite it. After all, it is a side project I’m doing for fun. The tech stack of choice — Ruby on Rails.</p>

<p>I haven’t used Rails since 2013, and for the last 8 years at Facebook I’ve been mostly doing JavaScript.</p>

<p><img src="https://frantic.im/assets/back-to-rails/logo.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The experience of picking Rails back up was really nice but… uneventful. Not much had really changed. A few things got added, a few small things moved around.</p>

<p>Of course I did <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/38060">hit some magical Ruby issues</a>. But unlike my typical experience with JavaScript, I was quickly able to find the solution.</p>

<p>Rails comes with so many things built-in and configured. Over the years, without Rails, I used to gluing random JavaScript libraries together to roll my own routing, file storage wrappers, email preview pipeline, managing secrets, test setup with fixtures, database migrations, logging, performance reporting, deployment scripts. With Rails I didn’t have to think about all these details and could simply focus on making product-visible changes.</p>

<p>It was like driving a Tesla after years of making my own scrappy cars. Similar components, but all configured and aligned to work well together.</p>

<p>Benefits of Rails (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Conventions</li>
  <li>Tooling, libraries</li>
  <li>Documentation</li>
  <li>Monolith is easy to understand and test</li>
</ul>

<p>Drawbacks of Rails (for hobby projects):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Feels heavyweight in the beginning</li>
  <li>Hurts if your opinions differ from Rails conventions</li>
  <li>Have to host on a server</li>
  <li>Doesn’t sound cool in 2020 (anymore and maybe yet)</li>
</ul>

<p>—</p>

<p>Serverless is like a black hole. It promised exciting adventures, but gravity sucked me in and I spent most of my efforts dealing with its complexity, instead of focusing on my product.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Concords is an MVP framework for building offline &amp; decentralised web apps, with a file-based approach to storing data. It has no servers or databases and is a static app built with Javascript and HTML, all code is written to run in a browser and nothing is stored outside of the browser or downloaded files.</p> <p>The full MVP is available to try at <a href="https://alpha.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">alpha.concords.app</a></p> <h2 id="why">Why?</h2> <p>SAAS applications run on servers with databases. Each interaction with the UI sends information from the browser to a server, which then likely writes something or fetches something from a centralized database.</p> <p>Maintaining servers and databases is expensive, complex and time-consuming and I'm not really interested in that side of software. I don't want the responsibility to look after data that is depended upon, that's neither my skill-set nor passion. I like to focus my attention on the front-end experience.</p> <p>I set out to build a framework for file-based SAAS apps. Multi-user collaborative apps, with data-driven user flows and advanced UI. But apps that run offline and save state to the filesystem, not send it off to a cloud-based database. Giving users full ownership and visibility of their data, with no dependency on an internet connection. Taking a progressive approach to connectivity, using it to enrich the experience, but not depend on it.</p> <h2 id="technical-steps">Technical Steps</h2> <ul> <li><p>Functional blockchain library in Typescript.</p> </li> <li><p><a href="https://svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Svelte</a> &amp; <a href="https://sapper.svelte.dev/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Sapper</a> for all things UI.</p> </li> <li><p>Blockchain sync with IndexedDB and reactivity hook.</p> </li> <li><p>Created <a href="https://1.0.0.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">some mini-apps</a> to refine and test the core functionality.</p> </li> <li><p>User Authentication flow.</p> </li> <li><p><a href="https://alpha.concords.app/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">MVP: Kanban app</a>.</p> </li> </ul> <h2 id="concords-mvp-board-app">Concords MVP: Board App</h2> <p>This MVP serves to demonstrate a basic solution to a truly offline and decentralized experience in a collaborative web app. It's a static app, so just Javascript and HTML, with no servers or databases running in the background. It's a progressive web app with a service worker, that runs entirely in the browser. So once the initial load has been performed, the rest of the experience can work completely offline, where data is stored in files, downloaded and uploaded through the UI.</p> <p>A boards app covers a lot of functionality commonly found in SAAS applications, I figured it's a great benchmark to prove out the technology.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/add-task.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h3 id="authentication">Authentication</h3> <p>With Concords, authentication is all done in the browser, without any communication to a server or external resource.</p> <p>In the Concords authentication system, we issue a downloadable public profile which includes your public key and some basic user info. I keep mine for the MVP on my personal domain. <a href="https://ternent.dev/concords/sam-ternent.profile.concords.json" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://ternent.dev/concords/sam-ternent.profile.concords.json</a></p> <p>Anyone with access to my public key is able to encrypt data for me, that only I can read with my private key. I just have that stored on my personal machine. It’s never been online and no-one else knows it.</p> <p>This key is used to log the user into the app and only a valid key combination can login and access the software.</p> <p>For my MVP, this is more than sufficient to complete and decent authentication flow. We can have a recognisable UX of profile/password combination to build a login system, whilst setting us up for an encrypted, multi-user, data flow.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/signup.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <p>I know it's a pain to ask users to store both parts of their encryption keys themselves. If the private key is lost, it's unrecoverable and so is any encrypted data to that key. But I couldn't compromise here, it has to be this way to keep things decentralized. But it's a problem that can be fixed through software, it doesn't have to be my software - we're decentralizing things here, but key management software will fix this problem.</p> <h3 id="the-app">The App</h3> <p>Knowing roughly what I needed to build to prove out the concept, and having already implemented User Profile and the authentication flow, the key features I chose to implement were:</p> <ul> <li>Create new and multiple boards</li> <li>Downloadable app files</li> <li>Load any board, from any user</li> <li>Assign tasks to users</li> <li>Editable tasks</li> <li>Timestamped actions</li> <li>Drag to sort columns</li> <li>Draggable tasks across columns</li> <li>Soft delete tasks to the trash, with restore and remove</li> <li>Activity log with an immutable history of the board</li> </ul> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/create-board.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h4 id="multiple-users">Multiple Users</h4> <p>By default, a new user doesn't have edit access to a document. For the purpose of the MVP, we've got a "Join" button in the left-hand sidebar. Clicking this will add the user as an entry to the data store and unlock editing. This covers the concept enough for now, but we are able to achieve direct encryption with the public/private key authentication, so that's going to be an interesting avenue to explore further outside of the MVP context.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/third-user.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h3 id="core-library">Core Library</h3> <p>The core of the framework is written in Typescript. It's a collection of functional utilities which cover the data side of the application. It runs an internal blockchain for writing data, mapped with an IndexDB instance for reading.</p> <h4 id="blockchain">Blockchain</h4> <p>At the heart of the library is the <a href="https://hackernoon.com/merkle-tree-what-is-it-and-why-use-it-8m2a63xjd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Merkel Tree</a> solution. Our Merkle Tree (as used in Blockchain and git), is a functional library to act as a blockchain node, from a JSON object structure, in the browser.</p> <p>Built on top of that is a CRUD API which the application will interface with. When an action is performed in the app, a timestamped transaction is created for the blockchain. Once commit, all pending transactions are then added to a block on the chain. Once a block has been added to the blockchain, the hash-based data structure ensures the integrity of the app state.</p> <pre><code>{
 "type": "tasks",
 "action": "create",
 "data": {
   "title": "Task Name",
   "description": "Task Description",
   "completed": false,
   "due_date": "2020-11-02",

 },
 "signature": "NOT RELEASED"
}</code></pre><hr> <h4 id="database">Database</h4> <p>Sitting on the other side of the blockchain is the DB layer. When a transaction it accepted onto the blockchain, we parse the event and perform an operation on an IndexedDB instance in the browser. Transactions are recorded as they go in, so we don’t duplicate transactions and minimise the number of write operations to the database.</p> <p>As long as we have the blockchain data object, we have a full picture of our app and data state. We can drop and recreate a database with complete accuracy, based on secured transactional history. This is a <strong>read only</strong> layer.</p> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/flows/recreate-db.gif?raw=true"></p> <hr> <h4 id="architecture-overview">Architecture Overview</h4> <p><img alt="" src="https://concords.app/images/architecture.svg"></p> <hr> <h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2> <h3 id="desktop-app">Desktop App</h3> <p>A quick leap here is to build this out into a desktop app using electron. Little things like saving the hash to a keychain, directly reading and writing to the filesystem. I'm excited to try running the <a href="https://dat.foundation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DAT</a> project to enable P2P connectivity to give a realtime collaborative experience.</p> <h3 id="intergrations">Intergrations</h3> <p>My primary goal is decentralization. I'm not against storing data on the cloud, I just want to be able to make my own choice as to where. The initial standout integration I want to try is with Dropbox, syncing a folder in your filesystem to dropbox will give us the ability to introduce the "push/pull" aspect found in git.</p> <h3 id="conflict-resolution">Conflict resolution</h3> <p>I need to do further research around conflict resolution. I have the basics for a complete blockchain, which includes proof of work and consensus to ensure the validity of the underlying data structure, but it doesn't secure or handle in-app data conflicts. Visual diffs and conflicts are problems solved in various other applications, with plenty of research available. I'm not sure how it will look yet, but it should be a fun one to solve.</p> <h3 id="user-roles--permissions">User roles &amp; permissions</h3> <p>Using our data structure user roles and permissions are achievable. With the use of application-level permission keys, we can encrypt the access key for a specific user. They will then have access to any data under that permission level.</p> </section></div></div>]]>

<p><b>...or anyone else, for that matter.</b></p>

<p><i>Autumn 2020</i></p>

<p>Ask anyone who's really into cooking and they'll tell you how important it is to have a kitchen that's arranged just right. To someone who rarely cooks, a kitchen is probably just a place to store a few pots and a toaster, and the placement of such stuff doesn't matter much: canned soup and microwave dinners are designed for ease of preparation.</p>


<p>For the enthusiastic home cook, however, a lot of things can go wrong. Often there's only a second's notice to fix something that might ruin a perfect meal or set you back hours of hard toil. Hollandaise starting to split? Better bring out that ice cold water post haste! Garlic burning? Better chop some more right this instant, or the pasta will be overcooked and there goes the Aglio e Oglio.</p>


<p>To achieve speed, you have to know where your knives, pots, pans, spoons, whisks and other utensils are and you want to be able to arrange them so that they're easy to reach. Seasonings, spices, herbs and condiments should be within reach from the stove. Then there's the mise en place before the actual cooking begins: chopping all the vegetables, cubing the meat, slicing the bacon and so on.</p>


<p>All of this is, thankfully, easy to achieve. Even the most cramped kitchen will, after having been battle tested through a few meals, be as optimal as possible according to the cook's personal preference. The same goes for painters, carpenters, car mechanics and even office dwellers. Hammer missing from the hammer hook? For shame! Stapler not to the immediate right of the stack of post-its? Well it should be!</p>


<h3>The regulated kitchen</h3>


<p>Now imagine if you couldn't organize your kitchen to your heart's content. Not because you're lacking the funds or skills, but because some federally appointed clerk is constantly coming to inspect it.</p>


<p>"Nah," he says, adjusting his clip-on tie, "you can't put your spices there. Against regulations. All spices must be kept more than two yards from the stove at all times." He then goes on to explain that you'll have to call him every time you want to use the stove, just to make sure the pots you're using are compliance tested. Plus, they have to be stored in the government approved pot storage cabinet below the sink, otherwise they're not fit for kitchen use.</p>


<p>Want to change the color of the counter top? Sorry, no can do. Want to switch from glass bowls to stainless? Alas, you used to be able a few years ago, but nobody wants stainless anymore anyway, right? The salt <i>can</i> be put next to the stove, but it's not recommended and might change in the near future. Knives are now to be honed every Tuesday afternoon by a designated craftsman. Sure, you can postpone a few times, but eventually, you just have to live with that. Plus, there's going to be some dudes coming to inventory your pantry on a regular basis, most likely when you're in the middle of cooking something really complicated. There's no use in protesting - this is all for your own good.</p>

<p>And yes.


</p><p>Of course this is a metaphor for computers.</p>


<h3>The curious disappearance of configuration</h3>


<p>For the casual user, some of this can <i>maybe</i> be convenient - or at least not annoying. If someone who rarely uses the kitchen has decided to whip up a home cooked feast, it doesn't matter that the spices are kept strangely far from the stove: they're just happy they found them. And <i>maybe</i> there is, for the casual user, some "security" in lock-in efforts such as MacOS calling home<sup><a href="#footnote1">[1]</a></sup> to check if a program is allowed to run and that web browsers automatically block certain URLs.</p>


<p>Likewise, maybe a handful of confused beginners are helped by the fact that certain system settings are extremely hard to find, or that you're supposed to put all your photos in a specific directory, or that you can't decide what partition you want to install a program on, or that some indexing service starts running when you least expect it, or that not a single application gives a crap about the few color settings you're allowed to make.</p>


<p>For the power user, such things range from nuisances to something that seriously hampers productivity and creativity.</p>


<p>It used to be that whenever I got a new computer, I spent a day or two setting it up. I selected the fonts I wanted to use, I picked the colors I liked for window decorations and GUI elements, I installed my preferred tools and utilities and I organized the desktop icons and program launchers to my liking. It took a bit of time, but it was a labor of love. In times of trouble I was, if nothing else, at least the boss of my own desktop environment.</p>


<p>I don't know of any proprietary OS where I can do that anymore. Linux is, considering what's going on with the major distributions, desktop environments and UI toolkits, seemingly heading the same way. Sure, pick your own window manager, see if we care - we've got client side decorations! Want to theme your GUI? Yeah, but not in our Snap packages you won't! Want to turn off cursor blinking? Mmmmyyeeaahhh, not too sure about that. Oh, you started a GUI file manager? Hey, enjoy the ten new folders we've littered your home directory with! They all start with capital letters: designed for typing convenience in a case sensitive file system.</p>


<p>Of course I still spend a fair amount of time setting up a Windows machine, but these days it's not the joyful experience of configuring the best fonts and nicest colors and arranging the icons on the start menu in the correct order for my muscle memory. Instead it's usually a week of swearing over removed settings and working hard to find the ones that actually remain, or trying various registry hacks to circumvent seemingly unchangeable defaults. I'm working against the system instead of with it, and someone else is trying to boss me around.</p>


<h3>A better example</h3>


<p>All of this could be different. It used to be. On my Amiga, I could configure <i>everything</i>. Apart from things like fonts and colors I could draw my own mouse pointer, tiling desktop backgrounds and icons. (Yes, the system really shipped with separate little paint programs just for pointers, desktop tiles and icons.) I could customize double click speed and key repeat rates on millisecond levels. I could even control the exact position of individual icons and the size and position of every individual directory window opened.</p>


<p>Most casual users didn't care about all that, but they didn't have to. The system came with a reasonable set of defaults and when or if they grew more proficient and wanted to change something about their daily working environment, they had the option to do so.</p>


<p>This was a great approach to users. Instead of being treated like an incompetent moron and placed in a walled garden, you were entrusted and empowered. Something as simple as drawing my own mouse pointer on the Amiga was a profound and formative experience for me. As corny as it sounds, it was as if the guys who built this amazing machine put it in my hands and said, "Hey kid, you're in charge. This computer is yours. Learn how to use it and you can make it do anything." It was a call for exploration and creativity.</p>


<p>Today, I can't even change the system font in Windows. I can select an "accent color", but most applications completely ignore it. Every program defaults to downloading into a Downloads folder and I've lost count of how many times I've changed its folder view from grouped to not grouped, only to discover it's been magically changed back the next time I browse it. Lots of settings have been removed completely while others are buried deep in strange places where a user clearly isn't really supposed to venture.</p>


<p>The problem is that there's no toggle for enabling "advanced mode". I'm just supposed to accept that I can no longer change simple things I've been able to configure for the past thirty years. Someone, somewhere just decided that all users have the same basic skill level and that the defaults are always acceptable.</p>


<h3>General purpose Instagram cameras</h3>


<p>I suppose the lack of configurability is a metaphor for personal computing in general: we're not buying our machines, we're renting them by way of bizarrely complex EULA:s for everything from the firmware to the OS and we're not supposed to be curious or creative, we're supposed to sit back and passively consume advertisements. The base level of creative computer use is no longer exploring programming or graphics or music, but photographing a meal someone else has prepared and then applying a predefined sepia filter to said photo. The base level of configuring a system is no longer picking some personal favorites among fonts and colors, but - maybe - selecting between dark and light mode.</p>


<p>
On the flip side, more and more people also need to use computers 
for actually producing stuff - not least programming all those ad 
delivery platforms and the curiously unconfigurable operating systems 
they run on. But there are also armies of innocents; office workers,
administrators, hotel clerks, librarians, teachers - those people now often 
have no choice but to strain their eyes staring at black text on bright 
white backgrounds, unable to select a font they find easier to read.
</p>

<p>Too bad they can no longer store their spices close to the stove, but hey, who cares? Let them take one for the team. We're all swimming in ad revenue and if people learn to configure things, maybe they'll suddenly realize that the presence of those ads should be configurable as well.</p>

  <p><span>07 Nov 2020</span></p><p>The purpose of this serie is to review some parts of the <em>CPython</em>’s code.</p>

<p>Why ?</p>

<p>Well there are multiple reasons :</p>

<ul>
  <li>Because we can. The project is opensource and the source code is freely available here : <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython">https://github.com/python/cpython</a></li>
  <li>I strongly believe that we, as developpers, can learn a lot by studying good and clean code. And I think we can safely assume that CPython’s code, which is used practicaly everywhere, meet this crietria.</li>
  <li>I also think that studying python internals can make us better python programmers, for example ever wondered why changing <em>sys.stdout</em> seems to have no effect on subprocesses ? Well at the end of this article You will know why.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will try to regulary realease articles  on random functions/modules/data strucutres/algorithms.</p>

<p>Starting today I don’t really have a plan or a timeline for future articles, I’ll just start with <em>subprocess.Popen</em> and go from there.</p>

<p>I’ll try to link PEPs, articles and disscussions whenever I can.</p>

<p>DISCLAIMER : I am not a Python Core Developper, therefore a lot of claims that I’ll make here may be wrong, especially if they’re not backed by any evidence.</p>

<p>With that being said, let’s read some code !</p>

<h2 id="wait--what-the-heck-is-cpython-">Wait … What the heck is CPython ?</h2>

<p><em>CPython</em> is the official python implementation. You need to understand that there is a difference between python specification and a python implementation.</p>

<p>A simple example can be the sorting function :</p>

<p>The python specification specify that a valid implementation should offer a <code>sorted</code> function which can take a list and sort it.</p>

<p>But as you may recall from your painfull algorithms course, there are multiple sorting algorithms, so which one are being used ? Well, as a lot of things, it depends on the implementation.</p>

<p>In fact you can create your own implementation and use bubble sort if you want, not a very practical choice but you can !</p>

<p><em>CPython</em> is widely used nowadays, and a lot of its code is wrote using C, again this is an implementation detail not a specification one.</p>

<p>There are other python implementations like <em>PyPy</em> (which use JIT compilation), or <em>Jython</em> which is ran on a JVM machine.</p>

<h2 id="getting-the-code">Getting the code</h2>

<p>the first step is to get the cpython code. For that we gonna just clone the official repo on github :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>git clone https://github.com/python/cpython.git</code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="subprocesspopen--the-class">Subprocess.Popen : The class</h2>

<p>Please note that we won’t really analyze ALL the code of <em>Popen</em>, there are way too many options and use cases to fit in this article.</p>

<p>Instead we juste gonna try to understand what happens when you execute this line of code :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>subprocess</span><span>.</span><span>Popen</span><span>([</span><span>'ls'</span><span>,</span> <span>'-l'</span><span>])</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>We need to find a starting point, we can simply do :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>$ </span>find <span>-name</span> subprocess.py 

./Lib/asyncio/subprocess.py
./Lib/subprocess.py</code></pre></figure>

<p>we can safely assume that the module we’re searching for is <code>Lib/subprocess</code>.</p>

<p>By searching for <code>Popen</code> in the file we find a class :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>class</span> <span>Popen</span><span>(</span><span>object</span><span>):</span>
    <span>""" Execute a child program in a new process.

    For a complete description of the arguments see the Python documentation.

    Arguments:
      args: A string, or a sequence of program arguments.</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>The first instruction is :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>_child_created</span> <span>=</span> <span>False</span>  <span># Set here since __del__ checks it</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>the <code>__del__</code> is basicaly a destructor method in python, this method is automatically called when the garbage collector try to free the object.</p>

<p>in CPython the garbage collector use what we call <em>reference counting</em>, this means that if you write something like this :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>3</span><span>]</span> 

<span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>4</span><span>,</span> <span>5</span><span>,</span> <span>6</span><span>]</span> <span># we affect a new list to a</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>In the second line we no longer have a reference to the list <code>[1, 2, 3]</code>, which means that the garbage collector may delete it (or not) any time.</p>

<p>my guess, is that if you run a command like this :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>subprocess</span><span>.</span><span>Popen</span><span>([</span><span>'my command'</span><span>])</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>since you’re not referencing the Popen object, it is a <em>garbage candidate</em>, and the gc may try to delete it before it run. Which is not the excepected behaviour since you except the command to run even if you don’t care about what it’ll return.</p>

<p>What surprises me tough is the fact that it’s a class attribute, there is surely a reason behind it, but i’m not sure what.</p>

<p>After doing a <code>git blame</code>, we can see that it was actually an instance attribute before this commit <a href="https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/72e7761301febe026536e7a2a444269698dcf156">72e7761301febe026536e7a2a444269698dcf156</a>. Which refers to this issue : <a href="https://bugs.python.org/issue12085">issue12085</a>.</p>

<p>And the explanation is as follow :</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If subprocess.Popen is called with a keyword argument whose name is undefined or simply too many arguments, an instance of the Popen class is created but its __init__ method call fails due to the invalid argument list. (Immediately) afterwards, the new instance is destroyed and its __del__ method is called, which checks the _child_created field that is defined by __init__; but __init__ never got the chance to execute, so the field is not defined, and __del__ raises an AttributeError, which is written out to stderr.</p>

  <p>- Oleg Oshmyan (chortos) [2011]</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="the-__init__-method">The <code>__init__</code> method</h2>

<p>the first instruction in the init method is :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>_cleanup</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>from the comment it looks like the purpose of the function is to avoid zombie processes. one thing that i like about this function is how the autor of the except explictly explain why he passes when he catches a ValueError and why it’s okay. I see a lot of developpers using the pattern <code>try: except (some exception or just Exception) pass</code> instead of treating the error proply. This can be very risky as it may hide a real error that you wish you saw before wasting 2 days trying to debug a random issue.</p>

<p>After that we can see some basic parameters validation : like <em>is bufsize an integer</em> ?</p>

<p>This is also a very good habit to have, especialy in a dynamicaly typed language like Python.</p>

<p>your code may still work with the wrong types and give you a wrong result, as an example :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>to_upper</span><span>(</span><span>list_str</span><span>):</span>
	<span>return</span> <span>[</span><span>s</span><span>.</span><span>upper</span><span>()</span> <span>for</span> <span>s</span> <span>in</span> <span>list_str</span><span>]</span>

<span>to_upper</span><span>([</span><span>'aaa'</span><span>,</span> <span>'bbb'</span><span>])</span> <span># ['AAA', 'BBB']
</span><span>to_upper</span><span>(</span><span>'ab'</span><span>)</span> <span># ['A', 'B']</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>As you can see altough it works, example 2 is clearly not what the user would expect.</p>

<p>You can also start to see that some code parts depends on the target plateforme (windows / POSIX), for the rest of this article, I’ll focus on the POSIX part.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>(</span><span>p2cread</span><span>,</span> <span>p2cwrite</span><span>,</span>
<span>c2pread</span><span>,</span> <span>c2pwrite</span><span>,</span>
<span>errread</span><span>,</span> <span>errwrite</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_get_handles</span><span>(</span><span>stdin</span><span>,</span> <span>stdout</span><span>,</span> <span>stderr</span><span>)</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>next we get the <em>file decriptors</em> related to the optional arguments stdin/stdout/stderr.</p>

<p>A file descriptor is an abstraction managed by the process, each file descriptor points to an entry in a system wide table called <em>Open file table</em>.</p>

<p>In python you can do :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"my file"</span><span>).</span><span>fileno</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>This will return the file descriptor.</p>

<p>Based on the comments and common sense it looks like, we will not always need 6 file descriptors, but only if we choose to communicate with the child process (which is not our case for our example).</p>

<p>In our example it looks like : <code>c2pwrite</code> will be the fd of the output of our script (1 if stdout) and <code>p2cread</code> the fd of the input of our script (0 if stdin).</p>

<p>In the <code>_get_handles</code> function :</p>

<p>looks like the default values (if no alternative stdout/in/err) is provided) : -1.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>p2cread</span><span>,</span> <span>p2cwrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
<span>c2pread</span><span>,</span> <span>c2pwrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>
<span>errread</span><span>,</span> <span>errwrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span>

 
<span>if</span> <span>stdin</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
	<span>pass</span>

<span>if</span> <span>stdout</span> <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
	<span>pass</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>the function seems to confirm our hypothesis :</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>else</span><span>:</span>
	<span># Assuming file-like object
</span>	<span>p2cread</span> <span>=</span> <span>stdin</span><span>.</span><span>fileno</span><span>()</span>
<span>else</span><span>:</span>
	<span># Assuming file-like object
</span>	<span>c2pwrite</span> <span>=</span> <span>stdout</span><span>.</span><span>fileno</span><span>()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>it does bug me how similar the stdin / stdout / stderr code is. I know if I had to write this code I will desperatly try to somehow refactore it in one block, I’m not sure tough if it will be a good idea, refactoring is not always a good thing.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"> <span># How long to resume waiting on a child after the first ^C.
</span> <span># There is no right value for this.  The purpose is to be polite
</span> <span># yet remain good for interactive users trying to exit a tool.
</span> <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>_sigint_wait_secs</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.25</span>  <span># 1/xkcd221.getRandomNumber()</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>I found the comment funny, for refecence this the xkcd comic that it refers to :</p>

<p><img src="https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/random_number.png" alt="xkcd comic"></p>

<p>next we call the function : <code>_execute_child</code> (POSIX version in our case) :</p>

<h2 id="_execute_child-function"><code>_execute_child</code> function</h2>

<p>Again some basic parameter validation.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>audit</span><span>(</span><span>"subprocess.Popen"</span><span>,</span> <span>executable</span><span>,</span> <span>args</span><span>,</span> <span>cwd</span><span>,</span> <span>env</span><span>)</span> </code></pre></figure>

<p>this will send a <em>signal</em> and subsribed functions may do things accordenly (no idea what tough).</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>_USE_POSIX_SPAWN</span>
	<span>and</span> <span>os</span><span>.</span><span>path</span><span>.</span><span>dirname</span><span>(</span><span>executable</span><span>)</span>

		<span>return</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>if the <code>_USE_POSIX_SPAWN</code> is true, python will try to use it to create the child process.</p>

<p>according to : <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190922113430/https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris10/subprocess-136439.html">https://web.archive.org/web/20190922113430/https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris10/subprocess-136439.html </a></p>

<p><code>posix_spawn</code> will not copy the data of the parent process, which can make the script start faster for larger processes.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="python"> 

 <span>if</span> <span>sys</span><span>.</span><span>platform</span> <span>==</span> <span>'linux'</span> <span>and</span> <span>libc</span> <span>==</span> <span>'glibc'</span> <span>and</span> <span>version</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>(</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>24</span><span>):</span>

</span> 	<span>return</span> <span>True</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>that if you are on a linux plateform and the version of <em>glibc</em> is greater than <em>2.24</em> you ll use <code>posix_spanw()</code>.</p>

<p>the 2.24 version of glibc has been released around 2016 so it’s fair to assume that if you have a recent linux distribution you ll also use <code>posix_spawn()</code>.</p>

<p>If you want to check</p>

      We need to talk.
    </p><div>

<p>Here’s a paraphrased conversation I’m having way to often, costing me way too much time, keeping me from doing things that are way more important:</p>

<pre>User: Hi, I'd like to report a bug in your application.
Me:   Great! Please open a support ticket, then.
User: But, it looks like I need to pay for that?
Me:   So?
User: I just want to tell you that your app is broken, so you can fix it.
Me:   Yes, that's a support request, please open a ticket.
User: ...
</pre>

<figure>

  </a>
  
</figure><p>
                             
                             
From there it typically derails into a whiny tirade about me being a crappy two bit developer who doesn’t give a shit about his code (which is ridiculous, since, professional pride aside, I have every incentive to fix bugs, to prevent my inbox from getting flooded) and just wants to rip off his users.</p>

<p>In the past, I sometimes gave in (when it sounded like something might be wrong). I looked at the issue and almost always found that nothing was broken, just didn’t work as expected (which is actually to be expected for every reasonably complex piece of software). The user just didn’t bother reading the docs and tried to bypass the fee by masquerading the support request as a bug report. So, nowadays my policy simply is: no support ticket, no service. Any such request goes straight to the trash folder without even being looked at.</p>

<h2 id="why-am-i-such-an-asshole">Why am I such an asshole?</h2>

<p>Here’s the thing: I write open source software to solve <strong>my problem</strong>. I let you use my solutions because that comes at zero cost for me (well, almost, I still have to pay for the website, you are downloading from. You are welcome, by the way). I also provide the source code, so you can fix things yourself, should my solution turn out to be unsuitable. However, once you come to me with a “bugreport” that doesn’t also include a patch (or at least very precisely pinpoints the problem), then you are basically asking me to <strong>look at your problem</strong>. At this point, it is no longer zero cost for me and that’s the reason for why I am charging you money: you are asking me to spent time on your behalf. That is commonly called <strong>work</strong>. And surprisingly enough, work is what people expect to be paid for.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong. I’m happy to help. Selling support is what keeps the lights on here (did I mention the cost of running a webserver?). But coming to me under false pretense and/or expecting that I <strong>must</strong> provide free service on top of a software I gave away without charge is not going to win you any favours.</p>

<p>It stops being free, when it starts costing me! My time is valuable. If you want a piece of it, I want money in return. Period.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> Seems like this post has struck a nerve and caused a few misunderstandings. <a href="https://raccoon.onyxbits.de/blog/reactions-bugreport-free-support/">Clarification on my position here</a>.</p>

<![CDATA[Lazy Loading Explained]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>Lazy loading is a very cool design pattern that is not often talked about. Many frameworks implement it without even telling us about it ðŸ˜Š. For example, .NET Entity Framework (all versions) support the pattern.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what is lazy loading? The idea behind the pattern is simple. By using lazy loading, we defer the initialization of objects (heavy ones) until we need them. Thatâ€™s it.</p>



<p>Letâ€™s provide an example. We have a simple HR application. The application supports the tracking of employee records. Each record has standard fields like name, email, date of birth, and image (like a profile picture), etc.</p>



<p>The application has operations like adding employees, updating employees, searching for an employee, generating reports, etc. Do all functions need the image of the employee? Should we load images in some aggregated reports? Of course not. A picture can take a lot of resources, so it is not reasonable to load it everywhere. And here, lazy loading comes to help us.</p>



<h2>Lazy loading implementation</h2>



<p>There are several ways to implement the lazy loading pattern, but we are going to inspect the most used one (when it comes to manual implementation).</p>



<p>In the source code, the employee domain model is represented like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Name <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>string</span> Email <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> Image <span>{</span> <span>get</span><span>;</span> <span>set</span><span>;</span> <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> Employee<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>public</span> <span>void</span> Load<span>(</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>// LOGIC LOADING ALL THE DATA.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>Nothing special. Just a class with three fields and a method which would load all the data. But as we said, most of the time, we do not want the Image data because it could take a lot of resources.</p>



<p>So, how do we <a href="https://ddimitrov.dev/2020/02/15/what-is-code-refactoring/">refactor</a> the class? We do It like this:</p>



<pre><div><div><p><span>public</span> <span>class</span> Employee<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>private</span> <span>byte</span><span>[</span><span>]</span> image<span>;</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p></div></div>

</pre>



<p>We followed only four steps:</p>



<ol type="1"><li>Extract the logic for image data load from the Load method to a new Method â€“ LoadImage;</li><li>Introduce a new private field for the image data;</li><li>Refactor the Image property to check if image data is null. If it is, the new method loads the image data, assigns it to the image field, and then return it to the consumer.</li></ol>



<p>Next time we load the object (or objects if we load a collection of them), we wonâ€™t have the overhead of loading unnecessary image data. We are going to extract the image data only when we need it (by accessing Image property).</p>



<h2><strong>ORMs</strong></h2>



<p>ORMs like <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/querying/related-data" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Entity Framework Core</a> support lazy loading. When a query is executed, not all the properties are loaded (unless you have disabled lazy loading). Only by accessing them, another query runs to fetch the data.</p>



<p>For example, imagine we have two entities in relation: a Company entity and an Employee entity. A company has many employees. If we query for a specific company by id and we get a result, the list of its employees wonâ€™t be loaded. Only when we access them a new query will fetch the collection.</p>



<p>In some cases, this is cool in others, not ðŸ˜Š.</p>



<p>Can we implement our own lazy loading if we are using some ORM? Sure. The thing you should do is not to map properties/entities that donâ€™t need to be loaded with every query. Of course, you should provide proper methods to handle the data that is not loaded.</p>



<p>In Entity Framework, you use the [NotMapped] attribute to annotate desired properties.</p>



<p>You can read in many places that lazy loading is used when accessing network resources. That is true but not complete. You can use lazy loading also for any demanding operation, like complex computations, reading big chunks of local data, etc.</p>

<p>This is a tiny lesson in design I learned at Freshworks. The lesson seems obvious in hindsight, but it wasn’t so obvious when we were making the mistake.</p>



<p>So, <a href="http://www.freshdesk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Freshdesk</a> is used by customer support teams day in and day out. When these teams log in to Freshdesk, we show them conversations their users had sent in over email, Twitter, Facebook, etc – in one place. &nbsp;</p>



<p>These customer support teams can pick between two different views to see these conversations when reading them on Freshdesk.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One view was called the <strong>card view</strong>. The card view is quite similar to how emails appear today in mobile Gmail. It was the default, and it looked like this:</p>

<p>The other one is <strong>table view</strong>, which looked more like a spreadsheet. Beyond just the subject, you can also gather additional details users may have filled in when they sent in the conversation (via a form, for instance).&nbsp;Table view looked like this:</p>

<p>When we got on calls with teams that used Freshdesk, we were surprised that they hadn’t discovered table view until we told them about it.</p>



<p>A person actually told us that the icon we had used to represent the table view was too small, and it appeared like a calculator and not actually a table.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The first time I heard it – I’ll be honest, I chuckled. Then, I went back and thought about it and felt he was totally right. We had all sorts of icons (with <strong>no</strong> supplemental text) that made no sense to our customers. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>That’s</strong>&nbsp;<strong>when I learned a design lesson that I carry in my heart till day.</strong></p>



<p>Everyone’s muscle memory recognises the icons for ‘Save’, ‘Delete’ and ‘New’ as ‘something that looks like a floppy’, ‘a bin’ or ‘a plus’, respectively. And they know what these icons convey in the apps they’re seeing them on.</p>



<p>But the products we’re building these days have more than just these universally recognized actions. Brand new icons you may be using to represent these actions aren’t part of anyone’s muscle memory (like the floppy or bin icons).&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your product has a button to let sales people change the deal stage, it cannot be just an icon. It’s got to be supplemented with text. </p>



<p>If you’re building a feature where you’re taking people to a ‘focus mode’ to do some intense work using a button, you can’t have just an icon to represent it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sure, your designers and product team might love having just icons to represent these actions to save space but your users will:&nbsp;</p>



<p>1. end up rarely noticing the icon if it’s not a frequent action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>2. when it’s a frequent action, they’ll click on the icon,&nbsp;</p>



<p>3. realise they clicked on the wrong one,</p>



<p>4. then go on a trip to find what they actually want to click on,</p>



<p>5. then click on the right one after some retries.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>It just doesn’t work when someone says “we can just use an icon and get rid of the text to save some space in the screen.”</strong> By doing that, you’re not saving space – you’re actually causing a usability problem that your customer base will run into hundreds or thousands of times a day.</p>



<p><strong>So, here’s the bottomline:</strong></p>



<p>More often than not, content eats icons for breakfast. Any action that’s <strong>not universal</strong> like ‘save’, ‘new’ or ‘delete’ <strong>must include text.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>By doing this, you actually eliminate the thinking required by your users every time they’re trying to click on that button.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you have 1000 users, and on average, if one user does an action that’s represented by only an icon 10 times a day, that’s 10,000 confused and unsure clicks.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ten thousand literal moments everyday when people are spending a few seconds to figure out if they’re clicking on the right button or not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eliminate those 10k*2 seconds = 5 hours by just adding relevant text to those icons 🙂</p>



<p><strong>You’re not just saving those 10 seconds, you’re saving customers from feeling stupid, which they should never feel when using your products anyway 🙂</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I don't expect to have an ARM-based PC any time soon</h2>

	<p><small>November 15, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>The ARM-related news of the time interval is of course that Apple
has announced several ARM-based Mac laptops and that early (and
preliminary) leaks are that they perform very well and are definitely
competitive. This raises the great hope in many technical people's
minds of ARM based laptops and desktops from more than Apple, ARM
PCs that would run more than Apple's OS X. This is especially a
dream for many Unix people, who already run little or no commercial
binary software and so in theory ARM support is only a recompile
away; moving away from the x86 hegemony would please a lot of people.</p>

<p>(The practice of moving to ARM is somewhat different, especially
for performance sensitive code. Focused use of x86 assembly is
surprisingly common in various places.)</p>

<p>My own view is that while I wouldn't mind using a competitive ARM
based PC (either laptop or desktop), I don't expect to actually
have one any time soon. The rub is that 'competitive'. Right now,
the only ARM chip maker that can compete with the performance of
the x86 hegemony in the desktop/laptop space is Apple, and Apple's
machines only run OS X. While there are promising developments in
the server space, many of them are also bespoke to the large cloud
vendors, and also may not be particularly suitable for scaling down
to desktops and laptops (in all sorts of dimensions, including how
much money can be made on them).</p>

<p>Apple has demonstrated that it's possible to make ARM be competitive
(on laptops, at least, although likely on desktops too), but <a href="https://twitter.com/thatcks/status/1326317293849153540">they
stand alone</a>
and I don't think it's likely for anyone else to join them. Apple has
the benefit of a gigantic market for their own ARM designs that
feeds a firehose of money into their R&amp;D budget and also good
assurance of large production runs even for laptop CPUs (never mind
phone ones). Anyone else would be in the position of trying to take
laptop and desktop CPU market share from Intel and AMD (who are
already fighting each other), without the kind of money firehose
and good market that Apple has.</p>

<p>(Apple also has the benefit of capturing all of the profit from its
laptops. An ARM CPU maker would capture much less of the profit of
machines with its CPUs in them; much of the overall profit would go
to the system vendors or at least to the makers of other parts, like
motherboards.)</p>

<p>The other problem is that merely being competitive isn't good enough,
because there are real costs to switching to ARM (even for Unix
people). It's likely that an ARM PC would need to be clearly better
than the x86 equivalent before very many people became interested,
and might face an extended period of doubt and proving itself. To
be honest, that would be my attitude toward the first generation
of ARM PCs; I would not buy immediately and let other people get
those experiences.</p>

<p>(I think this will be easier on laptops than on desktops, because
on laptops power efficiency can count for a lot. The longer battery
lifetime is already one of Apple's selling points for their new ARM
laptops)</p>

<p>PS: I would love to be wrong on this, as I'm not particularly fond
of the x86 hegemony. But I'm also a pragmatist.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>You’re happily working your way through a codebase when you happen upon some code that makes you stop and think: What the…!? Maybe it’s a method that’s doing something surprising. Or perhaps it’s doing something completely unsurprising, it’s just doing it in a surprising way.</p>

<p><img src="https://tekin.co.uk/images/20201113/math-lady.jpg" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="git-blame-to-the-rescue">Git blame to the rescue?</h2>

<p>When this happens you might instinctively reach for <code>git blame</code> to help you figure out what’s going on. After all, <code>git blame</code> gives you the commit that most recently touched the line, and often that’s enough to point you in the right direction. But often it isn’t and you’re none the wiser. That’s because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>git blame is too coarse</strong>: it reports against the whole line. If the most recent change isn’t related to the part of the line you’re interested, you’re out of luck.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too shallow</strong>: it only reports a single change; the most recent one. The story of the particular piece of code you’re interested in may have evolved over several commits.</li>
  <li><strong>git blame is too narrow</strong>: it only considers the file you are running blame against. The code you are interested in may also appear in other files, but to get the relevant commits on those you’ll need to run blame several times.</li>
</ul>

<p>If you only use <code>git blame</code> you’re limiting yourself to a one-dimensional perspective of the code you’re trying to understand. Wouldn’t it be better to view things in 3D!?</p>

<h2 id="a-more-powerful-way-to-trace-the-history-of-wtf-code">A more powerful way to trace the history of WTF code</h2>

<p>Thankfully Git has some pretty powerful search tools built right in. Let’s take a closer look at some of the tools at our disposal.</p>

<h2 id="find-all-commits-containing-a-particular-piece-code">Find all commits containing a particular piece code</h2>

<p>If <code>git blame</code> is entry-level history search, <code>git log -S</code> (also known as “the pickaxe”) is how you take things to the next level. It lets you search for all commits that contain a given string:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>git log <span>-S</span> <span>"method_name"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will return all the commits that contain <code>method_name</code> across the entire repository, giving you a bespoke history of a piece of code across both multiple commits and files. You can use the pickaxe to examine the entire history of a particular snippet: all the places it’s been used; how it’s usage has changed; if it’s moved file; when it was first introduced, and more.</p>

<h2 id="see-the-diffs-alongside-the-commit-messages">See the diffs alongside the commit messages</h2>

<p>If you include the <code>-p</code> option (short for <code>--patch</code>) you get the full diff alongside the commit messages, giving you even more context and making it easier to spot the relevant changes:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-the-commit-that-first-added-some-code">Find the commit that first added some code</h2>

<p>Say you want to find the first commit that introduced a particular class, method or snippet of code. You can use the pickaxe combined with the <code>--reverse</code> option to get the commits in reverse-chronological order so the commit where the code first appears is listed at the top:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "method_name" -p --reverse
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="find-when-a-piece-of-code-was-deleted">Find when a piece of code was deleted</h2>

<p>Because the pickaxe search finds both additions and deletions, you can even use it to find code that has since been deleted:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "deleted code" -p
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Assuming the snippet no longer exists in the codebase the first commit returned will be the one where it was removed.</p>

<h2 id="limit-the-scope-of-the-search">Limit the scope of the search</h2>

<p>Because we’re using <code>git log</code> you can also provide a path to focus the search to a given file or folder:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -S "some code" -p app/models/user.rb
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="search-deeper-with-a-regular-expression">Search deeper with a regular expression</h2>

<p>I mostly stick to the pickaxe because I find working with regular expressions cumbersome, but if you want to perform a more advanced search using a regular expression you can do so with <code>-G</code> instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log -G "REGEX HERE"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>It’s also worth noting that searching with <code>-S</code> has a subtle limitation that <code>-G</code> does not: <code>-S</code> only shows commits that either added or removed the search string. If the string you are searching for moved within the same file but was otherwise unchanged, <code>-S</code> won’t include that commit, whereas <code>-G</code> will.</p>

<h2 id="search-the-commit-messages-themselves">Search the commit messages themselves</h2>

<p>Sometimes searching for literal code is too narrow, or the information you’re after isn’t actually in the code but in the commit messages themselves. In which case you can use <code>--grep</code> to search commit messages instead:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ git log --grep "commit message search"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="in-summary">In summary</h2>

<p>Next time some code has you puzzled and you want to understand more about it, look beyond <code>git blame</code> and dig deeper into the history using the pickaxe and friends:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Find the entire history of a snippet of code with <code>git log -S</code></li>
  <li>Include <code>-p</code> to see the diff as well as the commit messages</li>
  <li>Include <code>--reverse</code> to see the commit that introduced the code listed first</li>
  <li>Scope search to specific folders or files by including a path</li>
  <li>Search with a regular expression using <code>git log -G</code></li>
  <li>Search commit messages using <code>git log --grep</code></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="epilogue">Epilogue</h2>

<p>Of course searching a codebase’s history will only be fruitful if the history itself is helpful. If the history hasn’t been constructed with atomic commits that have useful commit messages, searching it will likely be a frustrating and unhelpful experience.</p>

										                <p><em>A superresolution image of a group of killer T-cells (green and red) surrounding a cancer cell (blue, centre). Image: US NIH.</em></p>
<p>On World Cancer Day this year, Tata Memorial Hospital in Mumbai, known in India for its cancer care facilities, <a href="https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/mumbai/exploring-new-options-in-cancer-care/article30729911.ece">announced</a> that it would study the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02161900">effects of yoga</a> on breast cancer patients. While the association between <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/features/regular-exercise-helps-patients-combat-cancer-67317">exercise and recovery</a> in cancer patients has been known since the 1990s, we know little about how this works on a molecular level.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://elifesciences.org/articles/59996">new study</a> shows that the key might lie in activating certain immune cells. The study, conducted by Randall Johnson and his team from the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden, and the University of Cambridge, was the culmination of three years of research on what makes exercise good for cancer patients.</p>


<p>They first established that exercise could indeed decrease the growth of tumours. They induced tumours in mice, mimicking breast cancer in humans, and separated them into two groups: one exercised on running wheels and one did not. After a few days, the tumours had shrunk in the group that exercised but not in the sedentary group.</p>
<p>When the researchers examined blood samples from the mice, two things had dramatically increased after exercise: immune cells known as CD8+ T-cells and a compound called lactic acid.</p>
<p>The team first looked into CD8+ T-cells, which <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-analysis/the-ever-expanding-t-cell-world-a-primer-31123">defend against</a> tumours and infections. Did increased levels after exercise mean that the cells were involved in reducing tumour growth? To test this, the team removed CD8+ T-cells from tumour-bearing mice and then made them exercise. This time, exercising could not shrink the tumours: removing the T-cells also removed the positive effects of exercise.</p>
<p>“Then we did what, to my mind, is the coolest experiment in the paper,” said Johnson. They made mice exercise, carefully took CD8+ T-cells from them, and transplanted the cells into another set of mice that had tumours but didn’t exercise. To the scientists’ delight, simply transplanting CD8+ T-cells from mice that had exercised could shrink tumours in sedentary mice.</p>
<p>“The T-cells themselves are coming in ‘trained,’ making them better anti-tumour T-cells,” Johnson said.</p>
<p>What was ‘training’ the T-cells, though? That’s when the team turned their attention to lactic acid. After an intense bout of exercise, lactic acid is what makes your muscles feel like they’re burning. In the bloodstream, it circulates as lactate, its ionic form.</p>
<p>To mimic this form and the levels attained after exercise, the researchers injected sodium lactate into sedentary mice that had tumours. As with the T-cells, they found that daily injections of sodium lactate could shrink tumours and improve survival in these mice.</p>
<p>The team now knew that, through exercise, both lactate and CD8+ T-cells could reduce tumour growth. But this still didn’t explain how the two effects were linked.</p>
<p>To answer this, the scientists first checked whether lactate could independently activate CD8+ T-cells – and found that it could. Next, they again injected mice with lactate, only this time they removed the CD8+ T-cells from the mice. Without the T-cells, lactate injections could no longer lessen tumour growth.</p>
<p>“This shows that it’s really the lactate affecting the T-cells and helping them achieve a better anti-tumour effect,” Johnson said.</p>
<p><ins>Also read: <a href="https://science.thewire.in/health/why-everyone-around-you-seems-to-be-getting-cancer/">Why Everyone Around You Seems to Be Getting Cancer</a></ins></p>
<p>The study fills an important gap in our understanding of how exercise and the related metabolite changes boost anti-tumour the activities of our immune cells.</p>
<p>This said, “My main concern is that people should not think that only exercise can cure cancer,” S.V. Chiplunkar, a former director of the Advanced Centre for Treatment, Research and Education in Cancer, Mumbai, and current head of its Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy division, cautioned.</p>
<p>“A combination of immunotherapy with supervised exercise or yoga regimens may yield significant benefits, but this needs to be tested in a randomised clinical trial.” Chiplunkar wasn’t involved in the study.</p>
<p>And as with any good study, this one spawned more questions than it answered. “Future studies should address how lactate levels are modulated in cancer patients/mice models in response [to] exercise,” Rajender Motiani, an assistant professor and DBT/Wellcome Trust India fellow at the Regional Centre for Biotechnology, Faridabad, said.</p>
<p>“A <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-019-0485-4">recent study</a> in elite athletes showed that lactate is utilised by a unique class of gut microbiome, enhancing endurance and performance. It would be worth examining gut microbiota changes in cancer patients in response to exercise.”</p>
<p>Johnson’s team is now working out how much exercise is needed to boost T-cell activity. For example, one question they’re asking is if one hour of intense exercise could be better than two hours of light exercise.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Helene Rundqvist, the study’s lead author, has been involved in a <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02522260?term=exercise&amp;cond=Breast+Cancer&amp;cntry=SE&amp;city=Stockholm&amp;draw=2&amp;rank=1">clinical trial</a> assessing the effects of exercise on breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. The trial is still active and expected to be completed in 2022.</p>

This not only ensures prevention of conflicts but also makes it easy to deploy this application anywhere you want.</p><p>Once this virtual environment is activated, your development environment is setup.</p><h5><strong>Creating a Django project</strong></h5><p>Once the virtual environment is created and the necessary python packages are installed, the boilerplate code you need can be created by using a nifty tool called django-admin. We will use this to create a project called <em>notesapp</em>. This not only creates the project structure but also configures a default SQLite database that you can use for the application. </p><p>This database is nothing but a single file created locally with the name <em>db.sqlite3</em> and is very handy to quickly prototype your application. You can change the database settings inside <em>settings.py</em> to point it to any database. This can be done later too once the basic functionality of your application is ready and works with SQLIte.</p><p>After your Django project is created, you also have to create a new Django app which we will use to define our models and APIs. Let's call this <em>notes. </em>Make sure to add this to the INSTALLED_APPS section of your settings.py</p><h3>Creating database models</h3><p>Before writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs, we must first create a database model on which we wish to perform the CRUD&nbsp;operations. Let us create a model called <em>Note </em>in notes/models.py.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/d5e29080d973326be371f0d03a5d23ef.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Before we proceed we must update the schema because a new database table needs to be created in the underlying database. This can be done by creating and running migrations</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE: https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/8234bd9ad41637718be8dca4dba04235.js&lt;/p&gt;<br>‍</p><h3>Creating the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</h3><p>Now that the model has been created, we need a way to perform CRUD operations on this model by writing as little code as possible. This is where Django Rest Framework comes in. Not only can you expose CRUD&nbsp;APIs on this model within minutes, but you also get a pretty nifty user interface to view those APIs in action. </p><p>To do this, you must first define a serializer for the database model you created in the above step. <strong>‍</strong></p><h5><strong>Defining a serializer</strong></h5><p>A serializer is responsible for two things<br></p><ol start="1" role="list"><li>To validate an incoming create/update request and reject it if the fields are not in the format that is required to create/update an entry in the database table.</li><li>To convert a database table entry into a format like JSON&nbsp;that can be transferred over the internet to the client.</li></ol><p>Let us create a serializer in notes/serializers.py as follows.</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/4d69bb0c0de94789842fe9eb23e8e882.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍</p><p>Inside the Meta class, we define which database model is being serialized and what all fields within that model should be serialized. We could choose to include only certain fields from the model that we would like to expose over the API.</p><p>We can also define certain fields as <em>read_only</em> which indicates that these fields will be ignored if present in a create/update request but they will be present in the response a read request. </p><p>In this above case, is_active is responsible for indicating if a note has been deleted or not. Therefore we must not allow it to be modified via a create/update request and it should be set to false only when a delete operation is performed. This will become more clear in the upcoming steps. </p><p>We can also define fields as <em>write_only </em>which will indicate that these fields will not be present in a read response but we will allow the field to be modified in a create/update request. We can now proceed to writing the CRUD&nbsp;APIs</p><h5><strong>Defining an API&nbsp;View set</strong></h5><p>In Django, the APIs are written in views.py and each API&nbsp;that does some operation on a certain database resource is a view. In our case we will be performing multiple operations on the database model and hence what we need is a viewset. Here is how you define one in notes/views.py</p><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/b313384c0774ec4f1dee342ced8ccc20.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>‍<br>‍<br>This viewset is now capable of performing all the CRUD&nbsp;operations and it will use the NoteSerializer to determine how the data will be received and how it will be sent back to the requesting client. <br></p><p>Since a read operation could be retrieving a single note or listing all the existing notes, we need a way to handle both cases. </p><p>The <em>get_object </em>is responsible to determine how an object is retrieved. In this case we look for an <em>id </em>field in the query parameters of a a request and use that to retrieve a note. </p><p>This method is also used while making an update operation because to update a particular note we would have to first retrieve that note.</p><p>The <em>get_queryset</em> method is responsible for determining how a list operation will work. In this case we will be listing all the notes which are still active and sort them in the decreasing order of the <em>last_udpated_on</em> timestamp.</p><p>The <em>perform_delete</em> method will determine what to do when a delete operation is requested. In this case we do not want to delete the row from the database and we simply want to deactivate it. Therefore we will be setting the <em>is_active</em> field to False and saving the note.</p><h5>‍<strong>Defining the URL&nbsp;path</strong>‍</h5><p>We just have one more step to complete before we can see our APIs in action and that is to determine what URL&nbsp;path will invoke the above viewset. This can be done in notesapp/urls.py as follows.<br>‍</p><p>‍<br>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/902b7c23e95e3cb4ddf99f1b52bbbe52.js&lt;/p&gt;</p><div><p>‍</p><p>To explain what is going on here, we are basically saying that if the url <em>/note</em> is called, no matter what the HTTP&nbsp;method is, we will be invoking the NoteViewSet and based on what the HTTP method is we will call a particular method within this viewset.<strong>‍</strong></p></div><ol start="1" role="list"><li>A POST&nbsp;call will result in a create operation of the Note model.</li><li>A GET&nbsp;call will result in retrieving a single Note model object using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A&nbsp;PUT&nbsp;call will result in replacing an existing Note model with a new Note and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A PATCH&nbsp;call will result in modifying only a certain field inside an existing Note model instead of entirely replacing it and the existing Note model will be fetched using the <em>id</em> query parameter.</li><li>A DELETE&nbsp;call will result in calling a destroy function which internally calls the <em>perform_destroy</em> method defined above in views.py.</li></ol><p>In case you haven't noticed, there is one thing missing in this url PATH and that is the ability to list all the existing Note model objects. </p><p>To solve this I&nbsp;created another URL&nbsp;path <em>/note/all </em>where I am invoking the same viewset as the above one with the difference being the GET&nbsp;call will now invoke a list method on the viewset instead of a retrieve method which means that the <em>get_queryset </em>method defined earlier will be invoked.<br></p><h3>See your APIs in action<br></h3><p>Okay enough talk, let us now run the server and view the APIs in action. You can run the Django development server using the below command and it will expose your server on the 8000 port on localhost.</p><div><p>‍</p><p>&lt;p&gt; CODE:&nbsp;https://gist.github.com/sankalpjonn/473d335affb3426f7d5cbc1a747e4fe4.js&lt;/p&gt;</p></div><blockquote>Please do not forget to include <em>r…</em></blockquote></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-body-4608430843265935994">
<p>I am what I would call a non-famous public person. What do I mean by that? I mean that I have jobs where people publicly review my work. As a college instructor, I receive student reviews. Some of them get read internally at our school, and some of them get posted publicy. And they’re attached to my name. They’re not some product where people might just know my company or my brand. They know <em>me</em>, and they’re reviewing <em>me</em>. As an author, my books get reviewed. Some of those reviews are by editors and official reviewers internal to the publisher. Some of those reviews are by email. But most of those reviews are posted online. As a software developer and hobbyist podcaster I also get public reviews.</p>

<p>To anyone in a personalized creative field who cares deeply about their work, bad reviews hurt. It’s not just about being sensitive (although I am sensitive and that doesn’t help). It’s that when you really pour your heart into something, as I do my teaching for example, then the product is an extension of you. Nobody would deny that the way a class or a book turns out is an extension of the personality, knowledge, and ability of the teacher/author. And when the product is criticized, it’s like you are being criticized. </p>

<p>My dad, who was also a college instructor, and the producer of nine books and nine instructional videos among many other public creative ventures, had a very thin skin. He couldn’t stand me reading him a bad review. That stuck with me. This very accomplished man, couldn’t stand even a little criticism. When I get too sensitive, I try to remember how his inability to accept criticism hurt some of his products. He was much more about getting things done than doing them perfectly. If he had a little bit more of a perfectionist streak in him, he would have done even better. But maybe he would have done less…</p>

<p>It doesn’t matter if I receive eighteen great reviews for a class. It’s the words of the two bad reviews that stick with me. And do you know why? <em>Because almost always there’s a kernel of truth to those reviews.</em> Does that mean we should listen to them? Well if I only listened to the bad reviews, I would never produce anything. I would just stay in bed. The fact is the people who are getting no bad reviews, are the people who are not taking the risk of putting themselves out there. So, we have to not let ourselves get so discouraged that we stop producing. And we have to remember that while we may not have served those two students well, we may have served those other eighteen students better than they would have been served in a world without us teaching them. </p>

<p>We can’t please every student or every customer. Nothing that gets watched/read by more than a few people is going to be liked by all of them. Even Mother Theresa would get a downvote on YouTube. So, if we’re serving the majority, we don’t want to let the critiques of a few steer us in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>On the other hand, being like my dad is dangerous too. <strong>No, the customer is not always right. But usually the customer has a point. We have to always be working to get better.</strong> Because we’re not perfect, and there’s always room for improvement. <strong>And we need to read those bad reviews to find those spaces for improvement.</strong> It doesn’t mean they’re right, but it does mean we need to think about them.</p>

<p>My dad accomplished an amazing amount. If he let those bad reviews slow him down too much, it’s very possible he would have not accomplished as much. But if he could have found a few tweaks, a few changes, to serve a few customers better, well then he could have grown through them. I want to grow, but I also don’t want to stop. So, I can’t let the reviews get me too down, but I have to read them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p><strong>In this article, let’s learn to compute VMAF, PSNR, and SSIM using FFmpeg. While working on videos (compression or post-processing), it is common to compute objective metrics in addition to doing subjective Visual Quality testing. If you are using FFmpeg in your workflow, it is very easy to compute these metrics instead of purchasing expensive tools. </strong></p>



<p>Let’s go ahead and take a look at these metrics and how they are computed, shall we?</p>



<hr>



<h2>What is VMAF?</h2>



<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/Netflix/vmaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">VMAF from Netflix</a></strong>&nbsp;stands for Video Multi-method Assessment Fusion, and it is a video quality metric that combines human vision modeling with machine learning. It’s become very popular as it succeeds (not fully) at automating subjective quality testing that usually requires humans to watch and score videos.</p>



<p>FFmpeg and Netflix’s VMAF are now part of every video processing and compression engineer’s toolbox. To understand how to install VMAF, please read our “<a href="https://ottverse.com/vmaf-ffmpeg-ubuntu-compilation-installation-usage-guide/">VMAF Installation</a>” article.</p>



<hr>



<h2>How to Compute VMAF using FFmpeg</h2>



<p>Let’s look at a couple of ways of computing VMAF. </p>



<p><strong>If your source and destination videos are of the same dimensions (height and width)</strong>, then you can directly compute the VMAF value using the command line below. </p>



<p>All you need to do is point FFmpeg to the location of the VMAF model file and it will do the rest. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi libvmaf="model_path=vmaf_v0.6.1.pkl":log_path=vmaf_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p><strong>However, in case the source and destination videos are not of the same resolution, then you have to ensure that the destination is brought to the same resolution as the source video before computing VMAF</strong>.</p>



<p>Here is a simple one-liner that uses the <code>filter_complex</code> to do the resolution change and then computes the VMAF value. I have used the <code>bicubic</code> filter to do the up/down scaling. </p>



<pre><code><code>bin/ffmpeg -i test_720p30.mp4 -i test_1080p30.mp4 -filter_complex "[0:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic[main]; [1:v]scale=1920x1080:flags=bicubic,format=pix_fmts=yuv420p,fps=fps=30/1[ref]; \</code>
<code>[main][ref]libvmaf=psnr=true:log_path=vmaflog.json:log_fmt=json" \</code>
<code>-f null -</code></code></pre>



<p>The log file that is produced by the VMAF computation is very comprehensive. It provides a frame-wise score of VMAF and its constituent metrics, along with the aggregate score (if that’s all you are looking for). </p>



<p>Here is an example of the VMAF file. </p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="205" src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=1024%2C205&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" alt="VMAF using FFMpeg" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://889329.smushcdn.com/2063466/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?size=240x48&amp;lossy=1&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 240w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=300%2C60&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://889329.smushcdn.com/2063466/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?size=480x96&amp;lossy=1&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 480w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=768%2C154&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://889329.smushcdn.com/2063466/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?size=960x192&amp;lossy=1&amp;strip=1&amp;webp=1 960w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=1024%2C205&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=1200%2C240&amp;ssl=1 1200w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=1536%2C307&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?w=1771&amp;ssl=1 1771w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/ottverse.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/vmaf-1.png?resize=1024%2C205&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure>

<h2>What is PSNR and How Is It Calculated?</h2>



<p>From Wikipedia, </p>



<p><em><strong>Peak signal-to-noise ratio, often abbreviated&nbsp;PSNR, is an engineering term for the ratio between the maximum possible power of a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signal_(information_theory)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">signal</a>&nbsp;and the power of corrupting&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noise" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noise</a>&nbsp;that affects the fidelity of its representation.&nbsp;</strong></em></p>



<p>So, for a video, you are essentially trying to compute how much noise or pixel corruption has been introduced due to the video compression process which is essentially lossy (mainly due to Quantization). </p>



<p>The first step is to compute the Mean Squared Error or MSE. The formula is shown below where I and K represent the original and destination images respectively and <code>m</code> and <code>n</code> are the height and width of the images respectively. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/3a34719b4f391dba26b3e8e4460b7595d62eece4" alt="{\mathit  {MSE}}={\frac  {1}{m\,n}}\sum _{{i=0}}^{{m-1}}\sum _{{j=0}}^{{n-1}}[I(i,j)-K(i,j)]^{2}" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>



<p>Once you have the MSE, you can compute the PSNR using the formula shown below. </p>



<p><img src="https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fc22801ed1232ff1231c4156b589de5c32063a8a" alt="{\begin{aligned}{\mathit  {PSNR}}&amp;=10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}^{2}}{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({\frac  {{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}{{\sqrt  {{\mathit  {MSE}}}}}}\right)\\&amp;=20\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{\mathit  {MAX}}_{I}}\right)-10\cdot \log _{{10}}\left({{{\mathit  {MSE}}}}\right)\end{aligned}}" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>



<p>Here,&nbsp;<em>MAX<sub>I</sub></em>&nbsp;is the maximum possible pixel value of the image. When the pixels are represented using 8 bits per sample, this is 255. </p>



<h2>How to Calculate PSNR using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>You don’t have to go through all those calculations while using FFmpeg. All you need to do use the filter module <code>lavfi</code> and tell it to compute the PSNR. That’s it. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi psnr=stats_file=psnr_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>FFmpeg will print the average PSNR on the console while the log file will contain a frame-wise list of the MSE and the PSNR for the Luma and Chroma planes (y, u, and v). An example is shown below – </p>



<pre><code>n:1 mse_avg:54.96 mse_y:72.51 mse_u:27.98 mse_v:11.74 psnr_avg:30.73 psnr_y:29.53 psnr_u:33.66 psnr_v:37.43 
 n:2 mse_avg:69.70 mse_y:93.80 mse_u:31.01 mse_v:12.02 psnr_avg:29.70 psnr_y:28.41 psnr_u:33.22 psnr_v:37.33 
 n:3 mse_avg:72.74 mse_y:98.37 mse_u:31.02 mse_v:11.96 psnr_avg:29.51 psnr_y:28.20 psnr_u:33.21 psnr_v:37.35 
 n:4 mse_avg:73.11 mse_y:98.94 mse_u:31.14 mse_v:11.76 psnr_avg:29.49 psnr_y:28.18 psnr_u:33.20 psnr_v:37.43 </code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>How to Calculate SSIM using FFmpeg?</h2>



<p>Finally, let’s take a look at computing SSIM using FFmpeg. Again looking at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_similarity" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definition of SSIM</a>, </p>



<p><em><strong>The&nbsp;structural similarity&nbsp;index measure&nbsp;(SSIM) is a method for predicting the perceived quality of digital television and cinematic pictures, as well as other kinds of digital images and videos. SSIM is used for measuring the similarity between two images. The SSIM index is a&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_quality#Classification_of_objective_video_quality_metrics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full reference metric</a>; in other words, the measurement or prediction of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_quality" target="_blank" rel="noopener">image quality</a>&nbsp;is based on an initial uncompressed or distortion-free image as reference.</strong></em></p>



<p>Calculating SSIM using FFmpeg is very similar to calcuating PSNR. </p>



<pre><code>ffmpeg.exe -i videoToCompare.mp4 -i originalVideo.mp4 -lavfi ssim=stats_file=ssim_logfile.txt -f null -</code></pre>



<p>The output of this command is going to look like this – </p>



<pre><code>[Parsed_ssim_0 @ 0000029c82894300] SSIM Y:0.926845 (11.357537) U:0.876798 (9.093807) V:0.860658 (8.559193) All:0.907472 (10.337287)</code></pre>



<p>And the log file will give you information on the SSIM values for each of the planes (Y, U, and V) along with the aggregate for each of the frames of the video. </p>



<pre><code> n:1 Y:0.930033 U:0.926453 V:0.913508 All:0.926682 (11.347897)
 n:2 Y:0.919140 U:0.915343 V:0.910900 All:0.917134 (10.816226)
 n:3 Y:0.922417 U:0.915795 V:0.910959 All:0.919404 (10.936853)
 n:4 Y:0.920077 U:0.916443 V:0.912994 All:0.918291 (10.877300)
 n:5 Y:0.926438 U:0.927597 V:0.917905 All:0.925209 (11.261518)
 n:6 Y:0.920619 U:0.919988 V:0.918780 All:0.920207 (10.980375)</code></pre>



<hr>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>That’s it folks – now you know how to calculate three very important objective metrics for video quality evaluation — PSNR, VMAF, and SSIM. By computing all three and using them for analysis, it’s hard to be thrown off by artifacts that one metric can catch and the other can’t. </p>



<p>And like always, do spend a few minutes doing some visual testing (subjective) after you’re done with the objective scores! </p>

<p>Do you hate writing? Me too.</p>



<div><p>I am not talking about tweets or IG posts. I’m talking about 500 word long articles and essays. Most of us don’t like writing them. They take too much time and effort. </p><p>But is time really the problem? I don’t think so. We spend a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.broadbandsearch.net/blog/average-daily-time-on-social-media" target="_blank">lot of time</a> on social media everyday right? Yeah time is not the problem.</p></div>



<p>So is effort the problem? Hmm let’s see. What happens when you open a blank page to write? Does anxiety kicks in? For me it does. </p>







<p>See, when I plan to write an article, usually I have a general idea about the topic I plan to write about. Though as soon as I open a blank page, my ideas start ruffling among each other making a mess. I don’t have clarity anymore. Everything starts falling apart, anxiety kicks in and …. I close the tab. Phew too much trouble for a few likes. </p>







<p>But after a few days / weeks those ideas start dying. The worst part is I see them dying without seeing the light of the day. That sucks. </p>



<p>And that’s why I try to write, and you should too.</p>



<p>Writing about a topic gives me a platform to just lay my ideas wide in the open. It’s like clearing my mental hard drive. It feels relaxing. </p>



<p>But If I just pour my random thoughts on a piece of paper that’s just writing, not <em>good</em> writing. I don’t want people to see a mishmash of ill shaped ideas, I want them to see a well ordered architecture where every part fits in. It’s not just for the sake of readers though, It’s for the ideas themselves. </p>



<p>Often about a topic, I have a range of musings. They’re like vectors, each with their own direction and magnitude. They make sense individually but to understand about the topic as a whole, all of them need to come in sync. Their rhythm has to match. That’s what good writing does. </p>



<blockquote><p>Good writing is just clear thinking expressed on paper.</p></blockquote>



<p>Writing about a topic makes me think about it from all the directions and perspectives. </p>



<p><em>What do I know about this topic?</em></p>



<p><em>Do I know enough?</em></p>



<p><em>If everything I know, correct?</em></p>



<p><em>How can I fill my gaps?</em></p>







<p>Jotting down everything I know helps me answer many of these questions. The ones still unanswered force me to research more. It’s a cycle.</p>



<p>Each draft of writing takes me one step closer to the complete and clear picture. The ultimate truth starts showing itself in the end. It’s a bliss moment.</p>



<p>The learning readers get is always a pleasant <em>byproduct</em>. </p>







<p>As one of my favorite writer <a href="https://twitter.com/Julian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Julian</a> says, </p>



<blockquote><p>The best writing is therapy that you publish for the world to learn from.</p></blockquote>







<p>After self-learning and expression, what is the next best thing writing offers?</p>



<p><strong>Relationships</strong>.</p>



<figure><div>
<div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Writing online is a superpower.</p><p>Here’s a list of people who should start writing online.</p><p>1. The Niche Hobbyist</p><p>The Internet rewards people with obscure interests. Writing online will help you find other like-minded hobbyists who you wouldn’t be able to find in real-life.</p></div>— David Perell (@david_perell) <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1227612675334660099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 12, 2020</a></blockquote></div>
</div></figure>



<div><p>Writing online helps you create meaningful relationships, sometimes even indirectly. When people read well written articles, they can’t stop but appreciate the coherent thinking of the writer. These artifacts demonstrate author’s expertise in the given topic and hence increase their visibility.</p><p>Internet is a great place, good content can reach thousands of people with zero marketing. </p></div>



<blockquote><p>“By making it easy for people to find you online, you’ll create a vehicle for serendipity.” – <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell">@david_perell</a></p></blockquote>



<p>This visibility can get you job offers, network of influential people, money and many other things. </p>



<div><p>I can go on and on about the benefits of putting yourself out there but it’s a moo point. You have to experience the magic yourself. When a stranger thanks you for a piece of advice or a someone asks if they can use your work, it feels great. </p><p>Not trying to brag here but even as a crappy writer myself, I have experienced the joy of someone reaching out to me to thank me for my work. You should too!</p></div>

<p><br>To sum up, writing offers you a landscape to let your thoughts crash with each each other at full speed until they form a elegant symphony together. </p>



<p>This symphony creates a lasting impression on the audience and opens a gateway to serendipitous interactions.  </p>

      <div>
        <article>
          <section><p>Earlier this year I bought a Raspberry Pi 3 to have as an AArch64
development machine. The fastest way to get familiar with an
instruction set is to write a disassembler for it and I’ve made one
for 64-bit <span>ARM</span> in R6RS Scheme as part of
the <a href="https://github.com/weinholt/machine-code">machine-code</a> project.
The instruction set is called <span>ARM</span> A64, instructions are always 32 bits
wide and they have a neat structure which is pretty fast to decode in&nbsp;software.</p>

<p>The architecture has 31 integer registers (x0-x30). There is also a
stack pointer register and a zero register that always contains
zeroes. Both these registers are encoded as register number 31, and
it’s up to each instruction if an operand can use the stack pointer or
the zero register. The x30 register is used to store the return
address. These registers are all 64-bit registers and the lower 32
bits can be accessed using the names w0-w31. Operations that write to
the lower 32 bits also clear the upper 32 bits, just like on&nbsp;<span>AMD64</span>.</p>
<p>There are also 32 registers usable as either floating point registers
or 128-bit vector registers. As vectors they support different
arrangements that are either 64 or 128 bits in total, containing
8-bit, 16-bit, 32-bit or 64-bit quantities. There are many
instructions that operate on multiple quantities at the same time,
which is an interesting way to speed up code. Multiple loop iterations
can be run&nbsp;simultaneously.</p>
<p>The instructions are documented in the <a href="https://developer.arm.com/docs/ddi0487/a/arm-architecture-reference-manual-armv8-for-armv8-a-architecture-profile"><span>ARM</span> ARM for ARMv8-A</a>. I’ve
counted, not including instruction aliases, 442 instruction mnemonics
(things like <span>ADD</span>, EOR, B.EQ, etc). They are organized in what is
basically a four-level table: main encoding, instruction group, decode
group and instruction. Chapter C4 of the manual follows the same
structure. This structure is nice for fast decoding, but it’s not
strictly necessary since all encodings at the instruction level still
need to have a unique&nbsp;meaning.</p>
<p>For each instruction mnemonic there can be multiple variants that
enable the instruction to handle different types of operands. An
example of this is the <span>FMUL</span> instruction that multiples two floating
point values. In a C program it would look like <code>a = b * c</code>. In A64
assembler it might look like one of these, depending on what the
surrounding code&nbsp;does:</p>
<pre><code><span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>s2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>d2</span>            
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.<span>4</span>s   
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.<span>2</span>d   
<span>fmul</span> <span>s0</span>, <span>s1</span>, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]       
<span>fmul</span> <span>d0</span>, <span>d1</span>, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>] 
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>4</span>s, <span>v1</span>.<span>4</span>s, <span>v2</span>.s[<span>0</span>]
<span>fmul</span> v0.<span>2</span>d, <span>v1</span>.<span>2</span>d, <span>v2</span>.d[<span>0</span>]
</code></pre>
<p>That’s quite a few variants for a single mnemonic. Not all mnemonics
have this many variants, but depending on how one counts I estimate
that there are in total around 1000-2000 variants. The instruction set
designers had to fit all these variants into 32 bits, while at the
same time making space for instructions that encode relatively large
immediate operands, and not forgetting about leaving space for future
extensions. As if that wasn’t difficult enough, the instructions
should also be easy to decode with&nbsp;hardware.</p>

<p>I’ve extracted the tables from my disassembler, rendered them with
the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/bit-field">bit-field package</a>, and
made them slightly interactive. If you’re reading this in a browser
you can see the encodings below. The thing to notice is that each
layer adds extra fixed bits: fields that must be a fixed 0 or 1 value.
(The last level, the instruction level, is not shown in this table).
Two encodings under the same parent always have some differences in
these fields, so that they can be separated by an instruction decoder.
Click an encoding to expand the next level of&nbsp;encodings.</p>




<p>There are many conventions in the field names. Instructions that take
register operands encode them in fields named <em>Rd</em>, <em>Rn</em> and <em>Rm</em>.
Immediate values (integers, <span>PC</span>-relative offsets, etc) are named <em>imm</em>.
Fields that change the type of operation tend to be called <em>op</em>N or
<em>opcode</em>. In general a few of the fields encode the operation (or the
size of the operation) and the rest encode the&nbsp;operands.</p>

<p>The image below shows the encoding space of the instruction set. The
<em>x</em> axis goes from 0 to 2<sup>16</sup>-1 and encodes the lower 16 bits
of the instruction space, and the <em>y</em> axis contains the upper 16 bits.
The different colors denote different decode groups, i.e. all the
encodings at the third level of the table above. (There is probably a
better&nbsp;representation).</p>
<p><img src="https://weinholt.se/articles/arm-a64-instruction-set/a64-2048-crushed.png" title="Encoding space used by ARM A64" alt="An image showing the 32-bit
  encoding space. Mostly there are horizontal thick lines of different
  colors. This shows that the higher 16 bits tend to keep similar
  instructions together, although there is some mirroring around the
  middle of the image."></p>
<p>All the dark spots are places where ARMv8 does not have any allocated
instructions, or the encoding is reserved. For many instructions there
are some fields that have reserved encodings and these are also&nbsp;dark.</p>
<p>Even if instructions are kept to the fixed 32 bit encoding there is
still plenty of room for the instruction set to&nbsp;grow.</p>

<p><span>ARM</span> A64 is a quite clean instruction set with only a few quirks here
and there in its encoding. Compared to AMD64 it has twice the amount
of registers, a clean separation of load/store instructions, clean
RISCy operands (mostly one destination register and two source
registers) and of course the register names and most mnemonics are
totally different. Both have 128-bit vector registers and 64-bit
integer registers and a 64-bit address space. They look quite similar,
except everything’s&nbsp;different.</p>

<p>The why of why people use vim has been <a href="https://dev.to/iggredible/why-i-use-vim-2f40">covered fairly extensively</a>, so I thought I would spend a little time explaining why I <em>teach</em> vim to my high school students, even in 2020.</p>



<p>It all began when I was assigned a mixed class of ninth through twelfth grade students in computer science just after the financial collapse on 2008. Well, the financial collapse first brought me to teach Intro to Programming using VB 6.0 and Windows thin clients, which was an experience unto itself (thanks in part to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conficker">Conficker virus</a>). That experience is worth a separate blog post and is a good part of why one of my specialties is teaching computer security.</p>



<p>So here I am with all levels of student, including AP CS A (read: AP CS Java), and obsolete Windows PCs (at least the thin clients were gone). I couldn’t install any software, wanted to teach C, had to teach Java, and had very few options (these were the days before online web based IDEs).</p>



<p>I had experience with the UNIX command line, primarily Sun Workstations, thanks to my wonderful education at <a href="https://www.soe.ucsc.edu/departments/computer-science-and-engineering">UCSC</a>, so that wasn’t an issue. I had played with Linux in the 1990s to a bit of success, but hadn’t touched it for almost a decade. So I found an old Pentium 2 carcass in the the garbage outside my condo complex, installed a hard drive, and tried this new (to me) flavor of Linux called, strangely, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a>.</p>



<p>I quickly realized this machine could have all the students coding at one, discovered the wonder that is <a href="https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html">putty.exe</a> (it doesn’t require any installation to run!) to connect the obsolete PCs to the server and soon my students were off and coding.</p>



<p>Why did I teach them vim? I wish I could say I agonized over all the options at the time and decided vim was the best pedagogical solution, but the reality of the situation was that vi was what I used in college because my father taught me vi. You see, I am lucky to have a father who worked in the industry and is even somewhat of a <a href="https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/qed.html">footnote in text editor history</a>. So I taught vi (later vim) because it is what I knew. A running theme in many computer science teacher’s trials by fire… teaching something because it is what they know. I will go as far as to argue that it is more important that the teacher knows the editor, and especially the programming language, rather than assigning any importance to one correct editor or one correct language that all teachers should teach.</p>



<p>Years later, though, I still teach vim and the command line. So here is how I justify my decision, even if only to myself.</p>



<p>It just works. Every time I go to a new school, it takes time to get the software installed necessary to run IDEs. I remember walking into one school in which the AP CS A class was flailing away with Eclipse on Mac OS X because the students needed, and didn’t have, administrator access. I have an amazing tech department at my current job, but even here it took us weeks to figure out how to deploy Visual Studio Code on the student’s MacBook Airs and then we had to figure out how to deploy Python3 and Java. So there’s no confusion, I teach vim along with many IDEs and I fully believe it is my responsibility to teach multiple platforms and multiple IDEs, but the CLI and vim are always my safety net.</p>



<p>My students can program in any number of of languages on a now cloud based CLI Linux machine (thank you <a href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> – both of whom offer a $5/month plan – just. happy customer!). By using the CLI, I can support literally any type of computer connecting (including iPads, although the lack of a virtual esc key drives me batty as a vim user, and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secure-shell-app/pnhechapfaindjhompbnflcldabbghjo?hl=en">ChromeBooks</a>). Students can connect from anywhere in the world and things just work. All of this became infinitely important in the remote and hybrid learning experience of the pandemic. And this is all possible because the students use vim.</p>



<p>I keep track of as many of my students that major in CS and a running theme is they all profusely thank me for teaching them vim and the CLI. Too many colleges start CS1 with an IDE and then throw the CS2 students into the deep end with the CLI. Not everyone is as lucky as I was in regards to having a father well versed in the CLI.</p>



<p>And yes, there are online IDEs these days, but I’ve found those to be full of their own pitfalls, privacy issues, and costs and find doing any advanced work using them to be very difficult if not impossible.</p>



<p>Also, to be clear, both nano and Emacs work quite well in the context of CLI Linux and I don’t make any claim that teachers should use vim over those equally acceptable command line text editors except for one small argument. Most people agree, computer security pretty much requires knowledge of the command line and a text editor. I always tell my students that the one editor they are likely to find already installed on a machine is vim and it is a bad day when you have to install another editor. Maybe just an issue for students interested in ethical penetration testing…</p>

<p>In 2007, just after his cancer diagnosis, Carnegie Mellon professor Randy Pausch gave <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTugjssqOT0">a well received lecture on Time Management</a>. These are my notes (<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/Randy/RandyPauschTimeManagement2007.pdf">slides here</a>, <a href="https://jamesclear.com/great-speeches/time-management-by-randy-pausch">transcript here</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Side note - he is better known for his Last Lecture on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ji5_MqicxSo">Achieving Your Childhood Dreams</a> - ironically given <em>before</em> this Time Management talk.</p>

  <h2 id="money-vs-time"><a href="#money-vs-time">Money vs Time</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>We are very good at dealing with money, but very bad at dealing with time. Having an idea of how much your time costs helps you start making tradeoffs better.</li>
    <li>We have to manage our time better than we manage our money. We have money budgets, what about time budgets?</li>
    <li>We are in a "Time Famine" - nobody says they have "too much time". Yet The typical office worker wastes almost 2 hrs a day at work, and 28 hours a week on TV. This isn't just a one-off problem - you can't solve it one week and then go back to normal - it's systemic and requries change in fundamental processes to address this once and for all.</li>
    <li>The goal is to have fun, be happier, lead a more meaningful life. If you're not going to have fun, why do it?</li>
    <li>Being successful doesn't make you manage your time well. Managing your time well does make you successful.</li>
    <li>Turn money into time - Hire someone to do chores. Esp if you have kids.</li>

    <li>
      <p>Always ask: Why am I doing this, What is the goal? Why will I succeed? What will happen if I don't do it?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>It's more important to do the right things, rather than do things right.</strong></p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Pareto Principle, 80/20 rule. Focus on the high value/impact things.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>People asked Walt how he built Disneyland in 366 days. His reply: "We used every one of them."</p>

    <li>
      <p><strong>Planning is impt</strong>. Failing to plan = planning to fail. Have a plan for day/week/quarter.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You can still be fluid - plans can change.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Todos</strong> - Break things down into small steps. "Get tenure" is not a todo. Eat your frog - do the ugliest thing first.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Prioritization</strong> (MOST IMPORTANT) Covey/Eisenhower Matrix</p>
      <ul>

        <li>urgent + unimportant</li>
        <li>not urgent + unimportant</li>
        <li>the trick is to not do unimportant things, and to tackle important things <strong>before</strong> they become urgent.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Keep your desk clear - have 1 thing on your desk</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Touch each piece of paper, email once. <strong>Inbox is not your todo list</strong>. File the email away and put it on your todo list.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>A filing system is absolutely essential. Have one place in the house where any piece of paper goes. (Ditto in the cloud/computer)</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Have at least two, maybe three monitors.</strong> Using just one "is like eating off the airplane tray."</p>

      <p>Productivity Stack:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Todolist</li>
        <li>Inbox</li>
        <li>Calendar. Dont use your brain to remember your appointments.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Standing during phone calls - will be much faster. Don't get comfortable. "I'd love to keep talking with you but I have students waiting."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Exercise on bike - can be spent on phone if you have a headset</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Write a Thank You note. Tangible way of telling someone you appreciated something. It makes you rare, they remember you well.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The dog - reminds you you have better things to do</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Chair - make your office comfortable for you, optionally comfortable for others (eg folding chair).</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>You do not find time to do something, you make time.</strong> And you make time by electing not to do something else.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Learn to say no.</strong> Opportunity cost is real. "Gentle no" = "I'll be your backup". "If you need an 8th person I'll be there."</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Find your creative time and defend it ruthlessly. It varies for people - could be 10pm-Midnight.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Find your dead time and do stuff where you don't need to be at your best.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Interruption</strong> takes 6-9mins, but recovery takes 4-5mins. Got to find ways to reduce frequency of interruptions. Turn phone calls into emails. Batch interactions with other people.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Giving hints to cut meetings short: Get up, walk to the door, thank them, shake their hand. Walk them out of the room.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><strong>Time journals</strong> - monitor and update thru the day. <a href="http://www.cs.unc.edu/Events/News/VirtuousReality/">Fred Brooks had actual time clocks</a>.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Look at open blocks where you know you are going to be wasting time, as gaps between blocks - make up a fake class.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Delegate.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>"How am I wasting other people's time?"</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>You become more efficient at work so you can leave on time and spend it with the people you love. Once you have kids the stakes are real.</p>

    <li>Sometimes you want to avoid Parkinson's Law - Work expands to fill the time available for it.</li>
    <li>But key realization - doing things at the last minute is very expensive. If you push things up to the deadline that's where all the stress comes from</li>
    <li>Make a fake deadline and pretend it is real.</li>

        <li>Specific date/time</li>
        <li>Specific penalty/reward</li>

    </li>
    <li>Challenge people: delegate until they complain</li>
    <li>Communication has to be CLEAR - and written</li>
    <li>Don't tell them HOW to do it - tell them what you need done, let them come up with solutions. This is how to work with people smarter than you.</li>
    <li>Offer relative importance - so people know what order to do them in</li>

      <p>He often uses humor - noting the optimistic side of his very grim situation, giving some relief to his audience while also reminding them of the importance of his message.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He is also extremely respectful - being humble to specific members of the audience ("Gabe is REALLY in good shape", "I am NOT smarter than Jim Calhoun", "Am I giving a talk with Alf Weaver in the audience?"), as well as the venue/general audience itself ("there aren't many better PhD programs in history than this one").</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>He brings in personal stories and examples, often involving his wife, and they are usually relatable and funny. His slides use photos from his own life living the things he talks about.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>The anecdotes also inject some variety - 40 minutes in he breaks for a tangent about his dog and a tiny debate he had with his wife.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Vocal variation - 53 minutes in he screams "PUT THE CIGARETTE OUT MOM" and that is a nice spike in decibels.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Ending is really good: He ends with actionable things to do, and a nice reminder of why this is important:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>"If I haven't changed anything, then we still had a pleasant hour together. If you have changed things, then you'll probably have a lot more time to spend with the ones you love. And that's important, time is all we have. And you may find one day, you have less than you think."</p>

November 14, 2020 | https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-i-read | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.spakhm.com/p/how-i-read">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I try to read a lot, though I'm not nearly as voracious a reader as people who have a reputation for it. I have no idea how Marc Andreessen or Patrick Collison read as much as they do, especially given the enormous demands on their time. The most plausible explanation is that they're aliens with ungodly information processing abilities. I'm human, so I shoot for 40 pages every day, and fail maybe a third of the time. That works out to about 10,000 pages or ~20 books every year. </p><p>Reading twenty books a year gets you a lot. Consider: one book gives you more knowledge about a subject than almost every other person on the planet, because people don't read. Two books on the same subject give you more knowledge than almost any reader, because people don't read two books about the same thing. How many people who read The Power Broker went on to read a second book about Robert Moses? I'd wager not many.</p><p>Beyond two books on a subject, there is a long utility dip. People who bothered to read more than two books about Robert Moses, are either obsessed with him or study him for a living, which means they've read much, much more about him. So two books on a subject, at least with respect to competitive edge, is an inflection point. After you read two, you get diminishing returns.</p><p>There is a way to get around this limitation. A single book is a pinhole view of the world set up by the author. You have no input into its contents, and therefore cannot change the orientation of this view. But you do choose the books you select. That means you can stitch together multiple pinhole views into a unique lens to examine the world— one that no one else will have unless they use the same list of books to stitch together the same lens. </p><p>For example, you can look at the world through history of technology that became ubiquitous. Here is one possible list of books to stitch together this lens: <a href="https://amzn.to/36fB6Vb">The Victorian Internet</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2GHE8Jh">Empires of Light</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ua2P49">The Wright Brothers</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/38pdoIY">The Network</a>, <a href="https://amzn.to/3n3SeEf">Hackers</a>. Very few people in the world read all five of these books. Even within Silicon Valley, where everyone's living depends on creating new ubiquitous technology, your understanding of how technology becomes ubiquitous will be in the 95th percentile (and likely higher) if you read these five. You will now be armed with a unique instrument that few others possess, and assuming twenty books per year, it only took you three months to acquire.</p><p>Another example is to look at American history and the dynamics of failure by studying biographies of U.S. presidents who sought reelection and lost. There were ten: John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren, Benjamin Harrison, William H. Taft, Herbert Hoover, Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and now Donald J. Trump. It may be difficult to stomach ten presidential biographies in a row, but it's doable to read five. That's enough to pick up a new lens. Another three months; another sophisticated instrument to examine the world at your disposal.</p><p>I settled on clusters of five and almost never read a single book in isolation. Less than five feel lacking; more than five gets repetitive. Every cluster has a goal of the form "study <code>X</code> through <code>Y</code>". Study American history through technological expansion, or study failure through one term presidents are just a few examples. I try to be creative and make <code>Y</code> unusual. For instance, everyone likes to read about presidents who are believed to be successful. A simple trick is to inverse it and read about unsuccessful ones instead. Or skip the presidents altogether, and read about vice presidents. It doesn't matter what <code>Y</code> is because you're trying to study <code>X</code>, and it's more fun to make <code>Y</code> unusual.</p><p>I don't bother diversifying books within a cluster by time period, cultural or linguistic background of the author, or anything like that. I simply try and find the best books on the subject. Sometimes they turn out to be diverse along some axes; other times they're homogenous. I never read forewords or prefaces and always finish every book in a cluster. I prefer paper to digital, and used books to new ones. I never take notes or, god forbid, create flashcards. My goal is to suck the juice out of a book, not to hold on to pieces of the carcass. If I ever need to remember a specific detail, it's always waiting for me on the shelf.</p><p>This system gives me four new instruments per year, each capable of inspecting the world in a different way. Rather than pick the instruments at random I try to be strategic and collect them into a mental lab. I visualize the lab as a room with multiple stations. Each station has a collection of related instruments on it. When I'm faced with a problem I can go to the right station and examine the problem through the instruments available on that station. All this is physically materialized on my bookshelf. Some day when I become less mobile, I plan to dedicate a literal room to it.</p><p>I don't maintain lists of books I want to read, and don't plan a sequence of instruments to acquire in advance. Once I'm done reading a cluster of books, I ask myself: <em>what instrument can I add to double the utility of my lab</em>? Another way to phrase this question is "what is the most important subject that I know the least about?" It's easy to think of many possible answers to this question; I then pick the answer that seems the most interesting, construct a new cluster of five books, and recurse.</p><p>Four instruments per year may not seem like much, but consider: in five years you will have about twenty mental instruments, all of which interrelate and reinforce each other. In ten years you will have an impressive lab of forty instruments. And it will be unique— no other mental lab on the planet will be able to inspect the world in the way that yours can.</p><p>Because the instruments are constructed from books, they are endlessly upgradeable. Sometimes you might choose to upgrade an existing instrument to increase its power and get higher resolution, rather than acquire a new one. You can do that one book at a time. To use the examples above, you can read another book about ubiquitous technology, or another book about a one term president.</p><p>If you organize your reading this way, your bookshelf won't be arranged by genre like a typical bookstore. Rather than having sections for e.g. biographies, essays, novels, military history, all sorted by author, you will instead have sections for addressing different problems, likely sorted by clusters of books in order that you encountered them. The arrangement won't make sense to anyone except you. But you'll be able to find what you need instantaneously, and your capacity to examine the world from different perspectives will dramatically increase.</p><p>Waiting five, ten, fifteen years to build a mental lab may seem like an impossibly long time. But you don’t have to wait. It’s a pleasure to read about the Wright brothers, or proliferation of the telegraph, or early computer culture! And in a measly three months you’ll have acquired a fresh way of looking at the world. Already you will be a different person. Then you keep going, and keep looking for new instruments to double the utility of existing ones. And in one year? You will look back at today’s version of yourself and find it unrecognizable.</p><p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Read ~40 pages/day, assume 30% failure rate. That's 10k pages and ~20 books annually. Pick a problem, and read clusters of five books to study that problem from a unique perspective. Visualize each cluster as an instrument to inspect the world. Collect instruments into a mental lab, with various stations for related instruments. You can upgrade the instruments one book at a time. Have your bookshelf reflect this mental image. Win the decade, not the day. Start now and never stop.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Governments are back on their anti-encryption bullshit again.</p>



<p>Between the <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2020/03/06/earn-it-is-an-attack-on-encryption/">U.S. Senate’s “EARN IT” Act</a>, the <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/10/orders-top-eus-timetable-dismantling-end-end-encryption">E.U.’s slew of anti-encryption proposals</a>, and <a href="https://fee.org/articles/australia-s-unprecedented-encryption-law-is-a-threat-to-global-privacy/">Australia’s new anti-encryption law</a>, it’s become clear that the authoritarians in office view online privacy as a threat to their existence.</p>



<p>Normally, when the governments increase their anti-privacy sabre-rattling, technologists start talking more loudly about Tor, Signal, and other privacy technologies (usually only to be drowned out by paranoid people who think Tor and Signal are government backdoors or something stupid; conspiracy theories ruin everything!).</p>



<p><strong>I’m not going to do that.</strong></p>



<p>Instead, I’m going to show you how to add end-to-end encryption to any communication software you’re developing. (Hopefully, I’ll avoid making <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/10/28/bizarre-design-choices-in-zooms-end-to-end-encryption/">any bizarre design decisions</a> along the way.)</p>



<p>But first, some important disclaimers:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Yes, you should absolutely do this.</strong> I don’t care how banal your thing is; if you expect people to use it to communicate with each other, you should make it so that you can never decrypt their communications.</li><li>You should absolutely NOT bill the thing you’re developing as an <em>alternative</em> to Signal or WhatsApp.</li><li>The goal of doing this is to increase the amount of end-to-end encryption deployed on the Internet that the service operator cannot decrypt (even if compelled by court order) and make E2EE normalized. The goal is NOT to compete with highly specialized and peer-reviewed privacy technology.</li><li>I am not a lawyer, I’m some furry who works in cryptography. The contents of this blog post is not legal advice, nor is it endorsed by any company or organization. Ask the <a href="https://eff.org/">EFF</a> for legal questions.</li></ol>



<p>The organization of this blog post is as follows: First, I’ll explain <a href="#symmetric-key-encryption">how to encrypt and decrypt data between users</a>, assuming you have a key. Next, I’ll explain <a href="#key-agreement">how to build an authenticated key exchange</a> and <a href="#session-key-management">a ratcheting protocol to determine the keys used in the first step</a>. Afterwards, I’ll explore <a href="#identity-key-management">techniques for binding authentication keys to identities and managing trust</a>. Finally, I’ll discuss <a href="#backdoor-resistance">strategies for making it impractical to ever backdoor your software (and impossible to silently backdoor it)</a>, just to piss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_Eyes">the creeps and tyrants of the world</a> off even more.</p>



<p>You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing.</p>







<h2 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h2>



<h3 id="choosing-a-cryptography-library">Choosing a Cryptography Library</h3>



<p>In the examples contained on this page, I will be using the <a href="https://libsodium.gitbook.io/doc/">Sodium cryptography library</a>. Specifically, my example code will be written with the <a href="https://github.com/paragonie/sodium-plus">Sodium-Plus</a> library for JavaScript, since it strikes a good balance between performance and being cross-platform.</p>


<pre title="">const { SodiumPlus } = require('sodium-plus');

(async function() {
     // Select a backend automatically
     const sodium = await SodiumPlus.auto();
     
     // Do other stuff here
})();
</pre>


<p>Libsodium is <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2018/04/03/cryptographic-right-answers.html">generally the correct choice for developing cryptography features in software</a>, and is available in most programming languages,</p>



<p>If you’re prone to choose a different library, you should consult your cryptographer (and yes, you should have one on your payroll if you’re doing things different) about your design choices.</p>



<h3>Threat Modelling</h3>



<p>Remember above when I said, “You don’t have to implement the full stack of solutions to protect users, but the further you can afford to go, the safer your users will be from privacy-invasive policing”?</p>



<p>How far you go in implementing the steps outlined on this blog post should be informed by <a href="https://adamcaudill.com/2016/07/20/threat-modeling-for-applications/">a threat model</a>, not an ad hoc judgment.</p>



<p>For example, if you’re encrypting user data and storing it in the cloud, you probably want to pass <a href="https://blog.cryptographyengineering.com/2012/04/05/icloud-who-holds-key/">the Mud Puddle Test</a>:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>1. First, drop your device(s) in a mud puddle.<br>2. Next, slip in said puddle and crack yourself on the head. When you regain consciousness you’ll be perfectly fine, but<em>&nbsp;won’t for the life of you&nbsp;</em>be able to&nbsp;recall your device passwords or keys.<br>3. Now try to get your cloud data back.</p><p>Did you succeed? If so, you’re screwed. Or to be a bit less dramatic, I should say: your cloud provider has access to your ‘encrypted’ data, as does the government if they want it, as does any rogue employee who knows their way around your provider’s internal policy checks.</p></div><cite>Matthew Green describes the Mud Puddle Test, which Apple products <a href="https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/">definitely don’t pass</a>.</cite></blockquote>



<p>If you must fail the Mud Puddle Test for your users, make sure you’re clear and transparent about this in the documentation for your product or service.</p>







<h2 id="symmetric-key-encryption">I. Symmetric-Key Encryption</h2>



<p>The easiest piece of this puzzle is to encrypt data in transit between both ends (thus, satisfying the loosest definition of end-to-end encryption).</p>



<p>At this layer, you already have some kind of symmetric key to use for encrypting data before you send it, and for decrypting it as you receive it.</p>



<p>For example, the following code will encrypt/decrypt strings and return hexadecimal strings with a version prefix.</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v1";

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        key,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Under-the-hood, this is using <a href="https://soatok.blog/2020/07/12/comparison-of-symmetric-encryption-methods/#aes-gcm-vs-xchacha20poly1305">XChaCha20-Poly1305</a>, which is less sensitive to timing leaks than AES-GCM. However, like AES-GCM, this encryption mode doesn’t provide <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/016">message- or key-commitment</a>.</p>



<p>If you want key commitment, you should derive two keys from <code>$key</code> using a KDF based on hash functions: One for actual encryption, and the other <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1153">as a key commitment value</a>.</p>



<p>If you want message commitment, you can use AES-CTR + HMAC-SHA256 or XChaCha20 + BLAKE2b-MAC.</p>



<p>If you want both, ask <a href="https://mumble.net/~campbell/">Taylor Campbell</a> about his BLAKE3-based design.</p>



<p>A modified version of the above code with key-commitment might look like this:</p>


<pre title="">const VERSION = "v2";

/**
 * Derive an encryption key and a commitment hash.
 * @param {CryptographyKey} key
 * @param {Uint8Array} nonce
 * @returns {{encKey: CryptographyKey, commitment: Uint8Array}}
 */
async function deriveKeys(key, nonce) {
    const encKey = new CryptographyKey(await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x01].append(nonce)),
        key
    ));
    const commitment = await sodium.crypto_generichash(
        new Uint8Array([0x02].append(nonce)),
        key
    );
    return {encKey, commitment};
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function encryptData(message, key, assocData = null) {
    const nonce = await sodium.randombytes_buf(24);
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': VERSION,
      'nonce': await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);

    const encrypted = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_encrypt(
        message,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return (
       VERSION +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(nonce) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(commitment) +
       await sodium.sodium_bin2hex(encrypted)
    );
}

/**
 * @param {string|Uint8Array} message
 * @param {Uint8Array} key
 * @param {string|null} assocData
 * @returns {string}
 */
async function decryptData(encrypted, key, assocData = null) {
    const ver = encrypted.slice(0, 2);
    if (!await sodium.sodium_memcmp(ver, VERSION)) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect version: " + ver);
    }
    const nonce = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(2, 50));
    const ciphertext = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(114));
    const aad = JSON.stringify({
      'version': ver,
      'nonce': encrypted.slice(2, 50),
      'extra': assocData
    });
    const storedCommitment = await sodium.sodium_hex2bin(encrypted.slice(50, 114));
    const {encKey, commitment} = await deriveKeys(key, nonce);
    if (!(await sodium.sodium_memcmp(storedCommitment, commitment))) {
        throw new Error("Incorrect commitment value");
    }
    
    const plaintext = await sodium.crypto_aead_xchacha20poly1305_ietf_decrypt(
        ciphertext,
        nonce,
        encKey,
        aad
    );
    return plaintext.toString('utf-8');
}
</pre>


<p>Another design choice you might make is to encode ciphertext with base64 instead of hexadecimal. That doesn’t significantly alter the design here, but it does mean your decoding logic has to accommodate this.</p>



<p>You SHOULD version your ciphertexts, and include this in the AAD provided to your AEAD encryption mode. I used “v1” and “v2” as a version string above, but you can use your software name for that too.</p>

<p>Antibiotic resistance could <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/12/oneill-rpt-amr/">cost the world $100 trillion by 2050</a>, and approximately kills 700,000 per year. Some in the scientific community say it could be as bad as cancer. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has emerged as one of the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4768623/">principal public health problems</a> of the 21st century. The World Health Organisation published <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/detail/27-02-2017-who-publishes-list-of-bacteria-for-which-new-antibiotics-are-urgently-needed">a list of bacteria of which new antibiotics are urgently needed</a>, and superbug “Staph” was Priority high. It’s a <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn25498-antibiotic-resistant-superbugs-now-a-global-epidemic/">global epidemic</a>.</p>



<p>We should be rational optimists, as Matt Ridley explains with evidence in his book. Through science and technology the world gets better via our collective brain.</p>



<p><a href="https://botanixpharma.com/">Botanix Pharmaceuticals</a> (Botanix) has made a scientific breakthrough. In September 2020, Botanix proved its product&nbsp; BTX 1801 kills superbug Staph (aka MRSA or golden Staph) without allowing resistance to develop. <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20200908/pdf/44mf662gw8dbkd.pdf">It was done in human skin</a>. This product is designed for Surgical Site Infections (SSI) which costs hospitals US$10 billion per year. The Phase 2a study is due in Q4 2020. They did this a year after they <a href="https://www.asx.com.au/asxpdf/20190801/pdf/4473szphv8b084.pdf">raised US$40 million at a valuation of US$198 million</a>.</p>



<p>There was already evidence Cannabidiol (CBD) was antibacterial, which is used in the product. This new data supports bigger studies for a potential new antibiotic. There is a big need for new antibiotics due to antibiotic resistance. The problem is that it is very hard to make these scientific breakthroughs. Botanix has made a breakthrough for the world, and the data will be used by other scientists to save lives. Botanix also has a cash runway to take its clinical pipeline to December 2021 (excluding FDA approved Phase 3 Acne).</p>



<p>There are <a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/hospital-infection-control/surgical-site-infections/">approximately 27 million</a> surgical procedures in the U.S per year. Approximately 5% get infected, which leads to 1.35 million SSI’s per year in the U.S. Occurrence of SSI is estimated to increase hospital stay by 7 to 10 days and add over <a href="https://www.infectiousdiseaseadvisor.com/home/decision-support-in-medicine/hospital-infection-control/surgical-site-infections/">$3,000 in costs of care</a>. Globally, <a href="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5435b2b9e4b0e1fd29fa9d26/t/5aa2b3374192023932fb6690/1520612157567/Surgical%26AnaesthesiaDataReport.pdf">there are approximately 313 million</a> surgical procedures per year. If 5% of surgical procedures lead to infections, that’s 15.6 million SSI’s globally.</p>



<p>In the U.S there are 1.35 million SSI’s per year, multiply that by $3,000 costs, and it equals $4 billion. SSI’s cost U.S hospitals $4 billion per year. If BTX 1801 is priced at $100, that equals $135 million yearly revenue in the U.S – a huge drop in hospital costs. Presume the product will last 10 years, and that equals $1.3 billion in revenue. Globally, potential annual revenue could be $1.5 billion (SSI’s multiplied by the $100 price).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Keep in mind that this is 1 of 3 products in the Botanix clinical pipeline. Pending studies are FDA approved <a href="http://marksita.com/botanix-pharmaceuticals">Phase 3 Acne</a> and Phase 2 Rosacea.</p>



<p>A recent study found it costs on average <a href="https://amr.solutions/2020/03/06/what-does-an-antibiotic-cost-to-develop-what-is-it-worth-how-to-afford-it/">$1.3 billion to get a new drug approved</a>. By using synthetic Cannabidiol, Botanix is able to make significantly better drugs. Botanix has a competitive advantage, and the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/patients/fast-track-breakthrough-therapy-accelerated-approval-priority-review/fast-track">FDA Fast Track Status</a> application (due to the <a href="https://smallcaps.com.au/botanix-pharmaceuticals-receives-fda-grant-antibacterial-product-btx-1801/">FDA Qualified Infectious Disease Product</a> status) will make it stronger.</p>



<p>Antibiotics is the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/rearvision/antibiotics-dilemma-running-out-of-drugs-to-treat-superbugs/7281438">$40 billion drug market</a> that no company wants a part of. <strong>Until now.</strong></p>
