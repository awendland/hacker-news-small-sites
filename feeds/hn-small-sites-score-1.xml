    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This is an attempt to understand Raph Levien’s <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/audio/2019/02/14/parallel-iir.html">IIR filters can be evaluated in parallel</a> by a person with no particular knowledge of DSP, filtering or relevant mathematics, just an interest in evaluating an IIR filter in parallel and a good deal of programming experience! The goal is to produce an implementation of this article demonstrating in code the approach Raph describes. The code won’t be optimal by any means, but should serve as a sufficient base for building something much better.</p>

<p>Right from the get go we get an inkling this might not be as straight-forward as we might hope:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Author’s note: I got slightly stuck writing this, so am publishing a somewhat unfinished draft</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Throughout the article focuses on a simple RC-lowpass filter, given by the equation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><code>y[i] = x[i] * c + y[i - 1] * (1 - c)</code></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Raph also points out that this formulation of an IIR filter, while easy to understand has been superseded by the state space approach:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rather than writing it it in direct form, which emphasizes the serial evaluation strategy, it’s better to use matrices. Basically, y becomes a state vector, and a becomes a matrix. This is known as the state space approach to filters and has many advantages. I’d go so far to say that direct form is essentially obsolete now, optimizing for the number of multiplies at the expense of parallelism, numerical stability, and good modulation properties.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The state space approach will become important later. It is worth taking a little detour to clear it up.</p>

<hr>
<h2 id="state-space-detour">State Space Detour</h2>

<p>All IIR filters are difference equations, which for our purposes are recursive equations that rely on one or more outputs from previous steps. Simply speaking, the deeper the recursion (more previous outputs), the more “powerful” it can be. This recursive level is the <code>order</code> of the filter. For example, to create a low-pass filter with a steeper cut-off, like a brick-wall filter, it will need more than just the single level of recursion of the RC-lowpass filter – it will have a higher order.</p>

<p>A possible building block of such high-order IIRs is the biquad. A biquad is a second order (order = 2) filter. Biquads can be chained together to create even higher-order filters, a representation called second order sections.</p>

<p>This gets us to the <code>direct form</code> referenced in the quote above. Direct Form is a way to represent a biquad. One of the Direct Forms uses the following equation:</p>

<p><code>y[n] = b0 * x[n] + b1 * x[n - 1] + b2 * x[n - 2] - a1 * y[n - 1] - a2 * y[n - 2]</code></p>

<p>This is a second order filter because it relies on two historical values (<code>y[n - 1]</code> and <code>y[n - 2]</code>.) Thinking of the RC-lowpass filter in this way tells us that <code>b0</code> is <code>c</code> and <code>a1</code> is <code>c - 1</code> and the other constants are zero (our filter is first-order.)</p>

<h3 id="conversion-to-state-space">Conversion to State Space</h3>

<p>All IIR filters can be representated by a transfer function, written as <code>H(z)</code>. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_biquad_filter">Wiki’s</a> introduction to biquads shows the transfer function. Mapping it to the direct form is trivial, so it is omitted here.</p>

<p>We want to convert the biquad form to a state space form. More generally it would be useful to be able to convert any IIR filter that can be written in terms of <code>H(z)</code> to state space form. This can be done by hand, but fortunately it can be done easily via GNU Octave’s or Matlab’s <a href="https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ref/tf2ss.html">tf2ss</a> function:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>c = 0.44
num = [c]
den = [1 c-1]
[A, B, C, D] = tf2ss(num, den)
A: 0.56
B: 1
C: 0.44
D: 0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally we can write the filter in state-space form. State-space form is generally written as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x[n+1] = Ax[n] + Bu[n]
y[n] = Cx[n] + Du[n]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So far our equations have had <code>y</code> as the output (i.e the filtered signal) and <code>x</code> as the input (i.e. the signal to be filtered.) State-space changes this, the signal to be filtered is <code>u</code> and <code>x</code> is the <em>state vector</em>. Generally, <code>A</code> and <code>C</code> are matrices and <code>B</code> and <code>D</code> are vectors. Since our filter is first-order, each of these values are simply numbers. <code>D</code> is zero so it can be removed entirely and <code>B</code> is one so it can be simplified to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x[n+1] = Ax[n] + u[n]
y[n] = Cx[n]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>substituting the constant <code>C</code> from the RC-lowpass filter equation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>x[n+1] = (1 - C)x[n] + u[n]
y[n] = Cx[n]`
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="monoid-homomorphism-time">Monoid Homomorphism Time</h2>

<p>This is where the meat of the approach lies. Quoting from the article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basic insight is that the target monoid is a function from input state to output state, and represents any integral number of samples. The monoid binary operator is function composition, which is by nature associative and has an identity (the identity function).
In general, the amount of state required to represent such a function, as opposed to a single state value, is intractable, but in [this case] it works […] because the function is linear.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is going to require some unpacking.</p>

<hr>
<h3 id="what-is-a-monoid">What is a monoid?</h3>

<p>A monoid is a triplet of:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a set being operated on</li>
  <li>an associative binary operator</li>
  <li>an identity element</li>
</ul>

<p>The set might be the set of real numbers, for example. A binary operator is a function that takes two parameters that are elements of the set. Associativity is the property <code>(a op b) op c = a op (b op c)</code>, i.e. you can place the brackets arbitrarily. An identity element is an element <code>e</code> such that <code>e op x = x op e = x</code>. It is a no-op element.</p>

<p>For example, you might have a monoid representing addition: <code>(f64, +, 0)</code> meaning the set being operated on are the 64-bit floats, the binary operation is addition and the identity is <code>0</code> because <code>0+x = x+0 = x</code>. Similarly you could have a monoid representing multiplication: <code>(i32, *, 1)</code>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Back to the article. Before tackling the homomorphism and what it means, we’ll try to understand what Raph gives us as the path forward:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The target monoid is a function of this form:
<code>y_out = a * y_in + b</code>
This can obviously be represented as two floats, we can write the representation as simply <code>(a, b)</code>. The homomorphism then binds a single sample of input into a function. Given the filter above, an input of <code>x</code> maps to <code>(c, x * (1 - c))</code>.
Similarly, we can write out the effect of function composition in the two-floats representation space. Given <code>(a1, b1)</code> and <code>(a2, b2)</code>, their composition is <code>(a1 * a2, a2 * b1 + b2)</code>. Not especially complicated or difficult to compute.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We have to understand:</p>

<ol>
  <li>What is a monoid homomorphism?</li>
  <li>How does the input mapping result in <code>(c, x * (1 - c)</code>?</li>
  <li>Why is <code>y_out = a * y_in + b</code> our target monoid?</li>
  <li>Why is our target monoid represented as <code>(a , b)</code>?</li>
  <li>How is the binary operation (function composition) applied?</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll do it backwards, from easiest to hardest to understand.</p>

<h3 id="how-is-the-binary-operation-function-composition-applied">How is the binary operation (function composition) applied?</h3>

<p>Raph makes the following statement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Given <code>(a1, b1)</code> and <code>(a2, b2)</code>, their composition is <code>(a1 * a2, a2 * b1 + b2)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is function composition? Say we have two functions, <code>f1</code> and <code>f2</code>, composition is simply <code>f2(f1(x))</code>. In our case the two functions are:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>f1: y[n] = a1 * y[n-1] + b1
f2: y[n] = a2 * y[n-1] + b2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The function composition, <code>f2(f1(x))</code> is thus:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>y[n] = a2 * (a1 * y[n-1] + b1) + b2
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>which multiplies out to:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>y[n] = a2 * a1 * y[n-1] + a2 * b1 + b2
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This is clearly still of the form <code>y[n] = a * y[n-1] + b</code>, with <code>(a, b)</code> now being <code>(a2 * a1, a2 * b1 + b2)</code>.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-our-target-monoid-represented-as-a--b">Why is our target monoid represented as <code>(a , b)</code>?</h3>

<p>This is now easier to understand. To represent the history of all prior invocations of the monoid, all we need are the <code>(a, b)</code> pair of the most recent function.</p>

<p>In other words, the history <code>fn(fn-1(fn-2(fn-3(...f0(0)...))))</code> can be represented as simply <code>fn(0)</code> provided we know the <code>(a, b)</code> pair.</p>

<p>Why do we know the initial input is zero? This chain of functions starts with <code>y[0] = ...</code>. But <code>y[0]</code> cannot be defined by a prior <code>y[-1]</code>; by definition there is nothing before the first element. Therefore the initial value for <code>y[n-1]</code> must be zero.</p>

<h3 id="why-is-y_out--a--y_in--b-our-target-monoid">Why is <code>y_out = a * y_in + b</code> our target monoid?</h3>

<p>The state space representation for our filter was written as two equations:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>x[n+1] = (1-C)x[n] + u[n]
y[n] = Cx[n]
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Our goal is to evaluate the filter in parallel, so we want to get rid of recursion. The equation for the <em>state vector</em>, <code>x[n]</code> is recursive, so that’s our target. We already know we can evaluate this equation without requiring the prior values provided we can compute values for <code>(a, b)</code>.</p>

<p>Also, from the introduction to this section, we’re told:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The basic insight is that the target monoid is a function from input state to output state</p>
</blockquote>

<p><code>x[n]</code> is the <em>state vector</em> so our target monoid is evaluating the state of the filter at any <code>n</code> and producing the corresponding output state.</p>

<h3 id="how-does-the-input-mapping-result-in-c-x--1---c">How does the input mapping result in <code>(c, x * (1 - c)</code>?</h3>

<p>All the pieces are in place, now we just need to compute those <code>(a, b)</code> values. We’ve got our target monoid:</p>

<p><code>x[n+1] = (1 - C) * x[n] + u[n]</code></p>

<p>let’s write it as:</p>

<p><code>y_out = (1 - C) * y_in + b</code></p>

<p>Remember <code>u[n]</code> is the signal, so when we feed in a single sample <code>x</code>, it takes the place of <code>u[n]</code> which is <code>b</code> in our target form:</p>

<p><code>y_out = (1 - C) * y_in + x</code>.</p>

<p>Pretty clearly, <code>(a, b)</code> is <code>(1 - C, x)</code>. That’s not what we expected. There are two reasons for this.</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, there’s a mistake in the article. The mapping should result in <code>(1 - C, x * C)</code>. That’s still not the result we have.</li>
  <li>Second, we are computing the state, not the final output. Once we have the state we still need to apply <code>y[n] = Cx[n]</code> to compute the final filtered result. Since that’s not a recursive function it is trivial to compute in parallel. It turns out that <code>(1 - C, x * C)</code> will both compute the state and apply the <code>y[n]</code> equation. I’m not sure how to derive this result, I stumbled upon it by accident. Furthermore, in the general case I’m not sure <code>y[n]</code> can be computed in one step along with the state vector (consider the case where <code>D</code> is non-zero.)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-is-a-monoid-homomorphism">What is a Monoid Homomorphism?</h3>

<p>A per usual, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monoid#Monoid_homomorphisms">Wiki</a> is a good source for this.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, if you have two monoids with binary operators <code>M1</code> and <code>M2</code> and a function <code>f</code> that translates inputs for <code>M1</code> into <code>M2</code>, then you have a homomorphism if:</p>

<p><code>f(M1(x, y)) = M2(f(x), f(y))</code> and given identity elements for the monoids <code>I1</code> and <code>I2</code> <code>f(I1) = I2</code>.</p>

<p>I’m not sure what the homomorphism is in this case since it requires two …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p><em>Note that this article, though written by a doctor, does not replace seeking the assistance of a medical professional if you have concerns about your health.</em></p><p>As a doctor who likes tech, I’ve always been excited when the Apple Watch comes out with new health functions like the ECG function and now the blood oxygen app. But I feel as if there needs to be some understanding of how to interpret them, because it may mislead people into thinking they’re not at risk for coronavirus, when in reality the only way you are really able to tell is to get tested with a swab.</p><p>We use pulse oximetry all the time for patients. The <em>peripheral oxygen saturation</em> - also known as the <em>SpO2</em> - is a critical vital sign that, well, tells us how well oxygenated is in your blood. The new Apple Watch Series 6 now comes with one. It works by basically using the lights on the watch to reflect how “red” the blood is in your body. The more red that reflects back to the watch, the more oxygen your blood has.</p><p>But it’s important how to understand how to interpret the readings that you find. Note that Apple provides an explicit statement that “Blood Oxygen app measurements are not intended for medical use, including self-diagnosis or consultation with a doctor, and are only designed for general fitness and wellness purposes. If you have questions about your health, contact a medical professional.”</p><figure><img src="https://dabido.com.au/content/images/2020/09/watchos7-series6-blood-oxygen-measurement.gif" alt=""></figure><p>A normal fit human being will generally have an SpO2 above 95%. So even if it’s 96% or 97%, it indicates that there’s nothing wrong from an oxygenation perspective - though if you have symptoms like chest pain, you may still actually have something very wrong going on. <strong>It is an isolated result and needs to be expertly interpreted with a doctor’s advice.</strong></p><p>If the oxygen saturation starts to dip to 94% or below, it might suggest impaired oxygenation. There’s a <em>very wide</em> variety of conditions that cause your oxygen saturation to go down. Most commonly, conditions that affect the lung - like asthma, COPD, or pulmonary embolism - would be the main culprits. Some people who have chronic lung conditions (particularly COPD) tolerate lower levels of SpO2 after having had their body adjust to it over long periods of time: so a 70 year old man with COPD who has an oxygen saturation of 93%, may at another moment have an oxygen saturation of 95%, and you wouldn’t necessarily worry too much about that 93% unless he had other symptoms. Fundamentally however, if any actual symptoms occur - like shortness of breath, chest pain, or dizziness - you should see a doctor immediately.</p><p>The question that’s probably on everyone’s mind is: <strong>how does the Apple Watch blood oxygen level relate to whether you have coronavirus or not? </strong> To understand that, you have to understand how to grade severity of Covid-19.</p><p>COVID-19 can be mild, moderate, or severe. Mild cases can generally stay at home under self isolation, whereas moderate or severe cases may need hospital.</p><h2 id="mild-coronavirus-normal-blood-oxygen-levels-95-but-not-worse-but-a-normal-oxygen-level-does-not-rule-out-coronavirus-">Mild coronavirus = normal blood oxygen levels (&gt;95%), but not worse. But a normal oxygen level does not rule out coronavirus.</h2><p>Most people who contract Covid-19 will either be asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic. They may have symptoms that are extremely difficult to tell from a standard common cold - sore throat, runny nose, a bit of a cough, fevers - but importantly, <strong>those with <em>mild</em> CoVid-19 (and no other medical conditions) will not have low blood oxygen levels.</strong></p><p>So just because you <em>don’t</em> have a low blood oxygen level SpO2 &lt;95%, does <em>not</em> mean that you don’t have Covid-19. In other words: you can have a normal blood oxygen and <em>still</em> have CoVid. A normal oxygen level does not rule out coronavirus. It just means that if you do have coronavirus, it is more likely to be considered a mild version.</p><p>Generally speaking, most people who have only mild COVID-19 should be managed at home under self-isolation, and no further investigations - apart from the swab that’s required for initial diagnosis - is necessary, unless other medical conditions are being considered. Your doctor <em>may</em> recommend that, if you have asthma or COPD, that you use an additional amount of puffer medication compared to usual. 4 out of 5 people with COVID-19 will have a</p><p>mild illness and will usually recover 2 to 3 weeks after the initial onset of</p><p>symptoms (<a href="https://covid19evidence.net.au/wp-content/uploads/FLOWCHART-2-MANAGEMENT-OF-MILD.pdf">source</a>). If respiratory symptoms do worsen, this is most likely to occur in the 2nd or 3rd week of illness. For some patients, symptoms may persist for longer than 4 weeks, or new symptoms may develop. The range of potential long term symptoms of COVID-19 is as yet unknown.</p><h2 id="moderate-or-severe-coronavirus">Moderate or severe coronavirus</h2><p>Shortness of breath, however, is a sign you should be worried about. <strong>Shortness of breath does not appear in mild coronavirus infections, but if you have shortness of breath, it indicates — if you <em>have</em> coronavirus — then that coronavirus is either moderate or severe.</strong> In this circumstance, seek medical advice.</p><p>Following the current evidence based guidelines we have in Australia (by the <a href="https://covid19evidence.net.au/">National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce</a>), <em>moderate</em> illness is classified as thus:</p><blockquote>Stable adult patient presenting with respiratory and/or systemic symptoms or signs. Able to maintain oxygen saturation above 92% (or above 90% for patients with chronic lung disease) with up to 4 L/min oxygen via nasal prongs. <strong>Characteristics</strong>: prostration, severe asthenia, fever &gt; 38 ̊C or persistent cough, clinical or radiological signs of lung involvement, no clinical or laboratory indicators of clinical severity or respiratory impairment.</blockquote><p>And <em>severe</em> coronavirus illness is defined as such:</p><blockquote>Adult patients meeting any of the following criteria: respiratory rate ≥ 30 breaths/min, oxygen saturation ≤ 92% at a rest state, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/ inspired oxygen fraction (FiO2) ≤ 300</blockquote><p>That’s a lot of jargon there. But the takeaway points for adults are:</p><ul><li>If you have viral symptoms but your oxygen saturation is above 95%, it <strong>does not mean that you don’t have coronavirus</strong>, it just means that you either have something that’s not coronavirus or you have a mild form of coronavirus.</li><li><strong>If your blood oxygen levels are below 92% on your Apple Watch and you do not have a pre-existing lung condition or you have significant symptoms, seek medical advice immediately. </strong></li><li><strong>If you have a previous lung condition and your blood oxygen levels are below 90% on your Apple Watch, seek medical advice immediately.</strong></li></ul><p>If any of the following symptoms occur, you <strong>need to seek medical attention immediately as you may need to go to hospital:</strong></p><p>• severe shortness of breath or difficulty breathing</p><p>• blue lips or face</p><p>• pain or pressure in the chest</p><p>• cold, clammy or pale and mottled skin</p><p>• new confusion or fainting</p><p>• becoming difficult to rouse</p><p>• little or no urine output</p><p>• coughing up blood</p><h2 id="how-do-i-interpret-my-apple-watch-blood-oxygenation-levels-for-children">How do I interpret my Apple Watch blood oxygenation levels for children?</h2><p>For kids, the criteria is somewhat similar at the time of writing (17/9/2020). In mild illness, the child should <strong>not</strong> have a SpO2 of less than 92%. <strong>If the blood oxygen level is less than 92% in a child, or they look like they’re having trouble breathing, seek medical attention.</strong> If you have any concerns at all, a low threshold for seeking the advice of a doctor is warranted.</p><h2 id="how-reliable-is-the-apple-watch-in-detecting-oxygen-levels">How reliable is the Apple Watch in detecting oxygen levels?</h2><p>It can’t always detect oxygen levels. To directly copy and paste from Apple’s website itself:</p><blockquote>Even under ideal conditions, your Apple Watch may not be able to get a reliable blood oxygen measurement every time. For a small percentage of users, various factors may make it impossible to get any blood oxygen measurement.</blockquote><ul><li>Skin perfusion (or how much blood flows through your skin) can impact measurements. Skin perfusion varies significantly from person to person and can also be impacted by the environment. If you are out in the cold, for example, the skin perfusion in your wrist might be too low for the sensor to work with the Blood Oxygen app to get a measurement.</li><li>Permanent or temporary changes to your skin, such as some tattoos, can also impact performance. The ink, pattern, and saturation of some tattoos can block light from the sensor, making it difficult for the Blood Oxygen app to get a measurement.</li><li>Motion is another factor that can affect your ability to get successful background or on-demand measurements. Certain postures, such as arms hanging by your side or fingers in a fist position will also result in unsuccessful measurements.</li><li>If your heart rate is too high (above 150 bpm) while at rest, you won't be able to get a successful blood oxygen measurement.</li></ul><p>It’s also important that you make sure that the Apple Watch is flush with your wrist, as this will also affect results.</p><figure><img src="https://dabido.com.au/content/images/2020/09/DraggedImage.png" alt=""></figure><h2 id="references">References</h2><ul><li><a href="https://covid19evidence.net.au/">https://covid19evidence.net.au/</a> - Covid-19 Taskforce Guidelines (for medical professionals).</li><li><a href="https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT211027">https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT211027</a></li></ul><h2 id="disclaimer">Disclaimer</h2><p><em>Although I’m sure I have, if I haven’t iterated the point enough: don’t make a self-diagnosis, seek a doctor’s advice on how to proceed. </em></p><p><em>If any mistakes or you'd like to get in contact with me, please do so at david (at) dabido.com.au.

            <h2>433% Keyboard</h2>
            <p>—「0X://Explanation」<br>
            IT IS FINALLY (mostly) COMPLETED. If anyone has ever heard directly from God Himself, the conception of this keyboard was definitely the message. 450 keys of solid non-mx-browness and
            433% the size of a normal full size, what more could you ask for? This keyboard fits 2 (two) full football fields on it {diagram on page 9 of your textbooks}. and um yeah thats kinda it idk can you see it there isnt much to say.

            {and yes for anyone who is new, i know the images load slow, im using some jankery just bear with it plz and ty}

             <p>i've acquired all the materials, i intend to 3d print some "feet" for this board and maybe tent it a bit, here are the pcbs:</p>
             <p><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&amp;id=1uWil1XZH2ctQViab6xnskC4BIYivAWeG" width="500px"></p><p>this one should be pretty straight forward, i just need some free time to build it. two "scrabblepads" by donutcables btw.</p>
             
             <p>the dautning task beings, and spoiler: i finish it all in one weekend (kinda). well you know what they say, show dont tell (and my hands ache from this build) so heres some pics of the board while i soldered the 450 diodes, switches, etc:</p>

               lets just skip all of my indecsision and skip to what i finally settled on. a xda 9009 set, dsa dark gray blanks, xda light grey blanks, cherry relegenadble keycaps (tipro rebrand), dsa "retro beige", cherry beige keycaps, dsa black blanks, and stroke and structure set keycaps.

                 its honestly not as hard as i thought it would be to switch, its still 123897421987 times better than any staggered non split torture. anyway thanks for reading so far! its been fun~

While the surface of Venus is currently incredibly inhospitable, there are regions of the atmosphere around 50 km up where temperatures range from 0-150° C and one could imagine finding life (<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090318094642.htm" target="_blank">as we do on Earth</a>)—and this is exactly where the phosphine was detected. <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/when-we-finally-find-aliens-they-might-smell-terrible/" target="_blank">Phosphine has previously been proposed as a biosignature</a> (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05224" target="_blank">paper</a>) since it’s reactive (e.g. short lived) and we don’t know of any abiotic process that could create it in quantity. “<em>The presence of PH<sub>3</sub> is unexplained after exhaustive study of steady-state chemistry and photochemical pathways, with no currently known abiotic production routes in Venus’s atmosphere, clouds, surface and subsurface, or from lightning, volcanic or meteoritic delivery.</em>” For 3 billion years, ending around 750 million years ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life_on_Venus#:~:text=Recent%20studies%20from%20September%20of,amount%20of%20time%20to%20evolve." target="_blank">Venus may have had surface water and a habitable environment</a>, leaving the tantalizing possibility that we’ve detected the last surviving vestiges of an ancient ecosystem. On the other hand, this could be measurement error, or we may have instead found evidence of a new abiotic form of phosphine synthesis in the extreme environment of Venus—scientists will be working hard to propose non-biological processes that could explain these results, and we expect to see a spate of new atmospheric Venus <a href="https://www.inverse.com/innovation/life-on-venus-rocket-lab-ceo" target="_blank">mission proposals</a>. In the fantastic event that the phosphine is of biological origin, the next big question will be whether or not Venusian life evolved independently, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panspermia#Lithopanspermia" target="_blank">shares ancestry with life on Earth</a>. <a href="https://www.planetary.org/articles/venus-phosphine-biosignature" target="_blank">The Planetary Society has more about these results</a>.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div><table><tbody><tr><td> <a href="https://xkcd.com/2359/" title="" target="_blank"> <img alt="" src="https://mcusercontent.com/e215b9e6f9a105b2c34f627a3/images/bcbc9beb-6d82-474f-826f-cc7a10f62a73.png" width="564"> </a></td></tr><tr><td> &nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#astra-launches-let-s-do-a-rocketry-startup-roundup">¶</a><strong id="astra-launches-let-s-do-a-rocketry-startup-roundup">Astra launches + let’s do a rocketry startup roundup. </strong>Last Friday, after multiple delays, Astra’s Rocket 3.1 <a href="https://astra.com/blog/we-have-lift-off/" target="_blank">made a beautiful, but ultimately unsuccessful, attempt at an orbital launch</a> (here’s the <a href="https://twitter.com/astra/status/1304884123882807296?s=21" target="_blank">official launch video</a>, another with <a href="https://twitter.com/cultonjennifer/status/1304626860853141505?s=21" target="_blank">fun bystander commentary</a>, and a third with <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ewvandongen/videos/10100980788269883/" target="_blank">a closer view of the explosion</a>). The vehicle’s navigation system introduced an oscillation that caused the flight safety system to shut off the engine. This is the fourth failure for the company (Rocket 1 and 2 were launched under significantly more secrecy, and Rocket 3 suffered an anomaly/RUD pre-flight). Astra will attempt a Rocket 3.2 launch, likely later this year, but may be running low on funding, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2izFjTEBKQ" target="_blank">according to Scott Manley</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.pldspace.com/" target="_blank">PLD Space</a>, a Spanish startup initially focused on the sounding rocket market (with future orbital ambitions), recently <a href="https://startupsreal.com/pld-space-closes-e7m-investment-in-tie-up-with-arcano-partners/" target="_blank">closed an additional €7M investment</a> after completing a full duration static fire (in February) and qualification of thrust vectoring (last month) for their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEPREL#TEPREL-B" target="_blank">TEPREL-B</a> engine—the engine that will power their <a href="https://www.pldspace.com/en/miura-1" target="_blank">Miura-1</a> suborbital rocket. In the southern hemisphere, <a href="https://www.gspacetech.com/" target="_blank">Gilmour Space Technologies</a> has been making progress on their hybrid fuel rocket, <a href="https://www.gspacetech.com/launch" target="_blank">Eris</a>, and inked a <a href="https://www.innovationaus.com/gilmours-giant-leap-for-sovereign-space-capability/" target="_blank">launch deal with Space Machines</a> last week. Eris uses a solid propellant with a liquid oxidizer, decreasing the complexity of development but retaining some of the efficiency and restartability that liquid engines provide. (Similarly, Rocket Lab <a href="https://3dprintingindustry.com/news/worlds-1st-3d-printed-battery-powered-rocket-engine-47226/" target="_blank">reduced the complexity of Electron by using electric pumps</a> instead of a traditional gas generator system.) And finally, Scottish startup <a href="https://www.skyrora.com/" target="_blank">Skyrora</a> recently launched their tiny SkyLark Micro (mentioned in <a href="https://orbitalindex.com/archive/2020-08-19-Issue-78/#news-in-brief" target="_blank">Issue No. 82</a>) and are targeting a launch of their scaled up <a href="https://www.skyrora.com/skyrora-xl" target="_blank">SkyLark XL</a> with its restartable peroxide third stage in 2023. We’re pulling for them all! (Related: While not a technical development, Chinese startup Landspace just <a href="https://spacenews.com/chinas-landspace-raises-175-million-for-zhuque-2-launch-vehicles" target="_blank">raised $175M for its Zhuque-2</a> two-stage methane-O2 vehicle and is targeting a June 2021 launch.)</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><a href="#the-world-is-on-fire-again">¶</a><strong id="the-world-is-on-fire-again">The world is on fire (again).</strong> Everyone on the US West Coast (and in <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-53893161" target="_blank">the Amazon</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-02568-y" target="_blank">the Arctic</a>, <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/07/heat-wave-thawed-siberia-now-on-fire" target="_blank">Siberia</a>...) is suffering through unlivable air quality indexes from record-breaking fires, which have burned over <a href="https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/" target="_blank">3.1 million acres in California alone</a>, an area larger than Connecticut and 26x what had burned by this time last year. As <a href="https://heated.world/p/nothing-to-see-here-folks" target="_blank">Emily Atkin reported in HEATED</a>, news sources are largely ignoring the cause of these fires: <a href="https://www.c2es.org/content/wildfires-and-climate-change" target="_blank">climate change</a>. This is a vicious cycle—the fires’ emissions are the <a href="https://twitter.com/Weather_West/status/1304477304962207744" target="_blank">highest we’ve ever seen by satellite from CA or OR</a> and have <a href="https://qz.com/1903191/western-wildfires-are-producing-a-record-breaking-amount-of-co2/" target="_blank">now emitted more CO<sub>2</sub> than the states’ power sectors</a>. Earth observation satellites are playing a key role in analyzing and responding to this crisis.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blogContent"><p>In the process of starting Grouparoo, we interviewed a hundred people who work in Marketing at various levels and roles. They spanned levels from independent contributors to executives and covered a wide range of marketing disciplines including Marketing Ops, Marketing Automation, Product Marketing, and more. Across our interviews, we heard about a diversity of experiences, but we heard a few common themes:</p><ol><li>Marketing’s scope is increasing</li><li>Marketing is becoming more and more technical</li><li>Marketers often don’t get the support they need from other teams</li></ol><p>While every role and level experienced this phenomenon slightly differently, the experiences were similar. I’ll being sharing some highlights from those interviews.</p><h2>Marketing’s scope is ever-increasing</h2><p>We’ve learned from marketers who have been in the tech industry for a while that their scope is continually expanding and increasing. The number of channels that marketers responsible for has grown, and by extension, the number of tools that they need to use to manage all of those channels has also grown. Here’s a diagram showing all of the different Marketing Technology (Martech) providers that exist per <a href="https://chiefmartec.com/2020/04/marketing-technology-landscape-2020-martech-5000/">chiefmartech.com</a>:</p><p><img alt="martech 2020" src="https://www.grouparoo.com/_next/static/images/martech2020-d175fee6b32c55455a663b3d4ee3f283.png"></p><p>Marketers also own more parts of the funnel now. Historically, marketers were responsible primarily for defining the company’s brand and driving awareness. Now, they’re increasingly responsible for qualifying leads, gathering emails, ensuring these leads convert, and nurturing and retaining those customers for the long-term.</p><h2>Marketing is becoming more technical</h2><p>As the number of channels has increased, the tools to support all of those channels has also increased. The skills required to run campaigns across all of these channels and analyzing the results of these campaigns requires more and more technical abilities.</p><p>As an organization grows, one of the most important aspects of marketing is segmenting your users correctly before you start any campaigns. If you can’t segment your customer base appropriately, the only options you have left are about how often you can contact your entire user list.</p><p>For technology companies, segmenting users isn’t just as simple as segmenting them based on their demographic information. The best kind of segmentation takes into account how your customers use your product, their purchase history, and all other kinds of data that exist in your data warehouse and elsewhere. Being able to join all of that data from various places, segment your users appropriately, and then take actions is super tough. All of this often requires someone with SQL skills to help you out.</p><h2>Marketers often don’t get the support they need from other teams</h2><blockquote><p>“It’s <strong>incapacitating</strong> to have to rely on someone else. Third party tools are a <strong>source of tension.</strong> Product &amp; Eng is saying over and over to you that your function isn’t important.” - VP of Marketing, <a href="https://taskrabbit.com/">TaskRabbit</a></p></blockquote><p>As Marketing is using more and more tools, Engineering and Product teams are needed to evaluate, prioritize, and integrate these tools. We’ve heard of some horror stories where a Marketing team had signed and was paying for Braze for over a year, but the Engineering team hadn’t integrated it yet. So, the Marketing team hadn’t sent a single email in over a year.</p><blockquote><p>“<strong>No one likes working on marketing integrations.</strong> The systems are brittle, it takes a long time, and it’s hard to know if you got the integration right.” - Engineering Manager, <a href="http://guideline.com/">Guideline</a></p></blockquote><p>Part of the issue is that very few engineers join a company because they’re excited to build an integration with Marketo. Engineers are usually excited about building and scaling the core product. As a result, this kind of work is often de-prioritized and pushed to next week, next sprint, next quarter, etc.</p><blockquote><p>“<strong>It’s like pulling teeth</strong> to get engineers to implement new events in Segment.” - Marketing Manager, <a href="http://molekule.com/">Molekule</a></p></blockquote><p>Even with tools like Segment that claim to be for marketers, the reality is that marketers and other teams are still dependent on engineers when new events need to be instrumented in the product.</p><blockquote><p>“Sending a new piece of data from Redshift to Marketo takes anywhere from 4-6 weeks. To work around delays, we manually export CSVs.” - Growth Manager, <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a></p></blockquote><p>Because of these slow processes, marketers and others often fall back to what’s tried-and-true: spreadsheets and CSVs. Even though CSVs and spreadsheets aren’t the most long-term scalable solution, they get the job done when data isn’t easily strung together.</p><h2>How does one solve these problems?</h2><p>Given everything I've described, while a lot of these challenges are rooted in organizational misalignment, these challenges can also be solved through technology. Here at Grouparoo, we've taken all of these learnings to build a framework and product that makes it easier for engineers to install so they don't have to worry about building and maintaining all of these integrations. Additionally, our product is architected to pull data directly from your core data sources without needing future engineering support. Feel free to share this <a href="http://grouparoo.com/blog/marketing-challenges">blog post</a> with your engineering team so they can try installing Grouparoo and <a href="http://grouparoo.com/meet">reach out</a> if you want to learn more.</p></div></div>]]>

September 16, 2020 | https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/19/const.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.ralfj.de/blog/2018/07/19/const.html">archive.org</a>

</header>

<p>For some time now (since the 1.26 release, to be precise), Rust has a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/46882">very powerful machinery for CTFE</a>, or compile-time function evaluation.
Since then, there have been various discussions about which operations should be allowed during CTFE, which checks the compiler should do, how this all relates to promotion and which kinds of guarantees we should be able to expect around CTFE.
This post is my take on those topics, and it should not be surprising that I am going to take a very type-system centric view.
Expect something like a structured brain dump, so there are some unanswered questions towards the end as well.</p>

<!-- MORE -->

<h2 id="some-background">Some Background</h2>

<p>CTFE is the mechanism used by the compiler, primarily, to evaluate items like <code>const x: T = ...;</code>.
The <code>...</code> here is going to be Rust code that must be “run” at compile-time, because it can be used as a constant in the code – for example, it can be used for array lengths.</p>

<p>Notice that CTFE is <em>not</em> the same as constant propagation: Constant propagation is an optimization pass done by compilers like LLVM that will opportunistically change code like <code>3 + 4</code> into <code>7</code> to avoid run-time work.
Being an optimization, constant propagation must, by definition, not change program behavior and will not be observable at all (other than performance).
CTFE, on the other hand, is about code that <em>must</em> be executed at compile-time because the compiler needs to know its result to proceed – for example, it needs to know the size of an array to compute how to lay out data in memory.
You can statically see, just from the syntax of the code, whether CTFE applies to some piece of code or not:
CTFE is only used in places like the value of a <code>const</code> or the length of an array.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>demo</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>X</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span> <span>+</span> <span>4</span><span>;</span> <span>// CTFE</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>u32</span> <span>=</span> <span>4</span> <span>+</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span> <span>// no CTFE (but maybe constant propagation)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We say that the <code>3 + 4</code> above is in <em>const context</em> and hence subject to CTFE, but the <code>4 + 3</code> is not.</p>

<h2 id="const-safety">Const Safety</h2>

<p>Not all operations can be used in const context.
For example, it makes no sense to compute your array length as “please go read that file from disk and compute something” – we can’t know what will be on the disk when the program actually runs.
We could use the disk of the machine compiling the program, but that does not sound very appealing either.
Things get even worse when you consider letting the program send information to the network.
Clearly, we don’t want CTFE to have actually observable side-effects outside of compilation.</p>

<p>In fact, just naively letting programs read files would also be grossly unsafe:
When computing the length of an array twice, it is important that we obtain the same result.
<strong>Update:</strong> As @eddyb points out, things get even worse once you consider const generics, traits, and coherence: At that point, you have to <a href="https://internals.rust-lang.org/t/mir-constant-evaluation/3143/47">rely on evaluating the same expression in different crates to produce the same result</a>. <strong>/Update</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>CTFE must be deterministic.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>If not, the compiler could end up thinking that two arrays have the same length, but then later compute different layouts.
That would be a disaster.
So, any kind of external input and any kind of non-determinism is a complete no-go for CTFE.
This does not just concern I/O, even converting a reference to a <code>usize</code> is not deterministic.</p>

<p>The compiler will throw a CTFE error if such an operation is ever attempted to be executed.
Those programs that <em>are</em> executable in const context are called <em>const safe</em>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A program is const safe if it can be executed by CTFE without hitting an error (panics are allowed).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is very much in analogy with the idea that a <em>safe</em> (or <em>run-time safe</em>, to distinguish it from const safe) program is a program that does not cause any memory errors or data races.
In fact, we will see that this analogy between “programs that are well-behaved under CTFE” (const safety) and “programs that do not cause UB” (run-time safety) can carry us very far.</p>

<p>One very interesting question now is whether some given function <code>foo</code> should be allowed to be called in const context.
We could just always say “yes”, and rely on the fact that CTFE will throw an error when <code>foo</code> does anything fishy.
The problem with this approach is that, if <code>foo</code> is in a library, updating the library might change <code>foo</code> in a way that makes it no longer const-safe.
In other words, making <em>any</em> function not const-safe any more would be a semver violation because it could break downstream crates.</p>

<p>The typical mechanism to solve that problem is to have an annotation that explicitly marks a function as “usable in const context”.
In Rust, the proposed mechanism for this purpose is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111"><code>const fn</code></a>; in C++ it is called <code>constexpr</code>.
The compiler can now reject calling non-<code>const</code> functions in const context, so library authors can add non-const-safe operations without breaking semver.</p>

<h2 id="const-type-system-and-const-soundness">Const Type System and Const Soundness</h2>

<p>This leads us to the interesting situation that the compiler will reject code in const context that it would accept just fine outside of const context.
In particular, the body of a <code>const fn</code> is <em>also</em> considered to be in const context – otherwise, if we allowed calling arbitrary functions, we would have the same problem again.
One useful way to think about this is that we have a second type system, a “const type system”, that is used to type-check code in const context.
This type system does not allow calls to non-<code>const</code> functions.</p>

<p>It should probably also not allow casting a reference to an integer, because (as discussed above) that is a non-deterministic operation which cannot be performed during CTFE.
What else?</p>

<p>Before we go on and add random additional checks, let us step back and think about what our goals are here.
Typically, the purpose of a type system is to establish some sort of guarantee for a well-typed program.
For Rust’s “main” (“run-time”) type system, that guarantee is “no undefined behavior”, which means no memory errors and no data races.
What is the guarantee for our new const type system?
We have already talked about it above: It’s const safety!
This leads us to the definition of const soundness:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>Our const type system is sound if well-typed programs are const-safe.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Again, notice how this is very similar to the correctness statement for the run-time type system, which guarantees run-time safety.</p>

<p>However, we have to be a bit careful here.
Consider the following piece of code:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>const</span> <span>fn</span> <span>is_eight_mod_256</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>usize</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>bool</span> <span>{</span> <span>x</span> <span>%</span> <span>256</span> <span>==</span> <span>8</span> <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>We will definitely want to allow this code.
Why should <code>==</code> or <code>%</code> not be const-safe?
Well, we could call our function as follows:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>is_eight_mod_256</span><span>(</span><span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>into_raw</span><span>(</span><span>Box</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>))</span> <span>as</span> <span>usize</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>That statement is certainly <em>not</em> const-safe as the result depends on where exactly the allocator puts our <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/boxed/struct.Box.html"><code>Box</code></a>.
However, we want to blame the <code>as usize</code> for this issue, not the <code>is_eight_mod_256</code>.</p>

<p>The solution is for the const type system to not just have separate rules about which operations are allowed, we also must change our notion of which values are “valid” for a given type.
An integer obtained from a pointer is valid for <code>usize</code> at run-time, but it is <em>not</em> valid for <code>usize</code> in const mode!
After all, there are basic arithmetic operations that we expect all <code>usize</code> to support, that CTFE cannot support for pointers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>A function is const-safe if, when executed with const-valid arguments, it does not trigger a CTFE error and returns a const-valid result (if it returns at all).</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Under this definition, <code>is_eight_mod_256</code> is const-safe because whenever <code>x</code> is an actual integer, it will evaluate without any error.
At the same time, this shows that converting a reference into <code>usize</code> is <em>not</em> const-safe, because the input of this operation is const-valid, but the output is not!
This provides a solid justification for rejecting such casts in const context.</p>

<h2 id="ctfe-correctness">CTFE correctness</h2>

<p>In Rust, CTFE is performed by miri, a MIR interpreter that used to be a <a href="https://github.com/solson/miri/">separate project</a> but whose core engine has been integrated into rustc.
miri will execute the code in const context step-by-step and just complain and fail with an error when an operation cannot be performed.
This does not just concern non-determinism; miri does not support everything it could support because @oli-obk is <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/blob/5ba21844f6c85a0cd55c8ea0250d5cd758134f84/src/librustc_mir/interpret/const_eval.rs#L199">super careful</a> about not accidentally stabilizing behavior that should undergo an RFC.</p>

<p>In fact, right now miri will reject all operations on raw pointers.
They all raise a CTFE error and hence must all be rejected by the const type system.
The plan is to change miri so that it can support more operations, but we have to be careful in doing so.
I have already mentioned that miri must be deterministic, but there is another point to consider that you might have expected to play a much more prominent role:
CTFE, at least if it succeeds, should match run-time behavior!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>CTFE is correct if, when it loops forever, completes with a result, or panics, that behavior matches the run-time behavior of the same code.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We clearly do not want code to behave differently when it lives in const context and is run by CTFE, and when it is compiled to machine-code and executed “for real”.</p>

<p>Or, do we?
Don’t get me wrong, I am not advocating for deliberately breaking that property, but it sure is worth considering what would go wrong if miri was <em>not</em> CTFE-correct.
Maybe surprisingly, it turns out that this would not be a soundness issue!
All we care about for the purpose of soundness is for CTFE to be deterministic, as already discussed.
We don’t re-run the same code at run-time and rely on it still doing the same, so nothing actually breaks if CTFE behavior diverges from run-time behavior.</p>

<p>That said, not being CTFE correct is surely very surprising and we should avoid it best we can.
However, I am told that actually predicting the result of floating-point operations deterministically <a href="https://gafferongames.com/post/floating_point_determinism/">is extremely hard</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/24111#issuecomment-386765720">LLVM isn’t exactly helping</a>.
So, we will likely have to live with either considering floating point operations to be const-unsafe (raising a CTFE error), or not having CTFE correctness when floating point operations are …</p></article></div>

<p>Published Feb. 12, 2012</p>
<p>Belatedly, the world has learned that Roger M. Boisjoly, the whistleblower who tried to prevent the <em>Challenger</em> space shuttle explosion, passed away recently in Nephi, Utah.</p>

<p>Roger M. Boisjoly, the son of a mill worker, was born April 25, 1938, in Lowell, Massachusetts. &nbsp;From childhood, he was known for his&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lowellsun.com/news/ci_19902357?source=rss#ixzz1mDSiN0rn">honesty</a>&nbsp;and “would not back down from what he believed in,” say family members. After earning a&nbsp;<a href="http://www.lowellsun.com/news/ci_19902357?source=rss#ixzz1mDOGMpcw">mechanical engineering</a>&nbsp;degree from the University of Lowell, he began working in the aircraft industry. After a move to California, then to Utah, he took a job with&nbsp; Morton Thiokol, working on solid rocket boosters for the space shuttle program.</p>
<p>In 1985, he&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2097973/Roger-Boisjoly-dead-Engineer-foresaw-Challenger-explosion-dies-age-73.html">warned</a>&nbsp;managers that 0-rings used to seal joints in the booster rockets could fail at freezing temperatures. ‘The result would be&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2097973/Roger-Boisjoly-dead-Engineer-foresaw-Challenger-explosion-dies-age-73.html">a catastrophe of the highest order</a>&nbsp;— loss of human life,’ he wrote in a memo.&nbsp; But, the problem had not been resolved when the space shuttle&nbsp;<em>Challenger</em>&nbsp;was prepared for launch on January 28, 1986.</p>
<p>On the night of January 27, temperatures fell below freezing.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/science-obituaries/9067491/Roger-Boisjoly.html">Boisjoly and four other engineers</a>&nbsp;tried desperately to convince management that the launch should be scrubbed.&nbsp; They warned that the cold would cause rubber o-rings to become brittle and fail, allowing hot gases to leak at the joints. Morton Thiokol and NASA managers dismissed the arguments, and decided to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/roger-boisjolys-death-goes-unnoticed-predicted-1986-nasa-rocket-explosion-68897/">go ahead</a>&nbsp;with the launch.</p>
<p>The next day, Challenger lifted off from its pad at Kennedy Space Center.&nbsp; At first, the launch appeared normal, but 73 seconds into flight the shuttle exploded, sending fragments arcing across the bright Florida sky.&nbsp; In view of a horrified public, including thousands of&nbsp;<a href="http://www.historyplace.com/speeches/reagan-challenger.htm">schoolchildren</a>&nbsp;watching a live broadcast, seven astronauts plummeted to their deaths in the Atlantic ocean.</p>
<p>NASA’s actions following the disaster were typical for a government agency with a scandal on its hands: it impounded documents and told employees and others connected with the program&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SwuCxfZn_kEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22NASA+Had+Warning+of+a+Disaster+Risk+Posed+by+Booster%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PxrIMhhWBM&amp;sig=8jGg4rLQy4_dX4_bloIqwa5NW8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9RE4T5nfLaTb0QHw6tnhAg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22NASA%20Had%20Warning%20of%20a%20Disaster%20Risk%20Posed%20by%20Booster%22&amp;f=false">not to talk to reporters</a>, even off the record.</p>
<p>President Ronald Reagan established a commission, known as the “Rogers Commission,” to search for the cause of the explosion and, initially, NASA managers were successful in &nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=SwuCxfZn_kEC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=%22NASA+Had+Warning+of+a+Disaster+Risk+Posed+by+Booster%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PxrIMhhWBM&amp;sig=8jGg4rLQy4_dX4_bloIqwa5NW8I&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9RE4T5nfLaTb0QHw6tnhAg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22NASA%20Had%20Warning%20of%20a%20Disaster%20Risk%20Posed%20by%20Booster%22&amp;f=false">diverting attention</a>&nbsp;from the o-rings. &nbsp;But, the dissenting engineers refused to let an important truth be swept under the carpet.</p>
<blockquote><p>It was clear to the engineers that NASA was bent on minimizing the pre-launch concern over the cold. Boisjoly was sufficiently concerned that he took his&nbsp;personal files&nbsp;into a sort of protective custody. He emptied his desk and took the critical memos with him to Huntsville. He slept with them in his motel room. He hid them in the locked trunk of his rented car when he went to work at the Marshall Space Flight Center. He sent copies home to Roberta. And still he worried that someone might try to lose or destroy them. –&nbsp;William C. Rempel, <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-28/news/mn-1361_1_engineers/3">Los Angeles Times</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The investigation took a new direction after February 9, when the New York Times published a&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6f6LrdOXO6wC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=new+york+times+february+9+challenger+closed+session&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ycL-vpTDJY&amp;sig=poGvZlXOiWbefMO3NCP8jvXlbyY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Jlo4T5SNOuPu0gHU5MHfAg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20york%20times%20february%209%20challenger%20closed%20session&amp;f=false">front-page story</a>&nbsp;(“NASA Had Warning of a Disaster Risk Posed by Booster”) citing concerns about o-ring failure expressed in documents it had obtained from an “anonymous solid fuel rocket analyst.”&nbsp; Afterward, the commission held three&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=6f6LrdOXO6wC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=new+york+times+february+9+challenger+closed+session&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ycL-vpTDJY&amp;sig=poGvZlXOiWbefMO3NCP8jvXlbyY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Jlo4T5SNOuPu0gHU5MHfAg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=new%20york%20times%20february%209%20challenger%20closed%20session&amp;f=false">closed sessions</a>&nbsp;where personnel from Morton Thiokol and Marshall Space Flight center were questioned, including participants in the teleconference that took place on the eve of Challenger’s launch.&nbsp; As a result, the o-ring issues became a major focus of the investigation.</p>
<p>Boisjoly, who had been known as a “crackerjack troubleshooter,” was re-branded a “<a href="http://www.ocregister.com/news/boisjoly-248703-boyd-chapman.html">whistleblower</a>.” “After he finally passed [his] files personally to Major Gen. Donald J. Kutyna of the presidential commission, Boisjoly was&nbsp;<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1987-01-28/news/mn-1361_1_engineers/3">accused</a>&nbsp;of ‘airing the company’s dirty laundry’ in front of the whole country,” wrote the LA Times.</p>
<p>In June 1986, the commission confirmed that the o-rings and cold weather led to the disaster.&nbsp; But, it did not attach blame to any of the individuals who ignored the engineers’ warnings.&nbsp; Instead, the commission criticized the “flawed”&nbsp;<a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=EP9D_30SpkMC&amp;pg=RA1-PA9&amp;lpg=RA1-PA9&amp;dq=NASA+HAD+WARNING+OF+A+DISASTER+RISK+POSED+BY+BOOSTER&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZsOwDSnG83&amp;sig=YgXOJqYLqYNITsW9iFk8pvKbEEg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3BQ4T-_vBqL50gG43JDTBQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=NASA%20HAD%20WARNING%20OF%20A%20DISASTER%20RISK%20POSED%20BY%20BOOSTER&amp;f=false">process</a>&nbsp;of decision-making.</p>
<p>The pre-launch effort by Boisjoly and others to stop the launch did not qualify as&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/EthicsResources/Otherresources/whistle.html">whistleblowing</a>, some experts say, because the engineers did not go outside approved channels. But, that legal definition is unrealistically narrow.</p>
<blockquote><p>If it is a distinguishing mark of actions labeled whistleblowing that the agent intends to&nbsp;force attention to a serious moral problem, both Boisjoly’s and MacDonald’s responses qualify. This feature is the foundation of the public’s interest in whistleblowing. By bringing such serious problems to light, whistleblowers contribute to protecting the public’s welfare.&nbsp;<em>– Vivian Weill, <a href="http://www.nspe.org/Ethics/EthicsResources/Otherresources/whistle.html">Illinois Institute of Technology</a> (1996)</em></p></blockquote>
<p>We now know that Boisjoly&nbsp;<a href="http://keranews.org/post/remembering-roger-boisjoly-he-tried-stop-shuttle-challenger-launch">met secretly</a>&nbsp;with an NPR reporter shortly after the shuttle disaster to provide information about the problems at Morton Thiokol — clearly not an approved channel. Unquestionably, that was an act of whistleblowing, but Boisjoly’s request for&nbsp;<a href="http://keranews.org/post/remembering-roger-boisjoly-he-tried-stop-shuttle-challenger-launch">anonymity</a>&nbsp;prevented it from becoming public knowledge.</p>
<p>The clearest evidence of whistleblowing, writes Weill, may be its most predictable consequence:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="https://whistleblowing.us/2012/02/remembering-roger-m-boisjoly-challenger-disaster-whistleblower-1938-2012/Weil%20nevertheless%20suggests%20that%20Boisjoly%20was%20a%20whistleblower,%20under%20different%20standards.%20Retaliation%20may%20be%20the%20most%20predictable%20feature%20of%20whistleblowing,%20perhaps%20enough%20to%20make%20it%20a%20defining%20feature.writes">retaliation</a>. There was no shortage of that after the engineers exposed the truth of o-ring failures. &nbsp;Along with Allan MacDonald, another engineer who tried to stop the Challenger launch, Boisjoly was&nbsp;<a href="http://www.standard.net/topics/atk/2011/01/27/two-men-fought-prevent-challenger-launch">taken off the investigation team</a>&nbsp;by Morton Thiokol management. The environment, he said, was hostile.</p>
<blockquote><p>“[Thiokol managers] were extremely angry when I turned in my documentation and that anger increased as I continued to testify,” says Boisjoly. During testimony at a committee hearing, he publicly refuted a manager’s assertion that Thiokol engineers weren’t unanimous in recommending that the launch be canceled. “When I finished they were so damn mad&nbsp;that I think if they had guns they would have shot me on the spot,” he says. – Molly Gavin, Engineering Times (August, 1995), <a href="https://www.nspe.org/resources/blogs/nspe-blog/pe-warned-space-shuttle-disaster">republished</a> by NSPE.</p></blockquote>
<p>Later, in “Truth, Lies and O-Rings,” MacDonald wrote that “Roger and I already felt like&nbsp;<a href="http://www.standard.net/topics/atk/2011/01/27/two-men-fought-prevent-challenger-launch">lepers</a>, but when we returned to Utah following the May 2 session our colleagues treated us as if we had just been arrested for child sexual abuse.”</p>
<p>Colleagues and even neighbors&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10084988">shunned</a>&nbsp;Boisjoly. Thiokol “<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/02/04/us/roger-boisjoly-73-dies-warned-of-shuttle-danger.html">cut him off</a>&nbsp;from space work,” and NASA “tried to&nbsp;<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2012/feb/07/local/la-me-roger-boisjoly-20120207">blackball him</a>&nbsp;from the industry.” “Managers isolated him in his position and “<a href="http://community.nspe.org/blogs/nspeblog/archive/2012/02/06/dhfh.aspx">made life a living hell</a>&nbsp;on a day-to-day basis.”</p>
<p>“When I realized what was happening, it absolutely destroyed me,” Boisjoly told The Associated Press in a 1988 telephone interview. “<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/10084988">It destroyed my career, my life, everything else.</a>”&nbsp; Boisjoly hung on for six months before deciding to take&nbsp;<a href="http://community.nspe.org/blogs/nspeblog/archive/2012/02/06/dhfh.aspx">long-term disability</a>&nbsp;leave, having been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder. He would not return to Thiokol.</p>
<p>Boisjoly filed lawsuits against Thiokol and NASA, including a&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qui_tam">qui tam</a></em>&nbsp;claim that Morton Thiokol had defrauded the public. The&nbsp;<a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1987-06-04/news/mn-4921_1_justice-department-spokeswoman">Justice Department refused</a>&nbsp;to join the suit as expected, and the lawsuits were&nbsp;<a href="http://ut.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac.19880831_0000002.DUT.htm/qx">dismissed</a>.&nbsp; The chilling spectacle of a whistleblower’s fall from grace sent a powerful message to others in the industry to stay silent about the next disaster in the making.</p>
<p>Boisjoly viewed the lawsuits as “<a href="http://community.nspe.org/blogs/nspeblog/archive/2012/02/06/dhfh.aspx">an exercise in total futility</a>.”</p>
<blockquote><p>“I think [the court system was]&nbsp;afraid of what they’d find.” The suits never even made it to the discovery process, he says. Boisjoly decided not to pursue the lawsuits further. “I tried to get on with my life,” he says. – Gavin, 1995</p></blockquote>
<p>Boisjoly’s moral courage earned him multiple&nbsp;<a href="http://www.onlineethics.org/cms/12717.aspx">awards</a>, including one from the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1988, and another from the Cavallo Foundation in 1990. Despite the awards, Boisjoly saw no hope of returning to his former career.&nbsp; Like many other blacklisted whistleblowers, he decided to&nbsp;<a href="http://community.nspe.org/blogs/nspeblog/archive/2012/02/06/dhfh.aspx">go into business for himself</a>.&nbsp; He obtained a professional engineering license and began consulting as a forensic engineer. In additon, he wrote papers and lectured to engineering students on a subject dear to him:&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2097973/Roger-Boisjoly-dead-Engineer-foresaw-Challenger-explosion-dies-age-73.html#ixzz1locDb6ls">ethical decision making.</a></p>
<p>NASA’s management culture failed to preserve the costly lessons of the&nbsp;<em>Challenger&nbsp;</em>disaster. In January 2003, NASA launched&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster">another space shuttle</a>&nbsp;under circumstances that worried engineers. &nbsp;Foam insulation broke off during&nbsp;<em>Columbia’s&nbsp;</em>lift-off and punched a hole in a wing, leaving it vulnerable to the extreme forces of reentry. On February 1, as it re-entered earth’s atmosphere,&nbsp;<em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Columbia_disaster">Columbia disintegrated</a></em>&nbsp;in the skies above Texas, sending another seven astronauts to their deaths.</p>
<p>The space shuttle program&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/main/index.html">ended</a>, several flights later, on July 21, 2011.&nbsp; Less than six months after, on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2097973/Roger-Boisjoly-dead-Engineer-foresaw-Challenger-explosion-dies-age-73.html#ixzz1locDb6ls">January 6, 2012</a>, Roger Boisjoly finally found peace.&nbsp; At the age of 73 — one year for every second of Challenger’s last flight — he died in his sleep of cancer.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>This is the first in a series of posts describing how we can debug applications in production using eBPF, without recompilation/redeployment. This post describes how to use <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/gobpf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gobpf</a> and uprobes to build a function argument tracer for Go applications. This technique is also extendable to other compiled languages such as C++, Rust, etc. The next sets of posts in this series will discuss using eBPF for tracing HTTP/gRPC data, SSL, etc.</p><p>When debugging, we are typically interested in capturing the state of a program. This allows us to examine what the application is doing and determine where the bug is located in our code. A simple way to observe state is to use a debugger to capture function arguments. For Go applications, we often use Delve or gdb.</p><p>Delve and gdb work well for debugging in a development environment, but they are not often used in production. The features that make these debuggers powerful can also make them undesirable to use in production systems. Debuggers can cause significant interruption to the program and even allow mutation of state which might lead to unexpected failures of production software.</p><p>To more cleanly capture function arguments, we will explore using enhanced BPF (<a href="https://ebpf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">eBPF</a>), which is available in Linux 4.x+, and the higher level Go library <a href="https://github.com/iovisor/gobpf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gobpf</a>.</p><p>Extended BPF (eBPF) is a kernel technology that is available in Linux 4.x+. You can think of it as a lightweight sandboxed VM that runs inside of the Linux kernel and can provide verified access to kernel memory.</p><p>As shown in the overview below, eBPF allows the kernel to run BPF bytecode. While the front-end language used can vary, it is often a restricted subset of C. Typically the C code is first compiled to the BPF bytecode using Clang, then the bytecode is verified to make sure it's safe to execute. These strict verifications guarantee that the machine code will not intentionally or accidentally compromise the Linux kernel, and that the BPF probe will execute in a bounded number of instructions every time it is triggered. These guarantees enable eBPF to be used in performance-critical workloads like packet filtering, networking monitoring, etc.</p><p>Functionally, eBPF allows you to run restricted C code upon some event (eg. timer, network event or a function call). When triggered on a function call we call these functions probes and they can be used to either run on a function call within the kernel (kprobes), or a function call in a userspace program (uprobes). This post focuses on using uprobes to allow dynamic tracing of function arguments.</p><p>Uprobes allow you to intercept a userspace program by inserting a debug trap instruction (<code>int3</code> on an x86) that triggers a soft-interrupt . This is also <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/01/27/how-debuggers-work-part-2-breakpoints" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">how debuggers work</a>. The flow for an uprobe is essentially the same as any other BPF program and is summarized in the diagram below. The compiled and verified BPF program is executed as part of a uprobe, and the results can be written into a buffer.</p><div><figure>

  </figure></div><p>Let's see how uprobes actually function. To deploy uprobes and capture function arguments, we will be using <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/app.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a> simple demo application. The relevant parts of this Go program are shown below.</p><p><code>main()</code> is a simple HTTP server that exposes a single <em>GET</em> endpoint on <em>/e</em>, which computes Euler's number (<strong>e</strong>) using an iterative approximation. <code>computeE</code> takes in a single query param(<em>iters</em>), which specifies the number of iterations to run for the approximation. The more iterations, the more accurate the approximation, at the cost of compute cycles. It's not essential to understand the math behind the function. We are just interested in tracing the arguments of any invocation of <code>computeE</code>.</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>To understand how uprobes work, let's look at how symbols are tracked inside binaries. Since uprobes work by inserting a debug trap instruction, we need to get the address where the function is located. Go binaries on Linux use ELF to store debug info. This information is available, even in optimized binaries, unless debug data has been stripped. We can use the command <code>objdump</code> to examine the symbols in the binary:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>From the output, we know that the function <code>computeE</code> is located at address <code>0x6609a0</code>. To look at the instructions around it, we can ask <code>objdump</code> to disassemble to binary (done by adding <code>-d</code>). The disassembled code looks like:</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB3aWR0aD0iMzIiIGhlaWdodD0iMzIiIHZpZXdCb3g9IjAgMCAzMiAzMiIgZmlsbD0ibm9uZSIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj4KPHBhdGggZmlsbC1ydWxlPSJldmVub2RkIiBjbGlwLXJ1bGU9ImV2ZW5vZGQiIGQ9Ik0yMC4zMzYgNUg4LjA0OEM2LjkxNjQ4IDUgNiA1LjkxNjQ4IDYgNy4wNDhWMjEuMzg0SDguMDQ4VjcuMDQ4SDIwLjMzNlY1Wk0yMy40MDggOS4wOTZIMTIuMTQ0QzExLjAxMjUgOS4wOTYgMTAuMDk2IDEwLjAxMjUgMTAuMDk2IDExLjE0NFYyNS40OEMxMC4wOTYgMjYuNjExNSAxMS4wMTI1IDI3LjUyOCAxMi4xNDQgMjcuNTI4SDIzLjQwOEMyNC41Mzk1IDI3LjUyOCAyNS40NTYgMjYuNjExNSAyNS40NTYgMjUuNDhWMTEuMTQ0QzI1LjQ1NiAxMC4wMTI1IDI0LjUzOTUgOS4wOTYgMjMuNDA4IDkuMDk2Wk0xMi4xNDQgMjUuNDhIMjMuNDA4VjExLjE0NEgxMi4xNDRWMjUuNDhaIiBmaWxsPSIjNEE0QzRGIi8+Cjwvc3ZnPgo=" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>From this we can see what happens when <code>computeE</code> is called. The first instruction is <code>mov 0x8(%rsp),%rax</code>. This moves the content offset <code>0x8</code> from the <code>rsp</code> register to the <code>rax</code> register. This is actually the input argument <code>iterations</code> above; Go's arguments are passed on the stack.</p><p>With this information in mind, we are now ready to dive in and write code to trace the arguments for <code>computeE</code>.</p><p>To capture the events, we need to register a uprobe function and have a userspace function that can read the output. A diagram of this is shown below. We will write a binary called <code>tracer</code> that is responsible for registering the BPF code and reading the results of the BPF code. As shown, the uprobe will simply write to a perf-buffer, a linux kernel data structure used for perf events.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/9f8b26f88f9b132440ef1b9d48b5a341/app-tracer.svg"><figcaption>High-level overview showing the Tracer binary listening to perf events generated from the App</figcaption></figure></div><p>Now that we understand the pieces involved, let's look into the details of what happens when we add an uprobe. The diagram below shows how the binary is modified by the Linux kernel with an uprobe. The soft-interrupt instruction (<code>int3</code>) is inserted as the first instruction in <code>main.computeE</code>. This causes a soft-interrupt, allowing the Linux kernel to execute our BPF function. We then write the arguments to the perf-buffer, which is asynchronously read by the tracer.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/87301c7282e8f8270fee2afb9fe85c81/app-trace.svg"><figcaption>Details of how a debug trap instruction is used call a BPF program</figcaption></figure></div><p>The BPF function for this is relatively simple; the C code is shown below. We register this function so that it's invoked every time <code>main.computeE</code> is called. Once it's called, we simply read the function argument and write that the perf buffer. Lots of boilerplate is required to set up the buffers, etc. and this can be found in the complete example <a href="https://github.com/pixie-labs/pixie/blob/main/demos/simple-gotracing/trace_example/trace.go" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><pre><div><p><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,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" alt="" title="Copy to clipboard" aria-label="copy"></p></div></pre><p>Now we have a fully functioning end-to-end argument tracer for the <code>main.computeE</code> function!

Many aspects of Go, such as nested pointers, interfaces, channels, etc. make this process challenging, but solving these problems allows for another instrumentation mode not available in existing systems. Also, since this process works at the binary level, it can be used with natively compiled binaries for other languages (C++, Rust, etc.). We just need to account for the differences in their respective ABI's.</p><p>BPF tracing using uprobes comes with its own set of pros and cons. It's beneficial to use BPF when we need observability into the binary state, even when running in environments where attaching a debugger will be problematic or harmful (ex. production binaries). The biggest downside is the code required to get even trivial visibility into the application state. While BPF code is relatively accessible, it's complex to write and maintain. Without substantial high-level tooling, it's unlikely this can be used for generic debugging.</p><div><figure><img src="https://blog.pixielabs.ai/static/12645e1cb582041085ede1877e97c812/wavingnaut.svg"><figcaption></figcaption></figure></div><p>Go dynamic logging is something we are working on at Pixie.

<p><span>O</span>n a bright, clear day in mid-June, Andry Kohut, director of the State Archive of the Ukrainian Security Service, stood in front of the sarcophagus of Chernobyl’s reactor Unit 4 wearing sneakers and an N95 face mask. Just over his head, a new mural by the Ukrainian artist Valeriy Korshunov, titled “Look into the Future,” came into view, depicting an outstretched hand holding an atom-like orb over a field of wild horses. Unveiled in 2019 to cheer up workers at the Chernobyl plant, the mural is meant to symbolize hope and renewal. So, too, was Kohut’s visit, in a way: before him, a stack of bright-yellow books, titled <em>The KGB Chernobyl Dossier: From Construction to Accident</em> were placed upon a folding table, and a small crowd of journalists gathered round.</p>



<p>The books contained hundreds of previously classified KGB documents about the nuclear power plant. They depicted how the Soviet security service participated in the construction, how it covered up small accidents at the plant, and how, when reactor Unit 4 exploded in April 1986, it moved to deny and mitigate the scale of the disaster. Kohut lowered his mask, grabbed a mic, and thanked the reporters for having made the journey into the exclusion zone. Because of his efforts, this archive was now being published for the first time, in print and online, for all the world to see. The first day that a portion of the Chernobyl documents were posted, 24,000 people visited the site to read them. Over seven thousand of these visitors read a<a href="http://avr.org.ua/viewDoc/24473/?fbclid=IwAR0SpK3bQ2iusoyToR23RlAXBimHqXjONopyBayd84bIbDaF5DQBZKst-dw"> single, secret, KGB report</a> on the causes of the accident — a first draft of exactly what went wrong with the reactor.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The initiative was undertaken on behalf of the electronic <a href="http://avr.org.ua/">archive of the Ukrainian Liberation Movement</a>, a project that Kohut and several collaborators launched in 2013, a few months before anti-government protests erupted in the streets of Kyiv. Then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yanukovych had reversed his predecessor’s policy of openness when it came to national archives, and Kohut and his team figured that creating a digital database of documents from the Soviet period would be a form of resistance. It was a way of explicitly linking the country’s tumultuous, uncertain present to its all-too-recent past.</p>



<p>By putting this history online, the archivists wanted not just Ukrainians but the entire international community to draw their own conclusions about how Soviet security services sought to censor, surveil, and repress citizens of the republics. During those years, friends, neighbors, colleagues, and relatives were encouraged to report on one another’s activities; professional and personal stability required strict allegiance to the Communist Party. These databases contain fragments of history that, when unearthed, have utterly transformed family and political narratives and shifted the terrain upon which conversations about memory, complicity, and justice are held.<strong> </strong>At the same time, the files provide concrete evidence against the prevailing myth about the Soviet government organs — that its agents knew, saw, and recorded everything. Sometimes the surprise is that the archives hold unexpected answers; sometimes it’s that they hold none at all. “The Chernobyl documents are just the tip of the iceberg,” Kohut says. “For us, it’s important that everyone can take a look and come to their own conclusions about the extent to which the methods used then are the same as those used today.”</p>



<p>All over Eastern Europe, not just in Kyiv and Lviv but also in Tallinn, Riga, Vilnius, <a href="http://sovlab.ge/en#documentSlider">Tbilisi</a>, and <a href="https://cechoslovacivgulagu.cz/en/index.html">Prague</a>, new and forthcoming digital databases of secret police documents are aiming to bring the past into view. The Soviet Union officially collapsed in 1991, granting these nations independence for the first time since before the ’50s. Yet the rituals and rules of the Soviet era continued to structure life there for decades to come; in some places, they still do. The recent push to put these repositories online marks a subtle but monumental shift. Previously, people had to visit archives in person in order to handle documents about themselves and their families, neighbors, and colleagues — and to see who was doing the surveillance and who was being surveilled (categories that were often one in the same). They had to travel, and they needed to know what they were looking for. Now, all they have to do is type the address into their browser and wait for the artifacts of their past to load. They don’t need to say who they are or why they need access.</p>

<p><strong>Each former Soviet</strong> country has a unique trove of information, some more extensive than others. In Tbilisi, Georgia, Irakli Khvadagiani and his team at <a href="http://sovlab.ge/en/about">SovLab</a> (short for Soviet Past Research Laboratory) have been collecting and scanning personal diaries, photographs, and testimonies from family archives. They are focusing on private documents because, while the nation’s archives are nominally public, there is a wall of bureaucracy that prevents citizens from accessing much of them. (Plus, most of what the public archives contain pertains only to the victims of Soviet rule — information about perpetrators and collaborators is much harder to find.) In Vilnius, Kristina Burinskaitė, senior specialist at the Genocide and Resistance Research Center of Lithuania, oversees the English-language site <a href="http://kgbdocuments.eu/">KGBdocuments.eu</a> and KGB Veikla Lietuvojet, which aims to help Lithuanians find documents about the experiences of their families and communities during the Soviet era, when hundreds of thousands were deported and repressed. There, new agent files are uploaded every month.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In January 2018, a long list of KGB agents was posted on the site that included the names (and aliases) of actor Donatas Banionis, star of Andrey Tarkovksy’s “Solaris”; the conductor Saulius Sondeckis; and the cardinal Vincentas Sladkevičius, all of whom are deceased. The very fact that they were mentioned was enough to suggest they may have been recruited by secret police, even though there were no details about what they might have done. A scandal ensued, and the named-men’s outraged families appealed to Lithuania’s prosecutor general to intervene.<strong> </strong>Five months later, Lithuania’s <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/04/09/what-is-lustration-and-is-it-a-good-idea-for-ukraine-to-adopt-it/">Lustration</a> Commission found that neither Banionis nor Sondeckis had collaborated with the KGB. It is the kind of ruling — a clean bill of historical health — that many descendants are now courting. And although such commissions are often operating with as little evidence as the public, their very existence speaks to the many valences of “collaboration,” and the ample possibilities for deception and misinterpretation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, the files offer a panoramic view of how Soviet rule impacted all tiers of society and continues to do so decades later. In 2015, Ostap Yednak was a newly elected member of the Ukrainian Parliament, part of a generation of former civil society leaders who joined the government after the revolution. He voted for the opening of the archives, without knowing what they would reveal of his own family history. “I never had the idea that I could have a personal relation to this matter,” he said, “but then I was speaking with my parents in the kitchen, and my father mentioned that, actually, my grandmother’s brother was arrested right before the German invasion and disappeared.” Yednak messaged Kohut’s archivists, and within a few weeks, he received a Google Drive folder containing almost a thousand pages on his great uncle’s fate.</p>



<p>He discovered that his great uncle was rounded up and interrogated with<a href="https://www.radiosvoboda.org/a/29745993.html"> his schoolmates,</a> accused of belonging to a Ukrainian partisan army. The boys were shot and buried in a mass grave. His grandmother hardly spoke a word of this to him — Yednak says she remained terrified of invoking the past and died without discovering the truth. Yednak, too, had grown up in the Soviet system, where he was taught a very selective story of the 20th century. Receiving the files from the archive changed that: “Suddenly, I figured out that I am part of another history, a hidden history. And I’m pretty sure that millions of Ukrainians still do not know this part of their history, because their families were too afraid to disclose this information to them.” He has been encouraging his friends and colleagues to look up their own relatives in the archives, though many Ukrainians still do not understand that the information is freely available. “We do a lot of explaining to people, to say that the archive really is open. They don’t believe it,” said Anna Oliinyk, acting director of the Center for Research on the [Ukrainian] Liberation Movement.</p>

<p>There are also many people who understand that the archives are open but have little desire to confront what they might hold. For the past 30 years, some who lived through the Soviet era have been trying to fill in the missing pieces in whatever way they can. Others hope that those pieces will remain missing for as long as they are alive. The dearth of information fueled conspiracy theories and rumors and prevented reform and lustration, ensuring that many of those who served in Soviet government posts were able to retain positions of power and political influence even after the Iron Curtain fell. In Georgia, where the very idea of fully carrying out lustration remains a potent political threat, Khvadagiani and his colleagues at SovLab are trying to do what they can by working around the state. “Everyone is afraid of showing the real picture of totalitarianism, when the majority was collaborating and part of the system,” he says. “Now everyone is trying to say that they were dissidents … that they were dreaming of a free Georgia and of democracy, but the reality is different.”</p>



<p>It’s hardly an accident that this mass unveiling is happening at this …</p></div></div>

<div><p>Welcome to Signals &amp; Threads, in-depth conversations about every layer of the tech stack, from Jane Street. I’m Ron Minsky.  </p><p>Today, I’m going to have a conversation with Andrey Mokhov about build systems. Build systems are an important but I think poorly understood and often unloved part of programming. Developers often end up with only a hazy understanding of what’s going on with their build system learning just enough to figure out what arcane invocation they need to get the damn thing working and then stop thinking about it at that point, and that’s a shame because build systems matter a lot to our experience as developers.  </p><p>A lot of what underlies a good developer experience really comes out of the build system that you use and also there’s a lot of beautiful ideas and structure inside of build systems. Sadly, a lot of that beauty is obscured by a complex thicket of messy systems of different kinds and a complicated ecosystem of different build systems for different purposes, and I’m hoping that Andrey can help us see through some of that thicket down to some of the elegance of all of this underneath.  </p><p>Andrey is a great person to have that conversation with because he’s had a long and interesting experience with build systems having done some work on <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/building/hadrian">Hadrian</a>, which is the build system for the <a href="https://www.haskell.org/ghc">Glasgow Haskell Compiler</a> and having written a few important papers that try and analyze and break down the ecosystem of build systems and help you understand kind of what’s going on fundamentally underneath, and finally, in the last few years, Andrey has been working here working on Jane Street build systems.  </p><p>So, thanks Andrey for joining me, and maybe to start with, you can start by explaining to us a little bit about what a build system is.</p></div>

<h2 id="140">1:40</h2>


<div><p>Hi, Ron. It’s great to be on the podcast. So what is a build system?  Build systems automate the execution of various tasks of individual developers like me and whole companies like Jane Street. So, as a software developer, what are the kind of tasks that I need to do every day? I need to compile and recompile source files. I need to run some tests. I need to keep my documentation up to date. There are lots of tasks like this.  </p><p>Every task is pretty simple and straightforward on its own, but there are a lot of them, and they are tedious and I need to remember to do them in the right order, so it’s great to have some automation that does it for me. In the old days, like, how would you do this without automation, you would just write a script, and the script was your build system. And that’s how I worked myself when I used to work on projects with just a few files. And it works perfectly fine in those settings.</p></div>

<h2 id="223">2:23</h2>


<p>Beyond just using simple scripts, what’s the next step up available to developers in terms of automation?</p>

<h2 id="227">2:27</h2>


<div><p>Well, before, I don’t know, 1976 when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">Make</a> was developed, there was nothing else and people were just writing scripts. And projects were getting bigger and bigger, it became difficult and at some point Make was developed to automate this. So Make was a huge breakthrough. It’s very simple. It allows you to write down the tasks that you need to execute and each task has some inputs and some outputs and the task itself, so what kind of command line you need to run to execute this task.  </p><p>And this very simple approach worked very well and it’s still being used these days. So these days I would say Make is still the most popular build system out there. If you go to a random open source project you will find a Makefile there.</p></div>

<h2 id="308">3:08</h2>


<p>Which on some level is kind of astonishing, just given how old Make is.</p>

<h2 id="311">3:11</h2>


<p>I’m amazed at how successful Make was and still is.</p>

<h2 id="314">3:14</h2>


<p>What was the thing that made Make such a big step forward?</p>

<h2 id="316">3:16</h2>


<p>Well, it was easy to use, right? You just write a few rules and the format for specifying those rules is pretty straightforward. It’s just a text file. And Make is available to you on pretty much any system. You type Make and it works. I guess it’s that kind of conceptual simplicity which attracted a lot of people to it, and of course also the pain that they had experienced before when they had to run all those tasks manually and they kept forgetting to run things in the right order. And I think this was one of the direct motivations of creating Make.</p>

<h2 id="345">3:45</h2>


<p>So, you talk about having a simple conceptual model, and what is that model on some level when you configure a job in Make, what you’re doing is specifying a collection of rules. Each rule says what you do, what’s the command you run to execute that rule, what it depends on and what it produces, and now Make has what is essentially a graph like model representing what are the things you need to do and what are the dependencies. Given that simple model, what are the services that Make now provides to you that you didn’t have before?</p>

<h2 id="412">4:12</h2>


<div><p>The main benefit of using Make compared to a script is that Make only reruns the tasks that need to be rerun. So how does it figure it out?  When you have like 1000 files in your project and you edit a single source file, if you run the script, it will basically recompile all 1000 files and then maybe relink some executables and rerun all the tests. And obviously that’s very wasteful. If you’ve only edited one file, only one file need to be recompiled.  </p><p>Make figures this out by just looking at timestamps. So, it just looks at the time of the file that you’ve just edited and it’s newer than the file that depends on it, so that files that depends on it needs to be recompiled and then its timestamp is updated, and so this wave of changes propagates through the build graph that you have and at the end for every task that you have in your description, you have the simple rule that everything that all the inputs of the task produced before the task, the outputs of the task have reproduced. This is before/after relationship is enforced everywhere in the build graph.</p></div>

<h2 id="511">5:11</h2>


<p>Right. Service number one that’s provided is incrementality. Small changes require small amounts of work in response to them.</p>

<h2 id="519">5:19</h2>


<p>That’s right. Yeah.</p>

<h2 id="520">5:20</h2>


<div><p>And this is important to developers kind of for obvious reasons, which is to say a key thing you want from your tools is responsiveness. You want to do something, see the results, think about whether that was the right thing to do and go back and make other changes, and so having tools that are responsive is enormously helpful. There’s a couple of the things that come to mind for me in terms of what Make helps out with. One of them is, it helps get the build right. One of the tricks with rebuilding your software is making sure that you’ve done all the things that you need to do. Like you could imagine that you changed a file and then you remember to rebuild that but you didn’t remember to rebuild everything that depended on it.  </p><p>And so having a simple language where you can express the dependencies and then once you get it right, you have a system that takes care of running things in the right order. There’s just a whole class of errors that you can make either in manual construction of a script or a manual kicking off of build tasks that just go away. I guess another thing is parallelism. There’s the incrementality of only having to do a small amount of work, but having this graph structured representation of the build also helps you kick off things in parallel.</p></div>

<h2 id="620">6:20</h2>


<p>Yeah. Absolutely. Like trying to maintain this parallelism by hand in a build script would be pretty annoying, right? You add a new file and suddenly you have a new dependency and need to rearrange the parallelism. Having some automation here is great as well.</p>

<h2 id="633">6:33</h2>


<p>Okay. This all sounds like a very short story. We had this problem, how to build things. A nice system like Make came out. It has a clean way of expressing dependencies and giving you some services off the back of that specification. All done, problem solved. What’s missing?  Why is the story of Make from 1976 not enough?</p>

<h2 id="651">6:51</h2>


<div><p>There are few things that are missing in Make. One of them as I mentioned, the way Make determines that a task needs to be rebuilt, is by looking at timestamps but very often this is too limiting. Let me give you a common example. You edit a source file by just adding a comment and as a result, you recompile that file and the result doesn’t change, but the timestamp does change anyway.  </p><p>It means that everything that depended on that file needs to be recompiled if you’re using Make. This is one of the problems that basically sometimes you want what we call “early cutoff” in build systems. If you recompile a file and the result is the same, you don’t want to recompile everything else that depends on it, so this is one feature that was missing.</p></div>

<h2 id="729">7:29</h2>


<p>Right. Essentially the problem is that the heuristic that Make uses for figuring out what needs to be redone is overly conservative, right? It will refire when it doesn’t strictly speaking need to refire.</p>

<h2 id="738">7:38</h2>


<p>That’s right. It’s overly conservative, at the same time I like it a lot because it basically just repurposes existing information. It’s just the information that is out there. The file system records modification times. Make itself doesn’t store anything at all, which is a very nice property to have. But if you want to support things like early cutoff you now need to start storing some information.</p>

<h2 id="757">7:57</h2>


<p>Right. I guess in addition Make’s timestamp-based recomputation is, as you say, overly conservative. It’s also under conservative, isn’t it?  I.e., it will fail to rebuild in some cases where it should.</p>

<h2 id="808">8:08</h2>


<p>Yeah and it’s fairly common for example, that various like backup software, for example, would mess up modification times, which would basically cause your project not to compile correctly and then you would have to go for the so-called “clean build” to just get around that limitation. Yes. Make’s reliance on timestamps is problematic.</p>

<h2 id="825">8:25</h2>


<p>Something goes wrong with Make, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>In our tumultuous</strong> present, mindfulness and meditation can seem like attractive ways to process difficult feelings and emotions. Meditative practices have long been a support strategy for traditional cultures facing collective trauma, and a method for bringing individuals and communities into mutual solidarity. Tibetan refugees, who have lived through cultural genocide, use meditation and ritual to join with their spiritual ancestors. In this way, they experience their own suffering as a doorway into compassion for others.</p>
<p>Tibetan culture, through its resilience, kindness, intelligence and joy, has inspired millions of people in the West to take up meditation. But are the practices that many of us turn to the same in substance as the rituals that other communities have relied upon for centuries? In most cases, the answer is no: they have a profoundly different orientation and, significantly, they lack the crucial communal features that make traditional meditation so vital and nurturing for the brain and body. In fact, modern meditation can often work against us â€“ reinforcing our separation from others, rather than strengthening the social bonds that are needed to overcome adversity and barriers to compassion.</p>
<p>The traditional and modern approaches to meditation are shaped by two distinct visions of the person. Those in traditional contemplative cultures typically understand persons to be constituted by their relationship to others, as the historian David McMahan <a href="https://oxford.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780195183276.001.0001/acprof-9780195183276">notes</a> in <em>The Making of Buddhist Modernism</em> (2008). As a consequence, practitioners first learn to experience themselves in meditation as empowered and supported by the care, compassion and wisdom of their spiritual ancestors and community. By contrast, citizens of the modern West often see persons as individual selves that exist prior to the community â€“ atomistic individuals who choose whether or not to enter into relationships.</p>
<p>These different conceptions of the person have important consequences for meditation. In the modern view, practitioners tend to think of meditation as an autonomous project of self-help: through their own efforts, they try to foster beneficial states of mind. Socially conditioned in this way, Westerners enter into â€˜lovingkindness meditationâ€™ (<em>metta</em>) as a way of summoning up a sense of love for themselves and those they feel close to; then, for those theyâ€™re neutral towards; and, finally, for people they dislike.</p>
<p>For traditional Buddhist communities, any such meditation wouldnâ€™t begin with an atomistic self who is trying to generate a positive mindset from scratch. In such cultures, practitioners begin meditation with rituals and prayers that remind them that they are part of a connected community, blessed and supported by a lineage of spiritual ancestors that spans many generations. This starting point is shared by contemplative and ritual forms of Buddhism, Christianity, Confucianism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism and many indigenous religions. In Tibetan Buddhism, for example, meditators envision a field of refuge that includes buddhas, bodhisattvas, spiritual teachers and other inspiring figures, who bless and sustain them and their world within qualities of unconditional love, compassion and wisdom. Practitionersâ€™ efforts to cultivate those same qualities begin not with self-help, but with the support and empowerment of their teachers and communities. In this way, the person meditating learns to become an extension of that field of love and compassion in which they are held, by progressively extending love and compassion to others.</p>
<p>Modern meditation and mindfulness, beginning with an atomistic sense of self, can reinforce an individualâ€™s sense of disconnection</p>
<p><strong>This kind of</strong> deeply supportive framework, found in all contemplative traditions, is mostly absent from modern meditation programmes. Because these communal dimensions of blessing and empowerment are embedded in premodern, ritualised cosmologies, they are often deemed an unneeded byproduct of â€˜primitive culturesâ€™, which can be jettisoned in order to â€˜moderniseâ€™ the practice. However, these cosmologies serve a valuable function that maps directly onto attachment theory, one of the most influential approaches to developmental and social psychology.</p>
<p>Attachment theory is based on the idea that the care that children receive in infancy stays with them through their lifespan â€“ for better or worse. Infants who receive sensitive and responsive care go on to develop a self that they feel is worthy of love. In turn, this supports their curiosity and courage to explore the world, because they trust that a source of security and support is available when needed. Sporadic or unreliable care, on the other hand, fosters insecurity and a distrust in support from others in times of need.</p>
<p>But the experience of security and insecurity is not locked in at infancy. Feelings of security and insecurity accrue throughout oneâ€™s life from relationships with peers, mentors, romantic partners and so on. This means that we all have traces of security and insecurity in different relational contexts. Through the lens of attachment theory, the ritual and devotional practices of traditional contemplative cultures, which are repeated many thousands of times throughout a personâ€™s life, offer a powerful field of care in which practitioners experience themselves as recipients of love, compassion and wisdom. From this secure base, they are empowered to extend sustainable, inclusive and unconditional care to others.</p>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective, humans come prepared with capacities for care and compassion. But without the experience of actually receiving care, people can develop inner psychological blocks to compassion â€“ including a lack of inner security, courage and confidence. Lack of security can foster aversion to othersâ€™ suffering, a sense of isolation and biases against others. These psychological barriers interact with and are reinforced by systemic inequities such as racism, classism, sexism and homophobia.</p>
<p>Modern meditation and mindfulness, by beginning with an atomistic sense of self, can increase an individualâ€™s sense of disconnection. They can present meditation as a passive source of comfort for the self, instead of a practice that uses discomfort to create solidarity with other sufferers. In her <a href="https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300215809/american-dharma">book</a> <em>American Dharma</em> (2019), the Buddhist scholar Ann Gleig documents how communally oriented meditation can help people to become conscious of socially conditioned traumas, to heal internalised racism, and to tolerate the discomfort that conversations about race and privilege can generate.</p>
<p>Traditional cultures of compassion training strive to dismantle barriers to compassion by bringing to mind a field of care in which practitioners are held and supported, and from which they can learn to hold and support others. This relational starting point promotes resilience and connectivity, and bolsters the psychological and social resources we need today to confront systemic injustice. But how might secular people in modern individualistic cultures gain access to such communal benefits?</p>
<p>By reinhabiting moments of supportive caring connection, we can establish a core of inner safety that can be returned to again and again</p>
<p><strong>Research findings in psychology</strong> show that feelings of security can be temporarily increased, including among people who have predominantly insecure attachment histories. Social psychologists developed a method called <em>attachment security priming</em>, in which participants are asked to visualise a moment of receiving care from a loving figure, a trusted friend, or simply by thinking of words such as â€˜loveâ€™, â€˜safetyâ€™ or â€˜careâ€™ for a moment. These simple priming <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16351370/">exercises</a> temporarily increase feelings of security, safety and courage. In turn, participants are more likely to offer help to others, have more patience listening to othersâ€™ difficult emotions, and possess less bias against other groups. This research suggests that attachment security priming could be integrated into meditation to recover the relational basis of the practice.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://mindrxiv.org/dmxj7/">article</a> forthcoming in the journal <em>Perspectives on Psychological Science</em>, we introduce a relational starting point of support for meditation, derived from traditional Tibetan practice, and informed by research on attachment security priming. There are various ways to engage a relational starting point for meditation, depending on oneâ€™s own life experience, background and worldview:</p><ul>
<li>You can recall a simple moment of supportive caring connection with another person, from any time in your life, and re-inhabit that caring moment as if itâ€™s happening now â€“ evoking a rich experience of loving qualities and energies in mind and body. For example, Paul can call to mind playing cards with his loving grandmother at her kitchen counter, and John can recall a moment visiting a joyfully welcoming aunt as a young child.</li>
<li>A second option is to bring to mind someone to whom you feel grateful for their impact on your life, and experience the uplifting quality of imagining that person as present with you now.</li>
<li>A third option, if you practise in any spiritual tradition, is to bring to mind a saint, divine figure or field of spiritual ancestors, with whom you feel a deep connection.</li>
<li>If none of those options resonate, you might recall a time you spent somewhere special to you in the natural world â€“ a place that felt deeply welcoming or peaceful. Or recall a loving moment with a pet. Or bring vividly to mind a moment when you were a loving presence to another person.</li>
</ul><p>According to <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/research-topics/78/embodied-and-grounded-cognition#overview">theories</a> of embodied cognition, when we recall any such caring moment, it is simulated and re-enacted in multiple systems of the brain and body, including perceptual, motor, visual and affective systems. During the caring moment practice, we can visualise and simulate a felt sense of security, by experiencing that moment as if it were happening now, along with …</p></div></div></div>

    <p>I don’t like how modern web applications are built. Many of the web applications
are too unstable, That you can’t imagine having the system running without a
team supporting it. The fact that we try to automate manual processes then the
automation needs manual intervention defies the purpose. Some companies has an
army of developers if they were to do the business by hand they would make a
better job than the programmed system. There are many reasons for this
situation. One of the reasons is the excessive use of third party dependencies.</p>

<p>Lets take a look on a basic modern web based system, There are several layers
on software running on the machine, starting from firmware to your business
logic.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_212438.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_212438.jpg"></p>

<p>I don’t think this is very helpful to understand the gravity of the situation.
There are many actors that are not considered in this picture. Layers are also
missing because they are implicit in other layers. Lets expand these hidden
layers and actors. It will help us understand better why that small Nodejs or
RubyOnRails application we wrote isn’t just one layer in this picture.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_214548.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_214548.jpg"></p>

<p>Here are the layers we added this time:</p>

<ul>
  <li>System core utilities</li>
  <li>Other processes your application depends on like “memcached, Redis, MySQL,
Postgres…etc”</li>
  <li>Third party code your application depends on an ORM, Template engine,
pagination library, a library that <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/">pads your string with
spaces</a> just
because.</li>
  <li>Server applications that sits in front of your code handling HTTP and response
compression…etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>For each of these layers there is <strong>at least</strong> one team responsible for
maintaining it.</p>

<p>Again, We missed other layers and people in this picture. Most of the
applications are using external SAAS providers for logs or monitoring or bug
reporting or provide parts of the system functionality that can take more time
to build by the company team. lets add them to the picture along with their
teams.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_221047.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_221047.jpg"></p>

<p>This picture is for one application, I won’t expand it to a whole system with
different services and programs that is the reality of all companies.
Lets stick to one application for the sake of simplicity.</p>

<p>So here is the first point I want to make: With every service you use you’re not
just a user, This service is now part of your application, You are held
responsible for it’s behavior and misbehaving. You will inherit bugs in their
system. When this service team is affected by COVID-19 and get reduced to the
point where they can’t fix issues you will be affected too. When They get slower
your application will get slower too. When their service is down your
application will experience malfunction too, Your system and theirs is now
connected. So add external services integration cautiously. By adding an
external system you’re putting your trust in this service team and their ability
in delivering what the service is promising now <strong>and</strong> in the future. This is not
an easy decision and it should be treated as such.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_224907.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_224907.jpg"></p>

<p>Now lets move to the direct dependencies of your application. If you’re using
any modern programming language it’ll have a way to package code into reusable
format that could be reused by other applications. one package can use code from
other packages, these packages can use other packages and so on like a tree.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.emadelsaid.com/images/IMG_20200915_231326.jpg" alt="IMG_20200915_231326.jpg"></p>

<p>With every package in this tree we depend on the code inside this package and
the team that maintains it. A freshly generated rails project depends on 74
packages for ruby and <code>Yarn list</code> that lists JavaScript dependencies output 3102
lines, that’s 3176 packages with teams maintaining them and bugs and new
versions all the time.</p>

<p>This is wrong for many reasons. I will list some of them here for the sake of
clarity.</p>

<ul>
  <li>You have put your trust in at least 3176 other developers. You have never met
them, never talked to them, there are no guarantee they will continue to
maintain this package. There are no guarantee they won’t put code in their
package to show <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/npm-bans-terminal-ads/">ads in your
terminal</a> or <a href="https://www.trendmicro.com/vinfo/dk/security/news/cybercrime-and-digital-threats/hacker-infects-node-js-package-to-steal-from-bitcoin-wallets">code that
steals your bitcoin wallets
</a>.</li>
  <li>You are not really using all of this code. When someone is writing an open
source package it will suffer sooner or later from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep">feature
creeping</a> You are probably using
couple features of this package and don’t need the rest, but you wanted the
banana and got the whole forest now.</li>
  <li>With every package update you’re inventing unnecessary work for yourself. New
versions of packages are released all the time. Updating your project to <strong>get
the latest bug fixes and features</strong> is usually what people do. Most of the
time because of feature creeping these versions changes are not relevant to
you at all, but you won’t know until you read the change log. If it’s relevant
to your project you’ll need to do an update. if something is deprecated or
changed you’ll need to change your code. So suddenly someone somewhere is
telling you to change your code. That’s part of the control you have over your
code handed over to someone you never talked to or knew.</li>
  <li>When your programming language has a new release you can’t update unless all of
your dependencies are up to date. For ruby 2.7.0 for example some language syntax is
now deprecated and shows warning when you run your project. So to fix that you
either fix it in the package and open a PR with the change or wait for the
maintainer to update it.</li>
  <li>When you encounter a bug in a dependency you will have to understand this
package code, fork, branch, fix rinse and repeat. That requires a some
cooperation from the library maintainer which is most of the time isn’t
possible because most of the open source projects are voluntarily maintained.</li>
  <li>Developing new features or modifying existing features are ordre of magnitude
harder. You’ll need to dig into the documentation of the dependencies looking
for support for this little feature you want to add. That is if there is any
documentation at all for that part of the code. Otherwise you’ll have to dig
in to the library code.</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the second point I want to make: Using external library implies that you
trust the maintainer and you also inherit his decisions about using other
libraries and so forth. This decision should be weighed based on the benefit of
the library and how many of it’s features you’re going to use and other factors
like the maturity and how responsive is the maintainer, please don’t use GitHub
stars as a factor in your decision it’s misleading. And if the part you use from
the library isn’t too big I recommend using the library to save some time and
effort upfront but make sure you get rid of it and implement the part you need.
An example of that is a pagination library like rails “Kaminari” if you’re using
it to save you some time then sure. But keep on your todo list a task to remove
it and implement the feature yourself. An example of libraries that’s hard to
get rid of it “OpenCV” This is something that reimplementing the part you need
probably will be a huge task so it can stay. You’ll need to use your best
judgment to decide between these 2 sides of the spectrum.</p>

<p>I like to think of what I do as building an automated system, I would like this
system to run by itself, keep itself clean and healthy, doesn’t need manual
intervention. If the whole team disappeared out of existence I would like that
system to work for a very long time without any supervision.</p>

<p>More code means more bugs for me to fix, by extension more code that I didn’t write
means more bugs that I probably can’t solve. This is dangerous and shouldn’t be
taken lightly. Extending your code with external libraries or systems can cut
down effort hence the cost of development. But when this is taken lightly it
backfires badly.</p>

        <p>
          Wish you had a way to share data with your friends in a frontend-only
          project?
        </p>

        <p>
          Turns out you can! You can place your data inside your URIs and then
          copy/paste them to your friends. It's that simple.
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is a quick proof of concept whipped up in 30 minutes to
          show you how to do it.
        </p>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Type data in the text box below.</li>
          <li>Click "Save".</li>
          <li>Copy + paste the URL to your friends.</li>
          <li>Your friends receive the same data that you saved earlier.</li>
        </ol>

        

        <h2>How to build your own</h2>
        <p>The recipe is super simple.</p>

        <h3>Function to save the data to the URL</h3>
        <p>
          In order to save data, all you have to do is use the following data.
          Your data will be saved to your URL, and you can copy/paste it to your
          friends.
        </p>
        <pre>          function save(json={}) {
            // step 1, serialize the JSON to a string.
            const dataToSave = JSON.stringify(json); // stringify the json
            const base64 = btoa(dataToSave);         // base64 encode the data, for aesthetic purposes
            const hash = encodeURIComponent(base64); // encode the string as a URI component

            // step 2, add the string to a param called 'data-hash'
            const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
            urlParams.set("data-hash", hash);
            window.location.search = urlParams;
          }
        </pre>
        <h3>Function to load the data from the URL</h3>
        <p>
          Loading the data back is even easier. You just read the URL params and
          decode the data.
        </p>
        <pre>          function load() {
            // get the data from the hash
            const urlParams = new URLSearchParams(window.location.search);
            const hash = urlParams.get("data-hash");

            // if there is no data, return empty object.
            if (!hash) {
              return {};
            }
            
            // else decode and return the object
            const jsonString = atob(decodeURIComponent(hash));
            return JSON.parse(jsonString);
          }
        </pre>

September 16, 2020 | https://www.architect.io/blog/why-distributed-apps-need-dependency-management | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.architect.io/blog/why-distributed-apps-need-dependency-management">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><img src="https://www.architect.io/images/blog/why-distributed-apps-need-dependency-management/dependency-mgmt@2x.png" alt="Dependency management"></p>
<p>Distributed cloud applications (aka microservices) have introduced an enormous
amount of complexity into the design and operation of cloud software. What used
to manifest itself as complexity hidden within a single process or runtime now
finds itself spread across tens or hundreds of loosely coupled services. While
all of these services can use different languages and can scale independently
from one another, the distributed nature can often make the app as a whole hard
to navigate, hard to deploy, and hard secure.</p>
<p>This new complexity makes it increasingly difficult to manage and contribute to
cloud-native applications, and beckons questions as to how we can maintain
healthy cloud software. How can we take advantage of the benefits of
service-oriented design without introducing friction and cost elsewhere?</p>
<p>Fortunately we've run into this problem before. Microservices aren't the first
pattern that has forced developers to figure out how to collaborate and
contribute to endless webs of interconnected components. For the last few
decades the solution has been the same: <strong>dependency management</strong>.</p>
<p>We use dependency managers every day to re-use public and private software
packages, build upon the work of others, and gracefully encapulate the details
of our own work into consumable formats. There are a number of reasons why
dependency management is the key to unlocking the power of distributed software,
and it's high time we learn from the past to power the future of cloud-native
development.</p>
<h2 id="1-developer-collaboration"><a href="#1-developer-collaboration" aria-label="1 developer collaboration permalink"></a>1. Developer collaboration</h2>
<p>One of the most important functions of dependency managers like
<a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a>, <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/">Pip</a>,
<a href="https://maven.apache.org/what-is-maven.html">Maven</a>, and others, is to broker
collaboration amongst developers. By providing a consistent packaging mechanic
that seamlessly enables code to be extended, dependency managers have enabled
otherwise unrelated teams to consume each other's work. While these tools can be
used within the walls of enterprises to enable teams to publish and collaborate
on their work, we've seen dependency managers used at a much grander scale to
broker collaboration within the open-source community. The consistency of the
tooling and width of adoption has enabled the creation of enormously powerful
and freely accessible libraries for all to use and continue to build upon.</p>
<p>While this level of collaboration has been realized within the communities for
individual languages (NPM for Javascript, Pip for Python, etc.), it has yet to
be fully realized within the cloud-native community. We fortunately have Docker
to create consistency in how cloud services are packaged, but containers don't
have enough information about the relationships between services to resolve and
extend dependencies. Adding proper dependency management to index and resolve
relationships to peer apps and services is critical if we want to realize for
microservices what others already do with libraries in individual languages.</p>
<h2 id="2-self-service-environments"><a href="#2-self-service-environments" aria-label="2 self service environments permalink"></a>2. Self-service environments</h2>
<p>The collaborative effects of dependency managers don't happen by magic. The main
reason consistent dependency resolvers are so powerful is because developers all
around the world are able to reproduce their effects using the same commands and
processes. Reproducibility is a key element of dependency managers. Without it,
no one would be able to download and operate libraries and packages created by
others without complex, custom bootstrapping logic – the creation of which would
be an enormous barrier to adoption and distribution.</p>
<p>Service-oriented applications are no different from language-specific libraries
in this regard. Our ability to extend the work of others is predicated on our
ability to run or otherwise access the services and applications we hope to make
calls to. Teams have been able to make due by operating centralized QA or
sandbox environments, but the inability to reproduce these environments creates
a new set of problems. Engineers can't operate their own development
environments, services that depend on others can't be easily shipped, developers
are forced to write their own scripts to run their app locally and remotely, and
every team needs to about production-grade tools, networking, and network
security. By leveraging a consistent, dependency management solution, teams need
only to assert the network dependencies for their services to give everyone in
the org a consistent way to spin up services in their stack along with its
dependencies – allowing everyone to operate their own environments.</p>
<h2 id="3-automation"><a href="#3-automation" aria-label="3 automation permalink"></a>3. Automation</h2>
<p>The self-service benefits of consistent dependency management doesn't just mean
that developers can operate their own environments. It also means that
environments can be provisioned and torn down through automation. The
consistency of a single command or process to resolve dependencies, enrich
networking, and automate security is the perfect recipe for integration into
CI/CD pipelines!</p>
<p>If every service can be run consistently (e.g. with container platforms) and is
aware of its own dependencies, new environments can be provisioned for each
merge request and changes can be seamlessly promoted into staging and production
when merged into relevant branches. This means that every team can achieve
scalable
<a href="https://thenewstack.io/what-is-gitops-and-why-it-might-be-the-next-big-thing-for-devops/">GitOps</a>
for every developer and every new service added to the application.</p>
<h2 id="4-security"><a href="#4-security" aria-label="4 security permalink"></a>4. Security</h2>
<p>One of the risks introduced by microservice architectures is the need for each
service to expose APIs that broker access to their functionality. Since these
services live as separate processes, communication over a network is one of the
only ways for them to connect to each other and receive requests for processing.
This means that each new service exposes an interface that can be accessed by
others, and if developers aren't careful they can accidentally expose it to the
wrong parties.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.architect.io/images/blog/why-distributed-apps-need-dependency-management/declare-data-breach.webp" alt="Cloud Security"></p>
<p>Preventing accidental exposure of network interfaces is yet another area where
dependency management can provide support. With developers providing a
structured index of their own service's network dependencies, not only can we
automatically resolve those dependencies, but we can also enrich the environment
with the corresponding network policies required to lock it down – only services
that depend on each other can access each other. This structured approach
drastically reduces the need for developers to understand network security
tooling, and opens them up to create new services more freely.</p>
<h2 id="5-flexibility"><a href="#5-flexibility" aria-label="5 flexibility permalink"></a>5. Flexibility</h2>
<p>Another benefit of dependency management with respect to microservices and
distributed applications is flexibility. With developers capturing the details
of their immediate dependencies and associating them with their own services,
the resolver itself is free to instrument the relationships in unique ways in
each environment that gets deployed. Want to try out a different API gateway or
service mesh? Want to instrument distributed tracing by capturing ingress and
egress traffic from each service? With automation that can hook into the
dependency resolver, operators are free to experiment with new tools and configs
without any code changes to existing services or distractions for developers.</p>
<h2 id="why-doesnt-it-already-exist"><a href="#why-doesnt-it-already-exist" aria-label="why doesnt it already exist permalink"></a>Why doesn't it already exist?</h2>
<p>Dependency resolution would be an enormously powerful tool solution to enable
developers to collaborate and contribute to cloud-native applications, but can't
we use the vast number of package managers that already exist to help with
instrumentation? While it would be nice to use existing tools, resolving
dependencies for networked applications isn't the same as resolving the
relationships between libraries and binaries.</p>
<p>The download of code artifacts that fulfill dependency requirements for
libraries all happens at build-time to create one master binary/library.
Microservices however don't get bundled into single binaries and instead need to
be run as independent services and then connected to over a network. This means
that the resolution strategy has additional steps, and happens at an entirely
different lifecycle stage than regular libraries. Turns out, the earliest point
in an application lifecycle that we can properly resolve dependencies for
distributed applications is at deploy-time. It is at this point that we know
both the relationships between all services in the stack as well as the tooling
and details of the target environment needed to properly provision and connect
services.</p>
<p>To sum it up, it's hard to create a large scale resolver for network
dependencies, but doing so would provide enormous benefits to engineering teams
and the cloud community as a whole. If we're to properly navigate the growing
landscape of cloud-native tools, we'll need to learn from dependency management
practices of the past.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/HubSpot%20Webinar_%20%20Kickstart%20Your%20ABM%20Campaign%20in%20Minutes,%20Not%20Months.jpg" alt="HubSpot Webinar_  Kickstart Your ABM Campaign in Minutes, Not Months"></p>
<p>Now, most information on the internet about ABM can be a little hand-wavy and abstract:</p>
<p><em>"Account-based marketing (ABM), also known as key account marketing, is a strategic approach to business marketing based on account awareness in which an organization considers and communicates with individual prospect or customer accounts as markets of one."</em></p>
<p>What the hell does this even mean?</p>
<p>I'm going to skip all the fluffy stuff, and get right down into tactics.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/HubSpot%20Webinar_%20ABM%20strategies%20that%20take%20minutes%20not%20months%20to%20win%20large%20B2B%20deals%20%20(4).jpg" alt="HubSpot Webinar_ ABM strategies that take minutes not months to win large B2B deals  (4)"></p>
<p>If you are looking for an explanation on what is ABM, what the benefits are, or why you should use ABM - this is not the article for you.</p>
<p>There are other resources on the internet that can explain it better than I ever can (or have the patience to).</p>
<p>This article is going to be a tactical sharing&nbsp;of our best performing ABM campaign, in Feb 2020.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/HubSpot%20Webinar_%20ABM%20strategies%20that%20take%20minutes%20not%20months%20to%20win%20large%20B2B%20deals%20%20(5).jpg" alt="HubSpot Webinar_ ABM strategies that take minutes not months to win large B2B deals  (5)"></p>
<p>We started off by selecting 67 accounts.</p>
<p>Which led to 21 demos, 16 sales accepted leads, and 7 closed-won deals for a total of $210K in revenue.</p>
<p>The total budget was $2,400 - most of which was spent on LinkedIn Ads, and a small portion for handwritten notes and gifts.</p>
<p>The campaign ran for 45 days in total.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/HubSpot%20Webinar_%20ABM%20strategies%20that%20take%20minutes%20not%20months%20to%20win%20large%20B2B%20deals%20.jpg" alt="HubSpot Webinar_ ABM strategies that take minutes not months to win large B2B deals "></p>
<p>We used a relatively simple technology stack:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>HubSpot as our marketing automation platform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Salesforce as our system of record</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Leadfeeder to track website visitors to accounts</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Figma to design our marketing collaterals</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LinkedIn Campaign Manager to run our LinkedIn Ads</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Saleswhale for pipeline acceleration</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All the above tools, with the exception of LinkedIn Campaign Manager (which you need to run ads), are optional. They can be replaced with a spreadsheet and manual human labor.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/HubSpot%20Webinar_%20ABM%20strategies%20that%20take%20minutes%20not%20months%20to%20win%20large%20B2B%20deals%20%20(1).jpg" alt="HubSpot Webinar_ ABM strategies that take minutes not months to win large B2B deals  (1)"></p>
<p>Here are the three things we learnt.</p>
<h2>Lesson one - It's all about account selection</h2>
<p>It's hard to understate the importance of selecting the right set of accounts to go after.</p>
<p>But where do you begin?</p>
<p>We started by analyzing our historical Salesforce data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Closed-won rates</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sales cycle times</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lifetime value (LTV) &amp; churn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Product adoption</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We teased out similarities between our best performing accounts, and clustered them.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we created a hypothesis, themes around pain points &amp; use cases - and validated our approach with the sales team.</p>
<p>It's important to keep the sales team closely involved in the account selection process, and allow them to recommend and contribute ideas / accounts for consideration.</p>
<p>However, I would NOT recommend giving Sales free rein to choose whatever accounts they want.</p>
<p>This is to prevent them from using your ABM campaign as a "wish-list" of accounts to go after. Which means that the hodgepodge of accounts they select may not fit into your tightly orchestrated ABM campaign.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For our ABM campaign, we decided to focus on accounts which:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Have at least 200 employees</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are in the B2B technology space</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a marketing automation platform (check with BuiltWith)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Salesforce</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has more than 3 quota-carrying sales reps (check against LinkedIn)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Generating more than 300 inbound leads per month (proximate - check for lead magnets / webinars on website + cross-reference against Alexa web traffic)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are doing at least one top-of-the-funnel webinar a month (check against website and company social)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are hiring actively for inside sales development reps (check against website careers page)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The more specific and tightly controlled your account list, the easier it is to create messaging and content that resonates with them.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/HubSpot%20Webinar_%20ABM%20strategies%20that%20take%20minutes%20not%20months%20to%20win%20large%20B2B%20deals%20%20(18).jpg" alt="HubSpot Webinar_ ABM strategies that take minutes not months to win large B2B deals  (18)"></p>
<h2>Lesson two - Segment, segment, segment</h2>
<p>Next, building out our buyer personas.</p>
<p>At Saleswhale, we adhere to the <strong>4-1</strong> rule.</p>
<p>The 4-1 rule stipulates each account should have at least 4 prospects we are going after at any point in time. And that 1 of the 4 prospects must be a decision maker with budget / purchasing power.</p>
<p>The 4-1 rule helps to build grassroots familiarity, and ensures an account is saturated with enough "air cover" during the 45 day campaign to influence key decision makers.</p>
<p>We segmented our buyers into 5 distinct personas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>P1 - Heads of Marketing / Growth / Demand Gen (decision makers with purchasing power)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P2 - Marketing / Growth / Demand Gen Managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P3 - Marketing / Sales Ops Managers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P4 - C-level decision makers (interestingly enough, they are not decision makers, but executive sponsors / influencers)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>P5 - Sales / SDR Directors</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We created tailored content for each persona - from ads, to collaterals, to email messaging - in a distinct track, which I'll cover later.</p>
<p>What do you do if you are unclear about your personas, or how to create tailored content for them?</p>
<p>Easy - call up your existing customers and talk to them.</p>
<p>At Saleswhale, we called up and spoke to 100 decision makers and end users of our platform.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>What were their top priorities?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are their biggest challenges?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What content do they consume?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are they trying to learn now?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We then mapped all of these learnings systematically into a spreadsheet:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png?width=2854&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-09-16 at 1.20.23 AM" width="2854" srcset="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png?width=1427&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png 1427w, https://blog.saleswhale.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png?width=2854&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png 2854w, https://blog.saleswhale.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png?width=4281&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png 4281w, https://blog.saleswhale.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png?width=5708&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png 5708w, https://blog.saleswhale.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png?width=7135&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png 7135w, https://blog.saleswhale.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png?width=8562&amp;name=Screen%20Shot%202020-09-16%20at%201.20.23%20AM.png 8562w" sizes="(max-width: 2854px) 100vw, 2854px"></p>
<p>The learnings from this spreadsheet helped us group together personas, and understand how to create content that would resonate with each segment.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/HubSpot%20Webinar_%20ABM%20strategies%20that%20take%20minutes%20not%20months%20to%20win%20large%20B2B%20deals%20%20(19).jpg" alt="HubSpot Webinar_ ABM strategies that take minutes not months to win large B2B deals  (19)"></p>
<h2>Lesson three - Design non-linear buyer journeys</h2>
<p>Next, we used <a href="https://business.linkedin.com/marketing-solutions/ad-targeting/matched-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn Matched Audiences</a> to make sure that we show our ads to only people working at the target accounts.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-14%20at%201.34.31%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-09-14 at 1.34.31 AM"></p>
<p>At this stage, the ads shown are mostly for top-of-the-funnel (TOFU) content, to educate customers about the problem space.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a TOFU ad which links to an article we wrote:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-14%20at%201.40.09%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-09-14 at 1.40.09 AM"></p>
<p>After a pre-determined amount of time (~2 weeks), we swapped out the TOFU content for middle-of-the-funnel (MOFU) content.</p>
<p>MOFU content is the bridge between the high-level problem space and the value our product provides.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a MOFU ad which points to an eBook we wrote:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-14%20at%201.44.51%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-09-14 at 1.44.51 AM"></p>
<p>The landing (squeeze) page for the eBook download:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/Screen%20Shot%202020-09-14%20at%201.45.41%20AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2020-09-14 at 1.45.41 AM"></p>
<p>We monitor accounts for engagement:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.saleswhale.com/hubfs/Untitled%20(3).png" alt="Untitled (3)"></p>
<p>When accounts hit a certain engagement threshold (or fail to do so, after a pre-set amount of time), we would dog-food our own product and use Saleswhale to do email outreach.</p>
<p>You can replace Saleswhale with human sales labor.</p>
<p>While it's tricky trying to convince your sales team to devote time on accelerating leads down the funnel (instead of spending time selling) - if you have a dedicated sales development (SDR) team, or you are willing to do this manually yourself, you can make this work.</p>
<p>Here's an example of a MOFU acceleration email conversation play that our AI assistant, Dolores, ran for a particular track:</p>

<p><strong>Some learnings around LinkedIn Ads: </strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>LinkedIn Sponsored Content works well - especially video ads, which work really well</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>LinkedIn Lead Gen Forms didn't work well for us - they were very expensive, and for some reason, the conversion rate to meetings was extremely low</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>What's the best form of video content?</strong></p>
<p>Forget those cheesy cartoon company introduction videos that you outsource for $300 on Fiverr.</p>
<p>Customer testimonial videos work the best. Here's how to produce these videos easily:</p>
<p><strong>What's a scrappy way to get customer testimonial videos?</strong></p>
<p>Get your best customers to shoot a raw, unedited 30 second video of themselves on their iPhone (raw and authentic works best, don't need to be over-polished), and talk about:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The problem they were facing before they used your product</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What made them want to search for a solution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How they came across your product</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How your product solved their problem</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Add captions, edit lightly, and upload it to LinkedIn. There you go.</p>
<p>Remember to send your customers some swag, or a token of appreciation for their efforts.</p>

<h2>Getting the deal across the finish line</h2>
<p>A two key tenets I believe in:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<p>The job of Marketing is to make the job of Sales easier</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Marketing should be <a href="https://blog.saleswhale.com/demand-generation-versus-lead-generation-how-not-understanding-the-difference-destroyed-our-teams-morale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">measured by revenue</a> (not leads, or MQLs)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The corollary to the above - if the leads/pipeline/opportunities you are creating for sales are not turning into revenue, then all your efforts on ABM are wasted.</p>
<p>A hurdle that your sales team have to overcome, especially today - is the finance department of their prospects.</p>
<p>So, what we actually did was to create this thing called a mutual value proposal template for the Sales team.</p>

					<p>Everyone that uses an external product or service on their website knows the "Powered by" label. At Freddy Feedback we decided to not display this label on our widget.</p>
<h2>Why not?</h2>
<p>We believe in the power of design and great user experience. In our opinion, displaying such a label degrades both of these.</p>
<p>Just look at how beautifully minimal this is for your users:</p>
<p><img src="https://freddyfeedback.com/blog-images/widget-5-stars.png">
</p>
<p>Also, and maybe this is just us, we never understood how you can charge customers hundreds of dollars a month and then show a label that only benefits your own company instead of your customer's user experience.</p>
<h2>But what about growth?</h2>
<p>We're in this for the long run, and we want to grow our business with some core principles that we believe in. As mentioned, two of those are great design and a delightful user experience. We rather do things right and grow slower.</p>
<h2>What if you're wrong?</h2>
<p>A crystal ball is on the roadmap, but we haven't figured out how to build it yet. If anyone has an API that would be appreciated!</p>
<p>Until then, there is a chance that we do another blog post where we explain that we changed course on this topic.</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-ca009e2cc3b721215b4d"><div><pre><code><a href="https://www.vesselproject.io/s/God-in-the-Loop.pdf" target="_blank">PDF VIEW</a></code></pre><div><p>My last article, “<a href="https://www.vesselproject.io/life-through-quantum-annealing" target="_blank">Life Through Quantum Annealing</a>” was an exploration of how a broad range of physical phenomena — and possibly the whole universe — can be mapped to a quantum computing process. But the article simply accepts <em>that</em> quantum annealing behaves as it does; it does not attempt to explain <em>why</em>. That answer lies somewhere within a “true” description of quantum mechanics, which is still an outstanding problem.</p><p>Despite the massive predictive success of quantum mechanics, physicists still can’t agree on how its math corresponds to reality. Any such proposal, called an “interpretation” of quantum mechanics, tends to straddle the line between physics and philosophy. There is no shortage of interpretations, and in the words of physicist David Mermin, “New interpretations appear every year. None ever disappear.” Am I going to throw one more on that pile? You bet.  </p><p>I’m not going to start from scratch though; I simply propose an ever-so-slight modification to an existing forerunner: the many-worlds interpretation, where other “worlds” or timelines exist in parallel to our own. My modification is this: the only worlds that <em>can </em>exist are those that exist within a causal loop. Stated another way: our universe, or any possible universe, must be a causal loop.  </p><p>I will introduce the relevant concepts and provide an argument for my proposal, but my goal is not to once-and-for-all prove this interpretation as true. Rather, my goal is to explore what happens if we accept the interpretation as true. If we start with the assumption that only causal loop universes can exist, then several interesting things follow — we find parallels to our own universe, and we might even find God.  </p></div><h3>Causality &amp; Quantum Interpretations</h3><div><p>Before talking about causal loops, let’s take a step back and talk about causality — perhaps the single most fundamental concept in all the sciences. It plays a starring role in the two most important theories in physics: general relativity and quantum mechanics. </p><p>General relativity, developed by Einstein, combines space, time, and gravity in a geometric description of spacetime. In spacetime, two observers might not agree on the space between two events or time between two events — but they <em>always </em>agree on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YycAzdtUIko" target="_blank">spacetime interval</a>, which corresponds to a causal relationship between two events. As such, causality is the only thing that is universally agreed on, making it the only proper description of objective reality. Another phenomenon predicted by general relativity is the cosmic speed limit — the speed of light — which is more appropriately understood as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msVuCEs8Ydo" target="_blank">speed of causality</a>, more fundamental than light alone. Here we see that spacetime and the speed of light are not inherently real; they are just useful ways of describing causality, the only objective reality. </p><p>But if general relativity is interesting because we can <em>only</em> agree on causality, then quantum mechanics is interesting because we <em>can’t</em> agree on causality.  </p><p>As I alluded to earlier, the full explanation of quantum mechanics is still a mystery, and that mystery has everything to do with causality — specifically how objective, causal reality relates to the wave function. The wave function of a quantum system is most easily understood as a probability distribution, where the probability of the system being in any given state is calculated when you square the amplitude of the wave function for that state. The wave function is in a “superposition” of all possible states until it is measured, after which we observe a single state. </p></div></div></div><div data-aspect-ratio="63.013698630136986" data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599779020325_5819"><div>

(Image by Louay Fatoohi)</p><div><p>On the surface, it appears that quantum physics is inherently random if it can only be described by probability, and somehow the act of measuring or observing the system causes it to assume an objective state. If you’re convinced of this, then you basically agree with the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, which posits an interaction between the system and observer that causes the wave function to randomly “collapse.” This has been the standard interpretation for a long time, although others interpretations have been consistently gaining steam. </p><p>As an alternative, maybe you don’t think the universe is random at all — it’s deterministic, but there are “hidden” variables we don’t yet know about. In this case, there is no wave function collapse, so we don’t need to introduce any extra physics to explain what happens when we observe the system. If you’re on board with that, then you just signed up for the de Broglie-Bohm theory, also known as the pilot wave theory. </p><p>But maybe you’re still not quite convinced. Let’s make things even simpler: the universe isn’t random, but there aren’t hidden variables either. You have the wave function, and that’s it — what you see is what you get. That, it turns out, pretty much sums up the many-worlds interpretation. In this theory, all possible “worlds” described by the wave function do exist; we just happen to occupy one of them. While it requires the least explanation, the bizarre implication is that many parallel worlds exist as branches of different possible outcomes. </p><p>These three interpretations tend to be the top contenders, and they each take a different approach to answer the question of “what causes what?” The fact that a basic causal structure of physics cannot gain consensus makes this interesting territory, plus it has far-reaching implications. A proper explanation doesn’t just account for the non-locality of entanglement or the apparent uncertainty of superposition — it explains how humans fit into reality. </p><p>As observers, do we cause the wave function to collapse? That would certainly seem to elevate the role of consciousness in the causal nature of reality (which has not gone unnoticed by experts and cranks alike). Or is the wave function itself the only causal, objective reality? If so, that's one more reason to believe we’re at the mercy of a universe that’s indifferent to our existence. </p><p>The third interpretation is the one I want to revisit later in this article: the many-worlds interpretation. Keep it in mind. While it appears to threaten our sense of importance and potentially free will, it's not so bad if we just add a twist — or better yet, a loop. </p></div><h3>Causal Loops</h3><div><p>It may be fairly self-explanatory, but I’ll nonetheless define a causal loop as follows: a closed causal chain of events, where each event is the effect of another event on the chain. A simple example is a loop of three distinct events where Event A causes Event B, which causes Event C, which in turn causes Event A — each event is causally connected to another on the loop, and there is no “first” event. If you start at any one event, the sequence that follows inevitably leads back to the same event as if it caused itself. </p><p>Causal loops sound absurd, but their possibility has been successfully defended, particularly by philosopher Richard Hanley in his paper, “<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:SYNT.0000035847.28833.4f" target="_blank">No End in Sight: Causal Loops in Philosophy, Physics, and Fiction</a>” (and any mention of Hanley moving forward is in reference to this paper). Hanley points out that causal loops are not logically inconsistent nor physically impossible — at worst, they simply require grand coincidences. Causal loops as a whole aren’t created, they simply exist, and any strangeness about this is merely apparent — they’re in no worse a position concerning the question of why anything exists. Interestingly, Hanley also mentions that the idea of a causal loop universe is taken very seriously in cosmology, and that causal loops are actually more likely to occur in a universe like ours which hosts intelligent agents. </p><p>Let’s unpack that a bit. If intelligent agents discover their universe is indeed a giant causal loop, they may have incentive to maintain the loop they inhabit by causing the very events that lead to their own existence. Furthermore, they can intentionally make events happen that would otherwise require coincidence. But there is nothing coincidental or mysterious about an intentional action; we intentionally do things every day. Hanley notes, “the existence of agency may be the very thing that permits causal loops to obtain.” </p><p>This is where I’ll take it one step further than Hanley: not only are causal loop universes possible, but all possible universes must be causal loops. As I mentioned earlier, I’m going to run with this as an assumption, but I’ll still attempt to provide some reasoning. </p><p>That reasoning boils down to two propositions: the first is that all events must have causes; the second is that only in closed causal chains do all events have causes. We saw that in a causal loop all events have definitive causes — other events on the loop. There is no issue. But in an open causal chain (imagine a straight line), one more event is always required to explain causation. We’re left with a case of infinite regress, which isn’t inherently problematic, but its “openness” implies there must be an event without a cause, which is impossible. Furthermore, any series of causes and effects cannot, by definition, be considered as part of separate causal systems. If we define a universe to be a causal system, then it follows that all universes must also be causal loops, including our universe. </p><p>Using a causal-loop-only starting point, we can dive into some pretty interesting things.</p></div><h3>Different Paths: Curved Spacetime &amp; Clever Demons  </h3></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></article></div></div>

<p><strong>Update 2020-09-17:</strong> Huawei <a href="https://www.huawei.com/en/psirt/security-notices/2020/huawei-sn-20200917-01-hisilicon-en">issued a statement</a> saying that none of the vulnerabilities have been introduced by HiSilicon chips and SDK packages. I will update this article as more information comes in.</p>

<hr>

<p>This article discloses critical vulnerabilities in IPTV/H.264/H.265 video encoders based on HiSilicon hi3520d hardware. The vulnerabilities exist in the application software running on these devices. All vulnerabilities are exploitable remotely and can lead to sensitive information exposure, denial of service, and remote code execution resulting in full takeover of the device. With multiple vendors affected, and no complete fixes at the time of the publication, these encoders should only be used on fully trusted networks behind firewalls. I hope that my detailed write-up serves as a guide for more security research in the IoT world.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/id/896979">CERT/CC vulnerability note VU#896979</a></p>

<p>During my research I had physical access to several devices from the following vendors: <a href="http://szuray.com/">URayTech</a>, <a href="https://jtechdigital.com/product/jtech-ench4-0220/">J-Tech Digital</a>, and <a href="https://www.provideoinstruments.com/iptv-encoders">Pro Video Instruments</a>. I performed my research initially on URayTech, then confirmed vulnerabilities in the other two vendors.</p>

<p>There is at least a dozen of different vendors that manufacture and sell very similar devices. By analyzing product documentation and firmware update packages, I’ve got a high level of confidence those devices were also affected by most, if not all, vulnerabilities listed here. Here is an [incomplete] list of these additional vendors: <a href="http://www.networktechinc.com/h264-hdmi-encoder.html"><em>Network Technologies Incorporated (NTI)</em></a>, <a href="https://www.oupree.com/IP-Video-Encoder-Decoder/"><em>Oupree</em></a>, <a href="http://www.szmine.com/Video_Encoder/"><em>MINE Technology</em></a>, <a href="https://www.blankom.de/products/irenis-ip-encoder-streamer/"><em>Blankom</em></a>, <a href="https://www.iseevy.com/product-category/video-encoder/"><em>ISEEVY</em></a>, <a href="https://www.orivision.com.cn/c/h264-hdmi-encoder_0017"><em>Orivision</em></a>, <a href="https://www.procoderhd.com/">WorldKast/procoder</a>, <a href="http://www.digicast.cn/en/product.asp?pType=222">Digicast</a></p>

<p>It is my understanding that most of these devices are intended to be used behind NAT/firewall. However, I was able to utilize <a href="http://shodan.io/">shodan.io</a> to identify several hundred devices on the public internet, all likely to be exploitable by an anonymous remote attacker.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Hardware video encoders are used for video streaming over IP networks. They convert raw video signals (such as analog, SDI, HDMI) to H.264 or H.265 streams and send them to a video distribution network (YouTube, Twitch, Facebook,…) or let the users watch the video directly via RTSP, HLS, etc. Normally, these encoders have a web interface to allow the administrator to configure networking, encoding parameters, streaming options, and so on. Many such devices on the market today are based on <a href="http://www.hisilicon.com/en/">HiSilicon</a> (a Huawei brand) hi3520d ARM SoC running a special Linux distribution called HiLinux, with a set of user-space utilities and a custom web application on top.</p>

<p>Security research on HiSilicon devices has been done in the past. Here are some existing publications:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://habr.com/ru/post/173501/">Root shell in IP cameras</a> (in Russian) by Vladislav Yarmak, 2013. The research uncovered the root password allowing root shell access over telnet.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/tothi/pwn-hisilicon-dvr">HiSilicon DVR hack</a> by Istvan Toth, 2017. This research targeted DVR/NVR devices, and uncovered a root shell access with elevated privileges, a backdoor password, a file disclosure via path traversal, and an exploitable buffer overflow.</li>
  <li><a href="https://habr.com/en/post/486856/">Full disclosure: 0day vulnerability (backdoor) in firmware for Xiaongmai-based DVRs, NVRs and IP cameras</a> by Vladislav Yarmak. This research uncovered a very interesting “port knocking” backdoor allowing a remote attacker to start the telnet, and then log in with one of the several known passwords.</li>
</ul>

<p>While the streaming video encoders may share the same hardware architecture and the underlying Linux system with the above devices, my research targets the <strong>admin web application specific to the video encoders</strong> and does not overlap with the prior work.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>Here is a few pictures of one of the devices I had an opportunity to test.

Let’s plug this thing in, connect to network, and start exploring!</p>

<h2 id="network-recon">Network recon</h2>

<p>A simple <code>nmap</code> scan reports the following open ports:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ nmap -p 1-65535 encoder
...
PORT     STATE SERVICE
23/tcp   open  telnet
80/tcp   open  http
554/tcp  open  rtsp
1935/tcp open  rtmp
5150/tcp open  atmp
8086/tcp open  d-s-n
8554/tcp open  rtsp-alt
9588/tcp open  unknown
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="23---telnet">23 - telnet</h3>

<p>Telnet displays the login prompt, but the password is unknown at this point:</p>



<h3 id="80-8086---web-application">80, 8086 - web application</h3>

<p>Both ports serve the main admin web interface. The default credentials are <strong>admin/admin</strong>
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/110-login.png" alt="login"></p>

<p>The login prompt suggests basic HTTP authentication, but this is actually <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digest_access_authentication">digest authentication</a>. The following header is returned by the application:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>WWW-Authenticate: Digest qop="auth", ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the browser authenticates with:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Authorization: Digest username="admin", ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(as I will demonstrate below, digest is not the only authentication method supported by the application)</p>

<p>After logging in, the user sees a simple web interface.
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/120-status.png" alt="status"></p>

<p>Note that vendors customize the interface, and your device can display something completely different, such as:
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/130-status.png" alt="status">However, the underlying functionality (the web API calls) are all the same regardless of the UI.</p>

<p>There are several sections where the administrator can perform various tasks such as setting up the network, adjusting encoder parameters, uploading images to overlay the video, upgrading the firmware, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="554-8554---rtsp">554, 8554 - RTSP</h3>

<p>RTSP stands for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_Time_Streaming_Protocol">Real Time Streaming Protocol</a>. If it’s enabled, one can watch the video stream directly from the encoder.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ curl -i rtsp://encoder:554
RTSP/1.0 200 OK
CSeq: 1
Server: Server Version 9.0.6
Public: OPTIONS, DESCRIBE, PLAY, SETUP, SET_PARAMETER, GET_PARAMETER, TEARDOWN
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="1935---rtmp">1935 - RTMP</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-Time_Messaging_Protocol">Real Time Messaging Protocol</a>, another way to deliver video</p>

<h3 id="5150---serial-to-tcp">5150 - serial to TCP</h3>

<p>Mysterious service. <code>netcat</code> connects but the server does not seem to react to any input</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ nc -v encoder 5150
Connection to encoder 5150 port [tcp/*] succeeded!
foo
bar
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This initially puzzled me, but when playing with devices from other vendors I noticed that some firmwares allowed control over this port:
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/140-serial.png" alt="serial"></p>

<h3 id="9588---another-web-server">9588 - another web server</h3>

<p>This one is <code>nginx</code>, but not exactly clear what it is for.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ curl -i http://encoder:9588

Server: nginx/1.6.0

...
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="firmware-analysis">Firmware analysis</h2>

<p>Clicking around the web interface, I noticed the backup feature:
<img src="https://kojenov.com/assets/2020-09-15-encoders/150-backup.png" alt="backup">
I immediately went ahead and backed up (i.e. downloaded) both the firmware and the configuration.</p>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>

<p>The firmware backup is a RAR archive that can be easily unpacked:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>$ file up.rar
up.rar: RAR archive data, v4, os: Win32

$ mkdir up
$ cd up
$ unrar ../up.rar
...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here is the directory structure:</p>

  <p><em>(Dated: Sep 15 2020)</em></p>
<p>Synthetic geometry lies at the intersection of human <em>intuition</em>—insights arising from our core knowledge priors of shape, symmetry, distance, and motion—and <em>formal proof</em>: for two millenia, the treatment of geometry in Euclid’s <em>Elements</em> has exemplified the axiomatic method in mathematics.</p>
<p>While not actively researched in contemporary mathematics, synthetic geometry survives today in the form of <em>olympiad geometry</em> problems posed in contests like the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). While in principle reducible to the axiomatics of Euclid, olympiad geometry in practice is situated on its own foundations and a body of assumed knowledge which goes far beyond the axioms in the <em>Elements</em>: reduction to real/complex/barycentric coordinates, algebraic methods <em>a la</em> Gröbner bases, and passage to projective or inversive geometry, to name a few tricks. Modulo this assumed knowledge, proofs in olympiad geometry remain elementary and relatively short. However, they often require creative insights on when to apply techniques that can transform the search space—a single well-chosen auxiliary point or a clever inversion can cut a path through an otherwise intractably thorny problem.</p>
<p>As such, synthetic geometry poses an enticing challenge for artificially intelligent theorem proving. On one hand, the insight required for well-chosen auxiliary points and transformations, and the ability to finish a proof given such insights, are miniaturizations of the problems of <em>goal-conditioned term synthesis</em> (given a theorem to prove, what intermediate definitions or lemmas will lead to a proof?)—and <em>tactic selection</em>. On the other hand, geometry is remarkably accessible: anyone can draw a diagram to gain intuition about a problem, or perturb diagrams to quickly discover new problems. Put another way, geometry distinguishes itself by the ease with which humans can synthesize and manipulate models to guide reasoning, motivate constructions, and discover interesting facts. Moreover, we can be fairly confident in a conjecture \(\phi \to \psi\) if we have sample merely a few dozen diagrams satisfying \(\phi\) as pathologically as possible and find that in all of them, \(\psi\) also holds. Since it turns out to be <a href="#diagram-synthesis-with-tensorflow">easy to automatically synthesize high-quality diagrams</a>, this means that in geometry, it might be feasible to trade compute for a curriculum—definitely not something we can say for e.g. arithmetic geometry (it took a team of mathematicians <a href="https://leanprover-community.github.io/lean-perfectoid-spaces/">months</a> to formally construct a single perfectoid space in Lean) or elementary number theory, whose logic is somehow less tame than geometry’s, and where it is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermat%27s%5FLast%5FTheorem">really easy to conjecture really hard problems</a> (and where <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/514/conjectures-that-have-been-disproved-with-extremely-large-counterexamples">counterexamples to conjectures</a> can show up after billions of positive examples.)</p>
<p>I spent the summer working on geometry solvers for the <a href="https://imo-grand-challenge.github.io/">IMO Grand Challenge</a> with Dan Selsam at Microsoft Research. A superhuman olympiad geometry solver will only be 1/4th of a solution to the IMO Grand Challenge, but we expect the techniques developed here to accelerate the development of solvers for the other problem domains. What follows is a (not-so-brief) field report of what we’ve tried and learned so far.</p>
<h2 id="the-agony-and-the-ecstasy-of-forwards-vs-backwards-reasoning">The agony and the ecstasy of forwards vs backwards reasoning</h2>
<p>One of the fundamental dichotomies of automated reasoning—and a source of many tough design decisions—is between <em>forwards</em> and <em>backwards</em> reasoning. Should one derive consequences of facts already known, or work backwards from the goal to narrow the search space before proceeding? Put another way, should one build the proof tree from the leaves up (forwards) or from the root down (backwards)? Either approach has drawbacks: forwards reasoning can produce many unpromising intermediate lemmas, leading to problems of memory complexity; conversely, backwards reasoning can explore many unpromising branches of the search tree, leading to problems of time complexity.</p>
<p>The best results seem to arise from combining both. Humans, for example, rarely use pure forwards or backwards reasoning alone. In practice, we rely on instinctual heuristics for when to forward-chain into promising parts of the search space and when to expand the backwards search tree (i.e., accumulating a table of lemmas that we know can finish the proof as soon as we supply their preconditions). Sometimes our intuition tells us it’s a good idea to just unwind definitions and follow our nose, and other times we’ll somehow know we’re in a bad part of the search space and should reorient with another technique.</p>
<p>SAT solving is a great example. One can think of the DPLL algorithm for SAT as performing a backwards search for a resolution proof tree rooted at the empty clause. (If the first variable selected is \(x\), then this is a promise that the final resolution yielding the empty clause \(\varepsilon\) is that of the unit clauses \((x)\) and \((\neg x)\).) Unlike first-order logic, this resolution proof search is guaranteed to terminate, but the runtime can easily blow up if we do not prune (for example, suppose we disable unit propagation). Now consider the extension of DPLL to CDCL. A learned clause \(C\) produced by conflict analysis of a candidate assignment \(\mathcal{F}|_{\alpha}\) can be proved from \(\mathcal{F}\). In terms of the resolution proof, every time we close a branch of the backwards search from \(\varepsilon\), we also perform a bit of forwards reasoning, accumulating a proof forest starting at the leaves which lets us close future branches of the backwards search more quickly. In practice, CDCL vastly reduces the time complexity of DPLL. This comes at the cost of intricate heuristics (clause activity scores, glue levels…) for managing the memory complexity of the accumulated lemmas. Nevertheless, this is a paradigmatic example of how forwards and backwards reasoning can be synthesized to great effect.</p>
<p>Tabled resolution in logic programming is another example. Backward chaining with Horn clauses (e.g. Prolog) is the prototypical backwards reasoning algorithm. Naïvely implemented, it also illustrates the pitfalls of pure backwards reasoning. Without storing information of what we have already proved in a global state which persists across different branches of the search (in this case a table for memoization; in the case of CDCL, a clause database), the search thrashes and blows up; in the case of Prolog (or systems that use vanilla SLD resolution, like Lean 3’s typeclass system) it can even loop. <em>Tabling</em> maintains a search forest instead of a single backtracking search tree. This can be viewed as incorporating forwards reasoning (goal propagation and scheduling) into a purely backwards algorithm: failed search trees from earlier in the search are suspended instead of discarded, and can be resumed if their dependencies are discovered and propagated from another part of the search later on.</p>
<h2 id="searcht-a-monad-transformer-for-generic-backwards-search"><code>SearchT</code>: a monad transformer for generic backwards search</h2>
<p>One of the tools we developed this summer is a monad transformer for generic backwards search, called <code>SearchT</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="haskell"><span>data</span> <span>SearchT</span> cp c m a <span>=</span> <span>SearchT</span> (m (<span>Status</span> cp c m a))

<span>data</span> <span>Status</span> cp c m a <span>=</span>
    <span>Fail</span>
  <span>|</span> <span>Done</span> a
  <span>|</span> <span>ChoicePoint</span> (<span>Decision</span> cp c m a)

<span>data</span> <span>Decision</span> cp c m a <span>=</span> <span>Decision</span> { choicePoint <span>::</span> cp, choices     <span>::</span> [(c, <span>SearchT</span> cp c m a)] }
</code></pre></div><p>A value of type <code>SearchT cp c m a</code> represents a search for a value of type <code>m a</code>. When executed, a <code>SearchT</code> program either fails, succeeds with a desired (monadic) value of type <code>a</code>. or returns a <em>choice point</em>, which wraps a list of continuations representing possible branches of the search with features of type <code>cp</code> and <code>c</code> to be consumed by heuristics. The value returned by the search is completely general; <code>a</code> could even be a <code>SearchT</code> program itself, so that the whole thing is metasearch over search programs. Unlike <code>ListT</code>, which can also be thought of as encoding a search, the continuations in <code>SearchT</code> are explicit and the search must be run explicitly. The benefit of running the search ourselves is that now it doesn’t have to be depth first (as in <code>ListT</code>) and we can manage the continuations in whatever container (stack, queue, priority queue…) we like. In between processing branches of the search, we can also process the arbitrary features returned by the choice points as input to branching heuristics. For example, at a high level, the breadth-first search in the outer loop of <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/holist/home">DeepHOL</a>, where possible choices of tactic applications are re-ordered according a policy network, can be encoded this way.</p>
<p>Global state which persists across different branches of the search can be maintained in the inner monad <code>m</code>. For example, <code>m</code> could be a <code>StateT ProofForest IO</code>, and a <code>SearchT</code> program could search for terms which unify with the left hand side of a forward chaining rule, apply the rule, and store the result in the global state. In this way, we can implement forward reasoning. Conversely, local state (like a partial proof tree, say, or a cache of local assumptions) that is destroyed upon backtracking can be maintained in an outer state monad, e.g. <code>StateT TacticState (SearchT m cp c a)</code>.</p>
<p>We had several uses for the <code>SearchT</code> abstraction—notably, in our ARC solver (which I will describe next), and for mining constructions and conjectures from geometry diagrams.</p>
<h2 id="warm-up-the-abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge--arc">Warm-up: The Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge (ARC)</h2>
<p>The first thing I worked on was a solver for Kaggle’s <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/abstraction-and-reasoning-challenge">Abstraction and Reasoning Challenge</a>. The task was to build a solver that could pass what was essentially a battery of psychometric intelligence tests (see Francois Chollet’s <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.01547">preprint</a> for more motivation). Here’s a typical task:</p>

</div>
<p><img src="https://jesse-michael-han.github.io/img/arc-example-1.png" width="100%">
</p>
<p>This is an unforgiving few-shot learning problem: there are only a handful of training examples per task, and the answers for the test inputs, including the exact grid dimensions, have to be an exact match.</p>
<p>Our solver was structured around <code>SearchT</code> and performed primarily backwards search, with lightweight caching in a global state. We essentially stored the problem statement and some local …</p></div></div>

It provides another wonderful example of where compounds in nature can be used to treat human diseases”, he said.</p><p>Dr Duffy also tested to see if melittin could be used with existing chemotherapy drugs as it forms&nbsp;pores, or holes,&nbsp;in&nbsp;breast&nbsp;cancer cell&nbsp;membranes, potentially enabling the entry of other treatments into the cancer cell to enhance cell&nbsp;death.</p><p>“We found&nbsp;that&nbsp;melittin can be used with small molecules&nbsp;or&nbsp;chemotherapies,&nbsp;such as docetaxel,&nbsp;to treat&nbsp;highly-aggressive types of breast cancer.&nbsp;The combination of melittin and docetaxel was&nbsp;extremely efficient&nbsp;in reducing tumour growth in mice.”</p><p>Dr Duffy’s research was conducted as part of her PhD undertaken at Perth’s Harry Perkins Institute of Medical Research at the Cancer Epigenetics laboratory overseen by A/Prof. Pilar Blancafort.</p><p>“I began with collecting Perth honeybee venom.&nbsp;Perth bees are&nbsp;some of&nbsp;the healthiest&nbsp;in the world.</p><p>“The bees were put to sleep with carbon dioxide and&nbsp;kept on&nbsp;ice before the&nbsp;venom&nbsp;barb was pulled out from the&nbsp;abdomen&nbsp;of the bee and the venom extracted by&nbsp;careful dissection,” she said.</p><p>While there are 20,000 species of bees, Dr Duffy&nbsp;wanted to compare the effects of Perth honeybee venom to other honeybee populations in Ireland and England, as well as to the venom of bumblebees.</p><p>“I found that the European honeybee in Australia, Ireland and England produced almost identical effects&nbsp;in breast cancer compared to normal cells.

People want to make it complicated.</p>
<p>My brain isn’t that smart – I need to dumb things down. And it ends up, dumbing things down can usually elevate your chances of success. </p>
<p>When I consider a project, I like to compare it to a washing machine.</p>
<p>Washing machines do <span>one thing</span>. </p>
<p>Set a cycle, mash a button, and the receptacle goes to work.</p>
<p>It doesn’t dry clothes. It doesn’t fold clothes. It doesn’t warn you when you throw a red shirt in with all your whites.</p>
<p>It just washes.</p>
<p>Here in the United States, consumers purchase one metal box to clean, plus one metal box to dry. You’d think we’d have combined them by now, like Europe has, but no – – separate. And we sorta prefer it that way.</p>
<p>I admire that simplicity. Simplicity can be an unfair advantage, if you think about it.</p>
<p>One of my projects involves <a href="https://www.deepsouthventures.com/i-sell-onions-on-the-internet/">selling sweet Vidalia onions</a>. A lot of my customers ask: “What else does your farm sell online, Peter?”</p>
<p>My answer: “Nothing, just onions.”</p>
<p>At the beginning of that project, my monkey brain kept insisting we expand into other categories.</p>
<p><strong><em>“SELL <span>&nbsp;GEORGIA PEACHES!&nbsp;</span>“</em></strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; it’d say. </p>
<p><strong><em>“OH OH! <span>&nbsp;GEORGIA PECANS!&nbsp;</span>“</em></strong></p>
<p>I allowed it to chirp over the course of two shipping seasons, but by the third, I’d duct taped its mouth.</p>
<p><em>Where my internal monologue wound up, was here</em>: Why downshift into another category when our primary continues to grow 25%-50% every year? Why water down my attention when our principal has clearly struck a nerve? And hell, we’re still tweaking logistics, customer support, quality control, etal on Vidalia anyway. It’s nowhere near perfected.</p>
<p>Growth for growth’s sake doesn’t make sense to me. We’re not Amazon. We don’t want to be Amazon. We’re privately owned &amp; family operated – we don’t have to listen to that diatribe.</p>
<p><em><strong>What does make sense</strong> is controlled growth</em>, with a strong connection to our product &amp; customers. Correction, an <em><strong>intense</strong></em> connection with our product &amp; customers.</p>

It doesn’t have to be any fancier than that.</p>
<p>Drop a penny in a gumball machine, slide the lever, and a gumball rolls out.</p>
<p>Happy customer. Problem solved.</p>

That's why I was so thrilled that <a href="https://github.com/enisdenjo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Denis</a> decided to pick up that important work and create a new library for the WebSocket Protocol.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>We will support his work of maintaining the library and standardizing it with the GraphQL over HTTP working group.
This is a part of a lot of exciting work coming up about GraphQL and real-time, so follow us for new things in this space!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Denis will take it away from here!</p></blockquote><h3>Introduction</h3><p>At some point in time during your web development journeys, you may’ve been faced with the challenge to add a real-time component. The synonym for realtime in the browser is the WebSocket API. <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This is how MDN’s describes it</a>:</p><blockquote><p>The WebSocket API is an advanced technology that makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user’s browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply.</p></blockquote><p>Google Chrome was the first browser to support the WebSocket Protocol, adding support in 2009 - two years before it was officially standardised in 2011. As the need for full-duplex server-client communications rose, other browsers followed suit.</p><p>As of today, all major browsers support the WebSocket Protocol - see the <a href="https://caniuse.com/?search=Web%20Sockets" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Can I Use table</a>.</p><h3>WebSockets ❤️ GraphQL</h3><p>Okay, so, how do I use WebSockets to add support for the <a href="https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Subscription" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL <code>subscription</code> operation</a>? Doing a basic Google search, you’d be faced with a single solution, namely <a href="https://github.com/apollographql/subscriptions-transport-ws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>subscriptions-transport-ws</code></a>. Looking through the repository, checking recent comments, reading through the issues and open PRs - might have you notice the abundance of bugs and their security implications. <a href="https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-transport-ws/issues/3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A summary can be found here</a>.</p><p>The authors have done a brilliant job, but unfortunately other projects and needs have reduced their disposable time for maintaining and nurturing this well accomplished, yet needy, idea. But, it did indeed inspire me to take up their legacy and revitalised it! Having faced various WebSocket challenges with GraphQL myself - I jumped in writing a new library from scratch.</p><p>With no further ado - I humbly introduce <a href="https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-transport-ws" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>graphql-transport-ws</code></a>. A coherent, feature-full, zero-dependency, plug-n-play, lazy, simple, server and client implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-transport-ws/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new, security first GraphQL over WebSocket Protocol</a> with full support for all 3 GraphQL operations: <code>Queries</code>, <code>Mutations</code> and <code>Subscriptions</code>. The protocol aims to be standardised and become a part of GraphQL with the help of the foundation’s <a href="https://github.com/graphql/graphql-over-http/pull/140" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GraphQL over HTTP work group</a>.</p><p>The library is written in TypeScript and the full implementation totals merely ~1000 lines of well formatted, commented, code. It leverages modern JavaScript primitives and the well established presence of WebSockets.</p><h3>How do I get started?</h3><p>I am glad you asked! This is how:</p><h4>Install</h4><pre><pre>$ <span>yarn</span> <span>add</span> graphql-transport-ws

<p>I am fascinated by <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup">Shape Up</a>‘s notion of setting an appetite for a feature.</p>



<blockquote><p>An appetite is completely different from an estimate. Estimates start with a design and end with a number. Appetites start with a number and end with a design. We use the appetite as a creative constraint on the design process.</p><cite>Ryan Singer, <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.2-chapter-03#setting-the-appetite">Shape Up</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>In other words, we should stop saying “here are the specific requirements for feature X, how long will it take?” </p>



<p>Instead, we should say “We want a feature that does X, and our appetite for it is Y weeks. What can you build in that time?”</p>



<p>To make it simple, Basecamp only has 2 possible appetites:</p>



<blockquote><p><code><strong>Small Batch</strong></code>: This is a project that a team of one designer and one or two programmers can build in one or two weeks. We batch these together into a six-week&nbsp;cycle.</p><p><code><strong>Big Batch</strong></code>: This project takes the same-size team a full six-weeks.</p><cite>Ryan Singer, <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.2-chapter-03#setting-the-appetite">Shape Up</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Remember that <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/06/10/spotting-broken-processes/">the best processes are dead simple</a>. It doesn’t get much simpler than this. <em>Decide if each feature is worth a big batch or a small batch, and let the team figure out what they can build in that timeframe</em>. See? I summarized it in a sentence. Simple.</p>



<p>If you work with clients, I’m sure you immediately think of reasons why that wouldn’t work. A few that come to mind for me are:</p>



<ul><li>Clients give you requirements and they want a price in the contract. I’ve <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">ranted about that before</a>. It’s hard to escape from “starting with a design and ending with a number.” It’s easier with an existing client because you aren’t trying to win a bid, but it’s still possible with new clients. Maybe we should start talking about appetites early in the discovery phase, after they sign the contract?</li><li>Basecamp’s teams are small: 1 designer and 1 or 2 developers. Teams at most companies are bigger, and could build more than a single feature in 6 weeks. Maybe we should divide a large team into smaller teams to work on features with appetites?</li><li>Putting the designer into the team would be a big shift for most companies. Starting development before anything is fully designed would be an even bigger shift. But both of those are valuable, no?</li></ul>



<p>Those are tough problems, but they feel solvable. </p>



<p>What I love about the idea of appetites is that it forces teams to be agile. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation? Responding to change over following a plan? Appetites are agile at their core. I’m curious and hopeful that it would work as well in an agency setting as it does at Basecamp.</p>

With this launch,  developers using Twilio's Programmable Voice  get a simple and affordable ASR/Speech-to-text platform to build speech- IVRs, Voice Bots and real time agent assist applications. Voicegain provides developers on the Twilio platform significant advantages</p><h2 id="viewer-3b1oa">Key Features of Twilio Media Streams support</h2><p id="viewer-2dncc">Twilio Media Streams support will give developers the following features:</p><ol><li id="viewer-aa64c"><p><strong>Grammar Support: </strong>Developers can now write IVR and voice bot applications that use <strong>grammars</strong>. Many traditional VoiceXML IVRs are built using grammars. However, until now Twilio TwiML did not support use of speech grammars as the &lt;Gather&gt; command supports only text capture. This made it hard to migrate existing VoiceXML IVR applications to the Twilio platform. Mapping of text to semantic meaning had to be done separately; either by writing code in a back-end programming language or using a NLU engine like Google Dialogflow, making it a very expensive process. Voicegain solves these problems by supporting both <strong>GRXML </strong>and <strong>JSGF </strong>speech grammars.
Voicegain ASR when used with grammars uses them as the core language model in the ASR. This delivers higher accuracy compared to an ASR that uses a large vocabulary language model to recognize text and then applies grammars to the recognized text. </p></li><li id="viewer-2lkid"><p><strong>90% Savings on ASR Licensing costs: </strong>Build <strong>low cost</strong> speech IVR application. -- A big advantage for developers of the Twilio Programmable Voice platform has been its affordable pricing. However, that was not necessarily true for existing ASR options like &lt;Gather&gt; that is priced at 2 cents for 15 seconds (with 15 second minimum) or 8 cents per minute. With Voicegain the <a href="https://www.voicegain.ai/pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><u>price</u></strong></a><strong> is 1.25 cents per minute</strong> measured at 1 second increments.  Including the billing increment, <strong>we are 90% cheaper. </strong></p></li><li id="viewer-df1pl"><p><strong>Better Timeout Support: </strong>Voicegain supports configurable timeouts for no-input, <strong>complete timeout</strong> and incomplete timeout. Because the grammar is integrated with the recognizer, Voicegain ASR is able to deliver accurate complete timeout response which is not possible with &lt;Gather&gt; command for which the only way to tell if the caller stopped speaking is a large enough pause. </p></li><li id="viewer-7mckv"><p>Simplify <strong>dynamic prompt playback</strong>. -- In order to make use of &lt;Connect&gt;&lt;Stream&gt; as easy as possible, we support passing prompts when invoking &lt;Stream&gt;. Prompts can be provided either as text or as URLs. If provided as text then Voicegain will either use TTS or perform dynamic concatenation of prerecorded prompts.  A prompt manager for such prerecorded prompts is provided as part of Voicegain Web Portal. 
Configurable <strong>barge-in </strong>is supported for the prompts.</p></li><li id="viewer-auc98"><p><strong>Fine-tune and test grammars</strong>. -- Voicegain Web Portal includes a tool for reviewing and fine tuning grammars. The tool also supports regression tests. You would never ever deploy grammars without knowing how well they are going to perform after changes.</p></li></ol><h2 id="viewer-9t19d">How Twilio Media Streams works with Voicegain? </h2><div id="viewer-f0q42"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.voicegain.ai/post/announcing-twilio-twiml-connect-stream-support" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e90723_efa9609d4fc345188b98e3e91f4dd19d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_901,h_509,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e90723_efa9609d4fc345188b98e3e91f4dd19d~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-f3v81">TwiML &lt;Stream&gt; requires a websocket url. This url can be obtained by invoking Voicegain /asr/recognize/async API. When invoking this API the grammar to be used in the recognition has to be provided. The websocket URL will be returned in the response.  </p><div id="viewer-1tiqr"><div><div data-hook="imageViewer" role="button" tabindex="0"><div role="img"><p><img data-pin-url="https://www.voicegain.ai/post/announcing-twilio-twiml-connect-stream-support" data-pin-media="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e90723_04f7848807a349069c88b747fca35bcc~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_896,h_555,al_c,q_80/file.png" src="https://static.wixstatic.com/media/e90723_04f7848807a349069c88b747fca35bcc~mv2.png/v1/fit/w_300,h_300,al_c,q_5/file.png"></p></div></div></div></div><p id="viewer-4cgk5">In addition to the wss url, Custom Parameters within &lt;Stream&gt; command are used to pass information about the question prompt to be played by Voicegain to the caller. This can be a text or a url to a service that will provide the audio.</p><p id="viewer-chsps">Once &lt;Connect&gt;&lt;Stream&gt; has been invoked, Voicegain platform takes over-  it:</p><ul><li id="viewer-4k6o4"><p>Plays the prompt via the back channel of &lt;Stream&gt;</p></li><li id="viewer-dl5vs"><p>As soon as caller starts speaking, the prompt playback is stopped (if it it was still playing) exactly like in &lt;Gather&gt;</p></li><li id="viewer-400cn"><p>Spoken words are are recognized using grammar. Recognition result is then provided as a callback from Voicegain Platform. In case of no-input or no-match an appropriate callback will also be made.</p></li><li id="viewer-39pqs"><p>&lt;Stream&gt; connection is stopped and the TwiML application will continue with a next command.</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-5oe9j">BTW, we do support DTMF input as an alternative to speech input. </p><p id="viewer-4bi5v">[UPDATE: you can see more details of how to use Voicegain with Twilio Media Streams in this new <a href="https://www.voicegain.ai/post/how-to-use-voicegain-with-twilio-media-streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Blog post</u></a>.]</p><h2 id="viewer-5rju5">Other features of the Voicegain Platform</h2><p id="viewer-afees"><strong>1. On Premise Edge Support: </strong>While Voicegain APIs are available as a cloud PaaS service, Voicegain also supports OnPrem/Edge deployment. Voicegain can be deployed as a containerized service on a single node Kubernetes cluster, or onto multi-node high-availability Kubernetes cluster (on your GPU hardware or your VPC).</p><p id="viewer-e2nci"><strong>2. Acoustic model customization:</strong> This allows to achieve very high accuracy beyond what is possible with out of the box recognizers. The grammar tuning and regression tool mentioned above, can be used to collect training data for acoustic model customization.</p><h2 id="viewer-9md6b">More Features Coming </h2><p id="viewer-1ghtq">On our near term roadmap for Twilio users we have several more features:</p><ul><li id="viewer-1th58"><p>Advanced <strong>Answering Machine Detection</strong> (AMD) -- will be invoked using &lt;Connect&gt;&lt;Stream&gt; and will provide very accurate answering machine detection using speech recognition.</p></li><li id="viewer-93p29"><p><strong>Large vocabulary language model </strong>to just capture the spoken words (no grammars are used) and integrate with any NLU Engine of your choice. We think it will be attractive because of the lower cost.</p></li></ul><p id="viewer-c9mgf">You can sign up to <a href="https://voicegain.ai/trial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>try our</u></a> platform. We are offering 600 minutes of free monthly use of the platform.

<p>Consider this incomplete snippet of Rust code:</p>

<pre><code data-lang="rust"><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

</div>
<p>I want to see an LR parser which produces the following syntax tree
(from <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/manual.html#show-syntax-tree"><strong>Show Syntax Tree</strong></a> rust-analyzer command, with whitespace nodes elided for clarity):</p>

</div>
</div>
<p>The most error-resilient LR-style parser I know, <a href="https://github.com/tree-sitter/tree-sitter">tree sitter</a>, produces this instead (tree sitter is GLR, this is <strong>not</strong> the style of parsing advocated by the article):</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre> 1

    struct_pattern [2, 0] - [4, 1])
      type: type_identifier [2, 0] - [2, 6])
      ERROR [2, 7] - [2, 8])
        identifier [2, 7] - [2, 8])

        name: field_identifier [3, 3] - [3, 4])
        pattern: identifier [3, 6] - [3, 9])
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Note two things about the rust-analyzer’s tree:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There’s an (incomplete) “function” node for <code>fn foo(</code>.
Unclosed parenthesis doesn’t preclude the parser from recognizing parameter list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incomplete function does not prevent struct definition from being recognized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These are important for IDE support.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that the cursor is just after <code>(</code>.
If we have rust-analyzer’s syntax tree, than we can figure out that we are completing a function parameter.
If we are to get fancy we might find the calls to the (not yet fully written) <code>foo</code>, run type inference to figure out the type of the first argument, and than suggest parameter name &amp; type based on that (not currently implemented — there’s soooooo much yet to be done in rust-analyzer).
And correctly recognizing <code>struct S</code> is important to not break type-inference in the code which uses <code>S</code>.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of literature about error recovery for LR parsers, how come academics haven’t figured this out already?
I have a bold claim to make: error-recovery research in academia is focusing on a problem irrelevant for IDEs.
Specifically, the research is focused on finding “minimal cost repair sequence”:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a set of edit operations is defined (skip, change or insert token),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a “cost” metric is defined to distinguish big and small edits,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an algorithm is devised to find the smallest edit which makes the current text parse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This is a very academia-friendly problem — there’s a precise mathematical formulation, there’s an obvious brute force solution (try all edits), and there’s ample space for finding polynomial algorithm.</p>
<p>But IDEs don’t care about actually guessing &amp; repairing the text!
They just need to see as much of (possibly incomplete) syntax nodes in the existing text as possible.
When rust-analyzer’s parser produces</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>  PARAM_LIST@6..7
    L_PAREN@6..7 "("
STRUCT@9..31
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>it doesn’t think “Oh, I need to insert <code>)</code> here to complete the list of parameters”.
Rather, it sees <code>struct</code> and thinks “Oh wow, didn’t expect that! I guess I’ll just stop parsing parameter list right here”.</p>
<p>So, here’s</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Important"></i>
</td>
<td>
<p>First Challenge</p>
Design error <em>resilient</em> (and not just error <em>recovering</em>) LR parsing algorithm.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Note that error resilience is a topic orthogonal to error reporting.
I haven’t payed much attention to error reporting (in my experience, synchronous reporting of syntax errors in the editor compensates for bad syntax error messages), but it might be the case that MCRS are a good approach to there.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>While finding product-market fit for <a href="https://www.palabra.io/?utm_medium=direct-sales-tips-startups&amp;utm_source=blog">Palabra</a>, our marketing strategy was exclusively organic and our first sales came from 1-1 conversations with potential users. After a month of difficult conversations and failed demos, I learned a very new and innovative approach to direct sales: actually listening to what people are saying. In this post I'll share my experience and some tips to listen to users, in the hopes of saving founders &amp; early startup teams some time and energy.</p><h2>What we mean by direct sales</h2><p>As the name suggest, direct sales means you talk directly to your prospect and try to sell them your solution via a 1-1 conversation. This conversation usually starts by reaching the prospect you think your product would work for, and sharing why you think your solution would be good for them.</p><p>Taking a direct approach is more common for B2B businesses, because the decision to purchase is strategical and the price is higher, which means you get a bigger return for each user you convert. But I think it's a good strategy to follow for any early stage SaaS, because it's an easy and direct way of learning about your users and implementing solutions that work for them.</p><p>The biggest challenges to direct sales is finding the right prospects and knowing how to show them value as quickly as possible. With direct conversations you'll probably get a higher conversion rate than self-served sales, but at a much slower rate.</p><h2>Why direct sales in a SaaS startup?</h2><p>When we launched Palabra we had no audience and not enough user data to understand who we should be targeting or how to convert them into paying users. We had two possible paths to follow:</p><ol><li>Awareness-first: Experimenting with low-budget ads or organic strategies in different channels, with different messages to see which stick better. This approach is the startup playbook, feeding the top of the funnel with as many prospects as possible assuming most of them will not end up buying, and learn how to convert them better later on.</li><li>Conversion-first: Spending almost no time to feed the top of the funnel (keep a low stream of leads and prospects) but improving that funnel to have better conversions. Leads would be scarce, but we'd learn how to qualify them and provide value so they are willing to buy and stay around.</li></ol><p>The first path was the riskier for us. First, because we had little experience with paid acquisition, and wouldn't know if our misses would be due to lack of experience or just wrong channels.</p><p>Second, we wanted to engage in deep conversations with users as soon as possible. We didn't really care about general trends, we wanted to actually understand what people were struggling with in email automation, and where to take our product so that it worked for them. That's why we decided to take the second path.</p><p>Our initial strategy was to ask a bunch of questions about people's current email automation strategies and try to turn the initial conversation into a sales pitch. We'd learn fast and get a few sales in the meantime.</p><p>Sounds easy, right? Well, it was not.</p><h2>What a failed sales conversation looks like</h2><p>After my first couple of calls I knew I was doing something wrong, but didn't know what it was. Sign ups were rarely because of my "sales" 1-1s, and every conversation left me with a sour feeling.</p><p>What usually happened was that I got to a call, asked the person a couple of questions about their strategies, and at some point I'd get nervous and start talking a lot. People are usually nice and would listen to what I had to say, but I could feel they weren't really interested, and felt like I was wasting time.</p><p>So what was I doing wrong?</p><p>After talking with my co-founder and a couple of friends in the SaaS industry, I found that I wasn't really paying attention to what prospects were saying. My team would ask questions about our prospects that I didn't know how to answer.</p><p>That meant I wasn't really selling, but I also wasn't learning about our users. I found I had to learn how to listen first, and sell later.</p><h2>How to talk less and sell more</h2><p>Listening to prospects is not at easy as it sounds when you are worried about selling them your solution. Specially if you're in early stage and don't have much experience selling software, it'll be hard to keep a clear mind and letting the user take the conversation where they want to.</p><p>But here's the thing: selling isn't about convincing people to try your product, it's about identifying how your product can solve a problem for them.</p><p>In a direct sales conversation, you should have two take outs:</p><ol><li>Identifying if the person you're talking to has a problem you could solve (the more details the better)</li><li>Communicating clearly how your product is a solution to their problem.</li></ol><p>If you fail at #1, you'll end up trying to convince people who don't actually have a problem you could help them with. Those are not your users, and there's nothing you can do today to make their life easier. Even if you somehow convince them to sign up, they'll probably cancel their subscription, making your churn go up.</p><p>Failing at #2 is usually connected to #1, because the only way of communicating a solution clearly is to understand the problem perfectly. You have to <strong>listen really carefully</strong> to understand what those problems are.</p><p>Most of your conversations with prospects should be about #1. Make a lot of questions. Listen closely and follow up on what isn't clear. Make the other person feel listened to. Worst case scenario, you end up with valuable insights about what problems people have. As an early stage startup, this information is crucial to find product-market fit.</p><p>Here are some lessons I learned while taking a direct sales approach to SaaS. Most of them came from reading <a href="http://momtestbook.com/">The Mom Test</a>, talking to awesome people and experimenting on my own.</p><h2>3 direct sales tips to listen to your users</h2><h3>Writing down what you want to get from the conversation</h3><p>This list should be really short. My initial conversation guide had 15+ questions to get to understand the problem, and then a short demo. It worked kinda fine, but I usually got lost by question 5, and then started thinking about what to ask next instead of listening to the answer.</p><p>The Mom Test suggests you should "prepare your list of 3". Three things you want to get from each conversation, depending on who you'll be talking to. And that was magic.</p><p>In early Palabra demos, when I asked to have a quick chat to someone in a startup, I usually had three different scenarios:</p><ul><li>The founder talked to me directly, who had no details about the email automation strategies his/her team was using but could provide context.</li><li>I talked to a marketer in the startup, who usually had many years of experience and had tried a bunch of other email automation tools.</li><li>I talked to a technical co-founder or dev, who had a lot of questions about technical aspects of Palabra and had tried different integrations before.</li></ul><p>I prepared three different notes to look at before each conversation, one for each "buyer" persona, and wrote down my list of three.</p><p>I started asking questions that came to mind from listening to what people were saying, and spend almost no time looking at my notes. If I ever felt I was starting to get lost, I just glanced to my list of three for that particular person to check if I was missing something. Freedom.</p><h3>Having a structured set of questions</h3><p>This advice came from a great friend and the <a href="http://sofandrade.com/">best UX designer I've met</a>. She knows all about user interviews, and since I was also trying to learn from our prospects, I knew it would help. Her advice was to divide my questions into chunks or topics I wanted to know about.</p><p>Having differentiated topics gives you flexibility to follow the conversation and not worry about what to ask after each answer. If you ask a question from the first topic and your user's answer goes to a slightly different topic, you can go to that part of your guide and then come back after that's done.</p><p>As an example, this was the structure I ended up using for each guide:</p><ul><li>About them/their job/their goals</li><li>About their emails, what they were using them from</li><li>About their email automation tools, what they were using and how</li><li>About their pains, what was missing from their current tools?</li></ul><p>What usually happened is that my email questions got answers related to tools. So I just moved over to the "tools" set of questions and then looked to see if I was missing something important at the end.</p><p>A smart move was to leave questions about pains for last. By then I usually had enough information about their problem and could offer a clear solution with Palabra.</p><p>If we had a solution, I'd briefly tell people why I thought this would work, and offered to show them in a demo. By focusing on their specific solution in the demo, I only showed one feature and not the whole product, which was a much better use of everyone's time.</p><h3>Doing some background research - but still ask people</h3><p>You can't go into a sales pitch without knowing who you're talking to. For B2B sales you need to know about the company and the person you're actually going to talk to. The key here is to use that information wisely.</p><p>I used to start conversations on what I'd learned from their landing page, to let people know I had done my homework. But his was actually making me start with the wrong foot -by talking too much.</p><p>Asking about their company and what they do there gives you inside information you wouldn't get from LinkedIn or a landing page. And it also helps break the ice, since it's an easy answer for anyone.</p><p>My solution was full transparency. I started each conversation by saying I had done a bit of research about them but still wanted to hear from themselves. Then I would ask what they usually do.</p><p>This was incredibly effective. Being honest took away all of my nervousness and allowed me to relax into the conversation. I felt like I had no secrets, I was just telling the truth and asking questions. And I think this works both ways: the person you're talking to will probably trust you more if you're honest about what you're doing.</p><p>Just …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>Friends are a treasure. In an uncertain world, they provide a comforting sense of stability and connection. We laugh together and cry together, sharing our good times and supporting each other through the bad. Yet a defining feature of friendship is that itâ€™s voluntary. Weâ€™re not wedded together by law, or through blood, or via monthly payments into our bank accounts. It is a relationship of great freedom, one that we retain only because we want to.</p>
<p>But the downside of all this freedom, this lack of formal commitment, is that friendship often falls by the wayside. Our adult lives can become a monsoon of obligations, from children, to partners, to ailing parents, to work hours that trespass on our free time. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2Febs0000046">study</a> of young adultsâ€™ social networks by researchers at the University of Oxford found that those in a romantic relationship had, on average, two fewer close social ties, including friends. Those with kids had lost out even more. Friendships crumble, not because of any deliberate decision to let them go, but because we have other priorities, ones that arenâ€™t quite as voluntary. The title of the Oxford paper summed up things well: â€˜Romance and Reproduction Are Socially Costlyâ€™.</p>
<p>Such is the pace and busyness of many peopleâ€™s adult lives that they can lose contact with their friends at a rapid rate. For instance, a <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378873313001056?via%3Dihub">study</a> by the Dutch sociologist Gerald Mollenhorst found that, over a period of seven years, people had lost touch with half of their closest friends, on average. Whatâ€™s especially alarming is that many of us seem to be losing friends faster than we can replace them. A <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-13785-001">meta-analysis</a> by researchers in Germany published in 2013 combined data from 177,635 participants across 277 studies, concluding that friendship networks had been shrinking for the preceding 35 years. For example, in studies conducted between 1980 and 1985, participants reportedly had four more friends on average, compared with the participants whoâ€™d taken part in studies between 2000 and 2005.</p>
<p>If weâ€™re not careful, we risk living out our adulthoods friendless. This is a situation thatâ€™s worth avoiding. Friends are not only a great source of fun and <a href="https://www.pewforum.org/2018/11/20/where-americans-find-meaning-in-life/">meaning</a> in life, but studies <a href="https://academic.oup.com/psychsocgerontology/article/74/2/222/3760165">suggest</a> that, without them, weâ€™re also at greater risk of feeling more depressed. Itâ€™s telling that in their <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/1467-9280.00415">study</a> â€˜Very Happy Peopleâ€™ (2002), the American psychologists Ed Diener and Martin Seligman found that a key difference between the most unhappy and most happy people was how socially connected they were. Friends give us so much, which is why we need to invest in making them. Hereâ€™s how.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>Making more friends in adulthood is going to take some deliberate effort on your part. Itâ€™s an exciting challenge in theory, but one of the first obstacles youâ€™ll encounter is having enough confidence. Especially if you are shy by nature, putting yourself out there can seem scary, triggering fears of rejection. These fears might lead you to engage in two types of avoidance that will inhibit your ability to make friends. First, you might practise â€˜overt avoidanceâ€™, by not putting yourself in situations where itâ€™s possible to meet new people. Instead of going to your friendâ€™s movie night, with the chance to meet others, you end up staying at home. Second, you might find yourself engaging in â€˜covert avoidanceâ€™, which means that you show up but donâ€™t engage with people when you arrive. You go to the movie night, but while everyone else is analysing the film after itâ€™s over, you stay silent in the corner, petting someoneâ€™s pet corgi and scrolling through Instagram.</p>
<p><strong>Assume that people like you</strong></p>
<p>Both these forms of avoidance are caused by understandable fears of rejection. So imagine how much easier it would be if you knew that, were you to show up in a group of strangers, most of them would love you and find you interesting. This mindset actually has a self-fulfilling quality â€“ an American <a href="https://doi.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0022-3514.51.2.284">study</a> from the 1980s found that volunteers who were led to believe that an interaction partner liked them began to act in ways that made this belief more likely to come true â€“ they shared more about themselves, disagreed less, and had a more positive attitude. This suggests that if you go into social situations with a positive mindset, assuming people like you, then itâ€™s more likely that this will actually turn out to be the case.</p>
<p>Of course, you might still be reluctant to assume others like you because you donâ€™t believe itâ€™s true. If this is you, you might take comfort from research that found, on average, that strangers like us more than we realise. The <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797618783714">paper</a>, by Erica J Boothby at Cornell University and colleagues, involved having pairs of strangers chat together for five minutes, to rate how much they liked their interaction partner, and to estimate how much their partner liked them. Across a variety of settings and study durations â€“ in the lab, in a college dorm, at a professional development workshop â€“ the same pattern emerged. People underestimated how much they were liked, a phenomenon that Boothby and her colleagues labelled â€˜the liking gapâ€™.</p>
<p>What wisdom should we take from this research? It can remind us to go into new social events assuming that people will like us. It can keep us from being paralysed by fears of rejection, pushing us to question some of these fears. Try working on your internal dialogue, your inner voice that perhaps makes overly negative assumptions about how people will respond to you. Doing this will help give you the confidence to go out there and start initiating friendly contact with strangers.</p>
<p><strong>Initiate</strong></p>
<p>In <em>We Should Get Together: The Secret to Cultivating Better Friendships</em> (2020), Kat Vellos describes being inspired to write her book after a moment of feeling utterly alone. She was looking for a friend to hang out with, so she posted on Facebook: â€˜Who wants to go eat French fries and talk about life with me?â€™ Everyone who responded lived in another state; her local San Francisco Bay Area friends were all booked up. As she put it:</p>
<blockquote>I didnâ€™t just want to eat snacks and talk about life. I was craving a different kind of life â€“ one that would give me abundant access to friends who wanted to see me as much as I wanted to see them.</blockquote>
<p>This experience made Vellos realise that she needed more friends, so she created and executed a plan to make some. Eventually, she was running two successful meetup groups, and had established friendships with people she liked and wanted to get closer to. How did she change her life? She initiated. Vellos set aside time to reach out to people regularly, to revitalise old relationships and to awaken new ones, to check in, to find time to hang out. Her story reveals how initiative can change the course of our friendships.</p>
<p>To embrace the importance of initiating, you must to let go of the myth that friendship happens organically. You have to take responsibility rather than waiting passively. Science backs this up. Consider a <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0265407509106718">study</a> of older adults in the Canadian province of Manitoba. The participants who thought friendship was something that just happened based on luck tended to be less socially active and to feel lonelier when the researchers caught up with them five years later. By contrast, those who thought friendship took effort actually made more effort â€“ for example, by showing up at church or at community groups â€“ and this paid dividends, in that they felt less lonely at the five-year follow-up.</p>
<p>But itâ€™s not just showing up that matters, itâ€™s saying â€˜helloâ€™ when you get there. This means introducing yourself to other people, asking them for their phone numbers, following up and asking them to hang out. Initiating is a process, one that we must do over and over again to make new friendships.</p>
<p>Initiation is particularly important for people who find themselves in new social settings â€“ such as people who have moved to a new city, started a new school or job. In a <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1987-97266-009">study</a> of first-year undergraduates at the University of Denver in 1980, it was those students who rated themselves as having superior social skills who managed to develop more satisfying social relationships. Moreover, in the Fall, when everyone was new, it was specifically â€˜initiation skillâ€™ that was most important. Once friendships were more stable, it didnâ€™t matter as much.</p>
<p>Although we might fear that other people will turn us down if we initiate with them, the research finds that this is a lot less likely than we might think. When the American psychologists Nicholas Epley and Juliana Schroeder <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-28833-001">asked</a> research participants to open up conversations with their fellow train commuters, can you guess how many of them were shot down? None! Epley and Schroder concluded that: â€˜Commuters appeared to think that talking to a stranger posed a meaningful risk of social rejection. As far as we can tell, it posed no risk at all.â€™</p>
<p><strong>Keep showing up</strong></p>
<p>Once youâ€™ve initiated some new contacts, the challenge of turning them into genuine friendships begins. I learned this lesson when I moved to Atlanta to start a job as assistant professor. At first, I was proactive at making friends. I showed up to events, asked my friends if they knew anyone in the area, and went to some meetup groups. I met a few people, but most of these friendships fizzled. I was good at sparking a connection but struggled to sustain it.</p>
<p>According to Rebecca G Adams, professor of sociology and gerontology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro, sociologists have long <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/15/fashion/the-challenge-of-making-friends-as-an-adult.html">recognised</a> that friendships thrive when we have continuous interaction. My problem with sustaining connection was that I lacked the opportunity for repeated encounters. Going to a lecture, or a happy hour, or a networking event afforded me only one opportunity to connect. If you can, itâ€™s a better idea to sign up for activities that give you multiple opportunities to connect, such as a language class, a writing course, an …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

<![CDATA[10 Reasons for Choosing Apache Pulsar over Apache Kafka]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      

      <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">
  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <!--excerpt.begin-->
<p>I’ve been taking a closer look at <a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/">Apache Pulsar</a> and how it relates to <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache Kafka</a>. In case you are curious, here are ten of my findings:
<!--excerpt.end--></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Pulsar’s brokers are stateless. The state is kept in a separate storage layer (<a href="https://bookkeeper.apache.org/">Apache BookKeeper</a>). This means you can leverage a new broker without the need to re-partition existing data, which is required by Kafka.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pulsar’s storage layer is organized into segments which are spread across all storage nodes. Segments can be written to the main storage or off-loaded to a different type of storage. This allows Pulsar to offer tiered storage which Kafka does not support yet.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For replication, Pulsar uses a quorum-based algorithm, as opposed to a leader/follower-based approach in Kafka. The guarantees are the same, but the quorum approach tends to yield lower and more consistent latencies.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pulsar includes support for multi-tenancy which allows multiple user groups to share the same cluster, either via access control, or in entirely different namespaces. In Kafka, this is still under discussion.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pulsar offers full end-to-end encryption from the client to the storage nodes. Kafka currently does not have end-to-end encryption.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pulsar speaks other protocols such as RabbitMQ, AMQP, or even Kafka (!) which makes it easy to integrate Pulsar with existing applications. Further, there is support for <a href="https://prestodb.io/">Presto</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pulsar Functions is a way to do lightweight stream processing on top of Pulsar, conceptually similar to Kafka Streams. What I found interesting is that Pulsar’s functions are directly deployed on the broker nodes, whereas Kafka’s streams run as separate applications.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The Pulsar community has been very open about the limitations of Pulsar Functions, e.g. state management and DAG flows. In case Pulsar Functions doesn’t do it for you, there is an actively maintained <a href="https://github.com/streamnative/pulsar-flink">Pulsar &lt;&gt; ApacheFlink connector</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s not all sunshine and rainbows: Pulsar requires two systems: Apache BookKeeper and Apache Zookeeper. Kafka just requires Zookeeper. More systems could increase the operational complexity. On the other hand, it’s also the reason why Pulsar provides additional flexibility.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Pulsar is not new. It was originally developed and used at Yahoo, later donated to the <a href="https://apache.org/">Apache Software Foundation</a> in 2016. It’s used by Tencent, Splunk, and many others at large scale.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Obviously, this is not a full comparison of Apache Pulsar and Apache Kafka, but rather a compilation of the things I was surprised to find out about Pulsar, coming from the Kafka landscape.</p>

<p>Posted on <time datetime="2020-09-16T00:00:00+00:00">September 16, 2020</time></p>

<p>I recently came across <a href="https://n-o-d-e.net/zeroterminal3.html">the incredibly cool design</a> for an “ultimate Raspberry Pi computer” by NODE and was inspired to create my own “portable” Pi device. Although, with my concept, I decided to set a few restrictions on the build:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I wanted to keep the total cost as low as possible
    <ul>
      <li>including the Pi Zero <em>and</em> extra hardware</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I wanted to avoid any custom casings or need for 3D printed materials</li>
  <li>I wanted to make the full design extremely portable / lightweight</li>
  <li>I wanted to keep the build as user-friendly as possible (no soldering, odd hacks etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>With these constraints put in place, I built my very own Raspberry Pi Zero “hacker” terminal. You can see the finished product below:</p>

<p>I’m pretty happy with the final outcome and best of all - you can easily recreate this yourself with little-to-no effort!</p>

<p>So enough chit-chat - let’s build this bad-boy!</p>

<h4 id="raspberry-pi-zero-wh">Raspberry Pi Zero WH</h4>

<p>You will need a Raspberry Pi Zero W with GPIO header pins already soldered on to the board. (You could also do this yourself manually if you have the tools and skill to do so)</p>

<h4 id="li-ion-battery-hat">Li-Ion Battery HAT</h4>

<p>This HAT holds a single li-ion battery and for our purposes will connect with our Pi Zero via the GPIO header pins. You could also look into double-set battery HATs if that is something you would prefer - for my needs a single rechargeable battery works fine.</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/bradtaunt/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1200/https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/li-ion-battery-hat.jpg" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/bradtaunt/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_320/https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/li-ion-battery-hat.jpg 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/bradtaunt/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_540/https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/li-ion-battery-hat.jpg 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/bradtaunt/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_760/https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/li-ion-battery-hat.jpg 760w, https://res.cloudinary.com/bradtaunt/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_980/https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/li-ion-battery-hat.jpg 980w, https://res.cloudinary.com/bradtaunt/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1200/https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/li-ion-battery-hat.jpg 1200w" sizes="100vw" alt="Battery HAT Front" width="1280" height="1000" crossorigin="anonymous">

<p>Since our main “OS” is purely terminal based, I find you don’t really need a li-ion battery with a massive amount of power storage. 2500mAh will easily last a handful of hours mucking about with emails, files and web browsing. Plus, you can always carry a few extras for swapping out on-the-go.</p>

<h4 id="35-inch-tft-display">3.5-inch TFT Display</h4>

<p>A simple and fairly cheap touchscreen display. We won’t require our display to render videos or pretty graphics (since we will be entirely terminal-based) so this works just fine for our needs. I am using version 6.3 for this build.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, this item is optional if you feel more comfortable with using a pure bluetooth keyboard. I just personally prefer this method.</p>

<h3 id="wireless-keyboard">Wireless Keyboard</h3>

<p>In my product demo image at the beginning of the article, I’m actually using an old Logitech wireless keyboard since this one still hasn’t arrived. I plan to swap them out once I have it - the Logitech is far to large to be deemed “portable”.</p>

<h2 id="getting-setup">Getting Setup</h2>

<p>I will be setting up this “portable pi” via <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/wireless/headless.md">headless installation</a> with my main <a href="https://uglyduck.ca/my-pi-desktop/">Raspberry Pi 4 desktop</a>. Included below are some quick instructions on how to setup the Raspberry Pi Zero for <code>ssh</code> access.</p>

<h4 id="preparing-the-microsd-card">Preparing the microSD card</h4>

<ol>
  <li>Use Raspberry Pi Imager to write the Raspberry Pi Lite OS to your microSD card
    <ul>
      <li>Once complete, remove the microSD storage device and then re-connect it</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Navigate to the <code>boot</code> folder of the microSD device - we will be adding 2 files here
    <ul>
      <li>First add a completely empty file and name it <code>ssh</code> (no file extension)</li>
      <li>Next add an empty file named <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Open the <code>wpa_supplicant.conf</code> file in a code / text editor and paste the following (be sure to change <code>country</code> to your proper country code, as well as properly setting your network name / password):
    <div><div><pre><code> ctrl_interface=DIR=/var/run/wpa_supplicant GROUP=netdev
 update_config=1
 country=US

 network={
     ssid="Your network name/SSID"
     psk="Your WPA/WPA2 security key"
     key_mgmt=WPA-PSK
 }
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Unmount the microSD device, then place the microSD card in your RPi Zero</li>
  <li>Assemble the Raspberry Pi Zero with the Battery HAT (li-ion battery attached) connected via GPIO pins, and the 3.5 display connected on-top of the battery HAT’s pins</li>
  <li>Turn on the battery HAT switch to power the RPi Zero. Give the device ~90 seconds to perform the initial boot</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Note</strong>: the display will turn on but only show a white screen - this is normal</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="connecting-to-your-zero-via-ssh">Connecting to your Zero via SSH</h4>

<p>Open the terminal on your Raspberry Pi desktop and enter the following command:</p>



<p>You will then be asked if you wish to trust this device (say yes), then prompted for the <code>pi</code> user’s password - which is <code>raspberry</code>. After a moment you will be directly connected to your Raspberry Pi Zero. Hooray!</p>

<p>We just want to make a couple small configuration changes before going forward (mostly for security):</p>

<ol>
  <li>Run the command <code>sudo raspi-config</code></li>
  <li>Select “Change User Password” from the menu and change the password 
  <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/bradtaunt/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_1200/https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/raspi-config.png" srcset="https://res.cloudinary.com/bradtaunt/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_320/https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/raspi-config.png 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/bradtaunt/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_540/https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/raspi-config.png 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/bradtaunt/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_760/https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/raspi-config.png 760w, https://res.cloudinary.com/bradtaunt/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_980/https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/raspi-config.png 980w, https://res.cloudinary.com/bradtaunt/image/fetch/c_limit,f_auto,q_auto,w_984/https://uglyduck.ca/public/images/raspi-config.png 984w" sizes="100vw" alt="Raspberry Config" width="984" height="321" crossorigin="anonymous"></li>
  <li>After that, select “Network Options” and change your device name
    <ul>
      <li>This will avoid any conflicts of connecting to newer RPi devices down the line</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>That’s it!</p>

<h4 id="installing-display-driver">Installing display driver</h4>

<p>Next we will need to download and run the drivers needed for our 3.5-inch display to play nicely with our Pi Zero (just a blank white screen doesn’t help us much). While connected to our RPi Zero via SSH, run the following commands:</p>

<ol>
  <li><code>wget http://kedei.net/raspberry/v6_1/LCD_show_v6_1_3.tar.gz</code>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have snail-paced rural internet like I do, now is a good time to go and grab a coffee while this download completes</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once the download has finished, extract the contents and navigate to the new directory and install the driver:
    <ul>
      <li><code>sudo tar xzf LCD_show_v6_1_3.tar.gz</code></li>
      <li><code>cd LCD_show_v6_1_3</code></li>
      <li><code>sudo ./LCD35_v</code></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once completed, the RPi Zero will reboot and everything should work as expected!</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="installing-software">Installing software</h4>

<p>I’m not going to jump into heavy details about installing terminal-based software for this setup. The links I’ve attached in the software section should provide you with more than enough information to get started. For reference, I’m using a very basic set of applications:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Neomutt (emails)</li>
  <li>Lynx (quick and simple web browsing)</li>
  <li>Nano (writing notes / blog posts in a hurry)</li>
  <li>Vim (making any config edits or project work)</li>
</ul>

<hr id="summary">

<h2 id="final-summary">Final Summary</h2>

<p>There you have it - a terminal-based, portable Raspberry Pi Zero “hacker” device.</p>

<p>Is it practical? Not really. Can it replace any other <em>portable</em> device you might own? Probably not. Is it fun to make and experiment on? You bet! And in the end - isn’t that what matters most with pet Pi projects?</p>

<!-- <img src="/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/header.png" style="width: 100%;" alt="Fixing AWS Architecure Diagrams: Distributed Load Testing"> -->

<p><em>Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides a vast library of practical solutions to common business problems. In this series, we focus on the architecture diagrams included in these solutions and attempt to expand and improve on them. Read the previous entry <a href="https://blog.ilograph.com/posts/fixing-aws-architecture-diagrams-vod/">here</a>.</em></p>

<p>Below is AWS’s architecture diagram for their <a href="https://github.com/awslabs/distributed-load-testing-on-aws">Distributed Load Testing on AWS solution</a>. It comes directly from the linked repository. While the solution is excellent, the architecture diagram accompanying it exhibits a number of problems that limit its use as a technical resource.</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/original.png" alt="An AWS diagram"></p>

<p>This diagram has some common issues (see the <a href="https://blog.ilograph.com/posts/fixing-aws-architecture-diagrams-vod/">previous entry</a> in this series) and a few new ones:</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> The diagram lacks a clear purpose. It is referred to simply as an “Architecture Overview” in the solution.</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> There are no named resources; only AWS Services (e.g. <em>Amazon S3</em>) are shown. Looking at this diagram, a viewer has no way of knowing <em>what</em> buckets, lambdas and other resources exist or how they are related.</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> All of the arrows are unlabeled. The exact nature of the relations between these resources is a mystery.</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> The diagram mixes run-time and deployment-time concerns.</p>

<p> <strong>-</strong> The diagram is missing critical details about security and access management.</p>

<p><strong>In short, this diagram makes an <em>impression</em>, but fails to truly <em>inform</em> the viewer</strong>. This would be acceptable for a decorative element in a blog post or presentation, but as a technical resource, it can be much better. In this article, we remake this diagram with an aim toward creating a valuable source of information in its own right.</p>

<p>Like last time, we split the original into multiple perspectives, each focused on a single goal. We’ll have <strong>nine</strong> perspectives in total. Four will show static relations between the solution’s resources. The remainder show sample workflows (e.g. creating a new test, or canceling a test) with detailed control flows between the resources. We’ll start with one of the most important perspectives, run-time dependency:</p>

<h4 id="perspective-1-run-time-dependency">Perspective 1: Run-time Dependency</h4>

<h6 id="goal-show-which-resources-depend-on-which-resources-at-run-time">Goal: Show which resources depend on which resources at run-time</h6>

<p><strong>Original</strong>
<img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/old_1.png" alt="Run-time dependency (old)"></p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong>
<a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Runtime%2520Dependency"><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/new_1.png" alt="Run-time dependency">
</a></p>

<p>We address the issues in the original head-on. The perspective uses real resource names, and the relationship arrows are labeled. We’ve removed deploy-time concerns (e.g. <em>CodeBuild</em>) to focus on run-time concerns. And we’ve added detail about the testing console, including screen names and their API dependencies.</p>

<p>At first blush the diagram is much busier than the original; however, we can select a resource and see both what resources depend on it and what resources it depends on:</p>



<p>The aforementioned deploy-time dependencies are not <em>truly</em> gone, we’ve just moved them to a different perspective:</p>

<h4 id="perspective-2-deploy-time-dependency">Perspective 2: Deploy-time Dependency</h4>

<h6 id="goal-show-which-resources-depend-on-which-resources-at-deploy-time">Goal: Show which resources depend on which resources at deploy-time</h6>

<p><strong>Original</strong>
<img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/old_2.png" alt="Deploy-time dependency (old)"></p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong>
<a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Deployment%2520Dependency"><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/new_2.png" alt="Deploy-time dependency">
</a></p>

<p>This perspective’s goal is identical to the last one, only it is focused on deploy-time dependencies. Note that this includes external dependencies (a <em>Docker Hub</em> image and a <em>PyPi</em> library). It also shows source code dependencies for the lambdas. Once the solution is successfully deployed, the dependencies described in this perspective are no longer relevant to the solution run-time.</p>

<h4 id="perspective-3-security-and-access-management">Perspective 3: Security and Access Management</h4>

<h6 id="goal-show-which-resources-can-access-which-resources-and-how">Goal: Show which resources can access which resources, and how</h6>

<p><strong>Original</strong>
<img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/old_3.png" alt="Security (old)"></p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong>
<a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Access%2520Management"><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/new_3.png" alt="Security">
</a></p>

<p>This perspective describes something the original doesn’t fully attempt to address: security and access management. For the solution to work, resources need to get data from, send data to, and sometimes (in the case of lambdas) invoke other resources. This is all managed through roles, policies, and permissions governed primary through IAM.</p>

<p>Obviously, this perspective goes into considerably more detail than the original diagram does. Like earlier, we can select individual resources to see what resources it can access and be accessed by (and how).</p>





<h4 id="perspective-4-vpc-egress">Perspective 4: VPC Egress</h4>

<h6 id="goal-show-how-vpc-based-resources-access-the-internet">Goal: Show how VPC-based resources access the internet</h6>

<p><strong>Original</strong>
<img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/old_4.png" alt="VPC Egress (old)"></p>

<p><strong>Updated</strong>
<a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/VPC%2520Egress"><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/new_4.png" alt="VPC Egress">
</a></p>

<p>Naturally, the load testing cluster requires internet access to work. This simple diagram shows the resources allowing the cluster to access the internet from within the VPC.</p>

<h4 id="perspectives-5-9-example-control-flow-sequences">Perspectives 5-9: Example control-flow sequences</h4>

<h6 id="goal-show-detailed-interactions-between-resources-for-common-workflows">Goal: Show detailed interactions between resources for common workflows</h6>

<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Create%2520Test"><img src="https://blog.ilograph.com/img/fixing-aws-load-testing/sequences.png" alt="Sequences">
</a></p>

<p>All of the previous perspectives are <em>static</em> perspectives. There is no notion of time; the relations they describe are continuously in effect. They do not have steps showing how the resources actually interact. To help the viewer better understand <em>how</em> the resources interact (and how complex those interactions can get), we include five <strong>sequence</strong> perspectives for this solution:</p>

<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Execute%2520Test">Execute Test</a> - Shows how new tests are executed after being created</p>

<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Write%2520Test%2520Results">Write Test Results</a> - Shows how test results are written to DynamoDB</p>

<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/List%2520tests">List tests</a> - Shows how all running tests are fetched</p>

<p><a rel="noopener" href="https://app.ilograph.com/demo.ilograph.AWS%2520Distributed-Load-Testing/Cancel%2520test">Cancel Test</a> - Shows how a running test is canceled</p>

<p>Other workflows that could be documented include getting individual tests and getting test results.</p>

<h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4>

<p>The conclusion of the <a href="https://blog.ilograph.com/posts/fixing-aws-architecture-diagrams-vod/">previous entry</a> listed guidelines for better architecture diagrams, all of which we followed here. We benefited greatly from breaking up the original diagram into multiple perspectives and using real resource names, for example. By making these and other improvements, we hopefully made this diagram much more useful as a technical resource.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
            <p>Just a note about nomenclature before we start; I’ll use “functor” to represent the <a href="https://bartoszmilewski.com/2015/01/20/functors/">categorical meaning</a> of the concept:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A functor is a mapping between categories</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and <code>Functor</code> and <code>Contravariant</code> to specify the typeclass encodings of functors.</p>
<hr>
<p>Let’s begin!</p>
<p>Contravariant functors are odd aren’t they? Covariant functors (which are modelled by the <code>Functor</code> typeclass) are quite straightforward but <strong>contra</strong>variant functors as their name implies seem to be the complete opposite.</p>
<p>Before we get into what a contravariant functor is, it’s useful to look at the <code>Functor</code> <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Typeclassopedia">typeclass</a> which we know and love.</p>
<h2 id="functor">Functor</h2>
<p>A <code>Functor</code> is defined as:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Functor</span> f <span>where</span>
<span>  fmap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f b</code></pre></div>
<p>We often understand a <code>Functor</code> to be a “container” or a “producer” of some type, where the function supplied to <code>fmap</code> is applied to the elements that are “contained” or “produced” in some type constructor<a href="#type-constructor-1"><sup>1</sup></a> <code>f</code>.</p>
<p>A simple example would be the list (<code>[]</code>) type, that can represent zero or more values. Given a <code>[a]</code> we can turn it into a <code>[b]</code> when given a function <code>a -&gt; b</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> [] a <span>=</span> [] <span>|</span> a <span>:</span> [a]  <span>-- an approximation of the [] data type</span>

<span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> [] <span>where</span>
  fmap _ [] <span>=</span> []
  fmap f (x<span>:</span>xs) <span>=</span> f x <span>:</span> fmap f xs</code></pre></div>
<p>In the example below we convert a <code>[Int]</code> into a <code>[String]</code> given a function <code>Int -&gt; String</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>import </span><span>Data.Semigroup</span> ((&lt;&gt;))

<span>myInts ::</span> [<span>Int</span>]
myInts <span>=</span> [<span>1</span> <span>..</span> <span>5</span>]

<span>emptyInts ::</span> [<span>Int</span>]
emptyInts <span>=</span> []

<span>intToString ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
intToString n <span>=</span> (show n) <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>"!"</span>

<span>myStrings ::</span> [<span>String</span>]
myStrings <span>=</span> fmap intToString myInts <span>-- ["1!","2!","3!","4!","5!"]</span>

<span>myEmptyString ::</span> []
myEmptyString <span>=</span> fmap intToString emptyInts  <span>-- []</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Another example would the <code>Maybe</code> data type, that represents a value that may or may not exist.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Maybe</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span> <span>|</span> <span>Just</span> a

<span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>where</span>
  fmap _ <span>Nothing</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
  fmap f (<span>Just</span> x) <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> (f x)</code></pre></div>
<p>In the example below we convert a <code>Maybe Int</code> into a <code>Maybe String</code> given a function <code>Int -&gt; String</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>import </span><span>Data.Semigroup</span> ((&lt;&gt;))

<span>maybeInt ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span>
maybeInt <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> <span>10</span>

<span>notInt ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>Int</span>
notInt <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>

<span>intToString ::</span> <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
intToString n <span>=</span> (show n) <span>&lt;&gt;</span> <span>"!"</span>

<span>maybeString ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span>
maybeString <span>=</span> fmap intToString maybeInt <span>-- Just "10!"</span>

<span>notString ::</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>String</span>
notString <span>=</span> fmap intToString notInt <span>-- Nothing</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>Functor</code> typeclass has laws, that ensure <code>Functor</code> instances behave in a predictable way.</p>
<h3 id="laws">Laws</h3>
<h4 id="identity">Identity</h4>

<p>Essentially if you do nothing to the value of a <code>Functor</code>, you get the same <code>Functor</code> you started with.</p>
<h4 id="composition">Composition</h4>
<div><pre><code>fmap (f <span>.</span> g) <span>==</span> fmap f <span>.</span> fmap g</code></pre></div>
<p>If you convert the result of a Functor by <code>fmap</code>ing with a function <code>g</code> and then <code>fmap</code>ing that result with a subsequent function <code>f</code>, it’s the same as composing functions <code>g</code> and <code>f</code> (<code>f . g</code>) and then <code>fmap</code>ing once.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/functor-laws-ct.png" alt="Functor Laws"></p><p>Functor Laws</p>
</div>
<h3 id="the-wrong-type-of-fmap">The Wrong Type of fmap</h3>
<p>Now let’s look at something a little different. Let’s create a data type to wrap a predicate of some sort. A predicate is something that will evaluate to a <code>Bool</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>newtype</span> <span>Predicate</span> a <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> {<span> getPredicate ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span> }</code></pre></div>
<p>An example of a Predicate is <code>greaterThanTen</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>greaterThanTen ::</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>Int</span>
greaterThanTen <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\n <span>-&gt;</span> n <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>that tests whether a number is greater than ten.</p>
<p>We can run with it <code>getPredicate</code> and an <code>Int</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code>getPredicate greateThanTen <span>5</span>  <span>-- False</span>
getPredicate greateThanTen <span>11</span> <span>-- True</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It could be useful to define a <code>Functor</code> instance for Predicate - say if we have a <code>Predicate Int</code> and we want to convert it into a <code>Predicate String</code> when we have a <code>Int -&gt; String</code> function. Let’s try and implement that:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>-- fmap (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Predicate a -&gt; Predicate b</span>
  fmap f (<span>Predicate</span> p) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\b <span>-&gt;</span> undefined)
  fmap f (<span>Predicate</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>)) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\b <span>-&gt;</span> undefined)  <span>-- expanding p</span>
  fmap (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) (<span>Predicate</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Bool</span>)) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\b <span>-&gt;</span> undefined) <span>-- expanding f</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we’ve run into a small problem:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>How do we compose (a -&gt; Bool) and (a -&gt; b) to give us a (b -&gt; Bool) ?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are given a <code>b</code> but we don’t have access to any functions that actually use a <code>b</code>.</p>
<p>The problem is that we can’t. It’s because of something called “polarity” of the type variable <code>a</code>. No <code>Functor</code> instance for you <code>Predicate</code>.</p>

<h2 id="polarity">Polarity</h2>
<p>Polarity is a way of representing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_(computer_science)">variance</a> using the position of type variables. Let’s take a simple function <code>a -&gt; b</code> as an example.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/function-polarity.png" alt="Function Polarity"></p><p>Function Polarity</p>
</div>
<p>If a type variable is in <strong>input</strong> position like <code>a</code> it is given a <strong>negative</strong> polarity. If it is in an <strong>output</strong> position like <code>b</code> then it is given a <strong>positive</strong> polarity.</p>
<p>These polarities map directly to variant types.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Polarity</th>
<th>Variance</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Positive</td>
<td>Covariant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Negative</td>
<td>Contravariant</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Both</td>
<td>Invariant</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>What this means is that <code>Functor</code>s (which are actually covariant functors) require a type constructor in a covariant position in order for you to define a <code>Functor</code> instance for that type.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a type that we know has a <code>Functor</code> instance like <code>Maybe</code>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/maybe-polarity.png" alt="Polarity of the Maybe data type"></p><p>Polarity of the Maybe data type</p>
</div>
<p>We can see that the type variable <code>a</code> occurs in a covariant (or output) position within the definition of the <code>Just</code> constructor.</p>
<p>Now let’s look at the definition of <code>Predicate</code> data type:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/predicate-polarity.png" alt="Polarity of the Predicate data type"></p><p>Polarity of the Predicate data type</p>
</div>
<p>We can see that the type variable <code>a</code> occurs in a contravariant (or input) position. This indicates that we can’t create a (covariant) <code>Functor</code> instance for this data type.</p>
<p>But we want to map things! What do we do?</p>
<h2 id="contravariant">Contravariant</h2>
<p>Welcome the <code>Contravariant</code> typeclass to the stage! It’s defined as:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Contravariant</span> f <span>where</span>
<span>  contramap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f b <span>-&gt;</span> f a</code></pre></div>
<p>Snazzy! <code>Contravariant</code> also takes some kind of type constructor <code>f</code> just like <code>Functor</code> but it has this weirdly named <code>contramap</code> function instead of <code>fmap</code>.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>     fmap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-&gt;</span> f b <span>-- Functor</span>
<span>contramap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> f b <span>-&gt;</span> f a <span>-- Contravariant</span>
                         <span>^^^</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If we read <code>fmap</code> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have an <code>a</code> in some context and a function that takes that <code>a</code> and converts it to a <code>b</code>, I can give you a context with a <code>b</code> in it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we can then read <code>contramap</code> as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have a context that needs an <code>a</code> and a function that can convert <code>b</code>s to <code>a</code>s, I can give you a context that needs <code>b</code>s.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But that probably doesn’t make much sense. So let’s try and look at this in terms of our non-<code>Functor</code>: <code>Predicate</code>. <code>Predicate</code> has a <strong>need</strong> for an <code>a</code>, which it then uses to tell if something about that <code>a</code> is True or False.</p>
<p>Let’s try and write a <code>Contravariant</code> instance for <code>Predicate</code> given that we know that the type <code>a</code> in <code>Predicate</code> occurs in an input position.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Contravariant</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>where</span>
  <span>-- contramp (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f b -&gt; f a</span>
  contramap (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> a <span>-- substituting for `f` for Predicate</span>
  contramap aToB (<span>Predicate</span> bToBool) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\a <span>-&gt;</span> undefined)</code></pre></div>
<p>Given that we have a function <code>a -&gt; b</code> and essentially a function of type <code>b -&gt; Bool</code> (wrapped inside a <code>Predicate b</code>), we can if given an <code>a</code>, convert it to a <code>b</code> using <code>aToB</code> and then give that <code>b</code> to <code>bToBool</code> to give us a <code>Bool</code>.</p>
<p>Here’s a slightly long-form implementation of the <code>Contravariant</code> instance for <code>Predicate</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Contravariant</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>where</span>
<span>  contramap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> a
  contramap aToB (<span>Predicate</span> bToBool) <span>=</span>
    <span>Predicate</span> <span>$</span> \a <span>-&gt;</span>
      <span>let</span> b    <span>=</span> aToB a
          bool <span>=</span> bToBool b
      <span>in</span> bool</code></pre></div>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/contramap-predicate.png" alt="contramap on Predicate"></p><p>contramap on Predicate</p>
</div>
<p>or more succinctly:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Contravariant</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>where</span>
<span>  contramap ::</span> (a <span>-&gt;</span> b) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> b <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Predicate</span> a
  contramap f (<span>Predicate</span> b) <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>$</span> b <span>.</span> f</code></pre></div>
<p>We can see from the definition of <code>Predicate a</code> that all we are doing is running the supplied function <code>f</code> <strong>before</strong> the function within <code>Predicate b</code>. The reason we do that is to adapt a new input type to match an existing input type to gain some functionality.</p>
<p>If we revisit the (covariant) <code>Functor</code> instance for <code>Maybe</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>instance</span> <span>Functor</span> <span>Maybe</span> <span>where</span>
  fmap _ <span>Nothing</span> <span>=</span> <span>Nothing</span>
  fmap aToB (<span>Just</span> a) <span>=</span> <span>Just</span> (aToB a)</code></pre></div>
<p>we can see that the function <code>aToB</code> is run <strong>after</strong> we have a value of <code>a</code>. We do that to convert a result of some type to another type.</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://sanj.ink/images/contravariant/fmap-maybe.png" alt="fmap on Maybe"></p><p>fmap on Maybe</p>
</div>
<p>These are the essential differences between covariant and contravariant functors:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Typeclass</th>
<th>Function runs</th>
<th>Purpose</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Functor</td>
<td>after</td>
<td>Convert results</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Contravariant</td>
<td>before</td>
<td>Adapt inputs</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now that we know the essential difference between <code>Functor</code> and <code>Contravariant</code>, let’s look at how we can use <code>contramap</code> with our <code>Predicate</code> class.</p>
<p>Given that we already have a <code>Predicate</code> that determines whether a number is greater than ten:</p>
<div><pre><code><span>numGreaterThanTen ::</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>Int</span>
numGreaterThanTen <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\n <span>-&gt;</span> n <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>say we want to write another <code>Predicate</code> that verifies that the length of String is greater than ten characters.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>strLengthGreaterThanTen ::</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>String</span>
strLengthGreaterThanTen <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\s <span>-&gt;</span> (length s) <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>Sure, that’s pretty contrived but bear with me. Let’s also say we have a <code>Person</code> data type and we want to know if a person’s name is over ten characters long - if so we consider that to be a long name.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Person</span> <span>=</span> <span>Person</span> {<span> personName ::</span> <span>String</span>,<span> personAge ::</span> <span>Int</span> }

<span>personLongName ::</span> <span>Predicate</span> <span>Person</span>
personLongName <span>=</span> <span>Predicate</span> (\p <span>-&gt;</span> (length <span>.</span> personName <span>$</span> p) <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)</code></pre></div>
<p>And we can run these <code>Predicate</code>s as:</p>
<div><pre><code>getPredicate numGreaterThanTen <span>5</span> <span>-- False</span>
getPredicate numGreaterThanTen <span>20</span> <span>-- True</span>

getPredicate strLengthGreaterThanTen <span>"hello"</span>       <span>-- False</span>
getPredicate strLengthGreaterThanTen <span>"hello world"</span> <span>-- True</span>

getPredicate personLongName <span>$</span> <span>Person</span> <span>"John"</span> <span>30</span>        <span>-- False</span>
getPredicate personLongName <span>$</span> <span>Person</span> <span>"Bartholomew"</span> <span>30</span> <span>-- True</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And this is fine, but there’s some duplication across each of the <code>Predicate</code>s - namely the part where we compare a number to ten:</p>
<div><pre><code>(\n <span>-&gt;</span> n <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>)  <span>-- Int</span>
(\s <span>-&gt;</span> (length s) <span>&gt;</span> <span>10</span>) <span>-- String</span>

<p>It would be nice if we didn’t have to repeat ourselves.</p>
<p>If we look at the differences between <code>numGreaterThanTen</code>, <code>strLengthGreaterThanTen</code> and <code>personLongName</code> we can see that the only difference is that one works on an <code>Int</code> and the others work on <code>String</code> and <code>Person</code> respectively. <code>strLengthGreaterThanTen</code> and <code>personLongName</code> each convert their input types to an <code>Int</code> and then do the same comparison:</p>

<p><em>A new way of operating.</em></p>



<p>This is one of the books every creator should read. It is full of information for those trying to build an online audience. In this new world where information is abundant, it’s hard to be spotted. How to get people to notice your work? How can you get your stuff out there? And how you can get an audience?</p>



<p>Austin starts by this quote:</p>



<blockquote><p>Be so good they can’t ignore you.</p><cite>Steve Martin</cite></blockquote>



<p>And while it’s true, it’s not enough to be good. In order to be found, you have to be findable. This book goes into details on how sharing your work with the world can help you build an audience. The same audience that will help you get your word out once you’re ready.</p>



<p>The book helps you think about your work as a never-ending process and how to share it in a way that attracts people who might be interested in what you do.</p>



<h2>You don’t have to be a genius</h2>



<p>We see a genius as an individual with superhuman talents, free of the influence of a precedent, and with a direct connection to God. When inspiration comes, it strikes like a lighting bolt and then he spends the rest of his time in his studio turning this idea into a masterpiece.</p>



<p>But that’s not true.</p>



<p>Creative work is done in a group. All group members are contributing ideas, stealing from each other, copying, etc. It’s not about how smart you are, but about what you have to contribute, the ideas you share, the quality of connections you make, and the conversations you start. Austin calls this group a <strong>scenius</strong>.</p>



<p>Find your scenius, and be a good contributor.</p>



<hr>



<p>Austin then moves to talk about being an “expert”. He explains how the world is changing at such a rapid pace that it’s turning us all to amateurs. So instead of fighting it, embrace being an amateur.</p>



<p>An amateur is someone following something in the spirit of love. Because they have little to lose, amateurs are willing to try anything and share results.</p>



<blockquote><p>In the beginner’s mind, there are many possibilities. In the expert’s mind, there are only few.</p></blockquote>



<p>On the spectrum of creative work, the difference of mediocre and good is vast. But mediocrity is still on the spectrum, you can move up in increments. The real gap is between doing nothing and doing something. Amateurs know that contributing something is better than contributing nothing.</p>



<p>The best way to start in the path of sharing you work is to commit to learning in front of others. Find a scenius, pay attention to what others are sharing, and then start taking note. Look for voids you can fill with your own efforts, no matter how bad they are at first.</p>



<hr>



<p>On doing what we love, Austin explains how we’ve always been told to find our voice, but we never really know what this means. You can’t find your voice if you don’t use it. So talk about the things you love. Your voice will follow.</p>



<p>When talking about your work, make sure you do it online. In this day and age, if your work isn’t online, it doesn’t exist. We all have the opportunity to use our voices, to have our say, but so many of us are wasting it. If you want people to know about what you do and the things you care about, you have to share them.</p>



<h2>Think process, not product</h2>



<p>In a pre-digital world, the only way an artist could connect with an audience was through a gallery show or art magazine. But today, with social media, an artist can share whatever she wants, whenever she wants, at almost no cost. By sharing her day-to-day process, she can form a unique bond with her audience. <strong>Take people behind the scenes</strong>.</p>



<blockquote><p>People really want to see how sausages get made</p></blockquote>



<p>Become a documentarian of what you do. Let your audience see the person behind the products.</p>



<p>A lot of us go about our work and feel like we have nothing to show for it at the end of the day. But whatever the nature of your work, there is an art to what you do, and <strong>there are people who would be interested in that art</strong>. If only you presented it to them in the right way!</p>



<p>How can you show your work even when you have nothing to show? You need to make stuff (also see my post on <a href="https://elazzabi.com/2020/05/12/how-to-create-a-public-portfolio-when-what-you-do-is-private-or-proprietary/">how to create a public portfolio when your work is private</a>). No one will give a damn about your résumé, they want to see what you have made with your little fingers. Start a journal and write your thoughts, or speak in an audio recorder. Take a lot of photographs of your work at different stages. Shoot videos. etc. This is not about making art, it’s about simply keeping track of what’s going on around you. When you are ready to share, you’ll have a surplus of material to choose from.</p>



<h2>Share something small every day</h2>



<p>Every success needs decades worth of hard work and perseverance. But thankfully, you don’t need that time all in one big chunk. And speaking about chunks, forget big chunks. Forget years, months, weeks… Focus on something small. Focus on days.</p>



<p>Once a day, after you finish your work, go back to your documentation and find one little piece you can share. If you’re just starting, share your influencers and what’s inspiring you. If you’re in the middle, share your process or methods of work. If you completed the project, share the final result. If you have multiple projects in the wild, report how they are doing or share stories about how people are interacting with your work.</p>



<p>The form you use for sharing doesn’t matter. Blog, tweet, video, it doesn’t matter. There’s no one-size-fits-all plan for everybody. Pick what works for you, and stick to it.</p>



<p>Produce and share a lot. <em>Theodore Sturgeon</em>, a fiction author, states that 90% of what we produce is crap, the other 10% is good work. But the problem is we don’t know which is which until we share it with others. So make sure to share a lot, but keep in mind anything you share will be there forever. So don’t share something you don’t want your boss or mom to see.</p>



<hr>



<p>You daily updates will construct what Austin calls the <strong>Flow</strong>. But you need another part to achieve results, and it’s called the <strong>Stock</strong>. If the <em>flow</em> is the daily stream of updates, the <em>stock</em> is the content that will be still interesting in months and years from publication.</p>



<p>Stock is what people discover via search. It’s what spreads slowly but surely, building fans over time. And the magic formula is to <strong>maintain your flow, while working on your stock in the background</strong>.</p>



<p>Your stock is made by collecting, organizing, and expanding upon your flow. Social media is a public notebook where we share our ideas and invite others to share their voice with us. But the thing with notebooks is you need to revisit them in order to make the most out of them.</p>



<p>Social networks are good, but they come and go. If you’re really interested in sharing your work and expressing yourself, nothing beats owning your own space online, a place that you control. Buy a good domain name, and create your blog.</p>



<p>A blog is the perfect machine to turn flow into stocks. One blog post is nothing on its own. But publish a thousand blog posts over a decade, and it turns into your life’s work. This sounds technical, but a few Google searches will show you the way.</p>



<h2><strong>Open your cabinet of curiosities.</strong></h2>



<p>If you happened to be wealthy and educated in the 16th-17th century, chances are you had a cabinet of curiosities. A room filled with rare objects that served as a kind of external display. Books, skeletons, jewels, shells… were all part of the cabinet.</p>



<p>Before we are ready to take the leap of sharing our own work with the world, we can share our tastes in the work of others. Where do you get your inspiration? What do you read? Do you subscribe to anything? What movies do you see?…</p>



<p>When you share this online, always credit people and include a link pointing to the website of the creator.  The number one rule of the Internet is <strong>people are lazy</strong>. If you don’t include a link, no one will bother searching.</p>



<h2>Tell good stories</h2>



<blockquote><p>You might think that the pleasure you get from a painting depends on its color, its shape, and its pattern. And if that’s right, it shouldn’t matter if it’s an original or a forgery. But our brains don’t work like that. When shown an object, a face… people’s assessment -how much they like it- is deeply affected by what you tell them about it</p><cite>Paul Bloom – Psychology Professor</cite></blockquote>



<p>Words matter. Your work doesn’t exist in a vacuum. Whether you realize it or not, you’re already telling a story about your work. Every email you send, tweet, video, comment… they are all contributing to the narrative you’re constantly constructing.  If you want to be more effective when sharing yourself and your work, you need to become a better storyteller. You need to know what a good story is and how to tell one.</p>



<p>To tell a story, you need structure. But sadly, our life is messy. A good pitch has 3 acts: The first act is the past, where you’ve been, what you want, how you came to want it… The second act is the present, where you are now, how you’ve worked hard and used up most of your resources. The third act is the future, where you’re going, and how exactly is the person you’re pitching can help you get there.</p>



<p>Whether you’re telling a finished or unfinished story, always keep your audience in mind. Speak to them directly in plain language. Be brief. Learn to speak. Lear to write. Use spell-check…</p>



<h2>Teach what you know</h2>



<p>Think about what you can share from your process that would benefit your audience. What are your techniques? Are you skilled at using certain tools/materials? The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online. Use pictures, words, and videos. Make people better at something they want to be better at.</p>



<h2>Don’t turn into human spam</h2>



<p>There is a category of humans called human spam. They’re everywhere, and they exist in every profession. They don’t want to pay their dues, they want their piece right away. They don’t listen to your ideas, they tell you theirs. You should …</p></div></div>

<h2><!--more-->Eyebrow segmentation (iOS)</h2>
<p>Our Face AR SDK now supports eyebrow segmentation for iOS and macOS. We trained the neural network to recognize the eyebrows area on the face.</p>

<p>Eyebrow detection can be used in beauty apps for makeup transfer tasks. Or you can integrate it into entertainment apps to cut out the real eyebrows, recolor, or add funny animation.</p>
<h2>New Makeup API</h2>
<p>We’ve been working on alleviating developers’ efforts for makeup try-on app development. Our new <a href="https://docs.banuba.com/docs/effect_constructor/examples/makeup" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>Makeup API</span></a> reduces developers efforts for feature integration, eliminates the handwritten code duplicates and ensures consistency of code. Developers can use ready-made documented methods to call AR beauty features in their apps.</p>
<div data-service="youtube" data-responsive="true"><div><p data-mce-style="position: relative; overflow: hidden; max-width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; margin: 0px;"><iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" xml="lang" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mgXlmffi3g4?feature=oembed" width="480" height="270" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" data-mce-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mgXlmffi3g4?feature=oembed" data-mce-style="position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; border: none;"></iframe></p></div></div>
<p>Additionally, the makeup effect design and customization capabilities extended too. You can create e-commrce try-on apps and advertise specific items or combine makeup into preset looks for beauty and selfie editors.</p>

<hr>

<h2><span>SDK build for MacOS&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>To extend our Face AR SDK platform support, we added the SDK build for MacOS. Developers can now create and preview apps on <span>MacOS 10.13 and up,</span> while users can experience amazing Face AR experiences beyond iPhones, on their desktop too. Refer to the <a href="https://docs.banuba.com/docs/overview/sdk_features" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><span>List of features</span></a> for detailed information about platform availability.</span></p>
<h2><span>Face Tracking Switch Off</span></h2>
<p><span>To minify the SDK size, we added the ability to enable effects and neural networks without face recognizer. Some SDK features like background subtraction or hair detection use neural networks to perform a task and don't require face tracking. By disabling it, developers can decrease the app size and achieve better performance due to saved capacity.</span></p>
<h2><span>Fixed or Adaptive FPS (Android)</span></h2>
<p>Developers can now set camera FPS on Android to fixed or adaptive mode. The fixed mode provides stable FPS values or stops consuming capacity for camera exposure if these values can’t be achieved, e.g. low lighting conditions. The adaptive mode adjusts the camera exposure trying to search for the face even with low lighting conditions.</p>

      <p><a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> (command name <code>rg</code>) is a <code>grep</code> tool, but supports search and replace as well. <code>rg</code> is far from a like-for-like alternate for <code>sed</code>, but it has nifty features like multiline replacement, fixed string matching, <code>PCRE2</code> support, etc. This post gives an overview of syntax for substitution and highlights some of the cases where <code>rg</code> is a handy replacement for <code>sed</code>.</p>

<p>As seen in previous example, <code>rg</code> will search and replace all occurrences. So, you'll have to be creative with regexp to replace only a specific occurrence per input line.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ s=</span><span>'see bat hot at but at go gate at sat at but at'

<h2 id="rust-regex-and-pcre2">Rust regex and PCRE2<a href="#rust-regex-and-pcre2" aria-label="Anchor link for: rust-regex-and-pcre2">🔗</a></h2>
<p>By default, <code>rg</code> uses Rust regular expressions, which is much more featured compared to <code>GNU sed</code>. The main feature not supported is backreference within regexp definition (for performance reasons). See <a href="https://docs.rs/regex/1.3.9/regex/index.html">Rust regex documentation</a> for regular expression syntax and features. <code>rg</code> supports Unicode by default.</p>
<pre><code><span># non-greedy quantifier is supported

$ echo </span><span>"$s" </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>'foo.*?ba' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'[xyz]'

<p>The <code>-P</code> switch will enable <a href="https://www.pcre.org/current/doc/html/index.html">PCRE2</a> flavor, which has even more tricks. You can also use <code>--engine=auto</code> to allow <code>rg</code> to automatically use <code>PCRE2</code> when needed (for example: useful as an alias for <code>rg</code> command so that it gives performance of Rust engine by default and use <code>PCRE2</code> only when needed).</p>
<pre><code><span># backreference within regexp definition

<h2 id="fixed-string-matching">Fixed string matching<a href="#fixed-string-matching" aria-label="Anchor link for: fixed-string-matching">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Like <code>grep</code>, the <code>-F</code> option will allow fixed strings to be matched, a handy option that I feel every search and replace tool should provide.</p>
<pre><code><span>$ </span><span>printf </span><span>'2.3/[4]*6\nfoo\n5.3-[4]*9\n' </span><span>|</span><span> rg </span><span>--</span><span>passthru </span><span>-</span><span>F </span><span>'[4]*' </span><span>-</span><span>r </span><span>'2'

<h2 id="multiline-matching">Multiline matching<a href="#multiline-matching" aria-label="Anchor link for: multiline-matching">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Another handy option is <code>-U</code> which enables multiline matching.</p>

<p>By <b>Susam Pal</b> on 14 Sep 2008</p>

<p>
In this blog post, I will tell you a story about a remarkable
coincidence that occurred last week when a friend of mine and I were
sharing puzzles with each other.
</p>


<h2 id="recurrence-relation"><a href="#recurrence-relation">Recurrence Relation</a></h2>

<p>
While having lunch with my friend, I shared the following problem
involving a recurrence relation:
</p>

<p>
For integers \( n \ge 1 \) and \( k \ge 1, \)

\[
  f_k(n) =
    \begin{cases}
      n                       &amp; \text{if } k = 1, \\
      \sum_{i=1}^n f_{k-1}(i) &amp; \text{if } k &gt; 0.
    \end{cases}
\]

Find a closed-form expression for \( f_k(n). \)
</p>


<h2 id="nested-loops"><a href="#nested-loops">Nested Loops</a></h2>

<p>
Soon after I shared the above problem, he gave me a problem of his own.
Here is the problem shared by him:
</p>

<div>
<p>
Consider the following pseudocode with <code>k</code> nested loops.
</p>
<pre><code>x = 0
for c<sub>1</sub> in 1 to n:
    for c<sub>2</sub> in 1 to c<sub>1</sub>:
        ...
            for c<sub>k</sub> in 1 to c<sub>k-1</sub>:
                x = x + 1</code>
</pre>
<p>
What is the final value of <code>x</code> after the outermost loop
terminates?
</p>
</div>


<h2 id="coincidence"><a href="#coincidence">Coincidence</a></h2>

<p>
With one problem each, we went back to our desks. As I began solving the
<em>nested loops</em> problem shared by him, I realized that the
solution to his problem led me to the <em>recurrence relation</em> in
the problem I shared with him.
</p>

<p>
In the <em>nested loops</em> problem, if \( k = 1, \) the final value of
\( x \) after the loop terminates is \( x = n. \) This is also the value
of \( f_1(n). \)
</p>

<p>
If \( k = 2, \) the inner loop with counter \( c_2 \) runs
once when \( c_1 = 1, \) twice when \( c_1 = 2, \) and so on.
Therefore after the loop terminates, \( x = 1 + 2 + \dots + n =
\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}. \) Note that this series is same as \( f_2(n) =
f_1(1) + f_1(2) + \dots + f_1(n). \)
</p>

<p>
Extending this argument, we now see that for any \( k &gt; 0, \) the final
value of \( x \) is

\[
f_k(n) = f_{k-1}(1) + f_{k-1}(2) + \dots + f_{k-1}(n).
\]

In other words, the solution to his <em>nested loops</em> problem is the
solution to my <em>recurrence relation</em> problem. It was an
interesting coincidence that the problems we shared with each other had
the same solution.
</p>


<h2 id="closed-form-expression"><a href="#closed-form-expression">Closed-Form Expression</a></h2>
<p>
The closed form expression for the recurrence relation is

\[
f_k(n) = \binom{n + k - 1}{k}.
\]
</p>

<p>
It is quite easy to prove this using the principle of mathematical
induction. Since we know that this is also the result of the <em>nested
loops</em> problem, we can also arrive at this result by another way.
</p>

<p>
In the <em>nested loops</em> problem, the following condition is always
met due to the loop conditions:

\[
n \ge c_1 \ge c_2 \ge \dots \ge c_k \ge 1.
\]
</p>

<p>
The variables \( c_1, c_2, \dots, c_k \) take every possible choice
of integer values that satisfy the above condition. If we find out how
many such choices are there, we would know how many times the
variable \( x \) is incremented.
</p>

<p>
Therefore the final value of \( x \) is the number of possible ways of
arranging \( k \) numbers from the first \( n \) natural numbers in
descending order. To find this number, let us consider \( n \)
similar balls and \( k \) similar sticks. For every possible permutation
of these balls and sticks such that there is at least one ball to the
right of the rightmost stick, if we count the number of balls to the
right of the \( i \)th stick, we get a number that the variable \( c_i
\) (the counter variable in the \( i \)th loop statement) holds in some
iteration of its loop. Therefore the variable \( c_i \) is represented
as the number of balls lying on the right side of the \( i \)th stick
where \( 1 \le i \le k. \)
</p>

<p>
The above argument holds good because the first stick has more balls to
its right than the second one, the second stick has more balls to its
right than the third one, and so on, so \( n \ge c_1 \ge c_2 \ge \dots
\ge c_k \) is always satisfied. Further, we have added the constraint
that at least one ball must lie on the right side of the \( k \)th
stick, so \( c_k \ge 1. \) Also, any set of valid values for \( c_1,
c_2, \dots, c_k \) can be represented as an arrangement of these sticks
and balls.
</p>

<p>
To compute the number of permutations of \( n \) similar balls and \( k
\) similar sticks such that there is at least one ball to the right side
of the rightmost stick, we need to consider the rightmost ball to be
fixed in its position in all permutations. Thus we are left with only \(
n - 1 \) similar balls and \( k \) similar sticks that we can rearrange
in different ways. The number of permutations of \( n - 1 \) similar
balls and \( k \) similar sticks is

\[
\frac{(n + k - 1)!}{(n - 1)! k!} = \binom{n + k - 1}{k}.
\]
</p>

<p>
This closed-form expression is the solution to both the <em>recurrence
relation</em> problem and the <em>nested loops</em> problem.
</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Searching for an open-source Google Analytics alternative?</em></p><p><em>Our guest has your back. Uku Täht is the founder of <a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a>, an open-source web analytics project built with Elixir. For the last couple of months, his project has attracted a lot of attention through <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics">informative blog posts</a> and very positive user reviews.</em></p><p><em>In this interview, we talk about his use of Elixir in production: the benefits, the downsides, the specifics, and why Elixir is so good for projects like Plausible Analytics.</em></p><h2 id="interview-with-uku-t%C3%A4ht">Interview with Uku Täht</h2><p><strong>Could you tell us a little about your company and your role there?</strong></p><p>Plausible Analytics is an open-source project dedicated to making web analytics more privacy-friendly. Our mission is to reduce corporate surveillance by providing an alternative web analytics tool that doesn’t have any links to AdTech.</p><p>I started building Plausible almost two years ago as a side project. I’ve been working on it full-time since the beginning of this year and I’ve also partnered up with Marko who handles the marketing and communication side of things.</p><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/uj/ujixp3oy.2_(22)_(1).jpg" alt="ujixp3oy.2_(22)_(1).jpg"></p><hr><center><i>Uku Täht, the founder of Plausible Analytics.</i></center><p><strong>What is the key feature or set of features that make using Plausible Analytics a feasible replacement over Google Analytics?</strong></p><p>Google Analytics is overkill for most website owners. Plausible cuts through the noise by presenting all the important website traffic insights and metrics on one single page. You don’t need training or experience in web analytics to get started.</p><p>Keeping the script lightweight is also a priority. Our script is more than 17 times smaller than the Google Analytics script and more than 45 times smaller than the recommended Google Analytics integration using the Google Tag Manager.</p><p>But the biggest reason to choose Plausible is the fact that we’re committed to building open source software. The code behind our service is freely available for anyone. By using Plausible you help build software that everyone can benefit from, not just the corporations.</p><p><strong>How did Elixir as the language of choice work for you when implementing these features?</strong></p><p>I think Elixir is perfect for our use-case. It’s a very productive language once you learn it and it can also handle tons of traffic. Last month we processed 60 million pageviews with absolutely no issues.</p><p>Elixir really shines when you have stateful requirements for the app server. For example, we keep all the active sessions in memory so we don’t have to look a session up from the database on every event. It was a joy to build this part of the app using the GenServer primitives.</p><p><strong>How much did the fact that your product is not only self-hosted but also a SaaS inform your decision to go with Elixir? Did you choose it to scale a SaaS?</strong></p><p>I do believe that using Elixir allows us to make self-hosting a bit easier. In other languages, it’s common to use tools like Redis and external message queues but in Elixir we can often avoid these extra tools and keep the infrastructure requirements simple.</p><p>Plausible is currently designed to run on just one node. Once we start building out support for multi-node deployments, things will get really interesting. I feel like Elixir and the BEAM are designed perfectly for our use-case where we need multiple nodes to share state about visitors sessions.</p><p>Hopefully, we can evolve the architecture without needing extra infrastructure bits and pieces. The goal is to keep the requirements as simple as possible so everyone can run the code on their own server. By relying on BEAM fundamentals, we can probably avoid in-memoy stores, external message queues, and cluster managers altogether, making Plausible easy to self-host.</p><p><strong>Could you tell us more about your deployment: where do you host, how do you deploy, do you use the hot code reload functionality?</strong></p><p>We <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/made-in-eu">recently moved</a> from Heroku to using Digital Ocean. I wanted to eat our own dog food when it comes to the Docker infrastructure we built for self-hosting. So now we have a Digital Ocean droplet pre-configured with Docker and we just pull new images from our <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/plausible/analytics">DockerHub</a>.</p><p>Since we have a single node deployment, we do have ~30 seconds of downtime on each deploy and we don’t have auto-scaling support. We will deal with these issues as we scale, I just wanted to be upfront about the downsides of how we’re running it.</p><p>We don’t use hot code reloading since it doesn’t play well with the Docker flow.</p><p><strong>What was the biggest challenge while developing Plausible Analytics with Elixir?</strong></p><p>We use a database called Clickhouse for storing our stats. It’s a fairly new and cutting-edge database and it doesn’t have a robust integration with Elixir yet. We use a low-level connection library which gives us random errors sometimes.</p><p>I’m thinking about taking the time to write a proper Ecto adapter for Clickhouse so we can run migrations and have better error handling. It’s easy to complain about the lack of libraries in the Elixir ecosystem but I’d like to do my part in helping the ecosystem thrive.</p><p><strong>Are you satisfied with the result?</strong></p><p>Definitely. If I could go back and do it all over, I would choose the same stack again. Elixir+Phoenix is really fun to work with and it performs even better than I expected.</p><p><strong>Any key takeaways that you would like to share with our audience?</strong></p><p>Elixir is a wonderful language and its ecosystem is really coming along. I would encourage everyone to give it a try and contribute back to the ever-growing list of libraries and frameworks to make it even more powerful.</p><hr><p>I’d like to thank Uku for the interview! If you want to see more examples of Elixir used in production, check out <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/elixir-in-production-venu">our interview</a> with one of the Venu co-founders or read our post about <a href="https://serokell.io/blog/elixir-companies">companies that use Elixir</a>.</p><p>Additionally, if you have your own Elixir in production story to tell (both good and bad), we definitely want to hear it!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p><b>Corto</b> is a library for compression and decompression meshes and point clouds (C++ and Javascript).
</p><p>Source code can be found on <a href="https://github.com/cnr-isti-vclab/corto">Github</a></p>

<p>Corto supports point clouds and meshes with per vertex attributes: normals, colors, texture coordinates and custom attributes.</p>


<p>The main focus of this work is on decompression speed, see performances, both for C++ lib and javascript, while still providing good compression rates.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="#corto">corto</a> is program to compress .ply and .obj models
</li><li><a href="#libcorto">libcorto</a> is a C++ compression/decompression library
</li><li><a href="#corto.js">corto.js</a> a javascript library for .crt decompression
</li><li><a href="#cortoloader">CORTOLoader</a>, a threejs loader.
</li></ul>

<p>This work is based on the compression algorithm developed for the <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/nexus">Nexus</a> project for creation and visualization of multiresolution models. This approach has many advantages for large models in term of streaming and adaptive rendering.<br>
See <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/Publications/2015/PD15/">Fast decompression for web-based view-dependent 3D rendering</a>.</p>

</div> <!--row -->

<h2><a name="corto"></a>Corto</h2>

<p>A small executable to convert <em>.ply</em> and <em>.obj</em> into compressed format <em>.crt</em></p>

<pre>Usage:

corto [options] FILE

FILE is the path to a .ply or a .obj 3D model.

	-o &lt;output&gt;: filename of the .crt compressed file.
						if not specified the extension of the input file will be replaced.
	-e &lt;key=value&gt;: add an exif property, or more than one.
	-p : treat the input as a point cloud.
	-v &lt;bits&gt;: vertex bits quantization. If not specified an euristic is used
	-n &lt;bits&gt;: normal bits quantization. Default 10.
	-c &lt;bits&gt;: color bits quantization. Default 6.
	-u &lt;bits&gt;: texture coordinate bits. Default 10.
	-q &lt;step&gt;: quantization step unit (float) instead of bits for vertex coordinates
	-N &lt;prediction&gt;: normal prediction can be:
						delta: use difference from previous normal (fastest)
						 estimated: use difference from compute normals (cheaper)
						border: store difference only for boundary vertices (cheapest)
	-A : compute and add normals to the model.
	-P &lt;file.ply&gt;: decompress and save as .ply for debugging purpouses
</pre>

<p>Material groups for obj (newmtl) and ply with texnumbers are preserved into the crt model, additional properties can be stored in the file using the <em>-e</em> option.</p>

<p><em>-v 12</em> will result in the quantization of the coordinates to 1/4096th of the largest dimension in the bounding box. If not specified the quantization step is set to 1/20th of the average edge.</p>

<p><em>-n 10</em> normals are stored using the octahedron parametrization to a square of 1024x1024 positions, resulting in a better sample distribution than quantization in 3D.</p>


<h2><a name="cortoloader"></a>CORTOLoader</h2>

<p>CORTOLoader.js is similar to THREE.OBJLoader in functionality, and can easily replace it in three.js.</p>

<pre>var loader = new THREE.CORTOLoader({ path: "models/" });  
//materials autocreated, pass otherwise option loadMaterial: false

loader.load("bunny.crt", function(mesh) {
	//needed to render on texture load
	mesh.addEventListener("change", render);

	if(!mesh.geometry.attributes.normal)
		mesh.geometry.computeVertexNormals();

	scene.add(mesh); 
	render();
});
</pre>

<p>CORTOLoader is pretty self-explanatory in how to create a THREE.Mesh:</p>

<pre>var decoder = new CortoDecoder(blob); //where blob is an ArrayBuffer
var model = decoder.decode();

var geometry = new THREE.BufferGeometry();
if(model.nface)
	geometry.setIndex(new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.index, 1));

if(model.groups.length &gt; 0) {
	var start = 0;
	for(var i = 0; i &lt; model.groups.length; i++) {
		var g = model.groups[i];
		geometry.addGroup(start*3, g.end*3, i);
		start = g.end;
	}
}

geometry.addAttribute('position', new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.position, 3));
if(model.color)
	geometry.addAttribute('color', new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.color, 3, true));
if (model.normal)
	geometry.addAttribute('normal', new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.normal, 3, true));
if (model.uv)
	geometry.addAttribute('uv', new THREE.BufferAttribute(model.uv, 2));

var mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry);
</pre>



<h2><a name="corto.js"></a>Corto.js</h2>

<p>CortoDecoder class decodes a .crt as an arraybuffer and returns an objects with attributes (positions, index, colors etc).</p>

<pre>&lt;script src="js/corto.js"&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;script&gt;
var request = new XMLHttpRequest();
request.open('GET', 'bunny.crt');
request.responseType = 'arraybuffer';
request.onload = function() {
	var decoder = new CortoDecoder(this.response);
	var model = decoder.decode();
	console.log(model.nvert, model.nface, model.groups);
	console.log('Index: ', model.index);
	console.log('Positions: ', model.position);
	console.log('Colors: ', model.color);
	console.log('Nornmals: ', model.normal);
	console.log('Tex coords: ', model.uv);
	//custom attributes can be encoded, see cortolib below for details.
}
request.send();
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre>

<h2><a name="libcorto"></a>Libcorto</h2>

<p>Interface is not entirely stable, no mayor change is expected. See src/main.cpp for an extensive example.</p>

<pre>#include &lt;corto/encoder.h&gt;
#include &lt;corto/decoder.h&gt;

std::vector&lt;float&gt; coords;
std::vector&lt;uint32_t&gt; index;
std::vector&lt;float&gt; uv;
std::vector&lt;float&gt; radius;

//fill data arrays...

crt::Encoder encoder(nvert, nface);

//add attributes to be encoded
encoder.addPositions(coords.data(), index.data(), vertex_quantization_step);
encoder.addUvs(uvs.data(), pow(2, -uv_bits));

//add custom attributes
encoder.addAttribute("radius", (char *)radiuses.data(), crt::VertexAttribute::FLOAT, 1, 1.0f);

const char *compressed_data = encoder.stream.data();
const uint32_t compressed_size = encoder.stream.size();
Decoding

crt::Decoder decoder(size, data);

//allocate memory if needed
coords.resize(decoder.nvert*3);
index.resize(decoder.nface*3);

//tell the decoder where to decompress data
decoder.setPositions(coords.data());

if(decoder.data.count("uv")) {
	out.uvs.resize(decoder.nvert*2);
	decoder.setUvs(out.uvs.data());
}
//actually decode
decoder.decode();
</pre>

<h3><a name="encoder"></a>Encoder</h3>

<pre>Encoder(uint32_t _nvert, uint32_t _nface = 0, Stream::Entropy entropy = Stream::TUNSTALL);
</pre>

<p>The Encoder class assume the input is an indexed mesh, specify the number of vertices and faces (0 for point clouds). For debug or entropy compression test Stream supports lzip and lz4, they can be enabled defining ENTROPY_TESTS in the makefile.</p>

<p>Vertex coordinates, attributes and indices are passed to the encoder (assuming they respect the nvert, nface paramenters: 3*nvert for positions and normals, 4*nvert for colors, 2*nvert for uv, 3*nface for indices)</p>

<h4>Coordinates</h4>

<pre>bool addPositions(const float *buffer, float q = 0.0f, Point3f o = Point3f(0.0f)); //for point clouds
bool addPositions(const float *buffer, const uint32_t *index, float q = 0.0f, Point3f o = Point3f(0.0f));
bool addPositions(const float *buffer, const uint16_t *index, float q = 0.0f, Point3f o = Point3f(0.0f));
</pre>

<p><em>q</em> specify the quantization parameter, while <em>o</em> the origin of the quantization (v[i*3+k] = (buffer[i*3+k] - o[k])/q</p>
<p>If q is not specified the quantization step is estimated as 1/20th of the average edge length (or a function of the volume and number of the points
for point clouds).</p>

<pre>bool addPositionsBits(const float *buffer, int bits);
bool addPositionsBits(const float *buffer, uint32_t *index, int bits);
bool addPositionsBits(const float *buffer, uint16_t *index, int bits);
</pre>

<p>It might be more convenient to specify quantization step in term of the bits needed per coordinate</p>

<h4>Attributes</h4>

<pre>bool addNormals(const float *buffer, int bits, NormalAttr::Prediction no = NormalAttr::ESTIMATED);
bool addNormals(const int16_t *buffer, int bits, NormalAttr::Prediction no = NormalAttr::ESTIMATED);

bool addColors(const unsigned char *buffer, int rbits = 6, int gbits = 7, int bbits = 6, int abits = 5);

bool addUvs(const float *buffer, float q = 0);
</pre>

<p>Normal quantization is expressed in bits, referring to the octahedron parametrization space.</p>
<p>Prediction for normal attribute can be</p>
<ul>
<li>DELTA: difference from previous normal, it's fast but provide less compression
</li><li>ESTIMATED: difference from normal estimated from the vertex coordinates (and wont apply to point clouds)
slower than DELTA, but especially when coordinates are saved with high precision will provide better compression
</li><li>BORDER: will only preserve boundary normals. This is especially useful if the model is split into pieces
(for example in <a href="http://vcg.isti.cnr.it/nexus">Nexus</a> multiresolution viewer.
</li></ul>
<p>Color quantization for red, green, blue, alpha. Internally the color is stored as 
poor man YCbCr color space (where G estimates Y!), might be changed to something better and quantization refer to the internal space</p>

<h4>Generic attributes</h4>

<pre>bool addAttribute(const char *name, const char *buffer, VertexAttribute::Format format, 
	int components, float q, uint32_t strategy = 0);
bool addAttribute(const char *name, char *buffer, VertexAttribute *attr);
</pre>

<h4>Groups</h4>

<pre>void addGroup(int end_triangle);
void addGroup(int end_triangle, std::map<std::string, std::string=""> &amp;props);
</std::string,></pre>

<h4>Result</h4>

<pre>void encode();
</pre>

<p>After the decode call the numnber of vertices and faces might be different: degenerate triangles are removed and duplicated points
in point clouds are also removed</p>

<pre>uint32_t nvert = encoder.nvert;
uint32_t nface = encoder.nface;
</pre>

<p>The <em>.crt</em> bytes are stored in the <em>stream</em> member</p>

<pre>size_t count = encoder.stream.size();
size_t written = fwrite ( encoder.stream.data(), 1, count, file);
</pre>

<p>For details on compression bitrates see <em>main.cpp</em>.</p>





<h3><a name="decoder"></a>Decoder</h3>

<pre>Decoder(int len, const uchar *input);
</pre>

<p>Upon initializatiom, the decoder class will provide info about what is presente in the <em>.crt</em>, default attributes
are <em>position, normal, color, uv</em>.</p>

<pre>uint32_t nvert = encoder.nvert;
uint32_t nface = encoder.nface;

bool hasAttr(const char *name);
</pre>

<p>You are in charge to pass the decoder an allocated memory buffer where to decode attributes and index</p>

<pre>	bool setPositions(float *buffer);
	bool setNormals(float *buffer);
	bool setNormals(int16_t *buffer);
	bool setColors(uchar *buffer);
	bool setUvs(float *buffer);

	void setIndex(uint32_t *buffer);
	void setIndex(uint16_t *buffer);
</pre>

<p>Custom attributes can be requested, either using the default attribute type or a custom class.</p>

<pre>	bool setAttribute(const char *name, char *buffer, …</pre></div></div>

<p>When writing <abbr title="command-line interface">CLI</abbr> code, I often needed to handle cancellation – for instance, when a user presses CTRL+C producing an interrupt signal. Another possible use case is to handle graceful termination of HTTP servers using <code>http.*Server.Shutdown(ctx)</code>.</p>
<p>I had to write code using the signal package often and in multiple places. I didn’t want that, so I wrote the <a href="https://github.com/henvic/ctxsignal">ctxsignal</a> package to solve this common problem two years ago.</p>
<p>However, I kept finding it in other places and noticing people would often not handle proper termination correctly or at all, so I got motivated to submit a proposal and try to improve this situation.</p>

<p>Please note that the second returned value of the <code>signal.NotifyContext</code> function is a function called <code>stop</code> instead of <code>cancel</code>. Once you’re done handling a system signal, you should call <code>stop</code>. We call it <code>stop</code> instead of <code>cancel</code> because you need to call it to stop capturing any further system signal you registered with <code>NotifyContext</code>.</p>

<p>The stop function unregisters the signal behavior, which, like signal.Reset, may restore the default behavior for a given signal.</p>

<p>Over the years, I’ve discovered many techniques in learning how to design
as-safe-as-possible, misuse-resistant cryptographic libraries for some fairly
complex primitives, which I’d like to share in the hopes that we can continue to
progress the state-of-the-art in cryptography towards greater safety at
decreased cost to both cryptographers and security engineers.  Time permitting,
I hope to eventually turn this into a series of&nbsp;posts.</p>
<p>The typestate pattern is one I’ve greatly appreciated but didn’t have a name for
before reading <a href="http://cliffle.com/blog/rust-typestate/">this article</a>.  I
highly recommend reading it, and I won’t be reviewing it in detail here.  The
tl;dr is that you encode your state machine into a type system, such that invalid
state changes are caught at compile time rather than&nbsp;runtime.</p>


<p>Take, for example, this stubbed out implementation of a two-round distributed
key generation&nbsp;protocol.</p>
<pre>use curve25519_dalek::ristretto::RistrettoPoint;
use curve25519_dalek::scalar::Scalar;

pub struct Commitment(pub(crate) RistrettoPoint);
pub struct SecretKeyShard(pub(crate) Vec&lt;Scalar&gt;);
pub struct PublicKeyShard(pub(crate) Scalar);
pub struct ProofOfKnowledgeOfSecretKeyShard(pub(crate) Scalar, pub(crate) Scalar);

impl ProofOfKnowledgeOfSecretKeyShard {
    /// Prove in zero-knowledge a secret key.
    pub fn prove(
        secret: &amp;SecretKeyShard
    ) -&gt; ProofOfKnowledgeOfSecretKeyShard {
        // ...
    }

    /// Verify a proof of knowledge of a secret key.
    pub fn verify(
        &amp;self,
    ) -&gt; Result&lt;(), ()&gt; {
        // ...
    }
}

pub struct DistributedKeyGeneration {};

impl DistributedKeyGeneration {
    /// Generate a shard of the eventual shared secret, and form some
    /// commitments and a zero-knowledge proof regarding those secrets, in order
    /// to prevent rogue-key attacks, and send the commitments and proof to the
    /// other participants for checking.
    pub fn round_one_init(
    ) -&gt; (SecretKeyShard, ProofOfKnowledgeOfSecretKeyShard, Vec&lt;Commitment&gt;) {
        // ...
    }

    /// Check the commitments and proofs that were sent by the other participants.
    pub fn round_one_finish(
        proofs: &amp;Vec&lt;ProofOfKnowledgeOfSecretKeyShard&gt;,
    ) -&gt; Result&lt;(), ()&gt; {
        for proof in proofs.iter() {
            proof.verify()?;
        }
        // ...
    }

    /// Each participant uses their secret shard to evaluate a different shard
    /// of the eventual shared public key, which they send to each respective
    /// participant.
    pub fn round_two_init(
        secret: &amp;SecretKeyShard,
    ) -&gt; Vec&lt;PublicKeyShard&gt; {
        // ...
    }

    /// Verify the public shards received from the other participants, aborting
    /// on failure, then compute our long-lived signing key and a proof of its
    /// correctness.
    pub fn round_two_finish(
        secret: &amp;SecretKeyShard,
        public_shards: &amp;Vec&lt;PublicKeyShard&gt;,
        commitments: &amp;Vec&lt;Commitment&gt;,
    ) -&gt; Result&lt;(), ()&gt; {
        // ...
    }
}
</pre>

<p>It’s already doing better than many cryptographic APIs I’ve seen in the&nbsp;wild:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rather than passing around blobby arrays of bytes, it’s at least using the
  type system to do basic things, like ensuring that pieces of the secret key
  shards are kept separate and treated differently to the public key shards,
  even though they share the same underlying mathematical&nbsp;objects.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It has basic documentation, stating what actions — outside the scope of this
  cryptographic library — should be done with the return values.  (E.g. “send
  the commitments and proof to the other participants for&nbsp;checking”.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It attempts to use intuitive naming for types and variables, rather than
  condensing things in to nearly indecipherable acronyms, or — even worse —
  using inexplicable¹ single-letter function/variable&nbsp;names.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>¹ <span>IMHO</span> it’s okay to use single-letter variable names when mirroring the names
used in a paper, and leaving comments to make it clear what the object actually
is, however in all likelihood this isn’t code that should be exposed to a
security&nbsp;engineer.</p>
<p>So how could it be&nbsp;better?</p>
<p>This is precisely where the typestate pattern shines.  The above code would
allow a developer to&nbsp;do:</p>
<pre>let (secret, nipk_of_secret, commitments) = DistributedKeyGeneration::round_one();

send_to_participants(nipk_of_secret, commitments);

let public = DistributedKeyGeneration::round_two_init(&amp;secret);
</pre>

<p>Depending on the specifics of the protocol, skipping the call to
<code>DistributedKeyGeneration::round_one_finish()</code> allows for a
<a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/417">rogue-key attack</a>, where a rogue participant
creates a crafted public key shard which negates the contribution to a signature
from the targeted other&nbsp;participant(s).</p>
<p>Let’s see instead how this known attack could be eliminated entirely <i>by
making it discoverable at compile-time</i>.</p>
<pre>use curve25519_dalek::ristretto::RistrettoPoint;
use curve25519_dalek::scalar::Scalar;

pub struct Commitment(pub(crate) RistrettoPoint);
pub struct SecretKeyShard(pub(crate) Vec&lt;Scalar&gt;);
pub struct PublicKeyShard(pub(crate) Scalar);
pub struct ProofOfKnowledgeOfSecretKeyShard(pub(crate) Scalar, pub(crate) Scalar);

impl ProofOfKnowledgeOfSecretKeyShard {
    /// Prove in zero-knowledge a secret key.
    pub fn prove(
        secret: &amp;SecretKeyShard
    ) -&gt; ProofOfKnowledgeOfSecretKeyShard {
        // ...
    }

    /// Verify a proof of knowledge of a secret key.
    pub fn verify(
        &amp;self,
    ) -&gt; Result&lt;(), ()&gt; {
        // ...
    }
}

pub type DistributeKeyGenerationState = DistributedKeyGenerationRound1;

pub struct DistributedKeyGenerationRound1 {
    pub(crate) secret_shards: SecretKeyShard,
    pub proof: ProofOfKnowledgeOfSecretKeyShard,
    pub commitments: Vec&lt;Commitment&gt;,
}; 

impl DistributedKeyGenerationRound1 {
    /// Generate a shard of the eventual shared secret, and form some
    /// commitments and a zero-knowledge proof regarding those secrets, in order
    /// to prevent rogue-key attacks, and send the commitments and proof to the
    /// other participants for checking.
    pub fn init(
    ) -&gt; DistributedKeyGenerationRound1 {
        // ...
    }

    /// Check the commitments and proofs that were sent by the other participants.
    /// Only progress to round 2 if the verifications passed.
    pub fn progress(
        &amp;self,
        proofs: &amp;Vec&lt;ProofOfKnowledgeOfSecretKeyShard&gt;,
    ) -&gt; Result<distributedkeygenerationround2, ()=""> {
        for proof in proofs.iter() {
            proof.verify()?;
        }

        // ...

        Ok(DistributedKeyGenerationRound2a{ secret_shards: self.secret_shards.clone() }
    }
}

pub struct DistributedKeyGenerationRound2a {
    pub(crate) secret_shards: SecretKeyShard,
}

impl DistributedKeyGenerationRound2a {
    /// Each participant uses their secret shard to evaluate a different shard
    /// of the eventual shared public key, which they send to each respective
    /// participant.
    pub fn progress(
        &amp;self,
    ) -&gt; DistributedKeyGenerationRound2b {
        // ...
    }
}

pub struct DistributedKeyGenerationRound2b {
    pub(crate) secret_shards: SecretKeyShard,
    pub public_shards: Vec&lt;PublicKeyShard&gt;,
}

impl DistributedKeyGenerationRound2b {
    /// Verify the public shards received from the other participants, aborting
    /// on failure, then compute our long-lived signing key and a proof of its
    /// correctness.
    pub fn finish(
        &amp;self,
    ) -&gt; GroupPublicKey {
        // ...
    }
}

pub struct GroupPublicKey(pub RistrettoPoint);
</distributedkeygenerationround2,></pre>

<p>With these changes, the code of a security developer would likely look more like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre>let state = DistributedKeyGeneration::init();

let proofs = collect_proofs_from_other_participants();

let state = state.progress(&amp;proofs)?.progress();

send_public_shards_to_other_participants(state.public_shards);

let group_public_key = state.progress();
</pre>

<p>If any of the state machine update functions are ever called without the correct
context, the compiler catches the mistake, thus enforcing safety against
cryptographic attacks before they&nbsp;occur.</p>
<p>This is, albeit, a pretty trivial and simple toy example.  There are many other
things we could do with a decent type system to improve this code, including but
not limited&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Providing a <code>RoundTwo</code> trait for genericising over the two typestates in the
second round of the&nbsp;protocol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/future-proofing.html#sealed-traits-protect-against-downstream-implementations-c-sealed">the sealed design pattern</a>
to prevent third parties from creating further implementations of valid
<code>RoundTwo</code> states.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Avoiding repeated <code>clone()</code>/<code>copy()</code> of data in the state machine (e.g. the
<code>secret_shards</code> which get copied multiple times in the above example) by abusing
yet another empty trait which is implemented for all typestates to store the
actual state in a heap-allocated pointer (e.g. <code>Box&lt;ActualState&gt;</code>) which is
copied&nbsp;instead.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’d like to see a more complex example of these design patterns all put
together, I have
<a href="https://github.com/isislovecruft/ed25519-dalek/blob/9e44fb1c6e060bce9e54480ce1c7387d13c17b75/src/state.rs">a rough draft implementation</a>
of the <span>MSDL</span> protocol from

</div>
</div>
<p>Note two things about the rust-analyzer’s tree:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There’s an (incomplete) “function” node for <code>fn foo(</code>.
Unclosed parenthesis doesn’t preclude the parser from recognizing parameter list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Incomplete function does not prevent struct definition from being recognized.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>These are important for IDE support.</p>
<p>For example, suppose that the cursor is just after <code>(</code>.
If we have rust-analyzer’s syntax tree, than we can figure out that we are completing a function parameter.
If we are to get fancy we might find the calls to the (not yet fully written) <code>foo</code>, run type inference to figure out the type of the first argument, and than suggest parameter name &amp; type based on that (not currently implemented — there’s soooooo much yet to be done in rust-analyzer).
And correctly recognizing <code>struct S</code> is important to not break type-inference in the code which uses <code>S</code>.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of literature about error recovery for LR parsers, how come academics haven’t figured this out already?
I have a bold claim to make: error-recovery research in academia is focusing on a problem irrelevant for IDEs.
Specifically, the research is focused on finding “minimal cost repair sequence”:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>a set of edit operations is defined (skip, change or insert token),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a “cost” metric is defined to distinguish big and small edits,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an algorithm is devised to find the smallest edit which makes the current text parse.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>This is a very academia-friendly problem — there’s a precise mathematical formulation, there’s an obvious brute force solution (try all edits), and there’s ample space for finding polynomial algorithm.</p>
<p>But IDEs don’t care about actually guessing &amp; repairing the text!
They just need to see as much of (possibly incomplete) syntax nodes in the existing text as possible.
When rust-analyzer’s parser produces</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
</pre></td><td><pre>  PARAM_LIST@6..7
    L_PAREN@6..7 "("
STRUCT@9..31
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>it doesn’t think “Oh, I need to insert <code>)</code> here to complete the list of parameters”.
Rather, it sees <code>struct</code> and thinks “Oh wow, didn’t expect that! I guess I’ll just stop parsing parameter list right here”.</p>
<p>So, here’s</p>
<div>

<p>Note that error resilience is a topic orthogonal to error reporting.
I haven’t payed much attention to error reporting (in my experience, synchronous reporting of syntax errors in the editor compensates for bad syntax error messages), but it might be the case that MCRS are a good approach to there.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article> <header>  <br> <span> <i></i><!-- _includes/date_translate.html --> September 16, 2020 </span> <span>|</span> <span> <i title="Estimated reading time"></i><span> 4 mins </span> </span> <!-- _includes/author_articles_link.html -->  </header> <section> <!-- Content --> <div> <p>HTTPS is at the center of virtually all of our regular use of the global Internet. Facebook, Google, Amazon, Twitter, this blog and surely your favorite cooking-recipe website use HTTPS. In an ecosystem where even the most basic security measures are sometimes neglected, let’s take a look at how to implement HTTPS on your own website and why you should do so.</p> <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2> <p>This two-part article has a twofold objective: to raise awareness about the use of HTTPS (whether as a simple Internet user or as an administrator) and to show that its implementation is (no longer) intricated.</p> <p>This first part will deal with the theory behind the HTTPS. What is HTTPS? Why use it and therefore why implement it?</p> <h2 id="https-what-is-it">HTTPS: what is it?</h2> <h2 id="a-secure-version-of-http">A “secure” version of HTTP</h2> <p>HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the communication protocol used on the web to navigate, especially on websites accessible through your favorite browser. Thus, when you load a web page, the browser sends the request to the target server, which responds with the requested web page. All this is done in HTTP, and in the best case scenario, in HTTPS.</p> <h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?</h3> <p>Without the secure - encrypted - layer of HTTPS, all communication is done “in clear”, that is to say potentially readable or even modifiable by anyone between you (the client) and the server. HTTPS, by encrypting the communication through SSL/TLS, protects the data traveling through HTTP by making it understandable only to the recipient. To make sure that the recipient server is the one it claims to be, HTTPS authenticates the target with certificates, usually called “SSL Certificates”.</p> <p><img src="https://blog.eleven-labs.com/en/assets/2018-05-09-https-part-01/http-vs-https.png" alt="HTTP-VS-HTTPS"></p> <h2 id="le-https--pourquoi-est-ce-si-important-">Le HTTPS : pourquoi est-ce si important ?</h2> <h3 id="to-avoid-the-man-in-the-middle">To avoid the “Man in the middle”.</h3> <p>As I said before, in simple HTTP all communications are transparent, therefore fully accessible to anyone between you and the server. Taking advantage of such a situation is called a “Man-in-the-middle” attack. Take a look at the diagram below:</p> <p><img src="https://blog.eleven-labs.com/en/assets/2018-05-09-https-part-01/man-in-the-middle.png" alt="man-in-the-middle"></p> <p>Here, Helen communicates with the website “http://www.example.com” in simple HTTP. Thus, the password she sent is fully visible to the attacker. Carol, visibly wiser or at least luckier, communicates with the site “https://www.example.com” in HTTPS. In this way, the attacker sees only the encrypted and therefore useless version of the password.</p> <h3 id="to-ensure-the-identity-of-the-recipient">To ensure the identity of the recipient</h3> <p>HTTPS also offers another protection, which is to make sure that the recipient is who they say they are and not an impostor. Thanks to certificates issued by recognized certification authorities (e.g. OVH, goDaddy, Amazon or Let’s Encrypt), your browser is able to validate the identity of the site visited. This greatly helps to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks.</p> <h2 id="https-as-an-internet-user-how-can-i-protect-myself">HTTPS: as an Internet user, how can I protect myself?</h2> <p>As an Internet user, only your vigilance will save you. If the sites you visit display the small green padlock at the URL level, then the site in question is validated by your browser. Of course, you must first trust your browser on its HTTPS management. But nowadays, all main browsers do this job perfectly and are regularly updated in this regard.</p> <p>It is therefore up to the managers of the websites you visit to set up HTTPS. Today (as of August 2020 at least), about 80% of the websites visited are already encrypted according to Mozilla Firefox statistics (visible in particular on the page <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/stats/">Let’s Encrypt telemetry</a> :</p> <p><img src="https://blog.eleven-labs.com/en/assets/2018-05-09-https-part-01/graph_HTTPS_use.png" alt="graphique-progression-HTTPS"></p> <h2 id="https-as-an-administrator-is-it-complicated-to-set-up">HTTPS: as an administrator, is it complicated to set up?</h2> <p>Today, setting up HTTPS on your own server is easy and completely free. So there is no excuse not to do it, as soon as you set up your site.</p> <h3 id="about-lets-encrypt">About Let’s Encrypt</h3> <p>Let’s Encrypt, in addition to providing certificates for free, provides a tool to retrieve and renew those certificates: Certbot. Simply clone the GitHub repository or go through their Docker image to retrieve via the terminal all the certificates you might need. Since March 2018, Let’s Encrypt has been providing certificates called “wildcards”, which will validate all your current and future subdomains via a single certificate. And this is always free of charge.</p> <h3 id="seo">SEO</h3> <p>You should also be aware that simple HTTP sites are less well referenced by Google (<a href="https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2014/08/https-as-ranking-signal.html">since 2014</a>) and that browsers clearly tend to signal to the user the lack of security of sites that are not certified and protected.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>This first part on the theory around HTTPS is over: we have seen what exactly this protocol was, why it was important and how to use it, both as a web user browsing internet and as an administrator looking to secure his web platforms.</p> <p>In the second part of this article, we will see how to technically implement HTTPS on a server, using mainly Let’s Encrypt, Certbot, Nginx and Docker.</p> </div> </section> <!-- Block Author -->  </article></div>]]>

            <p>
                Podcast transcription is the process of turning audio content into written text. This can be a perfect way to make your podcast indexable by search engines and more discoverable for users.

            <p>
                Transcribing podcasts is a great way to boost SEO results and get strong Google Search positions for your websites. Google uses transcription results to index and understand the meaning of your podcasts. If you have transcriptions for all podcasts you help the search engine to find and rank your content properly. Also, podcast transcription results provide more content for website visitors to consume. For example, a podcast transcript will give an assist if a user needs to read website information in a quiet environment.

                <div>

                <div>
                    <h3>Here's my best practice guidelines for form design. </h3>
                    <p>Working on a design system for a bank has taught me a lot about forms. I've watched testing in our labs. I've worked alongside experts from specialist accessibility organisations. I've seen forms tested by disabled people and users of assistive technology. I've also read a lot of research.</p> 
                    <p>From all this learning I've formed my own forms best-practice guidelines. I thought it would be useful start recording it. Here's my work in progress. I do UI/UX so I'm coming at this from a designer's perspective.               
              
    </p><h2 id="principles"> First, some principles</h2>
                    
                    <hr>
					<p>It's important to start with with a set of principles. It's easy to become swayed by design trends and I have to bring myself back to the user.</p><p>I aspire to the <a href="https://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/">Inclusive Design Principles</a>. Designing forms for people experiencing permanent, temporary or situational disabilities improves the experience for everyone. I also look to the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility">WCAG</a> principles. Your website or app must be: </p>
	<ul>
	<li>perceivable</li>
	<li>operable</li>
	<li>understandable</li>
	<li>robust and compatible</li>

	</ul>
	<p>In summary, think of your user and keep things as simple and as functional as possible. But don't overvalue simplicity and style at the <a href="https://uxmyths.com/post/115783813605/myth-34-simple-minimal">cost of clarity</a>. In the words of Luke Wroblewski "<a href="https://aneventapart.com/news/post/obvious-always-wins-by-luke-wroblewski-aea-video">obvious always wins</a>".</p>

        <p>Simple input for a form. Easy to overcomplicate.</p>

        <h3>My guidelines</h3>  
        
        <ul>
        <li>Text input fields must have a visible label above the input box.</li>
        <li>Don't rely on placeholder text. It is not a substitute for a label.</li>
        <li>Place hint text under the form label.</li>
        <li>The size of the input box should reflect the intended input.</li>
        <li>Unless labelled otherwise, all fields in a form are required. Mark optional fields as 'optional'.</li>

        <hr>
        <p>Buttons trigger an action or event such as continuing to the next stage or submitting a form. Use them purposely.</p>        
        
		<div>        
        	<h3>My guidelines</h3>  
        
       		 <ul>
        	<li>Button text should describe the action the button performs and be consistent through the journey.</li>
        	<li>Don't overload the user with choices. Use only one primary button on each page for the main action.</li>
        	<li>Place the submit button where users look for it. In a standard form journey this is usually to the left edge of the form, directly below the final field.</li>
        	<li>Make destructive buttons like cancel or previous harder for the user to find. A back button or link often works well above the form.</li>
        	<li>Avoid disabled buttons. They have poor contrast and can cause confusion.</li>
        	</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="8thaz7jLrmqDqCxZnm3JAC">
	<time datetime="2020-09-16">September 16, 2020</time>
  
	<p>These are my thoughts on ageism - discriminating people, and more importantly, ideas, just because of someone’s age.</p>

<p>I’m 22 years old. If you’re older than me, don’t hang up. Give me a chance. Sure, I may not have as much experience as you, and a lot of what I say may be wrong and uninformed, but that’s fine. Mistakes are good because that means decisions are being made - and I can fix those mistakes, but I have to start somewhere - and that’s where this post comes in.</p>

<p>I’m going to pitch this idea in two ways. First, to someone younger than me, and then, to someone older. You’ll want to read them both to fully understand my view</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>To someone younger,<br>
When I disregard an idea you have - it might be because it’s a terrible idea - but more often than not, it’s because I’m jealous. I see a better version of myself when I look at you. You bring with you so much enthusiasm and potential, that I often wonder “What the f*** am I doing with my life?”. My feedback doesn’t come from a good place, and I certainly don’t have your best interests at heart. I feel like you might out-achieve me, and that’s terrifying. I too had big dreams 10 years ago that I haven’t achieved - so why should you? </p>

<p>I’m shutting you down because it makes me feel better. If anyone can understand that - it’s got to be you. Why? Well, you’re really ambitious, and you’ll do anything to leave your mark on this world, including preventing others from stealing your limelight. You came to me because you saw someone you respected and could look up to - and because I’m similar to you. If I am indeed similar to you, then I’m doing exactly what you would do too.</p>

<p>I hope you’ll walk away from a conversation with me the same way I did with my elders - with disdain, and a burning passion to prove them wrong. </p>

<p>More importantly, if I tell you that you’re doing a good job - be terrified. Approval from someone you respect is a dangerous drug. Your goal isn’t to get to my approval - it’s to get me to be terrified of you and for me to do anything I can to shut you down. It’s so easy to get trapped relying on the approval of an elder.</p>

<p>Honestly, at the end of the day, I blame you. You look up to us, as elders, to be your mentors and you expect us to be mature and have your best interests at heart. Why is that? Because we’re older? That’s aegist.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>To my elders,<br>
I do look up to you. Not because you’re older than me, or have more experience. No. I look to you as a worthy opponent - someone I can still beat. I’ve already failed my younger self by not hitting the goals I had, but when I see you - I’m not there yet, and that means I can still do better. </p>

<p>At first, I try to figure out what you were like at my age. Sure, I’m interested in your life, but more importantly, I’m pacing myself. I try to figure out what metrics I’m doing better than you on, and on what metrics I’m doing worse. If you’re within a reasonable band, then I’ll treat you as an equal. If you were significantly ahead when you were my age, then I’ll try my best to catch up. You can’t change your past, but I can change my future, and that means I have potential. I will still see you as an equal though - because anything more, and I’m bound to your approval. If I’m bound to your approval, then I can never beat you. I can only ever be good enough.</p>

<p>I’d love to hear your advice, and yes, even your stories and experiences. Learning what you did right and wrong is really valuable. After all, passing knowledge between generations is what brought humanity this far. While spewing words of wisdom is great for your self esteem - don’t ever forget the golden rule. You’re giving me advice, not orders. Don’t be disappointed when I don’t do what you say. I value your opinions, the same way I value the opinions of a peer or someone younger than me. Would you like me to weigh your words more highly? Why? Because you’re older than them? That’s aegist.</p>

<p>–</p>

<p>Ageism is an unfortunate fact of life in our society. We all experience it, but we also all contribute to it. Instead of trying to fix society, it’s far easier to adjust your own worldview so you’re less affected by it. I hope this essay helps you do just that</p>

Quality of software is driven by both the talent of its creators and how they feel while theyâ€™re crafting it. Teams that have the time and energy to be focused on the work itself can build magical, high quality software. Our tools and practices need to do their best to nurture this, not take it away.</p><p>To bring back the right focus, these are the foundational ideas Linear is built on.</p></header><section><h2>Principles</h2><h3>Build for the creators</h3><p>Software project management tools should build with the end users â€“ the creators â€“ in mind. Keeping individuals productive is more important than generating perfect reports.</p><h3>Opinionated software</h3><p>Productivity software should be opinionated. It's the only way the product can truly do the heavy lifting for you. Flexible software lets everyone invent their own workflows, which eventually creates chaos as teams scale.</p><h3>Create momentum â€“ don't sprint</h3><p>We should find a cadence and routine of working. In cycles, we decide priorities and assign responsibilities. Our goal is to maintain a healthy momentum with our teams, not rush towards the end.</p><h3>Meaningful direction</h3><p>Our daily work might be filled with tasks but we should understand and remind our teams of the purpose and long term goals of our work. Roadmaps, projects and milestones are all important to keep in mind as we plan our weekly schedules.</p><h3>Aim for clarity</h3><p>Donâ€™t invent terms if possible, as these can confuse and have different meanings in different teams. Projects should be called projects.</p><h3>Say no to busy work</h3><p>Our tools should not make us the designers and maintainers of them. We should throw away or automate the busy work so you can focus on the more important work.</p><h3>Simple first, then powerful</h3><p>Teams at different sizes have different needs. Tools should be simple to get started with and grow more powerful over time.</p><h3>Decide and move on</h3><p>There isn't always a best answer. The important thing is to make a decision, and move on.</p></section><section><h2>Practices</h2><h3>Set monthly, quarterly or/and annual roadmaps</h3><p>Ambitious goals are the only way to make a significant impact. Companies should focus on them when they define their high level direction. Reserve some space on your roadmaps for unexpected and reactive work that always comes up and allow your roadmap to change if needed.</p><h3>Connect daily work to larger goals with projects</h3><p>All projects and work should directly correlate to these goals. Review projects and their target dates during roadmap meetings and pull from projects as you plan cycles.</p><h3>Work in <i>n-week</i> cycles</h3><p>Cycles create healthy routine and focus teams on what needs to happen next. 2-week cycles are the most common in software building. They're short enough to not lose sight of other priorities but long enough to build significant features. Cycles should feel reasonable. Don't overload cycles with tasks and let unfinished items move to the next cycle automatically.</p><h3>Keep a manageable backlog</h3><p>You don't need to save every feature request or piece of feedback. Important ones will resurface and low priority ones will never get fixed. A more focused backlog makes it easier and faster to plan cycles, and ensures the work will actually get done.</p><h3>Mix feature and quality work</h3><p>All software has bugs, more than we can ever fix. Include bugs and other fixes as part of your cycles. Invest in tooling as it is a force multiplier if done right.</p><h3>Specify project and issue owners</h3><p>Each project should have a named owner responsible to own delivery and write the project brief. The same goes for issues. Others should collaborate but responsibility should lie with a single person.</p><h3>Write project specs</h3><p>Aim for brevity. Short specs are more likely to be read. The purpose of a spec is to briefly communicate the "why", "what" and "how" of the project to the rest of the team. Ideally these short documents force teams to scope out work so priorities are clear and teams avoid building the wrong thing.</p><h3>Understand your users</h3><p>The more popular your product, the more feedback you'll get. Overflowing inboxes are a good sign unless they're bug reports. Donâ€™t worry too much about organizing all the feedback. Collect it and use it as a research library when developing new features. Try to spot trends. Use feedback, even complaints, as an opportunity to get to know your users and ask them to explain why they want a specific feature so you find out their needs. Solve the problem â€“ donâ€™t just build the feature.</p><h3>Scope issues to be as small as possible</h3><p>It's hard to see visible progress when working on large tasks, which can be demotivating. Break down work into smaller parts and create an issue for each one when possible. Ideally you can complete several concrete tasks each week. It feels great to mark issues as done.</p><h3>Measure progress with actual work</h3><p>The clearest way to see whether something is complete or not is to show the diff in the code or design file. When the tasks are scoped small, your changes will be small and easier to review, too. Avoid massive pull requests or large design changes.</p><h3>Run cross-functional teams</h3><p>Designers and engineers should work together on projects, creating a natural push and pull. Designers bring their skills to explore ideas and push your team's thinking. Engineers can challenge thinking around implementation and will bring the winning ideas to reality. The best creators often have talent for both. Directly loop in other teams when building features they'll use or ask customers they interact with to use.</p><h3>Write a changelog</h3><p>Itâ€™s important to look back and celebrate what you achieved as a team. Consistent changelogs also communicate to the user new features, the value they get from your product, and your commitment to improving it. It's also an easy way to connect your team's individual work to the collective value they create.<!-- --> <a href="https://medium.com/linear-app/startups-write-changelogs-c6a1d2ff4820">Read more</a> on how we write ours.</p></section></div></div>]]>

<p>What's up, everyone!? 🤙 Today I'm going to give you 6 tips on how to easily improve SEO on your website! 🤓</p>
<h2 id="1-use-title-tag">#1 Use Title tag</h2>
<p>The HTML title tag is probably the most important (if not the most important) element on any web page. Title tags are displayed on search engine results pages as the clickable headline for a given result and are important for usability, SEO, and social sharing.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598815254812/va_V3GMhP.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<p>What to consider to write a <strong>good title</strong>?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Title length</strong> - if the title is too long it may be cut off by the search engine (“…” will be added at the end). This could possibly impact your title as important words may be omitted. It’s hard to define the exact limit of characters but based on my research it's about 50-60.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid stuffing keywords</strong> - titles with just a list of keywords are bad for search users and can be bad for search engines</li>
<li><strong>Create a unique title for every page</strong> - this helps search engines to understand that content on our web page is unique and valuable, and also drive higher click-through rates. You can use this example format for your titles:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Primary keyword - Secondary keyword | Brand name</strong></p>
<p><strong>Sexy black sandals - Shoes | Urban Clothing</strong></p>
<h2 id="2-use-open-graph-protocol">#2 Use <strong>Open Graph</strong> protocol</h2>
<p><strong>Open Graph</strong> meta tags are helping to control how the URL of your website is displayed when shared on social media. They need to be placed in  of your web page.</p>
<p>Why they are so important?</p>
<ul>
<li><p>They make content more eye-catching, which can improve click-through rates on your site.</p>
</li>
<li><p>They help you to provide more information about the content on the web page</p>
</li>
<li><p>They help to understand Facebook and other social platforms what the content is about, which may help you to increase your brand visibility</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Basic <strong>Open Graph</strong> meta tags:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>og:title - Title of your web page. It shouldn’t be too long (stick to 50-60 characters as in title tag).</p>
</li>
<li><p>og:type - The type of your object i.e. article, video, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>og:image - An image URL, which should represent your object within the graph. For optimal clarity across all devices use 1200x630 dimensions.</p>
</li>
<li><p>og:url - The canonical URL of your web page   </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For more tags see official Open Graph protocol docs:
<a href="https://ogp.me/" target="_blank">ogp.me</a></p>

<p>The <strong>meta description</strong> is the second thing that you see underneath the title tag in any search engine result. This element can have an effect on whether someone clicks on your link to check your content. Keep it meaningful and don’t stuff keywords - it should describe what can be found on the web page. Also, remember to have different descriptions on every page.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1598819580065/oUmPMakGz.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="image.png"></p>
<h2 id="4-keep-your-url-structure-simple">#4 Keep your URL structure simple</h2>
<p>The <strong>URL structure</strong> of your site should be as simple as possible. URLs should be constructed logically and they should be easily understandable for humans (when it’s possible to use the readable word rather than long ID numbers). Also, it’s recommended by Google to use hyphens instead of 
 underscores.</p>
<p>Example:<br>
<a href="https://www.example.com/blog/first-blog-post.html" target="_blank">example.com/blog/first-blog-post.html</a></p>
<h2 id="5-use-noreferrer-nofollow-and-canonical-for-anchor-tag-rel-attribute">#5 Use noreferrer, nofollow and canonical for anchor tag rel attribute</h2>
<p><strong>noreferrer</strong> has no direct impact on SEO, but it does have an indirect effect on your link building and promotion efforts. It prevents passing the referrer information to the target website by removing the referral info from the HTTP header. Explaining further, that means if someone arrives at your site from a link that uses this link type, your analytics won’t show who referred that link. Also, noreferrer prevents a JavaScript exploit involving window.opener. However, remember to not use it on internal links as it can mess up with your analytics reports.</p>
<p><strong>nofollow </strong> tells search engines not to follow the link to the next page and therefore shouldn’t pass any link authority to the link target. It’s recommended to use it for: links in comments or on forums, advertisements, and sponsored links, paid links.</p>
<p><strong>cannonical</strong> helps to prevent duplicate content issues. What that means is, if you have several versions of the same content, you pick one canonical and point the search engines at it. It improves SEO because the search engine knows which version is canonical and can count all the links pointing at the different versions as links to the canonical version. </p>
<h2 id="6-use-alt-tag-in-the-img-element">#6 Use alt tag in the img element</h2>
<p>I’ve already mentioned that alt tags improve accessibility on your site in the previous post. However, it can also impact the SEO of your website! Using an alt tag helps search crawlers to understand what is shown on the image. </p>
<p>When it comes to writing good alt text, the rules are the same as described in the accessibility post: </p>
<ul>
<li>Describe the image as precisely as you can</li>
<li>Keep it short (let’s say around 125 characters)</li>
<li>Avoid keyword stuffing</li>
<li>Don’t include “photo of”, “image of” etc.,</li>
<li>Use longdesc=“” when you need to describe more complex images, which require a longer description</li>
<li>Image buttons should have an alt attribute that describes the function of the button i.e.: “sign up”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>That's it for this post! 🤙 
Let me know in the comments if you liked it and if you already use those basic tips in your daily job 🤓</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            
<p>If you’ve ever faced a mounting list of to-dos, chances are you’ve tried using an “Eisenhower Box”—a matrix that helps you determine what’s urgent and truly important. As the story goes, the celebrated military hero and U.S. president was so darn effective because he used this tool to ruthlessly prioritize.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Except, as far as we can find, there’s no truth to any of this.* In 1961, Eisenhower <em>did</em> say, “Especially whenever our affairs seem to be in crisis, we are almost compelled to give our first attention to the urgent present rather than to the important future.” But the tool as we know it first appeared as the “Time Management Matrix” in Stephen Covey’s 1989 book, “The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People,” and Eisenhower wasn’t even mentioned.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what if people have taken liberties with the name—it’s still a useful tool, right? <strong>Well, increasingly as we run this activity, a frustrating phenomenon occurs: <em>everything</em> ends up being urgent and important. </strong>Teams refuse to drop projects, claiming they’ll just do them anyway, or that they <em>have</em> to get done, and that’s that.  Instead of helping the team prioritize, the exercise reinforces their haste, waste, and lack of focus—cementing a list of activities that are impossible to accomplish and thus ensuring the conditions for burnout and disengagement.</p>



<p><strong>So, what’s to be done to prevent this inability to prioritize, or <em>priorititis</em> as we like to call it? </strong></p>



<h2>A Quick Anatomy Lesson</h2>



<figure><div><p><img data-no-lazy="true" src="https://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIFs-23-1024x683.png" alt="" srcset="https://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIFs-23-1024x683.png 1024w, https://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIFs-23-300x200.png 300w, https://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIFs-23-768x512.png 768w, https://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIFs-23.png 1104w" sizes="(min-width: 790px) 790px, 100vw," data-full="https://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIFs-23.png" data-full-size="1104x736" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAADCAQAAADxPw1zAAAADklEQVR42mNkgANGrEwAAGMABP93vXMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" data-src="https://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIFs-23-1024x683.png" data-srcset="https://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIFs-23-1024x683.png 1024w, https://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIFs-23-300x200.png 300w, https://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIFs-23-768x512.png 768w, https://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIFs-23.png 1104w"></p></div></figure>



<p>Before we offer three simple tricks and some words of wisdom, let’s share how we construct our Eisenhower Matrix. The classic matrix starts with a basic 2×2 grid mapping the urgency and importance of each task or project. Then come the internal labels of each quadrant, meant to serve as a guide for how to proceed with projects that fall in that area of the map. A quick google search reveals that there are an endless number of labeling variations and we encourage you to explore alternatives, yet these are ours:</p>



<ul><li><strong>DO:</strong> For the most important and the most urgent tasks, get down to business and avoid distraction.</li><li><strong>PLAN:</strong> For the most important yet non-urgent tasks, begin thoughtful planning now in order to avoid late-hours or missed deadlines. Rather than the urgent present, this quadrant represents the important future—where long-term planning and deep work lies.</li><li><strong>QUESTION:</strong> For urgent but relatively unimportant tasks, ask the following questions: “What’s behind the urgency and is it real?” “Is this something I can automate or delegate?” “Can I accomplish the goal behind this with a lower level of effort or complication?” “What would happen if I don’t do this at all?”</li><li><strong>DROP:</strong> For tasks lacking in both urgency and importance, scrub them from the list entirely. This almost always triggers heartburn, so we ask teams to pre-mortem what might happen if they were erased and if those consequences are worth the effort and certain distraction. When teams still push back, we ask them to try ignoring the task for thirty-days and report back.</li></ul>



<p>Even with this guidance, leaders and teams again and again default to cramming their entire project list in the “DO” area of the map, effectively rendering the exercise moot. When this happens, we try the following tricks and then ask the team or individual to react.</p>



<h3>Trick #1: Locate the Center of Gravity</h3>



<center><img data-no-lazy="true" src="http://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIF-no-one-3.gif" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAADCAQAAADxPw1zAAAADklEQVR42mNkgANGrEwAAGMABP93vXMAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></center>



<p>After the individual or team has placed all of their tasks and projects onto the map, we simply shift either the axes or projects themselves until everything is centered. This effectively rebalances the frames of reference, or centers of gravity, for how importance and urgency are defined. This trick forces the individual or team to respect the spirit of the tool and compare tasks/projects against one another versus an internalized desire to do everything.</p>



<h3>Trick #2: Reflect the Level of Effort</h3>



<center><img data-no-lazy="true" src="http://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIF-no-two-2.gif" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAADCAQAAADxPw1zAAAADklEQVR42mNkgANGrEwAAGMABP93vXMAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></center>



<p>Another way to avoid an over-bloated “DO” quadrant is to force the individual or team to first size the tasks/projects (try the agile estimation technique of starting with relative t-shirt sizes, e.g. small, medium, large, x-large) and don’t allow any overlapping post-its or icons. This trick forces the individual or team to respect their own scarcity of time and resources.</p>



<h3>Trick #3: Use the Squeezebox</h3>



<center><img data-no-lazy="true" src="http://academy.nobl.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Eisenhower-GIF-no-three-2.gif" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAADCAQAAADxPw1zAAAADklEQVR42mNkgANGrEwAAGMABP93vXMAAAAASUVORK5CYII="></center>



<p>There’s no law saying that a 2×2 must have 90-degree angles. In fact, you can better reflect the inherent scarcity of time, attention, and resources by skewing the Eisenhower Matrix and reducing the overall area of the “DO” quadrant. This trick forces the individual and team to be honest about their ability to focus. </p>



<h2>Hacking at the Roots of <em>Priorititis</em></h2>



<p>While the above tricks are useful in the moment of prioritization, the causes of a crammed “DO” quadrant are systemic and strategic. </p>



<p>If you find yourself or your team struggling to prioritize, investigate if any of these frequently-cited conditions or causes are at play:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Do you really know who you are serving?</strong> If you’re organizing your own personal to-do list, have you stepped back to ask yourself what really matters to you? What do your core beliefs and values compel you to prioritize? If you’re organizing your work list, or your team’s, do you know who that work is serving and what those constituents value most? Or are you simply guessing by throwing spaghetti at the wall and seeing what sticks?</li><li><strong>Is your strategy lacking any clear articulation of tradeoffs?</strong> Strategy, after all, is about making choices. After you get clear on who you are serving, try framing your strategy (or even your personal values) in terms of <a href="https://academy.nobl.io/how-to-write-a-strategy-your-team-will-remember/">“even over” statements</a> to help you force the necessary choices that will make prioritization less confusing. </li><li><strong>Is there someone above you or your team that is driving an unrealistic sense of urgency?</strong> First, be sure they themselves have defined their strategies in terms of tradeoffs (based on an understanding of your customers) and then work to make the cost and consequences of those unrealistic expectations transparent. Start with good faith and over-communicate your or your team’s timelines and available bandwidth and keep them regularly updated on progress and momentum. If that information falls on deaf ears, don’t take it personally (this is the work of managing-up). You could try investigating where their sense of urgency is coming from in (e.g. someone even above them driving urgency) in order to find solutions and/or you could look for opportunities to positively reinforce behavior when they do acknowledge your abilities and availabilities.</li><li><strong>Have you fallen into a pattern of fire-fighting?</strong> The act of fighting workplace fires, i.e. rallying to answer an urgent need, can be addicting. You and/or your team are recognized as heroes, especially in the eyes of organizations with short-term myopia, and you can become dependent on seeking that recognition. Ultimately, though, you starve your resources and ability to plan for the long-term and accomplish bigger, more impactful initiatives.</li></ul>

<p>Late last year a colleague of mine offered me his lecturer position at <a href="https://www.fh-campuswien.ac.at/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a local university of applied sciences</a>. Little did I know, my previous experience in teaching online would come in <em>very</em> handy as we were heading into a whole world suddenly switching to remote education.</p>
<p>The initial idea was only to bring a more practical approach to the lectures. However, by the time we went into the first round of discussions with the university leadership we were already in lock-down mode, and the idea of replicating remote education from the past became very appealing.</p>
<p>In this post I will showcase the tools used to create <a href="https://fh-cloud-computing.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this cloud computing lecture</a> and explain how you can use them to create a similar experience for your students.</p>
<h2 id="the-concept">The concept</h2>
<p>With the lock-down everything changed. Students could no longer go into class rooms and pretend to listen to lecturers. Making a list of who’s present no longer made sense. Splitting a class room into groups for a project was no longer possible. Sure, Zoom added breakout rooms, but the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMOOG7rWTPg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">universally bad audio quality</a> made these either outright impossible, or at least very painful to listen to.</p>
<p>Let me demonstrate what I mean. Please listen to the following audio sample (or <a href="https://pasztor.at/posts/into-the-school-year-with-open-source-and-youtuber-spirit/reverb-demonstration.mp3">download it</a>):</p>

<p>Do you see what I mean? In a class room your brain naturally deals with the echo as you are in the same setting. When listening to someone on your computer you are not. This makes it a lot harder to understand what’s being said, and you are using your brain power to understand the words rather than comprehend the meaning.</p>
<p>The way we worked changed, too. Suddenly, nobody cared if you were cooking lunch, driving in a car, or taking care of your kid while being in a meeting. It became socially acceptable to be more efficient. It was suddenly OK to participate in a lecture while driving somewhere in a car.</p>
<p>Does it really make sense to <em>force</em> people to be there at the same time and look at the screen, even when nothing is happening? Does it really make sense to have a classic lecture where there’s a <em>lot</em> of downtime?</p>
<p>Let’s play a thought experiment. Or rather, let’s replicate an experiment I was confronted with back in 2018: you have the task to educate a large number of people who are distributed all over the continent. Furthermore, this group of people is constantly changing since people are hired, or leave the company from time to time. How would you do it?</p>
<p>If you think about it, this is exactly what online learning platforms are doing. Most platforms focus on video only. All the corporate platforms I have seen usually include material that nobody subjects themselves to because it’s just so fundamentally boring. The lecture is recorded in the same way a university lecture would: lots of downtime, bad audio quality.</p>
<p>This is just the <em>millenial impatience</em> at work, at the computer we are lacking a lot of non-verbal queues. It is a lot harder to listen to a disembodied, echo-y voice of a teacher than it is to sit in a class room. Also, the teacher can’t read our body language and stop if we don’t understand something.</p>
<p>In contrast, there are millions of YouTubers, Udemy, or Linkedin educators out there, who want to do exactly that. Their videos are tightly edited together to provide a great learning experience. A great learning experience <em>if you want a video</em>. So, that’s part of the solution.</p>
<p>However, not all of us want a video. When learning for a test we <em>skim</em> material very quickly. Or, we print it out and use a marker to highlight the important bits. Also, some people are just simply better at ingesting information by reading than they are by listening to someone. We also want to support the scenario when someone wants to consume information <em>on the go</em>.</p>
<p>We have two goals here: provide content for different <em>purposes</em>, and helping people of <a href="https://www.rasmussen.edu/degrees/education/blog/types-of-learning-styles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the 4 learning styles</a>.</p>
<p>We have all the tools in our hand: we are already making slides, a lot of university teachers are already writing notes, and we use our vocal chords to produce sound. We already have everything needed for <strong>multi-format educational material</strong>.</p>
<p>This multi-format educational material would encompass a <em>text</em> version of the material to be learnt. It would also contain illustrative (not bulled point) slides to help the visual types. It could then also have an <em>audiobook</em> for auditory learning, and finally combine the slides, and the audiobook to create a video.
Furthermore, we can also add our previous bullet point list to the slide speaker notes, and to the text version as well. If we really want to go out of our way we can add a quiz for the tactile learners.</p>
<h2 id="the-text-version">The text version</h2>
<p>Let’s start with the text version. One of the open source tools I really like is <a href="https://www.mkdocs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mkdocs</a>, a popular tool for software documentation. Together with the <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">material theme</a> it is capable of accommodating larger amounts of text. It also has built-in facilities for creating highlighted boxes for tips, tricks, and warnings called <a href="https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/admonitions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admonitions</a>.</p>
<p>mkdocs allows us to create documentation in an easy to edit format called <a href="https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">markdown</a>. Unlike Microsoft Word, Markdown is a purely text format and is easy to handle and transform when needed. Most importantly, mkdocs can make a great looking website out of it.</p>
<p>Once it is set up less technical people can be taught to edit content in it too. <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> offers everything needed to edit, and to publish the website. (Yes, they provide free hosting.)</p>
<p>The initial setup is not <em>too</em> difficult, but you will need a bit of technical finesse. If you haven’t already, head on over to <a href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> and register a free account. Once you’re done, go to <a href="https://github.com/janoszen/mkdocs-blueprint" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">my template repository</a> and click the green “Use this template” button. This will give you an option to make a copy of my prepared mkdocs setup into your own account. <strong>Make sure to check the “Include all branches” option.</strong></p>
<p>Once the process is complete, move to the “Actions” tab and wait for the deployment to complete. Once that’s done, go to “Settings” and scroll down to the “GitHub Pages” section. Please select <code>gh-pages</code> as the source and click “Save”.</p>

<p>Congratulations! <strong>Wait a few minutes</strong>, and you will be the owner of a brand new e-learning website located at <code>https://YOURUSER.github.io/YOURREPONAME/</code>! If you wish, GitHub will give you the option to set up a custom domain name for your website too. You can read more about that <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the official documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Now, on to customizations. Please look at your GitHub repository and open the <code>mkdocs.yaml</code> file. This is your main configuration file in the popular <a href="https://rollout.io/blog/yaml-tutorial-everything-you-need-get-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YAML format</a>. You can click the little pen icon to edit it. Don’t worry, GitHub keeps your old versions in case you mess up.</p>
<p>Once you are done customizing everything there, head on to the <code>docs</code> directory. This is where your content lives. Primarily, in the files titled <code>index.md</code>. The examples provided should show you the way. You can now add content to your heart’s content (pun totally intended).</p>
<p>You can also add admonitions like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">!!! note
    This is a note

!!! tip
    This is a tip

!!! warning
    This is a warning
</code></pre></div><p>Or you can add a quiz:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="fallback">{{ quiz("What components are redundant in a server?", [
    answer("Power supply"),
    answer("CPU"),
    answer("RAM"),
    answer("Fan"),
    answer("OOBM"),
]) }}
</code></pre></div><p>The quizzes don’t give the students feedback because they are designed to invoke thinking rather than giving them an easy to memorize answer.</p>
<h2 id="adding-audio">Adding audio</h2>
<p>So far you only have a text version of your course. Let’s add some audio. You can record audio with a great many tools, one of the most popular open source ones is <a href="https://www.audacityteam.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Audacity</a>. I personally use <a href="https://www.adobe.com/products/audition.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Adobe’s Audition</a> for this purpose.</p>
<p>Besides the audio software, you will also need a microphone. Nothing fancy, even a basic headset will do as long as the microphone is close to your mouth. <strong>Do not use in-ear headphones (e.g. Apple AirPods) or your built-in laptop microphone.</strong></p>
<p>You will need to find a quiet room. The room should also not be empty as empty walls reflect sound and cause reverb in the audio. Now comes the hardest part: you will need to read the text and listen to your own voice. <em>A lot.</em> The hard part here is not to fall into a monotone reading voice as most of us tend to do when we are sitting alone. If you are having a hard time doing this get someone else you can read to.</p>
<p>Also, make sure you experiment with your setup before you do the whole read. Move your microphone position to see what works best and how you can get the best result. When you are done with reading check your audio program if you can auto-remove long pauses. If you want to experiment with noise removal make sure you don’t over do it as it results in very weird and hard to listen-to artifacts.</p>
<p>Once you have your audio recorded, each segment in its own file, you can upload them to GitHub. Then you can add the audio to your <code>index.md</code> file by inserting the following HTML code below your headlines:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>audio</span> <span>preload</span><span>=</span><span>"none"</span> <span>controls</span> <span>src</span><span>=</span><span>"your-audio-segment.mp3"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/</span><span>audio</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div><p>If you add a separate file after each headline, the blueprint will take them and chain them together for listening. If you want to add a downloadable MP3, too, you can merge the files together in your audio editing program and add them to the top of the page.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-slide-deck">Creating a slide deck</h2>
<p>The next step is to create the slide deck. Traditionally, slide decks contain lots of bullet points. That serves a purpose as the slide deck is what students learn from. In our case, however, the slide deck is intended to invoke memorization. Memorization is helped by <em>unique visuals</em>. In my experience, most slides should contain a graphic relating to the content that’s being talked about.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><hr><p>The default way to write UI applications in ClojureScript is to use React or its cousin React Native.</p><p>UI applications involve handling the following things:</p><ol><li><strong>Displaying graphical components</strong> (~ how to describe them)<br>In this article we will use a very shallow wrapper around React described in a <a href="https://lambdam.com/blog/2020-09-react-wrapper">previous article</a> and included in the mook library.</li><li><strong>How to store and transform state</strong> (through user action or external action).<br>This is the topic of this article.</li><li><strong>How to link state and UI.</strong><br>React handles this point with the following "mantra": UI is a strict (and "dumb") application of the state: <code>UI&nbsp;=&nbsp;f(state)</code>.</li></ol><p>Mook is a young library that gives tools to store application state and to transform it.<br>After building ClojureScript applications (with React and React Native) for about 6 years, I bumped into various limitations. This library is an attent to circumvent them.</p><p>Throughout this article, we'll discover Mook ideas interactively thanks to Yehonathan Sharvit's wonderfull <a href="https://github.com/viebel/klipse" target="blank">Klipse</a> library. The ClojureScript code is compiled and executed directly in your browser so 1. you will see the result of the code next to it and 2. you can modify the code to explore its behavior.</p><h2>Global state management</h2><p>React handles only local state at the component level. But handling the global app state is another affair, and we have to turn toward other libraries (or manually crafting it around the ideas of <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/docs/in-depth-overview/" target="blank">Flux</a>).</p><p>A traditional way to handle global state in a Javascript is the <a href="https://redux.js.org/">Redux</a> approach. In the ClojureScript land, the reference is <a href="http://day8.github.io/re-frame/">re-frame</a>, which has similar concepts, with different names.</p><p>Here are the Redux important ideas:</p><ul><li>Isolate the application reference state into one hashmap structure.</li><li>Expose an opiniated way to read this state by preventing the risk of unwanted mutations.</li><li>Expose an opiniated way to transform this state.</li></ul><p>re-frame, in contrast to Redux, doesn't suffer from unwanted mutation risks thanks to Clojure persistent data structures.</p><p>Let's explore some problems and limitations of those frameworks of ideas.</p><h2>Limitation #1: state reading</h2><p>It's funny to note on a Clojure blog post that one of the first notions introduced in Redux essential tutorial is <a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-1-overview-concepts#immutability">immutability</a>. Reading the state with <code>useSelector</code> exposes the risk of mutating the reference state with methods such as <a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-4-using-data#sorting-the-posts-list">array.sort()</a>. This kind of risk doesn't exist in the Clojure land thanks to its <a href="https://augustl.com/blog/2019/you_have_to_know_about_persistent_data_structures/">persistent data structures</a>.</p><p>Also on the Redux side, new values suffer from the fact that the comparison of objects in JS are based on references, not values. So every new value that is an object will fire a full tree comparison, as explained on this <a href="https://redux.js.org/tutorials/essentials/part-4-using-data#creating-a-single-post-page">page</a> (in the 4th paragraph).<br>Clojure doesn't suffer from that since it does structural comparison by default, treating all data as values.</p><p>Finally, re-frame forces one to read the state in a component with a subscription. It forces to split some intention between different namespaces. After a while, changing and/or cleaning those linked parts of the code can be tricky.</p><p>To summarize: <strong>Since Clojure data structures are immutable and use structural comparison, we could locally and directly read it in the component and use Clojure structural equality to fire re-renders</strong>.</p><h2>Limitation #2: state writing</h2><p>Redux takes a lot of care to prevent unwanted mutations. So it defines a clear semantics to handle precise state mutations: this is the notion of reducer. Here is the shape of a reducer:</p><pre><code>function counterReducer(state, action) {
  ... // state tranformation here
  return newState;
}
</code></pre><p>Clojure already has a clear interface for state transition: <code>reset!</code> and <code>swap!</code> functions on atoms. But re-frame bypasses this interface, works hard to hide it and exposes a signature similar to Redux:</p><pre><code>(defn effect-handler [coeffects event]
 (let [item-id  (second event)
       db       (:db coeffects)
       new-db   (dissoc-in db [:items item-id])]
   {:db new-db}))
</code></pre><p>In the name of the superiority of data over everything (<code>data &gt; functions &gt; macros</code> in the <a href="http://day8.github.io/re-frame/a-loop/#homoiconic">intro page</a> of re-frame), some clean and simple properties of functions (composition, closures) and already existing pieces of the standard library (atoms) aren't used directly. This mantra might bring unwanted complexity.</p><p>To summarize: <strong>Since Clojure already has a clear and clean way to handle state transition, why not using it directly instead of hiding it?</strong></p><h2>Limitation #3: async workflows</h2><p>Let's talk only about re-frame.</p><p>This point is actually the one that pushed me away from re-frame: the existence of the <a href="https://github.com/day8/re-frame-async-flow-fx">re-frame-async-flow-fx</a> library.</p><p><strong>Having to redefine all async logic with pure data deeply is questionable when promises and core.async already exist.</strong><br>Once again, the mantra of <code>data &gt; function &gt; macro</code> seems to push away from the simplicity of some elegantly designed tools that already exist.</p><p>Complex async logic usually appears in the initialization phase of many applications. This library (and re-frame in general) forces to split an intention into multiple coupled event effects when a chain of promises can keep together async pieces of business logic.</p><p>To summarize: <strong>Why not using tools that already exist to handle async workflows?</strong></p><h2>Limitation #4: the single hashmap, in-memory database</h2><p>Last but not least, the idea that putting all the reference state into one hashmap is actually a good idea.</p><p>Let's imagine that we are creating a startup and that as CTO, we have to create an UI that allows users to pin books that they liked and recommand them to other users. One of the user stories is that on the user's main public page there is the list of read books and every book has information of the title, the author and a list of categories it belongs to.</p><p>You set up the database, expose a CRUD API and start coding the UI with one big hashmap to store the reference state.<br>Following the user story, a natural way of storing the data and exposing it on a coupled API endpoint would be the following:</p><pre><code>{:current-user-id 1234
 :users [{:id 1234
          :name "Dam"
          :relations [2345 ...]
          :books [{:id 9
                   :name "Foo"
                   :author "..."
                   :summary "..."
                   :categories [{:id 1
                                 :name "Thriller"}
                                {:id 2
                                 :name "Nordic"}]}
                  {:id 8
                   :name "Bar"
                   :author "..."
                   :summary "..."
                   :categories [{:id 3
                                 :name "Horror"}
                                {:id 2
                                 :name "Nordic"}]}]}
         {:id 2345
          :name "Chpill"
          ...}]}
</code></pre><p>After some time, the product manager asks for a new feature that would allow users to browse the books also by categories.</p><p>😤 No problem, I'm a tough programmer! Let's write a function that extracts this information from the big database hashmap.</p><pre><code>(defn get-books-by-categories [db]
  (some-&gt;&gt; (:users db)
           (some #(when (= (:id %) (:current-user-id db))
                    %))
           :books
           (reduce (fn [acc book]
                     (reduce (fn [acc category]
                               (if (contains? acc category)
                                 (update acc category conj book)
                                 (assoc acc category [book])))
                             acc
                             (:categories book)))
                   {})))
</code></pre><p>Yeah! I'm tough and Clojure is a blessing since I can put hashmaps as keys of hashmaps. The result would look like this:</p><pre><code>{{:id 1
  :name "Thriller"} [{:id 9
                      :name "Foo"
                      ...}
                     ...]

 {:id 2
  :name "Nordic"} [{:id 9
                    :name "Foo"
                    ...}
                   {:id 8
                    :name "Bar"
                    ...}
                   ...]

 ...}
</code></pre><p>But... 🤔</p><p>Maybe, that is not such a good idea. When I come back a month later, I struggle to understand what this function does and what is the shape of the data flowing through it.</p><p>To summarize: <strong>The hashmap data structure might not be very good as an in memory database since it forces one to give a "purpose shape" to the data.</strong></p><h2>Let's meet Mook</h2><p>Mook is the synthesis of about 6 years of crafting applications with ClojureScript. It came to life thanks to:</p><ol><li>React Hooks.</li><li>Datascript, a "true" in-memory database with powerful query capabilities.</li><li>Étienne Spillmaeker, aka <a href="https://github.com/chpill">@chpill</a>, my Clojure buddy since the beginning of my Clojure adventure.</li></ol><p>It tries to address the 4 pain points listed above.</p><p>Here are the strong Mook ideas:</p><ul><li>Use the db directly in the component with handlers.</li><li>Use Clojure references directly (generally atoms) in state transitions (aka actions).</li><li>Use promises to handle async workflows.</li><li>Make actions composable.</li><li>Enable the use of Datascript along with atoms to store state.</li></ul><p>Let's see how we could circumvent the previous limitations and then merge it into a usable library. We'll continue with our book platform and implement it with Mook interactively in the page thanks to <a href="https://github.com/viebel/klipse">Klipse</a>.</p><h2>Step #1: the data(base(s))</h2><p>One dominant idea of various architectures around React is to store the reference data in one place instead of spreading it all over the application.<br>Sadly we saw that this great idea leads to store the data into one big nested hashmap and that hashmaps aren't that good to store and extract information of "complex" data models.</p><p>Another great thing with Clojure is that it provides atoms which were from the beginning crafted with database-like interfaces.<br>Sadly again, a Datascript database and an atom do not share exactly the same interface for writing and listening (but do for reading, through the <code>deref</code> mechanism).</p><p>This can be summarized like this:</p><table>
  <thead>
    <tr><th scope="col"></th>
    <th scope="col">Reading</th>
    <th scope="col">Writing</th>
    <th scope="col">Watching</th>
  </tr></thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">atom</th>
      <td><code>deref</code></td>
      <td><code>reset!</code>, <code>swap!</code></td>
      <td><code>add-watch</code>, <code>remove-watch</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <th scope="row">Datascript db</th>
      <td><code>deref</code></td>
      <td><code>transact!</code></td>
      <td><code>listen!</code>, <code>unlisten!</code></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table><p>We'll see later that in the Mook case, having different writing interfaces is not important, but watching interfaces are very important for React re-renders on data change.</p><p>Furtunately, Clojure provides a clever tool …</p></div></article></div>

<p>Repl is a great window into a running program, but the textual nature of its output limits developer’s ability to inspect the program: a text is not an object, and we are dealing with objects in the VM.</p>

<p>Reveal aims to solve this problem by creating an in-process repl output pane that makes inspecting values as easy as selecting an interesting datum. It recognizes the value of text as a universal interface, that’s why its output looks like a text: you can select it, copy it, save it into a file. Unlike text, reveal output holds references to printed values, making inspecting selected value a matter of opening a context menu.</p>

<p>Unlike datafy/nav based tools, Reveal does not enforce a particular data representation for any given object, making it an open set — that includes datafy/nav as one of the available options. It does not use datafy/nav by default because in the absence of inter-process communication to datafy is to lose.</p>

<p>Not being limited to text, Reveal uses judicious syntax highlighting to aid in differentiating various objects: text <code>java.lang.Integer</code> looks differently depending on whether it was produced from a symbol or a class.</p>



<p>The easiest way to try it is to run a Reveal repl:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>clj <span>\</span>
<span>-Sdeps</span> <span>'{:deps {vlaaad/reveal {:mvn/version "1.0.130"}}}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-m</span> vlaaad.reveal repl
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Executing this command will start a repl and open Reveal output window that will mirror the evaluations in the shell.</p>



<h2 id="tap-support"><code>tap&gt;</code> support</h2>

<p>Clojure 1.10 added <code>tap&gt;</code> function with the purpose similar to printing the value for debugging, but instead of characters you get the object. Reveal repls show tapped values in their output windows — you won’t need <code>println</code> anymore!</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/tap.gif" alt="Tap demo"></p>

<h2 id="eval-on-selection">Eval on selection</h2>

<p>You can evaluate code on any selected value by using text input in the context menu. You can write either a single symbol of a function to call or a form where <code>*v</code> will be replaced with selected value.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/eval-on-selection.gif" alt="Eval on selection demo"></p>

<h2 id="inspect-object-fields-and-properties">Inspect object fields and properties</h2>

<p>Any object in the JVM has class and fields, making them easily accessible for inspection is extremely important. With <code>java-bean</code> contextual action you get a debugger-like view of objects in the VM. Access to this information greatly improves the visibility of the VM and allows to explore it. For example, for any class you have on the classpath you can get the place where it’s coming from:</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/java-bean.gif" alt="Java bean demo">
I learned about it after implementing this feature :)</p>

<h2 id="look-and-feel-customization">Look and feel customization</h2>

<p>Reveal can be configured with <code>vlaaad.reveal.prefs</code> java property to use different font or theme:</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/light-theme.png" alt="Light theme"></p>

<h2 id="url-and-file-browser">URL and file browser</h2>

<p>You can open URL-like things and files: both internally in Reveal and externally using other applications in your OS e.g. file explorer, browser or text editor.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/browse.gif" alt="Browse demo"></p>

<h2 id="doc-and-source">Doc and source</h2>

<p>Reveal can show you documentation and sources for various runtime values — namespaces, vars, symbols, functions, keywords (if they define a spec). Like <a href="https://cljdoc.org/">cljdoc</a>, it supports <code>[[wikilink]]</code> syntax in docstrings to refer to other vars, making them accessible for further exploration.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/doc-and-source.gif" alt="Doc and source demo"></p>

<h2 id="ref-watchers">Ref watchers</h2>
<p>Reveal can watch any object implementing <code>clojure.lang.IRef</code> (things like atoms, agents, vars, refs) and display it either automatically updated or as a log of successors.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/watchers.gif" alt="Ref watchers demo"></p>

<h2 id="charts">Charts</h2>

<p>Reveal can show data of particular shapes as charts that are usually explorable: when you find an interesting data point on the chart, you can then further inspect the data in that data point.</p>

<p>The simplest shape is labeled numbers. Labeled means that those numbers exist in some collection that has a unique label for every number. For maps, keys are labels, for sequential collections, indices are labels and for sets, numbers themselves are labels.</p>

<p>A pie chart shows labeled numbers:</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/pie-chart.gif" alt="Pie chart demo"></p>

<p>Other charts support more flexible data shapes — both because they can show more than one data series, and because they can be explored, where it might be useful to attach some metadata with the number. Since JVM numbers don’t allow metadata, you can instead use tuples where the first item is a number and second is the metadata. Bar charts can display labeled numbers (single data series) or labeled numbers that are themselves labeled (multiple data series):</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/bar-chart.gif" alt="Bar chart demo"></p>

<p>Line charts are useful to display progressions, so Reveal suggests them to display sequential numbers (and labeled sequential numbers):</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/line-chart.gif" alt="Line chart demo"></p>

<p>Finally, Reveal has scatter charts to display coordinates on a 2D plane. A coordinate is represented as a tuple of 2 numbers and as with numbers, you can use a tuple of coordinate and arbitrary value in the place of coordinate. Reveal will suggest scatter charts for collections of coordinates and labeled collections of coordinates.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/scatter-chart.gif" alt="Scatter chart demo"></p>

<h2 id="table-view">Table view</h2>

<p>There are cases where it is better to make sense of the value when it is represented by a table: collections of homogeneous items where columns make it easier to compare corresponding parts of those items, and big deeply nested data structures where it’s easier to look at them layer by layer.</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/table.gif" alt="Table view demo"></p>

<h2 id="and-more">…and more</h2>

<p>Reveal was designed to be performant: it can stream syntax-highlighted output very fast. In addition to that, there are various helpers for data inspection:</p>
<ul>
  <li>text search that is triggered by <kbd>/</kbd> or <kbd>Ctrl F</kbd>;</li>
  <li>out of the box <a href="https://github.com/lambdaisland/deep-diff2">lambdaisland’s deep-diff</a> output highlighting: all you need to do is have it on the classpath;</li>
  <li>various contextual actions:
    <ul>
      <li>deref derefable things;</li>
      <li>get meta if a selected value has some meta;</li>
      <li>convert java array to vector;</li>
      <li>view the color of a thing that describes a color (like <code>"#fff"</code> or <code>:red</code>);</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>



<h2 id="ui-concepts-and-navigation">UI concepts and navigation</h2>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/reveal/concepts.png" alt="Concepts"></p>

<p>Reveal UI is made of 3 components:</p>
<ul>
  <li>output panel that contains data submitted to reveal window (e.g. repl output);</li>
  <li>a context menu that can invoke actions on selected values;</li>
  <li>results panel that has 1 or more tabs with action results produced from the context menu.</li>
</ul>

<p>Navigation:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Use <kbd>Space</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd> or right mouse button to open a context menu on selection;</li>
  <li>Use <kbd>Tab</kbd> to switch focus between output and results panel;</li>
  <li>In results panel:
    <ul>
      <li>Use <kbd>Ctrl ←</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl →</kbd> to switch tabs in results panel;</li>
      <li>Use <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the tab</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In a context menu:
    <ul>
      <li>Use <kbd>↑</kbd> and <kbd>↓</kbd> to move focus between available actions and input text field;</li>
      <li>Use <kbd>Enter</kbd> to execute selected action or form written in the text field;</li>
      <li>Use <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close the context menu.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="customization">Customization</h2>

<p>Reveal can be customized using <code>vlaaad.reveal.prefs</code> java property that contains an edn map of UI preferences. Supported keys (all optional):</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>:theme</code> — color theme, <code>:light</code> or <code>:dark</code>;</li>
  <li><code>:font-family</code> — system font name (like <code>"Consolas"</code>) or URL (like <code>"file:/path/to/font.ttf"</code> or <code>"https://ff.static.1001fonts.net/u/b/ubuntu.mono.ttf"</code>) — reveal only supports monospaced fonts;</li>
  <li><code>:font-size</code> — font size, number.</li>
</ul>

<p>Example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>clj <span>-A</span>:reveal <span>\</span>
<span>-J-Dvlaaad</span>.reveal.prefs<span>=</span><span>'{:font-family "Consolas" :font-size 15}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-m</span> vlaaad.reveal repl
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="user-api">User API</h2>

<p>The main entry point to Reveal is <code>vlaaad.reveal</code> ns that has various repls and lower-level functionality for data inspection.</p>

<h3 id="repl"><code>repl</code></h3>

<p>It is a repl wraps <code>clojure.main/repl</code> with additional support for <code>:repl/quit</code> and <code>tap&gt;</code>. It is as simple as it gets. I use it all the time. Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>clj <span>-A</span>:reveal <span>-m</span> vlaaad.reveal repl
<span># Reveal window appears</span>
Clojure 1.10.1
<span>user</span><span>=&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="io-prepl"><code>io-prepl</code></h3>

<p>This prepl works like <code>clojure.core.server/io-prepl</code>. Its purpose is to be run in a process on your machine that you want to connect to using another prepl-aware tool. Example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>clj <span>-A</span>:reveal <span>\</span>
<span>-J-Dclojure</span>.server.reveal<span>=</span><span>'{:port 5555 :accept vlaaad.reveal/io-prepl}'</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Now you can connect to this process using any socket repl and it will show a Reveal window for every connection:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>nc localhost 5555
<span># reveal window appears</span>
<span>(</span>+ 1 2 3<span>)</span> <span># input</span>
<span>{</span>:tag :ret, :val <span>"6"</span>, :ns <span>"user"</span>, :ms 1, :form <span>"(+ 1 2 3)"</span><span>}</span> <span># output</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="remote-prepl"><code>remote-prepl</code></h3>

<p>Reveal is the most useful when it runs in the process where the development happens. This prepl, unlike the previous two, is not like that: it connects to a remote process and shows a window for values that arrived from the network. It can’t benefit from easy access to printed references because these references are pointing to values deserialized from bytes, not values in the target VM. It’s still nice and performant repl, and it’s useful when you want to use Reveal to talk to another process that does not have Reveal on the classpath (e.g. production or ClojureScript prepl).</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Start a prepl without Reveal on the classpath:
    <div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span> clj <span>\</span>
<span>-Sdeps</span> <span>'{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.764"}}}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-J-Dclojure</span>.server.cljs-prepl<span>=</span><span>'{:port 50505 :accept cljs.server.browser/prepl}'</span>
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
  <li>Connect to that prepl using Reveal:
    <div><div><pre><code>$ clj -A:reveal -m vlaaad.reveal remote-prepl :port 50505
# at this point, 2 things happen:
# 1. Browser window with cljs prepl appears
# 2. Reveal window opens

# input
js/window

# output
{:tag :ret, 
 :val #object [Window [object Window]], 
 :ns "cljs.user", 
 :ms 25, 
 :form "js/window"}
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="ui"><code>ui</code></h3>

<p>Calling this function will create and show a Reveal window. It returns a function that you can submit values to — they will appear in the output panel. All built-in visual repls are thin wrappers of other repls that submit values to a window created by this generic function. You can use it to create custom Reveal-flavored repls, or, instead of using it as a repl, you can configure Reveal to only show tapped values.</p>

<p>Example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>require</span><span> </span><span>'</span><span>[</span><span>vlaaad.reveal</span><span> </span><span>:as</span><span> </span><span>reveal</span><span>])</span><span>

</span><span>;; open a window that will show tapped values:</span><span>
</span><span>(</span><span>add-tap</span><span> </span><span>(</span><span>reveal/ui</span><span>))</span><span>

 </span><span>;; submit value to the window:</span><span>
</span>…</code></pre></div></div></div></div></div>

<p>Have you wondered how restaurants and cafes would tackle their surplus food availability? When I come across bakeries where all the breads get sold up near the closing time, it gives me immense satisfaction as a customer. But in reality, this is not the case all the time. The consumption patterns vary and we cannot safely assume that all the baked/cooked food would be sold at the end of the day. </p>



<figure><img src="https://www.traveller.com.au/content/dam/images/h/1/i/5/c/q/image.related.articleLeadwide.620x349.h1m3lq.png/1582771281097.jpg" alt="Hotels and food waste: What happens to breakfast buffet leftovers" width="334" height="187"></figure>



<p>It is said that an estimated 1.3 billion tonnes of food is wasted globally each year, one third of all food produced for human consumption, according to the <em>FAO</em> of the United nations. </p>



<figure><img src="https://blog.airliquide.se/sites/default/files/F%C3%B6rl%C3%A4ng_h%C3%A5llbarhet_p%C3%A5_livsmedel_med_Air_Liquides_livsmedelsgaser_SE.jpg" alt="Food waste är allas ansvar | Air Liquide - Sverige - Blog" width="353" height="236"><figcaption>One third of the world’s edible food is wasted every year – and that’s set to grow as the global population does.</figcaption></figure>



<p>As I had this thought about solutions for food waste in my mind, I came across an app that helps in this mission. <em>Too good to go (TGTG)</em> is a Copenhagen based company that not only helps to tackle the food wastage issue, but at the same time, be a connecting point to support the local business with their surplus food available with them. The local restaurants, bakeries, cafes, groceries stores etc are connected via this app. </p>



<figure><img src="https://www.theexeterdaily.co.uk/sites/default/files/field/image/44ec70adc6b90a5cf7191182a7b3fa092918cb458465dc346e89c39091e5be6b.jpg" alt="Costa Coffee expands partnership with Too Good To Go to tackle food waste  in Exeter | The Exeter Daily" width="369" height="245"><figcaption>The surprising element is that we do not know what food we would be getting when we make an order. Thus, it is called a magic bag.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Interestingly, I also came across another food waste app based out of Sweden, called <em>Karma</em> which is similar to <em>TGTG</em> app. One fascinating feature of this app is that you would get a personalized profile with data related to the number of kgs and items you have rescued so far. It also motivates us to win a batch and be consistent in this zero wastage mission. </p>



<figure><img src="https://www.werksgroup.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Karma_OOH_UK_Q2_IG-16.png" alt="" width="295" height="295"></figure>



<p>Both the apps provide us choices with dietary preferences and the ordering goes like this:<br>– Check what’s available in the store for you based on your location<br>– Pay it through the app in advance<br>– Collect the food at the prescribed time slot allotted</p>



<p>One major difference between <em>TGTG</em> and <em>Karma</em> app is that, the former offers us a bag filled with surplus foods (magic box) and the latter is the individual food items that we select and buy (there are no mystery/magic boxes). <br></p>



<figure><img src="https://gratisprinsessan.se/wp/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/karma-app.jpg" alt="Få 80 kr att handla för i appen Karma! - Gratisprinsessan" width="324" height="216"><figcaption>Ordering food through Karma app</figcaption></figure>



<div><p>Both the apps are exciting and provide an interesting dimension which complement and help in reducing the food wastage. Personally, I felt like a rescue warrior while using these apps with an added joy of getting quality food at an affordable price. I believe that this is a personal win-win solution to the customer, the local business and the planet! </p><p>Have you used the above apps or come across any other food waste solution apps? Would be great to hear from other (potential) rescue warriors.</p></div>

<p>This unwelcome surprise comes against the backdrop of dozens of controversies around the App Store — most recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/16/21293419/hey-apple-rejection-ios-app-store-dhh-gangsters-antitrust">Hey.com</a> and <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/08/28/apple-terminates-epic-games-account">Epic</a>, but more generally its <a href="https://marco.org/2020/09/11/app-review-changes">painfully confusing</a> and <a href="https://inessential.com/2020/05/10/heads_up_to_rss_reader_authors">arbitrarily applied</a> rules, its incomprehensible <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/tag/rejection/">app rejections</a> and their often sudden retractions, app <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2016/03/07/flexbright-adjust-display-temperature/">approvals followed by sudden removals</a> without explanation, and the general unequal treatment of developers where <a href="https://gizmodo.com/researchers-uber-s-ios-app-had-secret-permissions-that-1819177235">big companies</a> or favorites <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/02/27/bbedit-12-6-to-return-to-the-mac-app-store/">get special treatment</a>. It leaves me wondering, what the hell is Apple’s strategy here? This is not a flurry of bad PR for the sake of it. There are serious problems here that need to be addressed — in particular, Developer Relations.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p>Historically, these events announce new hardware and the upcoming release of the next major version of iOS, which is typically made public a few days later or the following week. For as long as I can remember it goes something like this:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apple hosts a media event on a Tuesday in September.</li>
  <li>Announcements include new iPhones, iPads, and Watches. Or, at least some combination of those. Maybe something about Apple TV.</li>
  <li>All of the new hardware will run the latest version of iOS (or watchOS, or tvOS).</li>
  <li>The next major release of iOS is announced to be shipping on Friday (in a few days) or sometime the following week, like the next Tuesday.</li>
</ul>

<p>But today, Apple announced that iOS 14 is shipping <strong>tomorrow</strong>. This was near the end of the event — at roughly 11:00 AM Pacific time. This means West Coast developers have half a day to put the final touches on their app updates for iOS 14 <strong>AND</strong> get their apps submitted with the just-released Xcode 12 GM <strong>AND</strong> get through App Store review. None of those tasks are trivial, and no one familiar with them would agree that this is a sufficient amount of time to complete them. If you happen to be working on the East Coast, this means you were given just a few hours before the working day was over to get your app ready and submitted. And if you live in Europe or anywhere else in the world, well, go fuck yourself and good luck tomorrow!</p>

<p>On top of this, critical bugs still exist in the latest releases of the SDKs, Xcode 12, and iOS 14. It seems they will not be addressed.</p>

<h4>* * *</h4>

<p>Given the increasingly tenuous relationship that Apple has with developers, I do not understand how it could be in their interest to act like such an asshole right now. Not to mention, it is unlikely that they will even be able to review all of these app submissions in time. We already do not feel valued due to the aforementioned issues, and this is an outright negligent response to developer relationships the company has damaged over the past few years. Announcing that iOS 14 ships tomorrow with virtually no notice to developers is yet another breach of trust, another disappointment, and quite frankly feels like a big ‘fuck you’ to developers. What purpose does it serve to place this last-minute, unnecessary stress on third-party developers?</p>

<p>Who is in charge of iOS releases at Apple that thought this was a good idea? Who is the head of Developer Relations that thought this was a good idea?</p>

<p>To whomever made these decisions: <strong>y’all fucked up. Again.</strong></p>

September 15, 2020 | https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt12/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt12/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>In the <a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io/posts/audio-from-scratch-pt11">last post</a> I ended by saying we
would be able to use <a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a> to generate some simple tunes.
In this post we will actually put that to the test. Click the video to hear the end result :)</p><p>Brother John / Frère Jacques is a popular nursing rhyme, and also one of the few things I was taught
to play on the piano as a kid. As such, I thought it’d be fitting to try to code this song this time.
The notes for playing this are taken from <a href="https://www.true-piano-lessons.com/frere-jacques.html">true-piano-lessons.com</a>.
The code takes the notes starting in the key of C. (Maybe since it’s in Go, I should have started in G. Feel free to change it).</p><p>In the previous posts, we actually ignored the problem of turning notes into frequencies.
<a href="https://github.com/DylanMeeus/GoAudio">GoAudio</a> works with given frequencies. So we’ll need to
first implement a way to turn the notes into frequencies. For this, I came up with a somewhat
hackish solution but I didn’t know a better way other than hardcoding it.</p><p>As we’re making the music using the equal-tempered scale we can calculate the frequencies for each
note given a reference frequency. I’m using <code>middle C</code> as the reference frequency, which can be
derived from <code>concert A (A440</code>) in this way: <code>middleC = (concertA * math.Pow(2, 3/12)) / 2</code>.</p><p>To follow along with how we derive the frequencies for each note, I suggest taking a look at
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equal_temperament">wikipedia</a>. The basic idea however is that we have
12 semitones in an octave, so for each octave we have to generate the 12 semitones based off a
reference frequency. Confusingly however, an octave starts at <code>C</code> and not at <code>A</code>. (it does loop
around) so we get: <code>C D E F G A B</code>. Each time we loop around and get back to C, we move up one
octave (meaning higher frequency, thus higher pitch).</p><p>You can view a table of all frequencies from C0 (C at octave 0) up to B8 (B at octave 8)
<a href="https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html">here</a>.</p><p>The code for this is a bit hacky, so if you have a better way please let me know! :-)</p><p>Here I am generating in both the fourth and fifth octave, from C4 -&gt; B5. If we print the map
generated by this code we get (abbreviated)</p><p>Also note that I have added <code>WAIT</code> with frequency 0 in there. This is a bit hacky (and unnecessary
in Go). I’ve added this so we can have some more wait time between playing different sections of the song.
As the default-zero value of a float is zero, and because you can access a map safely even when a
key is missing, this was not necessary. We could just call the map with the <code>WAIT</code> key even if it
wasn’t inserted and our result would still be correct.</p><p>If you’re reading this, there’s a pretty good chance you know this. But I wanted to highlight it, as
I think this is a pretty cool feature of Go! Yet, in this case, I chose to be explicit about the
intend of the <code>WAIT</code> note.</p><p>Alright, so we have our notes and our frequencies associated with them. We still need to actually
generate a wave. For this I’ve introduced the convenience function “play” which takes a few
parameters and returns a frame:</p><p>This is quite similar to the past about
<a href="https://dylanmeeus.github.io.posts/audio-from-scratch-pt10.md">ADSR</a>, and just as in that post we
will apply the ADSR envelope to the signal here as well. Notice that ‘play’ takes a <code>LookupOscillator</code>.
In the previous post we’ve build a few of these for generating sine waves, triangle, square, etc.</p><p>This function tells us, play a note for a certain duration (in seconds) with a given oscillator, and
return a slice of frames. This function allowed me to quickly change the type of wave, and play
around with the result of playing different notes for different timespans.</p><p>Getting the ADSR envelope to sound like I wanted to was honestly the goold old way of trial and error. 😅.</p><p>Finally we have everything ready to compose the song. The below code is definitely not pretty, but it gets the job done!
First we generate the notes, then we create a wave table of a shape that we’d like. We
plug this into an Oscillator, and then we start calling the <code>Play</code> function with the notes that we
need.</p><p>For convenience I’ve added some variables to easily adapt the duration of sections of the song.
Variables, yeah!</p><div><div>

<p>After several posts discussing different aspects of IT as a whole, I would like to start discussing another thread of thinking: software architecture. This is a huge topic and I pondered for quite a while where to start. Finally, I decided to start with debunking the long-lived architectural myth of reusability because this makes it easier to understand some of the ideas that I will discuss in later posts.</p>
<p>Reusability is a recurring topic that I discuss for lots of years meanwhile:</p>
<ul>
<li>One of my first public talks discussed reusability <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>I wrote an article about reusability for a (German) IT journal at the same time.</li>
<li>Some years later I published a <a href="https://blog.codecentric.de/en/2015/10/the-broken-promise-of-re-use/">post</a> discussing reusability on the blog of <a href="https://www.codecentric.de/">codecentric AG</a>.</li>
<li>I discuss this topic in many of my talks and workshops, especially in the context of service design.</li>
</ul>
<p>Yet, all these places only discuss selected aspects of the reusability fallacy. Here I try to brings those aspects together and discuss reusability in a more comprehensive way – probably still missing some relevant facets.</p>
<h2 id="the-fallacy">The fallacy</h2>
<p>Reusability is sort of a holy grail in software architecture and design for many years. The discussion about reusable software modules <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> gained momentum in the early 1970s. E.g., the seminal computer science paper <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5388187">“Structured design”</a> by Stevens, Myers and Constantine from 1974 already discussed reusability as one of the goals of structured design. <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>This discussion persists until today. And admittedly, the idea is intriguing: I create a software module once and as there are basically no reproduction costs in software, I can reuse it at no cost in as many places as I want. Invest once, harvest forever. What an efficiency lever! What a cost saver!</p>
<p>Hence, it is not surprising that generations of IT managers demand reusability as essential design goal, and their high priests, the architects in return try hard to deliver reusability. Over time this yearning for reusability has become independent. Nobody asks anymore if reusability makes sense in the given context. Reusability is important. Period!</p>
<p>Eventually, it even turned around: architects discovered that they can use reusability as a powerful sales argument for the introduction of new architectural paradigms. It was not necessary that they proved their claim. Simply arguing with reusability was enough to convince IT managers of the new paradigm. The typical reasoning was (and still is) as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We definitely need to invest in implementing &lt;shiny new paradigm&gt;. I know this does not create any business value now, but it allows to create <strong>reusable</strong> &lt;building blocks of paradigm&gt;! This way, we will have to pay a lot less for future projects, they will be a lot faster and we will be a lot more flexible. <em>The investment will pay for itself in no time!</em>â€�</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From all that I have seen in my IT career, it never worked this way – and I am very sure, it also never will work in the future.</p>
<h2 id="a-deeply-industrial-belief">A deeply industrial belief</h2>
<p>The reason why it never works this way, has several facets. First of all, reusability is a deeply industrial belief. In the physical world, reusability is mostly interchangeable with standardization. Standardized parts support building the product at a lower price and can easily be reused in multiple products. On the other hand, any part that is designed with reusability in mind is a candidate for becoming a standardized part.</p>
<p>The key aspect of reusability/standardization in the physical world is that it helps to save costs over time. You need to spend the efforts to design the part only once. The production process needs to be designed and set up only once. The required tooling needs to be created and installed only once. Afterwards you can produce as many copies of the part as you like without having to repeat the design and setup investments.</p>
<p>This way, reusability helps satisfying the key success criterion of <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/markets/#industrial-markets">industrial markets</a>: scale production in a cost-efficient way. A big part of the cost savings comes from the production of the parts, that you can produce lots of them without having to design and set up the production process and tooling over and over again.</p>
<p>If you additionally create the part in a way that it can be (re)used in different contexts, you can produce an even higher quantity which helps spreading the fixed costs for design and setup even further, i.e., the part becomes even cheaper (in terms of costs, not quality).</p>
<p>Thus, consistently aiming for reusability makes a lot of sense in the physical world where you create houses, bridges, furniture, electronic devices, etc. from reusable parts. But transferring this idea of cost savings via reusability to software development is riddled with several caveats.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-is-part-of-design-not-production">Implementation is part of design, not production</h2>
<p>The first persistent misunderstanding is that writing code can be compared to building a house or assembling a car. The idea is that software architecture and design work can be compared to designing a car or house and writing code is executing the plan, i.e., assembling the final product.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this perception is completely wrong. The final product in software development is the executable program. We usually create it by compiling the source code <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>. In other words: IT has the probably most efficient production process imaginable for more than 60 years meanwhile – so efficient, that we usually completely forget about it.</p>
<p>Today, this production process typically is a step in a CI/CD pipeline, but it does not change the fact that we build our products in an extremely efficient way without any human intervention.</p>
<p>Writing code on the other hand is completing the design. The product design is only completed after the last line of source code is written. Writing code is like adding the details of a car design, designing the details of the shape, the interior design, the power transmission and so on – everything that needs to be done <em>before</em> a car can be produced. Producing the actual product, the executable program from the code is negligible in terms of time, costs and effort.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing code is completing the design.</p>
<p>Building the product from the completed design is just issuing a command (and has nothing to do with writing code).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thus, all those metaphors that compare writing code with assembling a car or building a house are wrong.</p>
<p>This also means that the assumption derived from the physical world breaks that we can save lots of money in the production process by using reusable parts. The production process in IT is already unbelievable cheap compared to any physical domain. Additionally, we can produce as many copies of a part at basically zero cost: it is called the copy command.</p>
<p>Accordingly, all considerations that are based on the value of reusability in the physical world do not work in IT as reusability in software development does not help to save money in the production process.</p>
<h2 id="the-inherent-lack-of-standardization-in-it">The inherent lack of standardization in IT</h2>
<p>This still leaves room for efficiency gains through reusability in the design process. To (mis)use the metaphor of automobiles once more: Many car manufacturers use a platform strategy these days, i.e., they reuse a lot of standardized base parts in their car designs. E.g., they do not design the engines or chassis from scratch for every new model they design, but reuse engines or chassis from their platform, complementing them with parts individually designed for the specific model.</p>
<p>While this platform approach of reusing parts again primarily targets cost savings on the production side (which is not relevant in IT, as we have seen in the last section), it probably also helps to reduce time, costs and effort in the design process.</p>
<p>We can apply this idea to software development: The more reusable parts we can use in our design, i.e., software development process, the more time, costs and effort we can probably save.</p>
<p>This is where another peculiarity of IT strikes.</p>
<p>In his famous essay <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220477127_No_Silver_Bullet_Essence_and_Accidents_of_Software_Engineering">“No silver bullet”</a> <sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, Fred Brooks reasons about essential and accidental complexity in software development. One of the drivers of essential complexity he lists is “complexity”:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Complexity. Software entities are more complex for their size than perhaps any other human construct, because no two parts are alike (at least above the statement level). If they are, we make the two similar parts into one, a subroutine, open or closed. In this respect software systems differ profoundly from computers, buildings, or automobiles, where repeated elements abound. […] Likewise, a scaling-up of a software entity is not merely a repetition of the same elements in larger size; it is necessarily an increase in the number of different elements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, Brooks clearly rejects the idea that we can design a software solution from a set of higher-level standardized building blocks in the same way as we can design a wall by arranging the same type of brick multiple times. Each part we use will be different from all other parts.</p>
<p>Yet, while making the case against standardized building blocks, Brooks still leaves room for reuse: he states each part in our solution will be different, but we may use a part several times from higher-level contexts. Following this idea, we reuse lower-level functionalities to support higher-level functionalities.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-left-for-reusability">What is left for reusability</h2>
<p>In this post, I tried to deconstruct a part of the reusability fallacy: the fallacy that we can save lots of money from a more efficient production process by using standardized, reusable parts. Software development is all about design. The design is only completed after the last line of code is written.</p>
<p>The actual production process, i.e., creating the executable program, is so efficient and cheap that there is nothing left to save. Thus, all the reusability approaches that take concepts from the physical world and try to apply them to software development do not work.</p>
<p>We are left with efficiency gains in the design process itself due to the use of reusable parts. In the <a href="https://ufried.com/blog/reusability_fallacy_2/">next part of this little series</a> …</p></div></div>

  <section><p>Kontrast is a contrast checker available for desktop and mobile devices. You can
use Kontrast to choose background and text color combinations for your website or
app that your users will find easy to read. Kontrast can help you improve the
accessibility for your site or app for people with vision problems.</p>

<p>Kontrast won’t catch all the problems, but it should still be very helpful to catch
many issues early on, when designing your interface.</p>

<p>I released the first version of Kontrast earlier this month.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.kde.org/screenshots/kontrast/kontrast.png" alt="Kontrast main page"></p>

<p>Another big feature of Kontrast is the possibility to generate random color
combinations with good contrast. These colors can be saved in the application itself,
so that you can keep a particularly good color combination for later use.</p>

<p>Kontrast is available for the Linux desktop, <a href="https://plasma-mobile.org/">Plasma Mobile</a> and
there is also a Beta version for Android.</p>

<p>This application is built using the excellent <a href="https://develop.kde.org/frameworks/kirigami">Kirigami</a>
framework.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.kde.org/screenshots/kontrast/kontrat_mobile.png" alt="Kontrast mobile view"></p>

<p>You can download and install Kontrast from <a href="https://flathub.org/apps/details/org.kde.kontrast">Flathub</a> and
a nightly build is also available <a href="https://binary-factory.kde.org/job/Kontrast_android/">in binary factory</a>.</p>

<p>The tarball is available <a href="https://download.kde.org/stable/kontrast/kontrast-1.0.2.tar.xz">here</a>
and is signed with my gpg key <a href="https://carlschwan.eu/gpg.html">14B0ED91B5783415D0AA1E0A06B35D38387B67BE</a>.</p>

<h2 id="future-improvements">Future Improvements</h2>

<p>Future plans include improving the Android build, possibly release a stable
build of the Android version and also create a QtQuick-based color picker
that is better integrated with the application.</p>

September 15, 2020 | https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-5/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-5/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p><em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-0/">first</a></em> – <em><a href="https://bernsteinbear.com/blog/compiling-a-lisp-4/">previous</a></em></p>

<p>Welcome back to the “Compiling a Lisp” series. Last time, we added some
primitive unary instructions like <code>add1</code> and <code>integer-&gt;char</code>. This time, we’re
going to add some primitive <em>binary</em> functions like <code>+</code> and <code>&lt;</code>. After this
post, we’ll be able to compile programs like:</p>



<p>Note that these expressions may look like function calls but, like last
chapter, they are not opening new stack frames (which I’ll explain more about
later). Instead, the compiler will recognize that the programmer is directly
applying the symbol <code>+</code> and generate special code. You can think about this
kind of like an inlined function call.</p>

<p>It’s important to remember that the compiler has a certain internal contract:
the result of any given compiled expression is stored in <code>rax</code>. This isn’t some
intrinsic property of all compilers, but it’s one we’ve kept so far in this
series.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is similar to but not the same as the calling convention that I
mentioned earlier, where function results are stored in <code>rax</code>. That calling
convention is for interacting with other people’s code. Within your own
generated code, there are no rules. So we could pick any other register,
really, for storing intermediate results.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that we’re building primitive functions that can take two arguments, you
might notice a problem: our strategy of storing the result in <code>rax</code> won’t work
on its own. If we were to naïvely write something like the following to
implement <code>+</code>, then <code>rax</code> would get overwritten in the code generated by
compiling <code>operand1(args)</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_call</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_is_symbol</span><span>(</span><span>callable</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_symbol_matches</span><span>(</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>"+"</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>Compile_expr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>operand2</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>)));</span>
      <span>// The result of this is stored in rax ^</span>
      <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>Compile_expr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>operand1</span><span>(</span><span>args</span><span>)));</span>
      <span>// Oops, we just overwrote rax ^</span>
      <span>Emit_add_something</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>/*dst=*/</span><span>kRax</span><span>));</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We could try and work around this by adding some kind of register allocation
algorithm and take advantage of <code>rcx</code>, <code>rdx</code>, etc. Or, simpler, we could decide
to allocate all intermediate values on the stack and move on with our lives. I
prefer the latter. It’s simpler.</p>

<h3 id="stack-background-info">Stack background info</h3>

<p>Since we can’t yet save our compiled programs to disk, there’s some amount of
setup that has to happen before they’re run. Right now, the C programs I’m
providing along with this series compile to binaries that just run the test
suites for the compiler. They don’t actually run full programs. For this
reason, there are already some call frames on the stack by the time our
generated code is run.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at the stack at the moment we enter a compiled Lisp program:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>|                  | High addresses
+------------------+
|  main            |
+------------------+ |
|  ~ some data ~   | |
|  ~ some data ~   | |
+------------------+ |
|  compile_test    | |
+------------------+ |
|  ~ some data ~   | |
|  ~ some data ~   | v
+------------------+
|  Testing_exe...  | rsp (stack pointer)
+------------------+
|                  | &lt;-- Our frame!
|                  | Low addresses
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this diagram, we have the C program’s <code>main</code> function, which has its own
local variables and so on. Then the <code>main</code> function calls the <code>compile_test</code>
unit suite. This in turn calls this <code>Testing_execute_expr</code> function
(abbreviated in the diagram), which is responsible for calling into our
generated code. Every call stores the return address (some place to find the
next instruction to execute) on the stack and adjusts <code>rsp</code> down.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Refresher: the call stack grows <em>down</em>. Why? Check out this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/54391533/569183">StackOverflow
answer</a> that quotes an architect
on the Intel 4004 and 8080 architectures. It’s stayed the same ever since.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In this diagram, we have <code>rsp</code> pointing at a return address somewhere inside
the function <code>Testing_execute_expr</code>, since that’s what called our Lisp
entrypoint. We have some data “above” (higher addresses) <code>rsp</code> that we’re not
allowed to poke at, and we have this empty space “below” (lower addresses)
<code>rsp</code> that is in our current <em>stack frame</em>. I say “empty” because we haven’t
yet stored anything there, not because it’s necessarily zero-ed out.  I don’t
think there are any guarantees about the values in this stack frame.</p>

<p>We can use our stack frame to write and read values for our current Lisp
program. With every recursive subexpression, we can allocate a little more
stack space to keep track of the values. When I say “allocate”, I mean
“subtract from the stack pointer”, because the stack is already a contiguous
space in memory allocated for us. For example, here is how we can write to the
stack:</p>



<p>This puts the integer <code>4</code> at displacement <code>-8</code> from <code>rsp</code>. On the stack diagram
above, it would be at the slot labeled “Our frame”. It’s also possible to read
with a positive or zero displacement, but those point to previous stack frames
and the return address, respectively. So let’s avoid manipulating those.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that I used a multiple of 8. Not every store has to be a to an address
that is a multiple of 8, but it is natural and I think also <em>faster</em> to store
8-byte-sized things at aligned addresses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Let’s walk through a real example to get more hands-on experience with this
stack storage idea. We’ll use the program <code>(+ 1 2)</code>. The compiled version of
that program should:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move <code>compile(2)</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>Move <code>rax</code> into <code>[rsp-8]</code></li>
  <li>Move <code>compile(1)</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>Add <code>[rsp-8]</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
</ul>

<p>So after compiling that, the stack will look like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>|                  | High addresses
+------------------+
|  Testing_exe...  | RSP
+------------------+
|  0x8             | RSP-8 (result of compile(2))
|                  | Low addresses
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And the result will be in <code>rax</code>, per our internal compiler contract.</p>

<p>This is all well and good, but at some point we’ll need our compiled programs
to emit the <code>push</code> instruction or make function calls of their own. Both of
these modify the stack pointer. <code>push</code> writes to the stack and decrements
<code>rsp</code>. <code>call</code> is roughly equivalent to <code>push</code> followed by <code>jmp</code>.</p>

<p>For that reason, x86-64 comes with another register called <code>rbp</code> and it’s
designed to hold the Base Pointer. While the stack pointer is supposed to track
the “top” (low address) of the stack, the base pointer is meant to keep a
pointer around to the “bottom” (high address) of our current stack frame.</p>

<p>This is why in a lot of compiled code you see the following instructions
repeated<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>myfunction:</span>
<span>push</span> <span>rbp</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>rbp</span><span>,</span> <span>rsp</span>
<span>sub</span> <span>rsp</span><span>,</span> <span>N</span>  <span>; optional; allocate stack space for locals</span>
<span>; ... function body ...</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>rsp</span><span>,</span> <span>rbp</span>  <span>; required if you subtracted from rsp above</span>
<span>pop</span> <span>rbp</span>
<span>ret</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first three instructions, called the <em>prologue</em>, save <code>rbp</code> to the stack,
and then set <code>rbp</code> to the current stack pointer. Then it’s possible to maintain
steady references to variable locations on the stack even as <code>rsp</code> changes.
Yes, the compiler could adjust its internal table of references every time the
compiler emits code that modifies <code>rsp</code>, but that sounds much harder.</p>

<p>The last three instructions, called the <em>epilogue</em>, fetch the old <code>rbp</code> that we
saved to the stack, write it back into <code>rbp</code>, then exit the call.</p>

<p>To confirm this for yourself, check out this <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/qPM8Mh">sample compiled C
code</a>. Look at the disassembly following the
label <code>square</code>. Prologue, code, epilogue.</p>

<h3 id="stack-allocation-infrastructure">Stack allocation infrastructure</h3>

<p>Until now, we haven’t needed to keep track of much as we recursively traverse
expression trees. Now, in order to keep track of how much space on the stack
any given compiled code will need, we have to add more state to our compiler.
We’ll call this state the <code>stack_index</code> — Ghuloum calls it <code>si</code> — and we’ll
pass it around as a parameter. Whatever it’s called, it points to the first
writable (unused) index in the stack at any given point.</p>

<p>In compiled functions, the first writable index is <code>-kWordSize</code> (<code>-8</code>), since
the base pointers is already at <code>0</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_function</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>Buffer_write_arr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kFunctionPrologue</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span> <span>kFunctionPrologue</span><span>);</span>
  <span>_</span><span>(</span><span>Compile_expr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>node</span><span>,</span> <span>-</span><span>kWordSize</span><span>));</span>
  <span>Buffer_write_arr</span><span>(</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>kFunctionEpilogue</span><span>,</span> <span>sizeof</span> <span>kFunctionEpilogue</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I’ve also gone ahead and added the prologue and epilogue. They’re stored in
static arrays. This makes them easier to modify, and also makes them accessible
to testing helpers. The testing helpers can use these arrays to make testing
easier for us — we can check if our expected code is book-ended by this code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>const</span> <span>byte</span> <span>kFunctionPrologue</span><span>[]</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// push rbp</span>

    <span>// ret</span>
    <span>0xc3</span><span>,</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For <code>Compile_expr</code>, we just pass this new stack index through.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_expr</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>node</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>stack_index</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
  <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_is_pair</span><span>(</span><span>node</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>

                        <span>stack_index</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And for <code>Compile_call</code>, we actually get to use it. Let’s look back at our stack
storage strategy for compiling <code>(+ 1 2)</code> (now replacing <code>rsp</code> with <code>rbp</code>):</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move <code>compile(2)</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>Move <code>rax</code> into <code>[rbp-8]</code></li>
  <li>Move <code>compile(1)</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
  <li>Add <code>[rbp-8]</code> to <code>rax</code></li>
</ul>

<p>For binary functions, this can be generalized to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compile <code>arg2</code> (stored in <code>rax</code>)</li>
  <li>Move <code>rax</code> to <code>stack_index</code></li>
  <li>Compile <code>arg1</code> (stored in <code>rax</code>)</li>
  <li>Do something with the results (in <code>[rbp-stack_index]</code> and <code>rax</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>The key is this: for the first recursive call to <code>Compile_expr</code>, the compiler
is allowed to emit code that can use the current <code>stack_index</code> and anything
below that on the stack. For the <em>second</em> recursive call to <code>Compile_expr</code>, the
compiler has to bump <code>stack_index</code>, since we’ve stored the result of the first
compiled call at <code>stack_index</code>.</p>

<p>Take a look at our implementation of binary add:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>Compile_call</span><span>(</span><span>Buffer</span> <span>*</span><span>buf</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>ASTNode</span> <span>*</span><span>args</span><span>,</span>
                 <span>word</span> <span>stack_index</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>// ...</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>AST_symbol_matches</span><span>(</span><span>callable</span><span>,</span> <span>"+"</span><span>))</span> <span>{</span>

September 15, 2020 | https://liuliu.me/eyes/bazel-for-libraries-distribution-an-open-source-library-author-perspective/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://liuliu.me/eyes/bazel-for-libraries-distribution-an-open-source-library-author-perspective/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the past a few days, I’ve been experimenting with Bazel as a library distribution mechanism for <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a>.</p>

<p>I am pretty familiar with hermetic build systems at this point. My main knowledge comes from Buck dating 8 years back. At that time, it never occurred to me such a build system could eventually be a library distribution mechanism. During the same 8 years, NPM has taken over the world. New language-dependent package managers such as Go module, Cargo and Swift Package Manager popularized the concept of using the public repositories (GitHub) as the dependency references. Languages prior to this period, mainly C / C++ are moving to this direction, slowly.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a> has a simple autoconf based feature detection / configuration system. You would expect the package to work when <code>./configure &amp;&amp; make</code>. However, it never made any serious attempt to be too smart. My initial experience with monorepos at companies strongly influenced the decision to have a simple build system. I fully expect that serious consumers will vendor the library into their monorepo using their own build systems.</p>

<p>This has been true for the past a few years. But as I am finishing up <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a> and increasingly using that for other closed-source personal projects, maintaining a closed-source <em>monorepo</em> setup for my personal projects while upstreaming fixes is quite an unpleasant experience. On the other hand, <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a> from the beginning meant to be a low-level implementation. I am expected to have high-level language bindings at some point. Given that I am doing more application-related development with <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a> in closed-source format now, it feels like the right time.</p>

<p>Although there is no one-true library distribution mechanism for C / C++, there are contenders. From the good-old apt / rpm, to Conan, which has gained some mind-share in the open-source world in recent years.</p>

<p>The choice of Bazel is not accidental. I’ve been doing <a href="https://liuliu.me/eyes/migrating-ios-project-to-bazel-a-real-world-experience/">some Swift development with Bazel</a> and the experience has been positive. Moreover, the choice of high-level binding language for <a href="https://libnnc.org/">nnc</a>, I figured, would be Swift.</p>

<h2 id="configure">Configure</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a>’s build process, as much as I would rather not, is host-dependent. I use autoconf to detect system-wide libraries such as libjpeg and libpng, to configure proper compiler options. Although <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv">ccv</a> can be used with zero dependency, in that configuration, it can sometimes be slow.</p>

<p>Coming from the monorepo background, Bazel doesn’t have many utilities that are as readily available as in autoconf. You can write automatic configurations in Starlark as <a href="https://docs.bazel.build/versions/master/skylark/repository_rules.html">repository rules</a>, but there is no good documentation on how to write robust ones.</p>

<p>I ended up <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv/blob/unstable/WORKSPACE#L25">letting whoever use ccv to decide how they are going to enable certain features</a>. For things like CUDA, such configuration is not tenable. I ended up copying over <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/rules_cuda">TensorFlow’s CUDA rules</a>.</p>

<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>

<p>Good old C / C++ libraries are notoriously indifferent to libraries dependencies v.s. toolchains. Autoconf detects both toolchain configurations as well as available libraries. These types of host dependencies make cross-compilation a skill in itself.</p>

<p>Bazel is excellent for in-tree dependencies. For out-tree dependencies however, there is no established mechanism. The popular way is to write a <a href="https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/blob/master/protobuf_deps.bzl#L5">repository rules to load relevant dependencies</a>.</p>

<p>This actually works well for me. It is versatile enough to handle cases that <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/ccv/blob/unstable/config/ccv.bzl#L103">have Bazel integrations</a> and <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/dflat/blob/unstable/deps.bzl#L17">have no Bazel integrations</a>.</p>

<h2 id="consume-bazel-dependencies">Consume Bazel Dependencies</h2>

<p>Consumption of the packaged Bazel dependencies then becomes as simple as adding <code>git_repository</code> to the <code>WORKSPACE</code> and call proper <code>&lt;your_library_name&gt;_deps()</code> repository rule.</p>

<p>After packaging <a href="https://libccv.org/">ccv</a> with Bazel, now <a href="https://github.com/liuliu/s4nnc/blob/main/WORKSPACE#L3">Swift for nnc can consume the packaged dependency</a>.</p>

<h2 id="semantic-versioning-challenges">Semantic Versioning Challenges</h2>

<p>While the Bazel-provided library distribution mechanism works well for my case, it is simplistic. For one, there is really no good way to do <a href="https://semver.org/">semantic versioning</a>. It is understandable. Coming from a monorepo culture, it is challenging for anyone to dive into dependency hells of library versioning. A <a href="https://donatstudios.com/Go-v2-Modules">slightly different story happened to Go</a> a while back as well.</p>

<p>It is messy if you want to pin a specific version of the library while your dependencies are not agreeing with you. This is going to be messy regardless in C / C++ world, unless you prelink these extremely carefully. Bazel’s philosophy from what I can see, seems largely on <em>keeping the trunk working</em> side. It is working so far, but one has to wonder whether this can scale if more libraries adopted Bazel as the distribution mechanism.</p>

<h2 id="closing-words">Closing Words</h2>

<p>The past a few months experience with Bazel has been delightful. While I would continue to use language specific tools (pip, Go modules, Cargo, NPM) when doing development in that particular language, Bazel is a capable choice for me when doing cross-language development. Concepts such as <code>workspace</code>, <code>git_repository</code>, <code>http_archive</code> fit well within the larger open-source ecosystem. And most surprisingly, it works for many-repo setup if you ever need to.</p>

											<h2>How to Offload Compute-Intensive Code to Intel® GPUs</h2>
					
											
					
					


<!-- Ratings Modal -->


					
											<p>Intel® Processor Graphics Architecture is an Intel® technology that provides graphics, compute, media, and display capabilities for many of Intel’s system-on-a-chip (SoC) products. The Intel Processor Graphics Architecture is informally known as “Gen,” shorthand for generation. Each release of the architecture has a corresponding version indicated after the word “Gen.” For example, the latest release of Intel Graphics Architecture is Gen11. Over the years, they have evolved to offer excellent graphics (3D rendering and media performance) and general-purpose compute capabilities with up to 1 TFLOPS (trillion floating-point operations per second) of performance.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ll explore the general-purpose compute capabilities of the Intel Processor Graphics <strong><a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/c5/9a/The-Compute-Architecture-of-Intel-Processor-Graphics-Gen9-v1d0.pdf">Gen9</a></strong> and <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/db/88/The-Architecture-of-Intel-Processor-Graphics-Gen11_R1new.pdf"><strong>Gen11</strong></a> architectures and how to program them using <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/data-parallel-c-plus-plus.html"><strong>Data Parallel C++ (DPC++)</strong></a> in the <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit.html"><strong>Intel® oneAPI Base Toolkit</strong></a>. Specifically, we’ll look at a case study that shows programming and performance aspects of the two Gen architectures using DPC++.</p>
<h2><strong>Intel Processor Graphics: Architecture Overview by Gen</strong></h2>
<p>Intel Processor Graphics is a power-efficient, high-performance graphics and media accelerator integrated on-die with the Intel® CPU. The integrated GPU shares the last-level cache (LLC) with the CPU, which permits fine-grained, coherent data sharing at low latency and high bandwidth. <strong>Figure 1</strong> shows the SoC with Gen11 graphics. The on-die integration enables much lower power consumption than a discrete graphics card.</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_figure1.jpg" alt="" width="1019" height="735" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_figure1.jpg 1019w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_figure1-300x216.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_figure1-768x554.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1019px) 100vw, 1019px"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 1:&nbsp; Intel Processor Graphics Gen11 SoC (part of the larger CPU SoC)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2</strong> shows the architecture block diagram of a Gen9 GPU. The GPU contains many execution units (EUs), each capable of doing single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) computations. A collection of eight EUs would be a subslice. Each subslice has:</p>
<ul>
<li>An instruction cache</li>
<li>L1/L2 sampler caches</li>
<li>Memory load/store unit ports</li>
</ul>
<p>These subslices are aggregated to form a slice, which consists of a shared L3 cache (coherent with the CPU) and a banked shared local memory (SLM). An Intel integrated GPU might have one or more such slices. In such a configuration, the L3 is connected to multiple slices via an interconnect fabric.</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_figure2.jpg" alt="" width="748" height="459" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_figure2.jpg 748w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_figure2-300x184.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 748px) 100vw, 748px"></p>
<p><strong>Figure 2:&nbsp; Intel® Gen9 GPU Architecture</strong></p>
<p><strong>Figure 3</strong> shows some details of the EU in the Gen9 architecture. The EU supports multithreading with up to seven threads per EU, with each thread having 128 SIMD-8 32-bit registers. An EU can issue <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/c5/9a/The-Compute-Architecture-of-Intel-Processor-Graphics-Gen9-v1d0.pdf"><strong>up to four instructions per cycle</strong></a>. (Learn more about architecture details and benchmarking of Intel GPUs <a href="http://comparch.gatech.edu/hparch/papers/gera_ispass18.pdf"><strong>here</strong></a>.) For example, the peak theoretical GFLOPS for the hardware can be calculated as <span>(EUs)*(SIMD units/EU)*(FLOPS per cycle/SIMD unit)*(Freq GHz)</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 3:&nbsp; Subslice and EU architecture details</strong></p>
<p>When you’re programming a device such as a GPU, getting the best performance requires language constructs that map well to the hardware features available. Several APIs are available, but let’s take a deep dive into oneAPI.</p>
<h2><strong>oneAPI and DPC++ </strong></h2>
<p>oneAPI is an open, free, and standards-based programming model that provides portability and performance across accelerators and generations of hardware. oneAPI includes DPC++, the core programming language for code reuse across various hardware targets. You can find more details in my previous article, <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/parallel-universe-issue-39_1.pdf"><strong>Heterogeneous Programming Using oneAPI</strong></a> (<em>The Parallel Universe</em>, issue 39). DPC++ includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A Unified Shared Memory feature</strong> for easy host-device memory management</li>
<li><strong>OpenCL-style NDRange subgroups</strong> to aid vectorization</li>
<li><strong>Support</strong> for generic/function pointers</li>
<li><strong>And many</strong> other features</li>
</ul>
<p>This article presents a case study that converts a CUDA code to DPC++.</p>
<h2><strong>Case Study: Compute Kernel Execution on Intel Processor Graphics</strong></h2>
<p>Let’s look at the <strong><a href="https://github.com/ATNF/askap-benchmarks/tree/master/current/tHogbomCleanOMP">Hogbom Clean imaging algorithm</a></strong>, widely used in processing radio astronomy images. This imaging algorithm has two hotspots:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>Find Peak</span></li>
<li><span>SubtractPSF</span></li>
</ul>
<p>For brevity, we’ll focus on the performance aspects of <span>Find Peak</span>. The original implementation was in C++, OpenMP, CUDA, and OpenCL. The host CPU offloads the CUDA and OpenCL kernels onto the GPU when available. (CUDA is a proprietary approach to offload computations to only NVidia GPUs.) <strong>Figures 4</strong> and <strong>5</strong> show snippets of the host and device code, respectively.</p>

<p><strong>Figure 4:&nbsp; Find Peak host code: C++, CUDA</strong></p>

<p><strong>Figure 5:&nbsp; Find Peak device code: CUDA</strong></p>
<p>We can manually replace the CUDA code with DPC++, or we can use the <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/get-started-with-intel-dpcpp-compatibility-tool/top.html"><strong>DPC++ Compatibility Tool (DPCT)</strong></a>. DPCT assists in migrating CUDA programs to DPC++ (<strong>Figures 6</strong> and <strong>7</strong>). It just requires the Intel oneAPI Base Toolkit and the NVIDIA CUDA header. Invoking the DPCT tool to migrate an <span>example.cu</span> file is as simple as:</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_code1.jpg" alt="" width="1241" height="110" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_code1.jpg 1241w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_code1-300x27.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_code1-1024x91.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_code1-768x68.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1241px) 100vw, 1241px"></p>
<p>For migrating applications with many CUDA files, we can use the DPCT options <span>–in-root</span> to set the location of program sources and <span>–out-root</span> for writing the DPCT migrated code. If the application uses <span>make</span> or <span>cmake</span>, it’s recommended that migration be done using <span>intercept-build</span>. This creates a compilation database file (<span>.json file</span>) with the compiler invocations (the input file names for both the host C++ code and the device CUDA code and the associated compiler options).</p>
<p><img src="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_code2.jpg" alt="" width="1240" height="150" srcset="https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_code2.jpg 1240w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_code2-300x36.jpg 300w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_code2-1024x124.jpg 1024w, https://simplecore-ger.intel.com/techdecoded/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/dpc_code2-768x93.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1240px) 100vw, 1240px"></p>
<p>Specifically, for migrating Hogbom Clean CUDA code to DPC++, we can either invoke the DPCT tool on the <span>HogbomCuda.cu</span> file which has the CUDA kernels or use intercept-build. By default, the migrated code gets the file name extension <span>dp.cpp</span>.</p>
<p>Let’s review the migrated DPC++ code (<strong>Figures 6-9</strong>) and compare with the original CUDA code<br>
(<strong>Figures 4</strong> and <strong>5</strong>).</p>

<p><strong>Figure 9: Comparison of Find Peak CUDA kernel versus migrated DPC++ device kernel</strong></p>
<p>Some key aspects of a DPC++ code include the invocation of device code using <a href="https://www.khronos.org/sycl/"><strong>SYCL</strong></a> queues, a lambda function handler for executing the device code, and, optionally, <span>a parallel_for</span> construct for multithreaded execution. The migrated DPC++ code here uses the unified shared memory (USM) programming model and allocates memory on the device for data being read/written by the device kernels. Since this is a device allocation, explicit data copy needs to be done from host to device and vice versa. We can also allocate the memory as shared and it can be accessed and updated by both the host and the device. Not shown here is non-USM code, in which data transfers are done using SYCL buffers and accessors.</p>
<p>The DPCT-migrated code determines the current device and creates a queue for that device (calls to <span>get_current_device()</span> and <span>get_default_queue()</span>). To offload DPC++ code to the GPU, we need to create a queue with the parameter <span>sycl::gpu_selector</span>. The data to be processed should be made available on the device and to the kernel that executes on the GPU. The dimensions and size of the data being copied into and out of the GPU are specified by <span>sycl::range, sycl::nd_range</span>. When using DPCT, each source line in the CUDA code is migrated to equivalent DPC++ code. For the Find Peak device kernel code (<span>d_findPeak</span>), the DPC++ code generated (from CUDA code) is nearly a one-to-one equivalent migration. Hence, DPCT is a very powerful tool for quick porting and prototyping. The migrated DPC++ code comparison versus CUDA code is shown <strong>Figures 7</strong> and <strong>9</strong>.</p>
<p>Having migrated the code to DPC++ using DPCT, our next task is to check correctness and efficiency. In some cases, the DPCT tool may replace preprocessor directive variables with their values. We may need a manual fix to undo this replacement. We may also get compilation errors with the migrated code that indicates a fix (e.g., replacing CUDA <span>threadId.x</span> with an equivalent <span>nd_range accessor</span>). The Hogbom Clean application code has a correctness checker that helped us validate the results produced by the migrated DPC++ code. The correctness check was done by comparing results from the DPC++ code execution on the GPU and a baseline C++ implementation on the host CPU.</p>
<p>Now we can determine the efficiency of the migrated DPC++ code on a GPU by analyzing its utilization (EU occupancy, use of caches, SP or DP FLOPS) and data transfer between host and device. Some of the parameters that have an impact on GPU utilization are the workgroup sizes/range dimensions. In the Hogbom Clean application, for Find Peak, these are <span>nBlocks</span> and <span>findPeakWidth</span>.</p>
<p>To illustrate the performance impact and tuning opportunity, <strong>Figure 10</strong> shows a performance profile collected using <span>nBlocks</span> values set to <span>24</span> and <span>4</span>. The <span>findPeakWidth</span> was set to <span>256</span>. The profile was collected with <a href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/vtune-profiler.html"><strong>Intel® VTune™ Profiler</strong></a>, which supports GPU profiling. Tuning is more explicitly required when using DPCT because the parameters that are efficient for an NVidia GPU using CUDA may not be the most efficient for an Intel GPU executing DPC++ code. <strong>Table 1</strong> shows the stats collected on Gen9 (48 EUs).</p>

<p>In addition to GPU utilization and efficiency optimizations, the data transfer between host and device should also be tuned. The Hogbom Clean application has multiple calls to Find Peak, and <span>SubtractPSF</span> kernels and the data used by these kernels can be resident on the device. Thus, they don’t require reallocation and/or copy from host to device, or vice versa. (We’ll discuss some of these optimizations related to data transfers and USM in future articles.)</p>
<h2><strong>Writing Better Algorithms</strong></h2>
<p>Understanding the Intel Processor Graphics Architecture and DPC++ features can help you write better algorithms and portable implementations. In this article, we reviewed some details of the architecture and explored a case study using DPC++ constructs and DPCT. It’s important to tune the kernel parameters to get best performance on Intel GPUs, especially when using DPCT. …</p></div></div></div></div>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Concurrency is hard to get <em>correct</em>, at least for those of us unlucky enough to be writing in languages which expose directly the guts of concurrent hardware: threads and shared memory. Getting concurrency correct <em>and</em> fast is hard, too. Your knowledge about single-threaded optimization often won’t help you: at a micro (instruction) level we can’t simply apply the usual rules of μops, dependency chains, throughput limits, and so on. The rules are different.</p>

<p>If that first paragraph got your hopes up, this second one is here to dash them: I’m not actually going to do a deep dive into the very low level aspects of concurrent performance. There are a lot of things we just don’t know about how atomic instructions and fences execute, and we’ll save that for another day.</p>

<p>Instead, I’m going to describe a higher level taxonomy that I use to think about concurrent performance. We’ll group the performance of concurrent operations into six broad <em>levels</em> running from fast to slow, with each level differing from its neighbors by roughly an order of magnitude in performance.</p>

<p>I often find myself thinking in terms of these categories when I need high performance concurrency: what is the best level I can practically achieve for the given problem? Keeping the levels in mind is useful both during initial design (sometimes a small change in requirements or high level design can allow you to achieve a better level), and also while evaluating existing systems (to better understand existing performance and evaluate the path of least resistance to improvements).</p>

<h3 id="a-real-world-example">A “Real World” Example</h3>

<p>I don’t want this to be totally abstract, so we will use a real-world-if-you-squint<sup id="fnref:realworld" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:realworld">1</a></sup> running example throughout: safely incrementing an integer counter across threads. By <em>safely</em> I mean without losing increments, producing out-of-thin air values, frying your RAM or making more than a minor rip in space-time.</p>

<h3 id="source-and-results">Source and Results</h3>

<p>The source for every benchmark here is <a href="https://github.com/travisdowns/concurrency-hierarchy-bench">available</a>, so you can follow along and even reproduce the results or run the benchmarks on your own hardware. All of the results discussed here (and more) are available in the same repository, and each plot includes a <code>[data table]</code> link to the specific subset used to generate the plot.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>All of the performance results are provided for several different hardware platforms: Intel Skylake, Ice Lake, Amazon Graviton and Graviton 2. However except when I explicitly mention other hardware, the prose refers to the results on Skylake. Although the specific numbers vary, most of the qualitative relationships hold for the hardware too, but <em>not always</em>. Not only does the hardware vary, but the OS and library implementations will vary as well.</p>

<p>It’s almost inevitable that this will be used to compare across hardware (“wow, Graviton 2 sure kicks Graviton 1’s ass”), but that’s not my goal here. The benchmarks are written primarily to tease apart the characteristics of the different levels, and <em>not</em> as a hardware shootout.</p>

<h2 id="level-2-contended-atomics">Level 2: Contended Atomics</h2>

<p>You’d probably expect this hierarchy to be introduced from fast to slow, or vice-versa, but we’re all about defying expectations here and we are going to start in the <em>middle</em> and work our way outwards. The middle (rounding down) turns out to be <em>level 2</em> and that’s where we will jump in.</p>

<p>The most elementary way to safely modify any shared object is to use a lock. It mostly <em>just works</em> for any type of object, no matter its structure or the nature of the modifications. Almost any mainstream CPU from the last thirty years has some type of locking<sup id="fnref:parisc" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:parisc">3</a></sup> instruction accessible to userspace.</p>

<p>So our baseline increment implementation will use a simple mutex of type <code>T</code> to protect a plain integer variable:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>T</span> <span>lock</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>bench</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>lock_guard</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>holder</span><span>(</span><span>lock</span><span>);</span>
        <span>counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We’ll call this implementation <em><abbr title="Uses a std::mutex and std::lock_guard to protect a plain integer counter.">mutex add</abbr></em>, and on my 4 CPU Skylake-S i7-6700HQ machine, when I use the vanilla <code>std::mutex</code> I get the following results for 2 to 4 threads:</p>



<p>The reported value is the median of all trials, and the vertical black error lines at the top of each bar indicate the <em>interdecile range</em>, i.e., the values at the 10th and 90th percentile. Where the error bars don’t show up, it means there is no difference between the p10 and p90 values at all, at least within the limits of the reporting resolution (100 picoseconds).</p>

<p>This shows that the baseline contended cost to modify an integer protected by a lock starts at about 125 nanoseconds for two threads, and grows somewhat with increasing thread count.</p>

<p>I can already hear someone saying: <em>If you are just modifying a single 64-bit integer, skip the lock and just directly use the atomic operations that most ISAs support!</em></p>

<p>Sure, let’s add a couple of variants that do that. The <code>std::atomic&lt;T&gt;</code> template makes this easy: we can wrap any type meeting some basic requirements and then manipulate it atomically. The easiest of all is to use <code>std::atomic&lt;uint64&gt;::operator++()</code><sup id="fnref:post" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:post">4</a></sup> and this gives us <em><abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>atomic_counter</span><span>{};</span>

<span>void</span> <span>atomic_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>atomic_counter</span><span>++</span><span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The other common approach would be to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compare-and-swap">compare and swap (<abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>)</a> to load the existing value, add one and then <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> it back if it hasn’t changed. If it <em>has</em> changed, the increment raced with another thread and we try again.</p>

<p>Note that even if you use increment at the source level, the assembly might actually end up using <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> if your hardware doesn’t support atomic increment<sup id="fnref:atomicsup" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:atomicsup">5</a></sup>, or if your compiler or runtime just don’t take advantage of atomic operations even though they are available (e.g., see what even the newest version of <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5h4K7y">icc does</a> for atomic increment, and what Java did for years<sup id="fnref:java" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:java">6</a></sup>). This caveat doesn’t apply to any of our tested platforms, however.</p>

<p>Let’s add a counter implementation that uses <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> as described above, and we’ll call it <em><abbr title="Uses a CAS loop to increment a single shared counter.">cas add</abbr></em>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>uint64_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>;</span>

<span>void</span> <span>cas_add</span><span>(</span><span>size_t</span> <span>iters</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>iters</span><span>--</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>uint64_t</span> <span>v</span> <span>=</span> <span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>load</span><span>();</span>
        <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>!</span><span>cas_counter</span><span>.</span><span>compare_exchange_weak</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>,</span> <span>v</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
            <span>;</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s what these look like alongside our existing <code>std::mutex</code> benchmark:</p>



<p>The first takeaway is that, at least in this <em>unrealistic maximum contention</em> benchmark, using <abbr title="Uses an atomic increment on a single shared counter.">atomic add</abbr> (<a href="https://www.felixcloutier.com/x86/xadd"><code>lock xadd</code></a> at the hardware level) is significantly better than <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr>. The second would be that <code>std::mutex</code> doesn’t come out looking all that bad on Skylake. It is only slightly worse than the <abbr title="Compare-and-swap: an atomic operation implemented on x86 and other CPUs.">CAS</abbr> approach at 2 cores and beats it at 3 and 4 cores. It is slower than the atomic increment approach, but less than three times as slow and seems to be scaling in a reasonable way.</p>

<p>All of these operations are belong to <em>level 2</em> in the hierarchy. The primary characteristic of level 2 is that they make a <em>contended access</em> to a shared variable. This means that at a minimum, the line containing the data needs to move out to the caching agent that manages coherency<sup id="fnref:l3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:l3">7</a></sup>, and then back up to the core that will receive ownership next. That’s about 70 cycles minimum just for that operation<sup id="fnref:inter" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:inter">8</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Can it get slower? You bet it can. <em>Way</em> slower.</p>

<h3 id="level-3-system-calls">Level 3: System Calls</h3>

<p>The next level up (“up” is not good here…) is level 3. The key characteristic of implementations at this level is that they make a <em>system call on almost every operation</em>.</p>

<p>It is easy to write concurrency primitives that make a system call <em>unconditionally</em> (e.g., a lock which always tries to wake waiters via a <code>futex(2)</code> call, even if there aren’t any), but we won’t look at those here. Rather we’ll take a look at a case where the fast path is written to avoid a system call, but the design or way it is used implies that such a call usually happens anyway.</p>

<p>Specifically, we are going to look at some <em>fair locks</em>. Fair locks allow threads into the critical section in the same order they began waiting. That is, when the critical section becomes available, the thread that has been waiting the longest is given the chance to take it.</p>

<p>Sounds like a good idea, right? Sometimes yes, but as we will see it can have significant performance implications.</p>

<p>On the menu are three different fair locks.</p>

<p>The first is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ticket_lock">ticket lock</a> with a <code>sched_yield</code> in the spin loop. The idea of the yield is to give other threads which may hold the lock time to run. This <code>yield()</code> approach is publicly frowned upon by concurrency experts<sup id="fnref:notwhat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notwhat">9</a></sup>, who then sometimes go right ahead and use it anyway.</p>

<p>We will call it <abbr title="A ticket lock that calls sched_yield in a spin loop while waiting for its turn.">ticket yield</abbr> and it looks like this:</p>



<div><div><pre><code><span>/**
 * A ticket lock which uses sched_yield() while waiting
 * for the ticket to be served.
 */</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ticket_yield</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>atomic</span><span>&lt;</span><span>size_t</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>dispenser</span><span>{},</span> <span>serving</span><span>{};</span>

<span>public:</span>

<p>Let’s plot the performance results for this lock alongside the existing approaches:</p>



<p>This is level 3 visualized: it is an order of magnitude slower than the level 2 approaches. The slowdown comes from the <code>sched_yield</code> call: this is a system call and these are generally on the order of 100s of nanoseconds<sup id="fnref:spectre" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:spectre">10</a></sup>, and it shows in the results.</p>

<p>This lock <em>does</em> have a fast path where <code>sched_yield</code> isn’t called: if the lock is available, no spinning occurs and <code>sched_yield</code> is never called. However, the combination of being a <em>fair</em> lock and the high contention in this test means that a lock convoy quickly forms (we’ll describe this in more detail later) and so the spin loop is entered basically …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

					<p>A friend once said to me: <q>You know, to some people, C is just a bunch of macros that expand to assembly</q>. It’s been years ago (smartasses: it was also before <tt>llvm</tt>, ok?), but the sentence stuck with me. Do <em>Kernighan and Ritchie</em> really look at a C program and see assembly code? Does <em>Tim Berners-Lee</em> surf the Web any differently than you and me? And what on earth <em>did</em> <em>Keanu Reeves</em> see when he looked at all of that funky green gibberish soup, anyway? No, seriously, what the heck <em>did</em> he see there?! Uhm, back to the program. Anyway, what does Python look like in <em>Guido van Rossum</em>‘s<sup>1</sup> eyes?</p>
<p>This post marks the beginning of what should develop to a <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/tag/pythons-innards/">series</a> on Python’s internals, I’m writing it since I believe that explaining something is the best way to grok it, and I’d very much like to be able to visualize more of Python’s ‘funky green gibberish soup’ as I read Python code. On the curriculum is mainly <em>CPython</em>, mainly <em>py3k</em>, mainly <em>bytecode evaluation</em> (I’m not a big compilation fan) – but practically everything around executing Python and Python-like code (<em>Unladen Swallow</em>, <em>Jython</em>, <em>Cython</em>, etc) might turn out to be fair game in this series. For the sake of brevity and my sanity, when I say <em>Python</em>, I mean <em>CPython</em> unless noted otherwise. I also assume a POSIX-like OS or (if and where it matters) Linux, unless otherwise noted. You should read this if you want to know how Python works. You should read this if you want to contribute to CPython. You should read this to find all the mistakes I’ll make and snicker at me behind me back or write snide comments. I realize it’s just <em>your</em> particular way to show affection.</p>
<p>I gather I’ll glean pretty much everything I write about from Python’s source or, occasionally, other fine materials (documentation, especially <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/c-api/index.html">this</a> and <a href="http://docs.python.org/py3k/extending/index.html">that</a>, certain PyCon lectures, <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/05/07/searching-mailing-list-archives-offline/">searching</a> <a href="http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/python-dev">python-dev</a>, etc). Everything is out there, but I do hope my efforts at putting it all in one place to which you can RSS-subscribe will make your journey easier. I assume the reader knows some C, some OS theory, a bit less than some assembly (any architecture), a bit more than some Python and has reasonable UNIX fitness (i.e., feels comfortable installing something from source). Don’t be afraid if you’re not reasonably conversant in one (or more) of these, but I can’t promise smooth sailing, either. Also, if you don’t have a working toolchain to do Python development, maybe you’d like to head over <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/04/08/contributing-to-python/">here</a> and do as it says on the second paragraph (and onwards, as relevant).</p>
<p>Let’s start with something which I assume you already know, but I think is important, at least to the main way I understand… well, everything that I do understand. I look at it as if I’m looking at a machine. It’s easy in Python’s case, since Python relies on a Virtual Machine to do what it does (like many other interpreted languages). Be certain you understand “<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_machine#Process_virtual_machines">Virtual Machine</a>” correctly in this context: think more like JVM and less like VirtualBox (very technically, they’re the same, but in the real world we usually differentiate these two kinds of VMs). I find it easiest to understand “Virtual Machine” literally – it’s a machine built from software. Your CPU is just a complex electronic machine which receives all input (machine code, data), it has a state (registers), and based on the input and its state it will output stuff (to RAM or a Bus), right? Well, CPython is a machine built from software components that has a state and processes instructions (different implementations may use rather different instructions). This software machine operates in the process hosting the Python interpreter. Keep this in mind; I like the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">machine</a> metaphor (as I explain in minute details <a href="https://tech.blog.aknin.name/2010/07/04/pythons-innards-for-my-wife/">here</a>).</p>
<p>That said, let’s start with a bird’s eye overview of what happens when you do this: <kbd>$ python -c 'print("Hello, world!")'</kbd>. Python’s binary is executed, the standard C library initialization which pretty much any process does happens and then the main function starts executing (see its source, <kbd>./Modules/python.c: main</kbd>, which soon calls <kbd>./Modules/main.c: Py_Main</kbd>). After some mundane initialization stuff (parse arguments, see if environment variables should affect behaviour, assess the situation of the standard streams and act accordingly, etc), <a href="http://docs.python.org/c-api/init.html#Py_Initialize">./Python/pythonrun.c: Py_Initialize</a> is called. In many ways, this function is what ‘builds’ and assembles together the pieces needed to run the CPython machine and makes ‘a process’ into ‘a process with a Python interpreter in it’. Among other things, it creates two very important Python data-structures: the <strong>interpreter state</strong> and <strong>thread state</strong>. It also creates the built-in <strong>module</strong> <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/sys.html">sys</a> and the module which hosts all <a href="http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#built-in-functions">builtins</a>. At a later post(s) we will cover all these in depth.</p>
<p>With these in place, Python will do one of several things based on how it was executed. Roughly, it will either execute a string (the <kbd>-c</kbd> option), execute a module as an executable (the <kbd>-m</kbd> option), or execute a file (passed explicitly on the commandline or passed by the kernel when used as an interpreter for a script) or run its <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop">REPL</a> loop (this is more a special case of the file to execute being an interactive device). In the case we’re currently following, it will execute a single string, since we invoked it with <kbd>-c</kbd>. To execute this single string, <kbd>./Python/pythonrun.c: PyRun_SimpleStringFlags</kbd> is called. This function creates the <kbd>__main__</kbd> <strong>namespace</strong>, which is ‘where’ our string will be executed (if you run <kbd>$ python -c 'a=1; print(a)'</kbd>, where is <kbd>a</kbd> stored? in this namespace). After the namespace is created, the string is executed in it (or rather, interpreted or <em>evaluated</em> in it). To do that, you must first transform the string into something that machine can work on.</p>
<p>As I said, I’d rather not focus on the innards of Python’s parser/compiler at this time. I’m not a compilation expert, I’m not entirely interested in it, and as far as I know, Python doesn’t have significant Compiler-Fu beyond the basic CS compilation course. We’ll do a (very) fast overview of what goes on here, and may return to it later only to inspect visible CPython behaviour (see the <a href="http://docs.python.org/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-global-statement">global</a> statement, which is said to affect parsing, for instance). So, the parser/compiler stage of <kbd>PyRun_SimpleStringFlags</kbd> goes largely like this: tokenize and create a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concrete_syntax_tree">Concrete Syntax Tree</a> (CST) from the code, transorm the CST into an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree">Abstract Syntax Tree</a> (AST) and finally compile the AST into a <strong>code object</strong> using <kbd>./Python/ast.c: PyAST_FromNode</kbd>. For now, think of the code object as a binary string of machine code that Python VM’s ‘machinary’ can operate on – so now we’re ready to do interpretation (again, <em>evaluation</em> in Python’s parlance).</p>
<p>We have an (almost) empty <kbd>__main__</kbd>, we have a code object, we want to evaluate it. Now what? Now this line: <kbd>Python/pythonrun.c: run_mod, v = PyEval_EvalCode(co, globals, locals);</kbd> does the trick. It receives a code object and a namespace for <strong>globals</strong> and for <strong>locals</strong> (in this case, both of them will be the newly created <kbd>__main__</kbd> namespace), creates a <strong>frame object</strong> from these and executes it. You remember previously that I mentioned that <kbd>Py_Initialize</kbd> creates a thread state, and that we’ll talk about it later? Well, back to that for a bit: each Python thread is represented by its own thread state, which (among other things) points to the stack of currently executing frames. After the frame object is created and placed at the top of the thread state stack, it (or rather, the byte code pointed by it) is evaluated, opcode by opcode, by means of the (rather lengthy) <kbd>./Python/ceval.c: PyEval_EvalFrameEx</kbd>.</p>
<p><kbd>PyEval_EvalFrameEx</kbd> takes the frame, extracts opcode (and operands, if any, we’ll get to that) after opcode, and executes a short piece of C code matching the opcode. Let’s take a closer look at what these “opcodes” look like by disassembling a bit of compiled Python code:</p>
<pre title="">&gt;&gt;&gt; from dis import dis # ooh! a handy disassembly function!
&gt;&gt;&gt; co = compile("spam = eggs - 1", "&lt;string&gt;", "exec")
&gt;&gt;&gt; dis(co)
  1           0 LOAD_NAME                0 (eggs)
              3 LOAD_CONST               0 (1)
              6 BINARY_SUBTRACT     
              7 STORE_NAME               1 (spam)
             10 LOAD_CONST               1 (None)
             13 RETURN_VALUE        
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</pre>
<p>…even without knowing much about Python’s bytecode, this is reasonably readable. You “load” the name <kbd>eggs</kbd> (where do you load it from? where do you load it to? soon), and also load a constant value (<kbd>1</kbd>), then you do a “binary subtract” (what do you mean ‘binary’ in this context? between which operands?), and so on and so forth. As you might have guessed, the names are “loaded” from the <kbd>globals</kbd> and <kbd>locals</kbd> namespaces we’ve seen earlier, and they’re loaded onto an operand stack (not to be confused with the stack of running frames), which is exactly where the binary subtract will pop them from, subtract one from the other, and put the result back on that stack. “Binary subtract” just means this is a subtraction opcode that has two operands (hence it is “binary”, this is not to say the operands are binary numbers made of ‘0’s and ‘1’s).</p>
<p>You can go look at <kbd>PyEval_EvalFrameEx</kbd> at <kbd>./Python/ceval.c</kbd> yourself, it’s not a small function by any means. For practical reasons I can’t paste too much code from there in here, but I will just paste the code that runs when a <kbd>BINARY_SUBTRACT</kbd> opcode is found, I think it really illustrates things:</p>
<pre title="">        TARGET(BINARY_SUBTRACT)
            w = POP();
            v = TOP();
            x = PyNumber_Subtract(v, w);
            Py_DECREF(v);
            Py_DECREF(w);
            SET_TOP(x);
            if (x != NULL) DISPATCH();
            break;
</pre>
<p>…pop something, take the top (of the operand stack), call a C function called PyNumber_Subtract() on these things, do something we still don’t understand (but will in due time) called “Py_DECREF” on both, set the top of the stack to the result of the subtraction (overwriting the previous top) and then do something else we don’t understand if x is not null, which is to do a …</p></div></div>

<h4>
By Khaled Abou Alfa • Published 29th of July, <span>2020
</span></h4>
<p>
In 1927, Oleg Losev, a Russian inventor and scientist would introduce the world to the light-emitting diode. This technology would remain dormant for decades. Progress was made in 1962 with the introduction of the first red <span>LED</span>. For the next 30 years, an industry would hunt for the elusive colour blue. Over time the risk of pouring resource and treasure into this pursuit increased - you were chasing the pot of gold at the end of a blue coloured rainbow.
</p>
<p>
These pursuits would continue with little success until the early 90s. Then the work of Shuji Nakamura, Isamu Akosaki and Hiroshi Amano unlocked the secrets of the blue <span>LED</span>. So significant was this discovery that in 2004, the trio would receive the Nobel price in Physics.
</p>
<p>
This work would be employed in diverse contexts, from the multitude of screens we depend upon to data communications. For the built environment, this discovery would transform artificial lighting across the world. The incandescent (and to a lesser extent the fluorescent) lamp illuminated the 20th century. Light for the 21st century would be ushered in by the <span>LED</span> lamp.
</p>
<h2 id="obsolete-lighting-law">Obsolete Lighting Law</h2>
<p>In 1999, <a href="http://www.haitzs-law.com/uploads/7/6/3/6/76362633/1999-_national_research_report__same_as_2000_sarndia_nrp_.pdf">Roland Haitz co-authored</a> a research report, on the future of <span>LED</span> lighting (which was renamed as solid state lighting). The paper included data collected over decades that plotted both the cost of lumens and the red light output per <span>LED</span> package since the 1970s. 20 years ago Haitz empirically predicted the world we are living in today and captured in a<span></span> <span>‘</span>law’ which states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Every decade, for a given wavelength of light, the cost per lumen falls by a factor of 10 and the amount of light generated per <span>LED</span> package increases by a factor of 20.<br>
— Haitz’s Law</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
A new report, which addressed the shortcomings and reviewed the impact of the earlier report, was published <a href="http://www.haitzs-law.com/uploads/7/6/3/6/76362633/2011-physica_-_haitz_r_2011_pssa.pdf">a decade later in 2010</a>. This paper predicted that within the decade (by 2020), we would have reached a point of diminishing returns. It acknowledged that Solid State Lighting (<span>SSL</span>) is limited in two areas. The conversion efficacy - converting electrical energy to luminous flux cannot exceed 100%. The actual need for increased flux range - just because you can produce it, doesn’t mean the market needs it. The paper provided indications of where the future after 2020 is likely to evolve:
</p>
<p><em><span>‘</span>These include digital tuning of both the chromaticity and the temporal/spatial placement of light within the environment that is being lit.’</em></p>
<p><span>
27</span> years after the initial spark of the blue <span>LED</span> revolution, we are now entering a period of equilibrium of both the efficacy and flux of solid state lighting. The advances in lighting have now begun to shift into new territory, one of circadian rhythms, diurnal patterns and refined controllability.
</p>
<h2 id="controllability">Controllability</h2>
<p>Inline with the predictions from 10 years ago, the lighting industry has begun to focus its attention on how <span>SSL</span> can be controlled and manipulated. The technology available today would be considered both technically impossible and prohibitively expensive, compared with technology from only 15 years ago.</p>
<p>
The terms<span></span> <span>‘</span>circadian lighting’ or<span></span> <span>‘</span>human centric lighting’ have begun entering the lexicon as a means to enhance the wellbeing of everyone interacting with the built world. With the advent of <span>SSL</span> technology we are now able to control parameters such as colour spectrum, intensity and directionality. These systems offer control based on the exact location, the relationship to the outside world and what is happening outside in real time.
</p>
<p>
The main debate for the use of this type of lighting control is whether it actually works. Does it suppress the levels of Melatonin in the body? Does it make people more alert and therefore more responsive throughout the day? These are some of the questions that the industry will need to address for the technology to become more widespread.
</p>
<p>
<strong>In the last two decades, the lighting industry has experienced a revolution. This has led to an expanded scope of what is achievable with light in a manner unimaginable back in 1927. Incredibly these benefits have come at a greatly reduced level of energy consumption (typically 1/5th of previous technologies). The work is far from done, as incandecent lamp sources (amongst others) remain in wide use throughout the world (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/246030/estimated-led-penetration-of-the-global-lighting-market/">global penetration of LEDs hovers around 61%</a>). We must wean ourselves both for our own wellbeing and that of the planet.</strong>

<h2 id="dysons-car">Dyson’s Car</h2>
<p><img src="https://blot.im/cdn/blog_78585a67eddd4bfcb7936222fddae5c7/_image_cache/da258a83-f760-46bc-8d61-23c8faa2a5e8.png" alt="Timber" width="900" height="596"></p>
<p>We now know what form factor Dyson had chosen for their <a href="https://www.autocar.co.uk/car-news/features/exclusive-inside-story-dyson-ev">now shelved electric vehicle</a>. Micromobility this is <em>not</em>.</p>
<p>
The Dyson’s interview demonstrates the tone deaf nature associated with cars. You may need a car for some activities, but for most of your mobility needs, you likely can get away with other methods. How different our cities would be if we could understand and embrace that reality together.
</p>
<p>
In adjacent news the guys over at Micromobility.io have been documenting our transition for a while. Just released is <a href="https://micromobility.io/landscape">version 2.0 of their Landscape document</a>. The document demonstrates the breadth that is on offer in this field.

<p>The 2020 Tokyo Olympics may have been postponed but that doesn’t mean we don’t get to marvel at some stunning timber architecture. As covered in <a href="https://www.stet.build/ia/007">issue 007</a>, the Japanese know a thing or two about building in timber. The completion of the <a href="https://www.designboom.com/architecture/nikken-sekkei-timber-gymnastics-center-tokyo-olympic-games-07-23-2020/">Ariake gymnastics center</a> is a wonderful extension of that history.</p>
<p><img src="https://blot.im/cdn/blog_78585a67eddd4bfcb7936222fddae5c7/_image_cache/a5fb78b8-d41f-4f9e-9bbe-ca1a8b265307.jpeg" alt="Timber" width="818" height="545"></p>

<h2 id="spoke-pens">Spoke Pens</h2>
<p><img src="https://blot.im/cdn/blog_78585a67eddd4bfcb7936222fddae5c7/_image_cache/59e3faa3-40df-46fe-98d7-bbf3cdd7d852.jpg" alt="Spoke Pens" width="680" height="680"></p>
<p>Over the past 5–10 years there has been an incredible industry of machined pens produced and sold on Kickstarter. I have found that the ergonomic design and available refill options to be under-represented. Rather than focusing on the utility of the pen itself, many focus on both the materials and aesthetic design instead.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Most people make the mistake of thinking design is what it looks like. People think it’s this veneer — that the designers are handed this box and told,<span></span> <span>“</span>Make it look good!” That’s not what we think design is. It’s not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.<br>
— Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In this regard, the <a href="https://spokedesign.com/">Spoke pens and pencils</a> are different. The inside was considered first - even though the outside has a strong design language. The pen is primarily a wrap around the pen refill or pencil mechanism. The pens accept the standard Muji Gel ink refills or the Uni Signo <span>DX</span> refills (both come in a range of colours and go down to the 0.38mm range). While the pencil is based on the Pentel <span>P20</span># mechanical pencil mechanism. Both are highly recommended.

The reason we decided so late, was because we were waiting for a SIM card for our Iridium GO satellite phone, and we received it yesterday morning. As soon as we got it, we grabbed our passports and boat papers and hurried to the Immigration Office in Shizuoka to check out (a 4-5 hour train ride away). We were eager to leave on the 9th, as there was a good weather window, with moderate winds coming from a favourable direction. Because we weren't planning to leave until late yesterday morning, there were many tasks we had no yet done, or had not had time to do.<p>We're usually more organized than this, with only a few menial tasks to do, but not this time. Last minute departures is not our style, but we also wanted to take this window. We had to find a post box to send the pocket wifi we rented and to fill our water tanks — this may not seem like much, but it was, as it piled up on top of other things we'd forgotten, like finding and installing the pot holders to the stovetop, installing the jack lines, taking out the tethers, putting key items back in the ditch bag plus a number of other last minute things that had escaped us at the time.</p></td>

We use this opportunity to chat, meanwhile butterflies gather in my gut. I am nervous. I always am before a big trip and this time is no different, although this is our biggest passage yet, and will also likely be the most challenging. My gut has every right to twist itself into knots. We ask Shuhei to drop off our pocket wifi in a post box, he agrees ­— ah, what a kind person. He came by this with his truck to help Robusta with some last minute tasks, like getting produce, gas etc. We had done most of that ahead of time.</td>

We filled as many recipients as we could carry, as we don't know how long the trip will take. Once the tanks and jerry cans were full, we left the pontoon and headed outside of the breakwater. The Shimoda coastguard ship was lifting anchor at the time, it went past us, disappearing quickly as it was going much faster. Outside of the breakwater, we saw the lighthouse on our starboard side, the one we had difficulty rounding when we arrived here a week and a half ago due to 30-knot winds off our bow. Today, the seas were tame and the skies clear and blue. <p>We saw the Kurofune, a replica of Commodore Perry's black ship, taking tourists about the harbor. It was the first time we'd seen it on the water, as there weren't many tourists before due to concerns with the coronavirus. Now that the state of emergency's been lifted, people started traveling more around the country.</p></td>

The kuroshio, or <i>black current</i>, is very strong in this area, and even stronger between the islands as the water is forced through a narrow opening. We had no problem with ships, even with many heading to Tokyo. Our speed made it easy to work our way out of the main shipping channel. We are flying! Pino is happy to be moving again, and as are we.</td>

For lunch, we had inari pouches, a meal we'd purchased at MaxValue the night before. It's nice not having to cook on the first day. Neither of us are sea sick, but going below is still difficult and can easily trigger it. We stay outside instead, enjoying the good wind, weather and sun. <p>Devine is reading "The mushrooom at the end of the world", while I steer us east. We tried calling Robusta on the VHF, but got no answer, either they're too far or their radio isn't on.</p></td>

We had a grapefruit for desert, and made a mess on deck trying to pry it apart. The deck had red on it for a while afterwards.</p></td>

Robusta was at 33 degrees, upon exiting Shimoda they took a more southerly route, I wish we'd done the same. We underestimated the strength of this current.

We tried to find where it was, but found nothing. None of the thru-hulls are leaking. I also checked the hose connections, nada! I suspect it may be the rudder post that is leaking, but for now it is impossible to look as I'd have to get into the cockpit locker, which is full of water bins and other heavy gear. For now, we try and check the bilge often, pumping the water out by hand every 2h or so. We have two manual bilge pumps, one in the cockpit and another in the cabin under the sink. The automatic bilge pump doesn't empty the bilge entirely, as it sits on a little stand above the lowest point, but the manual pump tube touches the bottom and does a better job of sucking up the majority of the water. If anything, the automatic pump serves as an alarm.</p></td>

<p>This post is a draft, I published it by accident. Based on the positive feedback I’ll keep it up for now but know that you’re reading unfinished content :-), please check back later to see the finished product (spoiler: there are still many bytes to save)</p>
<hr>
<p>I was inspired by reading this blog <a href="https://briancallahan.net/blog/20200812.html">https://briancallahan.net/blog/20200812.html</a>
Where the author wants is building the smallest executable echo binary for an
x86_64 linux system. In the blog he gets to 848 bytes with programming in
assembly and to 840 bytes when compiling a C version of the program with Clang.
I really like optimizing code for size so I made myself this challenge to see
how much further this could be pushed! Since the original post already covered
C, lets start with a naive implementation of echo in my favorite compiled
language, <a href="https://ziglang.org/">Zig</a>!</p>

</span></code></pre></div><p>build with: <code>zig build-exe echo.zig --release-small --single-threaded &amp;&amp; strip echo</code> this produces a binary thats 9568 bytes in size, that not bad and
certainly a lot smaller than the echo included with a linux distribution (though
we have a lot less options). But it’s certainly not as small as the 840 bytes
Brian managed to achieve with C in his blogpost. So where do we start saving?
The current program is quite naive, so naive infact that when you add <code>-target native-windows</code> to the Zig compile options it even works on windows! While
building crossplatfrom code is very neat, assuming a linux os can save us a lot
of bytes. So lets rewrite our code to be compatible with linux only.</p>

</span></code></pre></div><p>Now that we’ve thrown away a lot of code that was helping us make our program
cross platform we no longer need code for allocating arguments and we can use
linux syscalls directly. This brings the size down to just 1752 bytes, but that’s
still not anywhere near 840, so next up lets see whats actually in the binary!</p>
<p>running <code>readelf -s echo</code> reveals there are still several functions in included
in the binary, they are: <code>_start</code>, <code>std.start.posixCallMainAndExit</code>,
<code>std.os.abort</code>, <code>std.os.raise</code></p>
<p>Apart from our entrypoint <code>_start</code>, we don’t really need those other functions,
so lets ditch them! posixCallMainAndExit is Zig’s “main” function. Luckily it is
really easy to get rid of the main function in Zig and define your own entry
point:</p>

</span></code></pre></div><p>By looking at <a href="https://github.com/ziglang/zig/blob/master/lib/std/start.zig">Zig’s main
function</a> and only
taking the parts we actually need and building our own entrypoint we manged to
save almost an entire kilobyte. We finally beat Brian’s original C
implementation by 40(!) bytes. But why stop here? Let’s analyze the binary and
see if there is more to be saved! Running <code>readelf -S echo</code> reveals that there
some sections left, even after running the <code>strip</code> command, not all of which are
neccesary, like the <code>.comment</code> section. While you could carve out sections of an
elf file like so: <code>objcopy --remove-section .comment echo</code>. There is a very nice
command line utility from the
<a href="http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/elfkickers.html">ELFKickers</a>
collection called <code>sstrip</code> this amazing little tool can really strip out every
unneeded byte from an elf file, so lets try it! running <code>sstrip -z echo</code> instead
of <code>strip</code> on the echo binary from the previous code snippet results in a 425
bytes file. Wow! this tool almost cut the size of out binary in half! Without
affecting the functionallity of the program at all. Incredible. Unfortunatly
running the tools twice does not make the binary half in size again magically.
So lets take another look at our algorithm and see if we can do some more
optimizations in the code!</p>

to us when it allocated the program arguments for us for our echo program we
need to write a space after every argument except the last, then we need to
write a newline. Instead of storing a string with a space in the binary, loading
a pointer to it and doing a seperate syscall, we can store the space at place of
the null byte at the end of the string. It would save even more bytes if we
could do the same for the newline, unfortunatly the newline also needs to be
printed if there are no arguments supplied to the echo program.</p>

</span></code></pre></div><p>For this massive save we can thank intel and linux for 35 years of backwards
compatibility! I modified the program slightly so it could be compiled for the
intel i386 architecture. I then added <code>-target i386-native</code> to the Zig compile
flags and it produced a 32 bit elf. 32 bit elfs are a lot smaller simply due to
the wordsize being half as large as on a 64 bit platform. This saves a lot in
header space, and also in instruction size! Our echo binary doesn’t need 64 bit
words anyway. The only difference in functionality is that the stringlength of
one argument may not exceed 2<sup>32</sup>. Which is far larger than the linux
kernel allows anyways. I think it’s reasonable to say this is the farthest It
can be pushes with ordinary programming languages, if we want to make it smaller
we’ll have to start getting our hands dirty with assembly! So lets ask Zig
nicely to provide us with a starting point, and let’s see where we end up.</p>
<p>That’s it for now! In the next part we’ll leave Zig behind!</p>

  <article>
    <p>As <a href="https://wiki.xfce.org/releng/4.16/roadmap">scheduled</a> we have just released Xfce 4.16pre1 on August 27th (sorry for the long time to write a post about it) - the first development release leading up to Xfce 4.16. And it comes with a boatload of new features and improvements, so prepare yourselves.</p>

<h3 id="notable-changes">Notable Changes</h3>

<h4 id="general">General</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Dropping lots of code (Gtk2 support), improving maintainability</li>
  <li>
    <p>Adding new icons to all core components to extend Xfce’s visual identity (also: follow freedesktop.org rDNS icon naming standard)
<img src="https://andreldm.com/assets/img/xfce-4.16pre1/icons.png" alt="New icons"></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A revamped and improved “About Xfce” dialog that also holds general system details
<img src="https://andreldm.com/assets/img/xfce-4.16pre1/about.png" alt="About dialog"></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Switch to client-side decorations for settings dialogs
<img src="https://andreldm.com/assets/img/xfce-4.16pre1/csd.png" alt="CSD Settings"></p>

<img src="https://andreldm.com/assets/img/xfce-4.16pre1/scale.png" alt="Display dialog"></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Settings Manager: Improved search/filter</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="panel">Panel</h4>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>New Plugin: “Status Tray” - a merger between the systray and the statusnotifier plugin, will make life for users much easier and less confusing, now supports the panel’s global “icon size” setting
<img src="https://andreldm.com/assets/img/xfce-4.16pre1/status-tray.png" alt="Status tray plugin"></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Autohide animation: Makes “autohide” more easily understandable (in the sense of: where did my panel just go?)
<img src="https://andreldm.com/assets/img/xfce-4.16pre1/autohide.gif" alt="Autohide animation" width="640px"></p>
  </li>
  <li>Launchers now show desktop file actions on right-click (e.g. “Open a New Private Window” for Firefox)</li>
  <li>
    <p>The Window list now supports “launching a new instance” of an application in the right-click menu
<img src="https://andreldm.com/assets/img/xfce-4.16pre1/launch-new-instance.png" alt="Launch new instance" height="240px"></p>

<h3 id="where-can-you-get-it">Where can you get it?</h3>

<p>Besides manually compiling <a href="https://archive.xfce.org/xfce/4.16pre1/src/">tarballs</a>, it’s also possible to use <a href="https://github.com/schuellerf/xfce-test">xfce-test</a> (<code>ubuntu_20.04-xfce-4.16pre1</code> tag) to easily preview Xfce 4.16 without the risk of breaking your system.</p>

<p>Update: Arch Linux users more adventurous than usual can try <code>-devel</code> packages from AUR. Likewise, openSUSE users can install <a href="https://en.opensuse.org/Xfce_repositories">packages</a> built directly from git master. If you’re afraid to trash your system consider playing with a virtual machine first.</p>

<p>Please go ahead try this release if possible, we would be more happy to hear your impressions as well as get bug reports before the final release.</p>

<h3 id="whats-next">What’s next?</h3>

<p>We’re expecting to release Xfce 4.16pre2 at the end of this month and if necessary pre3 will be released in October. If everything goes as planned Xfce 4.16 should be released by November!</p>

<p>California’s latest wildfire season has brought about no dearth of apocalyptic photos, showcasing the orange world beyond residents’ doors. As California copes and fires spur evacuation orders in multiple west coast states, PG&amp;E Corp. and other major utility companies are investigating how AI might help. In particular, they are deploying drones and using computer vision to spot potential equipment issues to mitigate the risk of damaged gear starting fires. While AI and drones are not being used to manage or combat the current fires, the utilities say these technologies do help with the regular monitoring of their systems.</p>

<p>Overhyped AI studies risk not only misleading the public, but also actively harming people affected by the use of less-than-stellar AI systems. AI boasts the potential to revolutionize areas such as healthcare, but researchers have warned that there is an abundance of poor-quality research. Now, a new set of standards crafted by an international team of experts is being published in the BMJ, Nature Medicine, and Lancet Digital Health. The new standards provide a framework for designing, delivering, and reporting clinical trials in AI. Standardization for testing conditions and reporting, along with stringent criteria, will help ensure that AI systems are safe and effective for use in healthcare settings.</p>

<![CDATA[Go’s Major Versioning Sucks – From a Fanboy]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>I’m normally a fan of the rigidity within the Go toolchain. In fact, we use Go on the <a href="https://app.qvault.io/dashboard/courses">front and backend at Qvault</a>. It’s wonderful to have standardized formatting, vetting, and testing across the entire language. The first real criticism I’ve had is with the way Go modules handle major versions. It’s over-the-top opinionated and slows down development in a significant number of scenarios.</p>



<h2>Refresher on “Go Mod”</h2>



<p>Go modules, and the associated commands <code>go mod</code> and <code>go get</code> can be thought of as Go’s equivalents to NPM and Yarn. The Go toolchain provides a way to manage dependencies and lock the versions that a collection of code depends on.</p>



<p>One of the most common operations is to update a dependency in an existing module. For example:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash"># update all dependencies
go get -u ./...

# add missing and remove unused dependencies
go mod tidy

# save all dependency code in the project's "vendor" folder
go mod vendor</code></pre>



<h2>Semantic Versioning</h2>



<p>Go modules use git tags and semantic versioning to keep track of the versions of dependencies that are compatible with the module in question. Semantic versioning is a way to format version numbers and it looks like this: <code>v{MAJOR}.{MINOR}.{PATCH}</code>. For example, <code>v1.2.3</code>.</p>



<p>Each number is to be incremented according to the following standards:</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes,
MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner, and
PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes.</code></pre>



<h2>Package-Side Problems</h2>



<p>Go has decided that all versions beyond <code>v0</code> and <code>v1</code> are required to use the major version in the module path. There are two ways to accomplish this. </p>



<p><strong>The first and recommended way</strong> is laid out in an example on the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://blog.golang.org/v2-go-modules#TOC_4." target="_blank">Go Blog</a>:</p>



<blockquote><p>To start development on&nbsp;<code>v2</code>&nbsp;of&nbsp;<code>github.com/googleapis/gax-go</code>, we’ll create a new&nbsp;<code>v2/</code>&nbsp;directory and copy our package into it.</p></blockquote>



<p>In other words, for every major version, we are encouraged to maintain a new copy of the entire codebase. This is also the only way to do it if you want pre-modules users to be able to use your package.</p>



<p><strong>The second way</strong> is to just change the name of your module in <code>go.mod</code>. Fore example, <code>module github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-tinydate</code> would become <code>module github.com/lane-c-wagner/go-tinydate/v2</code>. Besides this not working for older versions of Go, I also find it problematic because it breaks (in my mind) one of the most useful things about module names – they reflect the file path.</p>



<h2>Package-Side Solutions</h2>



<p>Allow package maintainers to specify the major version simply by updating git tags, no module name changes required. There is no need for two sources of truth.</p>



<p>We can enforce safe updating by adding warnings or prompts to the <code>go get</code> CLI. We don’t have to add unnecessary time-consuming policies.</p>



<h2>Client-Side Problems</h2>



<p>When new versions of dependencies are released we have a simple command to get the newest stuff: <code>go get -u</code>. The problem is that this command has no way to automatically update to a new major version. It will only download new minor changes and patches. There isn’t even a console message to inform you that a new major version exists!</p>



<p>That said, the reason for not auto-updating is clear, and to be fair, well-founded:</p>



<blockquote><p>If an old package and a new package have the same import path, the new package must be backwards compatible with the old package.</p><cite><a href="https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import" rel="noopener">Import compatibility rule</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>In other words, we should only increment major versions when making breaking changes, and if breaking changes are made they can’t have the same import path. While this makes sense, I think a simple console warning would have been a better solution than forcing a cumbersome updating strategy on the community.</p>



<p><strong>Another problem </strong>on the client-side is that we don’t only need to update <code>go.mod</code>, but we actually need to <code>grep</code> through our codebase and change each import statement to point to the new major version:</p>



<blockquote><p>Users who wanted to use&nbsp;<code>v2</code>&nbsp;had to change their package imports and module requirements to&nbsp;<code>github.com/googleapis/gax-go/v2</code>.</p></blockquote>



<p>Instead of a few simple CLI commands to get the latest dependencies, we’re making changes to the code itself.</p>



<h3>A Caveat – Diamond Imports</h3>



<p>Using different paths for different major versions makes more sense in situations where we may require two different versions of the same package, you know, <a aria-label="diamond imports (opens in a new tab)" href="https://research.swtch.com/vgo-import#dependency_story" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">diamond imports</a> and all that. This is the exception, not the rule, and it seems strange to tap dance around a problem that doesn’t exist in most codebases.</p>



<h2>Client-Side Solution</h2>



<p><code>go get -u</code> should have an additional command line flag to update major versions, and should default to showing a warning that there is a newer major version you don’t have yet.</p>



<p><em>Default</em> import paths should not change between major versions. If a module requires various versions, those <em>extra</em> versions could be flagged by having a different path.</p>



<h2>Why This Sucks For Me</h2>



<p>It is often the case that I want to build a package that has domain-specific logic and will only be used only in services at the small company I work for. For example, we have a repo that holds the <code>struct{}</code> definitions for common entities used across our system.</p>



<p>Occasionally we need to make backward-incompatible changes to those struct definitions. If it were an open-source library we wouldn’t make changes so often, but because it’s internal and we are aware of all the dependencies, we change the names of exported fields <em>regularly</em>. We aren’t changing names because we chose bad ones to begin with, we are usually changing names because requirements from the business change rapidly in a startup. </p>



<p>This means major version changes are a fairly regular occurrence. Some say that we should just stay on <code>v0</code>, and that’s a reasonable solution. The problem is these ARE production packages that are being used by a wide number of services. We WANT to Semver.</p>



<p>Go makes updating major versions so cumbersome that in the majority of cases, we have opted to just increment minor versions when we should increment major versions. We want to follow the proper versioning scheme, we just don’t want to add the unnecessary steps to our dev process.</p>



<h2>Hey – I Get It</h2>



<p>I understand why these decisions were made – and I even think in a lot of cases they were great decisions. For any open-source or public facing module this makes great sense. The Go toolchain is enforcing strict rules that encourage good API design.</p>



<p>In their effort to make public APIs great, they made it unnecessarily hard to have good “local” package design.</p>



<p>There is an <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40323" rel="noopener">open issue on Github</a> that would make new major versions more discoverable from the CLI. Take a look at that if you are interested.</p>



<p>Go still has the best toolchain and ecosystem. NPM and PIP can suck it.</p>



<p>If you disagree, @ me on Twitter.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <div><article> <p>Performance tuning is one of those programming rituals that gets oddly addicting. Seems like humans have a fundamental impulse to make a graph plot in their desired direction. This can be seen in a wide assortment of fields. Day traders watch metrics focused on their net earnings, nutritionists keep their calorie counts logged, and programmers focusing on performance obsess over memory allocations.</p> <p>After spending sometime obessing myself I found myself making large allocation improvements with some tricks in the popular <a href="https://github.com/jackc/pgx">PGX</a> library.</p> <p>I'd like to shout out <em>Kale Blanekship</em> and <em>Eric Chlebek</em> from the performance channel in #gophers slack. They provided the clues used in this post.</p> <h2>The code</h2> <p>The code that's being profiled is a new distributed lock implementation for <a href="https://github.com/quay/claircore/">ClairCore</a>. Postgres is the only required infrastructure for ClairCore by design. While it's not the best mechanim for a distributed lock, <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.1/explicit-locking.html">postgres advisory locks</a> can be utilized to get <em>mostly</em> there.</p> <p>You can view the distlock implementation <a href="https://github.com/ldelossa/distlock">here</a></p> <h2>Reducing channel allocations</h2> <p>Our distlock implementation utilizes the request/response channel-of-channel pattern. A request object with a response channel is pushed onto a request channel. When the receiver gets the request it writes to the response channel, unblocking any client listening.</p> <p>This pattern is useful but will also alloc a lot of channels resulting in bloating the heap.</p> <p>To demonstrate this a benchmark will be taken that profiles lock acquisition and lock return.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> go <span>test</span> -benchtime <span>"1m"</span>  -run xxx -bench . -memprofile memprofile.out -cpuprofile cpuprofile.out</span>
</code></pre> <p>The command above runs a 1 minute benchmark profiling both memory and cpu.</p> <p>Next lets start an interactive pprof session over the memory profile and drill into the function where the channel allocations are occuring.</p> <pre><code><span>$</span><span> go tool pprof distlock.test memprofile.out</span>

</code></pre> <h2>A PGX Trick</h2> <p>Removing the cost of the response-request model was a good win but there is still more to tune.</p> <p>Lets generate a graph of our call stack and associated allocations.</p> <pre><code>❯ go tool pprof -svg distlock.test memprofile.out
</code></pre> <p><img alt="photo of high PGX allocations" src="https://www.ldelossa.is/profile001.png"></p> <p>The above diagram is showing a large amount of allocations in PGX's getRows method. Its not rare for methods dealing with serialization to and from the database to allocate heavily. But it would be nice if we could eliminate this.</p> <p>Getting a session pg advisory lock typically looks like this.</p> <pre><code>SELECT pg_try_advisory_lock($1);
SELECT pg_advisory_unlock($1);
</code></pre> <p>Both lock functions return a table expression resulting in a true or a false.</p> <p>An optimization we can make is changing these queries to only return a row if the lock function returns true. Our application logic can then simply check whether any rows are returned and not read the contents.</p> <p>First lets fix our queries.</p> <pre><code>SELECT lock FROM pg_try_advisory_lock($1) lock WHERE lock = true;
SELECT lock FROM pg_advisory_unlock($1) lock WHERE lock = true;
</code></pre> <p>A slight modification allows us to only return rows if the lock function returns true.</p> <p>The next step is to short circuit the PGX library from reading the rows. This took a bit of library spelunking but I eventually discovered this...</p> <pre><code>rr := m.conn.PgConn().ExecParams(ctx,
    trySessionUnlock,
    [][]<span>byte</span>{
        keyify(key),
    },

    []<span>int16</span>{<span>1</span>},
    <span>nil</span>)
tag, err := rr.Close()
<span>if</span> err != <span>nil</span> {
    <span>return</span> response{<span>false</span>, <span>nil</span>, err}
}
<span>if</span> tag.RowsAffected() == <span>0</span> {
    <span>return</span> response{<span>false</span>, <span>nil</span>, fmt.Errorf(<span>"unlock of key %s returned false"</span>, key)}
}
</code></pre> <p>By using the lower level PgConn object we can exec our queries, get a response writer, and immediately close it to obtain the command tag. The command tag tells us if any rows were affected by the exec. This effectively tells us whether the lock was obtained or not in a somewhat indirect way.</p> <p>Let's take a new 1 minute memory profile to see how this effects our heap.</p> <p><img alt="photo of high PGX allocations" src="https://www.ldelossa.is/profile002.png"></p> <p>Notice the large improvement achieved.</p> <p>We can also compare the benchmark output.</p> <pre><code>85149            890605 ns/op            1288 B/op         21 allocs/op

</code></pre> <p>By eliminating the reading of rows we perform many more cycles and cut our allocation in roughly half.</p> <h2>Disclaimer on optimization</h2> <p>Is it worth to dig this deep into your allocations? Depends. If you know the code you are writing will be in the "hot-path" its empowering to know what your allocation profile looks like. Learning the skills to performance tune is addicting and powerful but writing code that can be read and easily maintained should always be the first goal. That being said I do think every engineer should go down the rabbit hole at least once. Its a lot of fun.</p> </article></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          <p>Some Linux kernel versions had a bug in their ip fragmentation module which caused system crash during handling of a malformed ip fragment back in 1997.</p>

<h2>What's an Ip Fragment</h2>
<p>
The "Internet Protocol" allows packets larger than the maximum transmission unit to be sent as smaller fragments. If an internet packet is fragmented; it uses 
"More Fragments" flag to indicate further coming fragments, "Fragment Offset" field to indicate fragments position and "IP Identifier" field to group fragments.
</p>
<p>The procedure for handling this in Linux kernel 2.1 is fairly simple. When the ip stack encounters with a packet with "More Fragments" flag, it keeps the packet in a hashmap 
until all fragments are received. Later, the ip stack tries to order packets since packets can arrive without order. After ordering, fragments are glued by their offset into 
a single packet for the further steps.
</p>
<figure>
    <table><colgroup span="2" width="135"></colgroup> <colgroup width="29"></colgroup> <colgroup span="2" width="106"></colgroup> <colgroup width="29"></colgroup>
    <tbody>
    <tr>
    <td colspan="2">IP Fragment</td>
    <td colspan="4">IP Fragment</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
    <td colspan="2">0</td>
    <td>128</td>
    <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
    <td>256</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
    </table>
    <figcaption>A normal fragmented ip packet.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
An example fragmented ip packet ready to glue is seen on the figure. The first fragment starts at offset 0 and finishes at offset 128 which the following fragment starts at. If there were a space 
caused by a lost fragment, then the kernel would wait for packet around 30 seconds before discarding all related fragments. But assuming the second fragment has its "More Fragments" flag unset, 
this fragment is ready for gluing into a single packet.
</p>
<h2>Packet Overlapping</h2>
<p>
So now, we know what happens if we make a gap between fragments. But what if we reduce the offset of the second fragment so it overlaps with the first one? 
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc791#page-28">RFC791</a>, the Internet Protocol describes an example defragmentation algorithm that allows overlapping so a newer fragment can 
overwrite previous fragments which linux just skipped overwriting part. So nothing spectacular happens on linux.
</p>
<figure>
    <table><colgroup width="135"></colgroup> <colgroup span="2" width="67"></colgroup> <colgroup width="27"></colgroup>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td colspan="3">IP Fragment</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td><span>IP Fragment</span></td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>64</td>
        <td>96</td>
        <td>128</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        <td>len</td>
        <td>&nbsp;</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <figcaption>A packet inside another packet</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Problems start to arise when we <i>"set the fragment offset to be inside of the previous packet's payload (it overlaps inside the previous packet) but do not include 
enough payload to cover complete the datagram".</i><sup>[quoted from teardrop.c inline comments]</sup></p>
<h2>The Bug</h2>
<p>As you might start to guess, the linux kernel calculated the length of a fragment by substracting the end of the first fragment from end of the second fragment so it skips the overwriting 
previous fragment and writes only the non-overlapping part - what's new from a fragment. This length calculation led to calculation of negative sizes for the fragments that overlap but 
finish earlier than the previous fragment.
</p>
<figure>
<pre>kernel2.1.62:ip_fragment.c@114
/* Fill in the structure. */
fp-&gt;offset = offset;
fp-&gt;end = end;
fp-&gt;len = end - offset;</pre>
<figcaption>In this context; the "end" variable is the end of the second packet, "offset" is the end of the first packet.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Let the length be calculated as negative, the gluing part which uses the length requires an unsigned type which a small negative value represented as a very high number. What gluing does? Let's see:</p>

<figure>
<pre>kernel2.1.62:ip_fragment.c@339
/* Copy the data portions of all fragments into the new buffer. */
fp = qp-&gt;fragments;
while(fp) {
    if(count+fp-&gt;len &gt; skb-&gt;len) {
        NETDEBUG(printk(KERN_ERR "Invalid fragment list: "
                "Fragment over size.\n"));
        ip_free(qp);
        kfree_skb(skb,FREE_WRITE);
        ip_statistics.IpReasmFails++;
        return NULL;
    }
    memcpy((ptr + fp-&gt;offset), fp-&gt;ptr, fp-&gt;len);
    if (!count) {
        skb-&gt;dst = dst_clone(fp-&gt;skb-&gt;dst);
        skb-&gt;dev = fp-&gt;skb-&gt;dev;
    }
    count += fp-&gt;len;
    fp = fp-&gt;next;
}</pre>
<figcaption>The part in ip_glue function that actually glues fragments into a new buffer.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The <code>memcpy</code> part evaluates the len as a very big number and starts to write huge amounts of data into the offsetted address. A hotfix released for this in version 2.1.63, 
checking if the len variable is greater than zero before passing it to <code>memcpy</code>.</p>
<h3>The Fix</h3>
<figure>
<pre>kernel2.1.63:ip_fragment.c@340
	/* Copy the data portions of all fragments into the new buffer. */
	fp = qp-&gt;fragments;
	while(fp) {
		if (fp-&gt;len &lt; 0 || count+fp-&gt;len &gt; skb-&gt;len) {
</pre>
<figcaption>The hotfix dropped fragments with negative len.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h3>The Comeback</h3>
<p>The story doesn't end here. The hotfix checked for a negative value but what about a packet with a length 0? Almost two years later, in march 1999, the check for zero length packets added as following:</p>
<figure>
<pre>kernel2.2.6:ip_fragment.c@361
	/* Copy the data portions of all fragments into the new buffer. */
	fp = qp-&gt;fragments;
	count = qp-&gt;ihlen;
	while(fp) {
		if ((fp-&gt;len &lt;= 0) || ((count + fp-&gt;len) &gt; skb-&gt;len))
</pre>
<figcaption>It's now dropping negative and zero length fragments.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A set of similar ip fragmentation vulnerabilities including these ones called "Teardrop Attack" and was used for a while to crash computers and cause denial of service.</p>

<p>So you know when you’re flopping about at home, minding your own business, drinking from your water bottle in a way that does not possess <em>any</em> intent to subvert the Commonwealth of Australia?</p>

<p>It’s a feeling I know all too well, and in which I was vigorously partaking when I got this message in “the group chat”<sup id="fnref:groupchat" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:groupchat">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/groupchat.png" alt="Can you hack this man?|medium">
<em>A nice message from my friend, with a photo of a boarding pass 🙂 A good thing about messages from your friends is that they do not have any rippling consequences 🙂🙂🙂</em></p>

<p>The man in question is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Abbott">Tony Abbott</a>, one of Australia’s <em>many</em> former Prime Ministers.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/tony_abbott_wikipedia.png" alt="if u google tony abbott u get this|small">
<em>That’s him, officer</em></p>

<p>For security reasons, we try to change our Prime Minister every six months, and to never use the same Prime Minister on multiple websites.<sup id="fnref:kevin07" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:kevin07">2</a></sup></p>

<h4 id="the-boarding-pass-photo">The boarding pass photo</h4>
<p>This particular former PM had just posted a picture of his boarding pass on Instagram (Instagram, in case you don’t know it, is an app you can open up on your phone any time to look at ads).</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/instagrampost.PNG" alt="Instagram post showing boarding pass|large">
<em>The since-deleted Instagram post showing the boarding pass and baggage receipt. The caption reads “coming back home from japan 😍😍  looking forward to seeing everyone! climate change isn’t real 😌 ok byeee”</em></p>

<h4 id="can-you-hack-this-man">“Can you hack this man?”</h4>
<p>My friend<sup id="fnref:hoggemoade" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:hoggemoade">3</a></sup> (who we will refer to by their group chat name, 𝖍𝖔𝖌𝖌𝖊 𝖒𝖔𝖆𝖉𝖊) is asking<sup id="fnref:onbehalf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:onbehalf">4</a></sup> whether I can “hack this man” not because I am the kind of person who regularly commits 𝒄𝒚𝒃𝒆𝒓 𝒕𝒓𝒆𝒂𝒔𝒐𝒏 on a whim, but because we’d recently been talking about boarding passes.</p>

<p>I’d said that people post pictures of their boarding passes all the time, not knowing that it can sometimes be used to get their passport number and stuff. They just post it being like “omg going on holidayyyy 😍😍😍”, unaware that they’re posting cringe.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/instagramboardingpasses.png" alt="screenshot of #boardingpass on instagram|medium">
<em>People post their boarding passes all the time, because it’s not clear that they’re meant to be secret</em></p>

<p>Meanwhile, some hacker is rubbing their hands together, being all “yumyum identity fraud 👀” in their dark web Discord, because this happens a <em>lot</em>.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/boardingpassposts.png" alt="screenshot of #boardingpass on instagram"></p>

<hr>

<p>So there I was, making intense and meaningful eye contact with this chat bubble, asking me if I could “hack this man”.</p>

<h3 id="surely-you-wouldnt">Surely you wouldn’t</h3>
<p>Of course, my friend wasn’t <em>actually</em> asking me to hack the former Prime Minister.</p>



<p>However.</p>



<p>You <em>gotta</em>.</p>

<p>I mean… what are you gonna do, <em>not</em> click it? Are you gonna let a <em>link</em> that’s like 50% advertising tracking ID tell you what to do? Wouldn’t you be <em>curious</em>?</p>

<p>The former Prime Minister had just posted his boarding pass. Was that <em>bad</em>? Was someone in danger? I didn’t know.</p>

<p>What I did know was: the <em>least</em> I could do<sup id="fnref:nocrime" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:nocrime">5</a></sup> for my country would be to have a casual browse 👀</p>

<h2 id="investigating-the-boarding-pass-photo">Investigating the boarding pass photo</h2>
<h3 id="step-1-hubris">Step 1: Hubris</h3>

<p>So I had a bit of a casual browse, and got the picture of the boarding pass, and then…. I didn’t know what was supposed to happen after that.</p>

<p>Well, I’d heard that it’s bad to post your boarding pass online, because if you do, a bored 17 year-old Russian boy called “Katie-senpai” might somehow use it to commit identity fraud. But I don’t know anyone like that, so I just clumsily googled some stuff.</p>

<h4 id="googling-how-2-hakc-boarding-pass">Googling how 2 hakc boarding pass</h4>
<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/uhhboardingpasshacking.png" alt="uhhh|small"></p>

<p>Eventually I found <a href="https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/hackers-use-hidden-data-airline-boarding-passes-hack-flights-0180728/">a blog post</a> explaining that yes, pictures of boarding passes can indeed be used for Crimes. The part you wanna be looking at for all your criming needs is the barcode, because it’s got the “Booking Reference” (e.g. <code>H8JA2A</code>) in it.</p>

<p>Why do you want the booking reference? It’s one of the two things you need to log in to the airline website to manage your flight.</p>

<p>The second one is your… last name. I was really hoping the second one would be like a password or something. But, no, it’s the booking reference the airline emails you and prints on your boarding pass. And it also lets you log in to the airline website?</p>

<p>That sounds suspiciously like a password to me, but like I’m still fine to pretend it’s not if you are.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-scan-the-barcode">Step 2: Scan the barcode</h3>
<p>I’ve been practicing every morning at sunrise, but still can’t scan barcodes with my eyes. I had to settle for a barcode scanner app on my phone, but when I tried to scan the picture in the Instagram post, it didn’t work :((</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/boardingpass.png" alt="the boarding pass photo">
<em>Maybe I shouldn’t have blurred out the barcode first</em></p>

<h3 id="step-2-scan-the-barcode-but-more">Step 2: Scan the barcode, but more</h3>

<p>Well, maybe it wasn’t scanning because the picture was too blurry.</p>

<p>I spent around 15 minutes in an “enhance, ENHANCE” montage, fiddling around with the image, increasing the contrast, and so on. Despite the montage taking up way too much of the 22 minute episode, I couldn’t even get the barcode to scan<sup id="fnref:step3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:step3">6</a></sup>.</p>

<h3 id="step-2-notice-that-the-booking-reference-is-printed-right-there-on-the-paper">Step 2: Notice that the Booking Reference is printed right there on the paper</h3>

<p>After staring at this image for 15 minutes, I noticed the Booking Reference is just… printed on the baggage receipt.</p>

<p>I graduated university.</p>

<p>But it did not prepare me for this.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/bookingrefhighlighted.png" alt="Boarding pass with booking reference highlighted">
<em>askdjhaflajkshdflkh</em></p>

<h3 id="step-3-visit-the-airlines-website">Step 3: Visit the airline’s website</h3>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/bookinglogin2.png" alt="Manage booking login screen with empty fields-large"></p>

<p>After recovering from <em>that</em> emotional rollercoaster, I went to <a href="https://qantas.com.au/">qantas.com.au</a>, and clicked “Manage Booking”. In case you don’t know it because you live in a country with fast internet, Qantas is the main airline here in Australia.</p>

<p>(I also very conveniently started recording my screen, which is gonna pay off <em>big time</em> in just a moment.)</p>

<h3 id="step-4-type-in-the-booking-reference">Step 4: Type in the Booking Reference</h3>

<p>Well, the login form was just… <em>there</em>, and it was asking for a Booking Reference and a last name. I had just flawlessly read the Booking Reference from the boarding pass picture, and, well… I knew the last name<sup id="fnref:lastname" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:lastname">7</a></sup>.</p>

<p>I did hesitate for a split-second, but… no, I had to know.</p>

<h3 id="step-5-crimes">Step 5: Crimes(?)</h3>

<em>The “Manage Booking” page, logged in as some guy called Anthony Abbott</em></p>

<h3 id="can-i-get-a-yikes-in-the-chat">Can I get a YIKES in the chat</h3>

<p>Leave a comment if you really felt that.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/yikes.png" alt="yikes"></p>

<p>I guess I was now logged the heck in as Tony Abbott? And for all I know, everyone else who saw his Instagram post was right there with me. It’s kinda wholesome, to imagine us all there together. But also probably suboptimal in a governmental sense.</p>

<h5 id="was-there-anything-secret-in-here">Was there anything secret in here?</h5>

<p>I then just incredibly browsed the page, browsed it so hard.</p>

<p>I saw Tony Abbott’s name<sup id="fnref:name" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:name">8</a></sup>, flight times, and Frequent Flyer number, but not really anything <em>super</em> secret-looking. Not gonna be committing any cyber treason with a Frequent Flyer number. The flight was in the past, so I couldn’t change anything, either.</p>

<p>The page said the flight had been booked by a travel agent, so I guessed some information would be missing because of that.</p>

<p>I clicked around and scrolled a considerable length, but still didn’t find any government secrets.</p>

<p>Some people might give up here. But I, the Icarus of computers, was simply too dumb to know when to stop.</p>

<h3 id="were-not-done-just-because-a-web-page-says-were-done">We’re not done just because a <em>web page</em> says we’re done</h3>

<p>I wanted to see if there were juicy things hidden <em>inside</em> the page. To do it, I had to use the <em>only</em> hacker tool I know.</p>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/inspectelement.png" alt="Right click > Inspect-small">
<em>Right click &gt; Inspect Element, all you need to subvert the Commonwealth of Australia</em></p>

<p>Listen. This is the only part of the story that might be confused for highly elite computer skill. It’s not, though. Maybe later someone will show you this same thing to try and flex, acting like only <em>they</em> know how to do it. You will not go gently into that good night. You will refuse to acknowledge their flex, killing them instantly.</p>

<h5 id="how-does-inspect-element-work">How does “Inspect Element” work?</h5>
<p>“Inspect Element”, as it’s called, is a feature of Google Chrome that lets you see the computer’s internal representation (HTML) of the page you’re looking at. Kinda like opening up a clock and looking at the cool cog party inside.</p>

<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/67/Pocketwatch_cutaway_drawing.jpg" alt="cog party|small">
<em>Yeahhh go little cogs, look at ‘em absolutely going off. Now imagine this but with like, JavaScript</em></p>

<p>Everything you see when you use “Inspect Element” was already downloaded to your computer, you just hadn’t asked Chrome to show it to you yet. Just like how the cogs were already in the watch, you just hadn’t opened it up to look.</p>

<p>But let us dispense with frivolous cog talk. Cheap tricks such as “Inspect Element” are used by programmers to try and understand how the website works. This is ultimately futile: Nobody can understand how websites work. Unfortunately, it kinda <em>looks</em> like hacking the first time you see it.</p>

<p>If you’d like to know more about it, I’ve prepared a short video.</p>

<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">hey youtube welcome to my hacking tutorial, today we're gonna hack.... the nsa <a href="https://t.co/2Z35GJjSZE">pic.twitter.com/2Z35GJjSZE</a></p>— “Alex” (@mangopdf) <a href="https://twitter.com/mangopdf/status/1123400764926226432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 1, 2019</a></blockquote>


<h3 id="browsing-the-manage-booking-pages-html">Browsing the “Manage Booking” page’s HTML</h3>

<p>I scrolled around the page’s HTML, not really knowing what it meant, furiously trying to find anything that looked out of place or secret.</p>

<p>I eventually realised that manually reading HTML with my eyes was not an efficient way of defending my country, and Ctrl + F’d the HTML for “passport”.</p>

<h3 id="oh-no">oh no</h3>

<p><img src="https://mango.pdf.zone/img/sunburnt-country/passportjson.gif" alt="Blurred screenshot of close up &quot;passport&quot; number"></p>

<h3 id="oh-yes">Oh yes</h3>

<p>It’s just <em>there</em>.</p>

<p>At this point I was fairly sure I was looking at the <em>extremely</em> secret government-issued ID of the <em>28th Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia, servant to her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II</em> and I was <em>kinda</em> worried that I was somehow doing something wrong, but like, not enough to stop.</p>

<h3 id="anything-else-in-this-page">….anything <em>else</em> in this page?</h3>

<p>Well damn, if Tony Abbott’s passport number is in this treasure trove of computer spaghetti, maybe there’s wayyyyy more. Perhaps this HTML contains the lost launch codes to the Sydney Opera House, or Harold Holt<sup id="fnref:holt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:holt">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Maybe there’s a phone number?</p>

<p>Searching for <code>phone</code> and <code>number</code> didn’t get anywhere, so I searched for <code>614</code>, the first 3 digits of an Australian phone number, using my colossal and highly celestial galaxy brain.</p>

<h5 id="weird-uppercase-letters">Weird uppercase letters</h5>
<p>A weird pile of what I could only describe as extremely uppercase letters came up. It looked like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>RQST QF HK1 HNDSYD/03EN|FQTV QF HK1|CTCM QF HK1 614[phone number]|CKIN QF HN1 DO NOT SEAT ROW [row number] PLS SEAT LAST ROW OF [row letter] WINDOW
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>So, there’s a lot going on here. There is indeed a phone number in here. But what the heck is all this <em>other</em> stuff?</p>

<p>I realised this was like… Qantas staff talking to eachother <em>about</em> Tony Abbott, but not <em>to</em> him?</p>

<p>In what is surely the subtweeting of the century, it has a …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

        <blockquote><p>You sometimes can identify markers for an imminent project meltdown. But you have to pay attention to the red flags. Here’s what to look for.</p></blockquote>
<p>I should have recognized the signs earlier. Everyone else in our startup software company was busy at work, aware that we needed to finish our software to acquire the venture capital we needed. Yet, Sandra began bringing the newspaper to work, and reading the entire thing, while the people around her wrote code, worked on the business plan, or tried to make sense of our accounting. Although it was inevitable that she’d leave – and perhaps the team implosion was also a foregone conclusion – I somehow refused to deal with the early indications.</p>
<p>Not every software development crisis has an early warning system, but plenty of them do. If you learn to recognize the signs early enough – and you’re willing to confront the problem, as I was not – you may be able to prevent the project from failing. If you can’t prevent the meltdown, perhaps you can save yourself.</p>
<h3>Meetings of the minds</h3>
<p>When you first join a team, or when you begin to have a bad feeling that you can’t quite name, pay attention to the way people behave during team meetings. I don’t mean necessarily that you should rush to get your résumé in order, if people get upset with one another. But do watch for signs that the proceedings don’t matter to the participants.</p>
<p>A quality engineer at a midrange German bank attended his first meeting on a new project. People arrived and left at will, without saying a word. Nobody kept minutes, he told me. “We usually don’t need that,” project participants told him. At that point, says the engineer, “I knew that the level of discipline in this project was far too low to produce anything valuable. This proved to be true within a year.”</p>
<p>Are developers writing code instead of paying attention to what the users are asking? Do people regularly check their e-mail? It’s time to wonder about their commitment.</p>
<p>Meetings also show stress among the people who are supposed to be working together, especially when meetings don’t happen. In one project, where formerly independent teams were expected to merge, “They saw themselves as competing with one another,” reports Solomon, a programmer at a large financial firm. “When we did the requirements interviews, the users (and their managers) were looking to ‘protect’ the ‘way we’ve always done business.'” Some managers planned to limit the influence of other groups; political battles were fought over the design. “There was no process for surfacing these issues (many of them valid business issues) and having management make a decision,” Solomon says.</p>
<p>In fact, the number of meetings you attend is a sign on its own. If you have to gather a committee for a two-hour roundtable for every decision – because nobody can accept one person making the call – bump that project to the bottom of your priority list. Particularly so if meetings have more than five people, or when managers outnumber workers. Each such meeting moves the project doomsday clock closer to boom.</p>
<p>Another red flag is procrastination about timely updates for stakeholders. For example: A decision is required but not yet made. A milestone is not reached due to delays but someone doesn’t want to disclose that stumble. “Those may not kill or put a project in ‘zombie,’ status,” says one programmer, “But if the communication has broken down it’s a good indicator of heading that way.”</p>
<h3>Expectations out of whack</h3>
<p>I’ve heard dozens of stories from developers and tester about the signs that a project is headed downhill. By far, the most common source of problems is inaccurate or poorly-communicated project expectations – and an inappropriate reaction from management when things go awry.</p>
<p>“Why haven’t we done [this task]?”</p>
<p>“Oh, [task] is easy; we can do that any time.”</p>
<p>For example, one tester once was on a project that was completely oversold. The project team spent long weeks on the project. They even pulled all-nighters. But <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/estimating-testing-time-a-few-useful-guidelines/">the scope was too large for the timeframe and the staffing</a>. “The pressure on the company to produce a customer (and on the executive team) was such that the team was nearly run into the ground.”</p>
<p>This tester was lucky. After a wholesale change in upper management, a VP was sent to fire everyone in sight, after being told that the problems were the team’s fault. But this executive was astute enough to listen. The VP realized the problem wasn’t the staff, but the sales person and upper management who had sold the project. “He was able to slightly reset expectations with the customer, and we managed to put the project into production, producing a reference in the process.” Whew. One happy ending.</p>
<p>Others aren’t so fortunate. Don, a software consultant, found that “the surest single measure of increased likelihood of project failure is a management or owners who believe the task being performed is of one or more orders of magnitude less complexity than it actually is. This is usually reflected in poor or inept staffing… and other resource and planning shortfalls.”</p>
<h3>The C-suite gets involved</h3>
<p>If there’s no <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-to-do-a-product-evaluation-for-enterprise-software/">project champion</a>, by whatever job title, you should worry. Project sponsors need clout; the people above them have to respect them. Otherwise, while projects can be completed, they’re rarely transformational. However, the project champion also captures and communicates the team’s vision.</p>
<p>The sad alternative is when you see a big upswing in manager and upper-level manager check-ins. There’s a sudden surge in, “Is there anything we can do to help?” questions that would have been useful two months earlier.</p>
<p>Or personnel appear who aren’t integrated into the team. They don’t seem to have clear roles. For instance, a director from another department shows up, demanding to know why they weren’t consulted on the project, even though their superior had approved the process or task.</p>
<p>Another sign: Your project scope changes like the weather, for reasons you cannot fathom, and you have no ability to push back. As one techie described a too-familiar scenario: “The smoke of your burning deadlines will outline vast and terrible corporate gods who do not wish you well.”</p>
<h3>Project plan? What project plan?</h3>
<p>Often, those inaccurate expectations are a sign of earlier errors in analysis. A sure sign of failure is when time pressure exceeds normal limits – by far. “All of a sudden, you have loads of work to do, in ever-decreasing time intervals,” says a consultant who works in financial organizations. “This clearly shows that some points during the analysis and/or design phase was done horribly wrong.”</p>
<p>A related sign: The software is being built in parts, and nobody has integrated the parts yet. Especially if it’s because they don’t like to collaborate with the other authors.</p>
<p>There are <em>so</em> many variations.</p>
<ul>
<li>The project manager never presents a timeline, schedule, or milestone list.</li>
<li>A deadline for an important task is postponed more than two times.</li>
<li>Your weekly update call includes a lot of awkward silences. Or the definition of “done” drifts into science fiction.</li>
<li>You hear, “Are you sure this will take that long?”</li>
<li>Or they say, “Let’s use the occasion to also do &lt;big thing that’s completely unrelated&gt; while we have leverage.”</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t have to wait long for over-complicated expectations to emerge. Solomon adds, “When the chief architect explained the project, I started to count the tiers, and arrived at seven. A seven-tier architecture would contain so many chances to fail that I was immediately sure that the product would never see the customers. I was right. Twenty-three million Euros for nothing.”</p>
<h3>The attack of the killer accountants</h3>
<p>Your first clue: The snack closet doesn’t get refilled.</p>
<p>The more elaborate version: A random bean counter yells for the fainting couch when you submit a project expense line item has been utterly unremarkable during your entire tenure. Long-standing vendor contracts are scrutinized. Suddenly you need signoff from busybodies who have to render judgment on a critical spending component of your plan which nonetheless represents &lt;1% of the budgeted outlay.</p>
<p>The cost cutting isn’t logical. They don’t lay off an engineering team, which might be a hard-headed business decision. But they cancel required services, such as the organization’s Trello subscription.</p>
<h3>Inappropriate staffing</h3>
<p>Instead of dealing with the underlying problem – the team or the company can’t deliver what they’d promised – one way that poor management deals with the impending crisis is to hire or fire people. Unfortunately, <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/whats-the-difference-between-a-good-qa-director-and-a-great-one/">they often pick the wrong ones</a>. For example, in one project, Management felt the project was underfunded for the goals it was trying to reach.&nbsp;They couldn’t hire enough people with the right skills (that was too expensive) and caused the project to be slow to deliver.</p>
<p>When you can’t hire as many people as you need, you attempt to get more from the existing staff. In some cases, management threatens to lay people off if they don’t work harder. In one tester’s <a href="https://www.oreilly.com/content/3-reasons-to-stop-hating-one-on-one-meetings/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one-on-one session meeting</a>, the manager pointed out that the tester wasn’t at work in the evening. The tester told him he currently worked 50 hour weeks, and the company only paid for 37.5 hour weeks. The manager responded, “If you are not working 60 hour weeks, you are not working hard.” Ten minutes later, he added, “If you are not working hard, you are the list of people to be laid off.” The tester took the boss at his word. “I’m not sure if that project ever shipped. I quit and found a new job.”</p>
<p>How long do you wait before you recognize there’s a crisis? David’s ready to throw in the towel. He’s in a group that handles a couple dozen products, but David is the only developer, tester, and now manager. “I know the situation is bad. My company decided to fix the problem with people leaving or being laid off by building from the top. My program manager left, so naturally they replace him with a VP of Sales.” Two months …</p></div></div>

We <a href="https://www.descript.com/overdub?lyrebird=true">can</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwYiDraKtSA&amp;feature=emb_logo">already</a> <a href="https://clyp.it/2pb4bp05">recreate</a> <a href="https://clyp.it/2pb4bp05">any</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/gwern/status/1086010478135050240">voice</a>. GPT-3 can already write&nbsp;<a href="https://arr.am/2020/08/11/ai-fan-fiction-or-barry-by-terry-pratchett-gpt-3/">dialogue</a> and movie plots almost indistinguishable from ones written by humans. Even <a href="https://openai.com/blog/jukebox/">generated music</a> is making fast progress.</p>
<p>It’s only a matter of time until we’re generating entire movies and shows. It’s startling to realize that Hollywood movies that cost $300M to produce today might be generated for a few cents within our lifetimes.</p>
<p>When the cost of something drops by a factor of a billion we should expect to see qualitatively different uses. It’d be a different medium. Not only would there be <a href="https://twitter.com/karpathy/status/714670494952370176">endless content</a>; there’d be endless content for any specific movie or TV show you could want. Generally speaking, AI will do for production what the internet did for distribution.</p>
<p>One of the amazing things about AI is how you can work at a high level of abstraction. Imagine adjusting sliders on your favorite movie to make it more gritty or funny. Or asking the AI to show you what Starwars would look like as directed by Christopher Nolan.<sup>1</sup> The same way you can use GPT-3 to write a <a href="https://arr.am/2020/07/09/gpt-3-an-ai-thats-eerily-good-at-writing-almost-anything/">Taylor Swift song about Harry Potter</a>, you could make a new Harry Potter movie starring Taylor Swift.</p>
<p>Language models already create new kinds of interactivity. One of the surprisingly fun things I’ve done with GPT-3 is to insert out of character behavior in the middle of a scene and&nbsp;watch the characters try to make sense of what happened.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">When you insert out of character behavior and GPT just has to go with it. &nbsp;😆 <a href="https://t.co/OrYpympLXX">pic.twitter.com/OrYpympLXX</a></p>
<p>— Arram Sabeti (@arram) <a href="https://twitter.com/arram/status/1290687692091645956?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 4, 2020</a></p></blockquote>


<p>Imagine a video form of this with your favorite characters.</p>
<p>Once we can generate high definition video and audio in real-time, these generative movies will become a different medium again – one you can inhabit.</p>
<p>There are <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayPqjPekn7g">already</a> <a href="https://www.latentspace.co/">companies</a> working on replacing 3D game engines like Unity with neural nets. In the limit, movies and games could merge into a single medium we might call Generative Reality.<sup>2</sup></p>
<p>I don’t mean to say people will stop consuming passive entertainment. Just that the same software will create both, and that at any time you’ll not only be able to change anything about what you’re watching but also insert yourself into the story.</p>
<p>What we’ll probably see first are virtual people that are indistinguishable from real people – at least for short conversations. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/virtualbeings/permalink/967815567016992/">The</a> <a href="https://www.synthesia.io/">technology</a> is <a href="https://twitter.com/lishali88/status/1285014740029276162?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1285014740029276162%7Ctwgr%5Eshare_3&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwordpress.com%2Fpost%2Farr.am%2F533">almost</a> there, and for some people, it <em>is</em> there. People are getting <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/replika-my-ai-friend/id1158555867#see-all/reviews">real emotional support</a> from chatbots, and they’ll be a lot more appealing when talking to them is indistinguishable from doing a video call with a friend (or with Abraham Lincoln or Professor Dumbledore). GPT-3 is already good at <a href="https://arr.am/2020/08/17/ai-tim-ferriss-interviews-ai-marcus-aurelius-gpt-3/">impersonating</a> <a href="https://aiwriter.app/sample/fac0734f03f5c2e388">people</a>. I expect licensing fictional and celebrity chatbots like Tony Stark or Lady Gaga will be a big business.<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>Before we get AI that can autonomously generate a full movie we’ll have increasingly powerful tools where humans guide the AI by selecting and combining the best outputs. This is the stage we’re at now with GPT-3. It’s generally coherent for only a paragraph or two, but if you have a human generating multiple paragraphs and picking the best one you can end up with <a href="https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1288554880144031744">surprisingly good results</a>.</p>
<p>Ira Glass <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2wLP0izeJE&amp;t=69s">talks about</a> how when you get started as a maker, your taste exceeds your grasp because you lack technical proficiency. As AI tools become more powerful the technical skill required will decrease until good taste is all you need to make great art. Eventually though AI will create content that won’t be improved by human intervention.<sup>4</sup></p>
<p>What timeline should we expect? The first tools for making generative movies (as well as real-time virtual people) seem only a matter of improvements on existing technology and putting them all together in a useable way.</p>
<p>One researcher I talked to told me I was underselling the whole thing and that fully generative movies could be here in under five years. That seems very fast to me, but what’s clear is that this is all closer than most people realize. Progress in AI has been <a href="https://twitter.com/goodfellow_ian/status/1084973596236144640?lang=en">frighteningly rapid</a> in the last five years. When I first started sharing samples of text generated by GPT-3 the main reaction I got was disbelief. Most <a href="https://twitter.com/wolfgang_xl/status/1290452261425029126">people</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/BruceHoult/status/1290482776622342145">thought</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/aPosteriorChain/status/1284164529048309762">it</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/erroraptor/status/1289592150527635458">was</a> a <a href="https://twitter.com/arram/status/1281995747924180992">hoax</a> and that there was no way an AI could have written that.</p>
<p>Combine photorealism with convincing virtual people and endless personalized stories and worlds to explore and it’s hard to imagine a more entertaining form of entertainment. We’d have the kind of simulated reality that philosophers have long built <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/table/the-experience-machine">thought experiments</a> around.<sup>5</sup></p>
<p>This will be addictive. <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/Movies/01/11/avatar.movie.blues/">Thousands of people were depressed after watching Avatar</a> because their real lives weren’t as appealing. It’s simultaneously exciting and worrying to imagine what would happen if people could live inside the movie.</p>
<p>It’ll be especially addictive if we use AI to discover what we want. By <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137">watching us interact with content</a>, it could learn what we want better than we understand it ourselves.</p>
<p>I hesitate to predict this is the end of civilization since that sort of prediction is <a href="https://pessimists.co/">famously</a> usually wrong, but it’s worrying to imagine alternate realities so compelling that people no longer engage with the real one.<sup>6</sup> Most animals, including humans, are susceptible to <a href="https://www.sparringmind.com/supernormal-stimuli/">superstimulus</a>. When Google tried using AI to develop the best chocolate chip cookie recipe, the solution it converged on was to make the cookie out of solid chocolate.</p>
<p>What I’m describing isn’t just a single superstimulus, but an <a href="http://consc.net/papers/virtual.pdf">entire reality</a> made of superstimuli. What will reality look like when it’s made out of solid chocolate? We might find out.</p>
<p><em>Thanks to Ben Mann, Amanda Askell, Nick Cammarata, Emmett Shear, and Ian Thompson for reading drafts of this essay.</em></p>
<p><strong>Notes</strong></p>
<p>1. I expect one of the most popular uses will be people creating more content from fandoms people already love. There are 800,000 Harry Potter stories on fanfiction.net.</p>
<p>2. Game engines today have a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/aaronzlewis/status/1291889682788253696">practical uses</a> beyond games which would also be impacted by Generative Reality.</p>
<p>3. You could argue that the need for canned NPC dialogue is one of the biggest things holding games back as an art form compared to books or movies. GPT-3 obviates it.</p>
<p>4. Generative Reality is trivially possible if we create superintelligence, but the thing I want to point at here is that even without superintelligence it appears to be not only possible but not very far away. (For what it’s worth, I also suspect that Artificial General Intelligence isn’t much further off than Generative Reality.)</p>
<p>5. Like all guesses at the future, this essay looks at a handful of trends and ignores all the others. While Generative Reality seems possible, a few of the basic assumptions it holds are that humans will continue to exist and that they’ll remain relatively unchanged.</p>
<p>6. We’d still be missing important technologies for fully immersive virtual reality, such as haptics, but once VR becomes very popular there will be a tremendous economic incentive to improve it.</p>

<p>RFID tags have been on my radar for home automation since <a href="https://github.com/hoveeman" rel="external nofollow">@hoveeman</a> published <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AvCseOQidSw" rel="external nofollow">this video</a> two years ago of him using RFID cards to play music in his house.</p>
<p>It has been <a href="https://twitter.com/balloob/status/1256728762680393728?s=12" rel="external nofollow">my dream</a> ever since to get this easily accessible to every Home Assistant user. It already got a lot more accessible when <a href="https://github.com/maddox" rel="external nofollow">@maddox</a> released <a href="https://github.com/maddox/magic-cards" rel="external nofollow">Magic Cards</a>. But this was still a separate application that you had to run besides Home Assistant, and it required a separate RFID reader.</p>
<p>Can we do better? Yes, we can. Today we are introducing <b>Home Assistant Tags</b>. A collaboration between our iOS, Android, frontend, core and hardware groups. With Home Assistant Tags, we’re making scannable tags (NFC/RFID) a first-class citizen in Home Assistant. Easy to read, write and automate!</p>
<h2>
<a name="the-apps" href="#the-apps"></a> The Apps</h2>
<p>The official Home Assistant apps have been updated with NFC support. This dramatically lowers the bar for starting to automate your house with NFC tags. All you need now is tags!</p>
<p>From the apps you can now write a special Home Assistant URL to tags. Once you hover over one of these tags with your phone, they will trigger the Home Assistant app and send the identifier to your Home Assistant instance for processing. Tags are not bound to the phone that wrote them, any phone can scan them.</p>
<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/david-development" rel="external nofollow">@David-Development</a> for the NFC support in the Android app and thanks to <a href="https://github.com/zacwest" rel="external nofollow">@zacwest</a> for the NFC support in the iOS app.</p>

<p>
Only iPhone XS, XR and iPhone 11 or later support background NFC tag reading.
</p>
<h2>
<a name="standalone-tag-reader" href="#standalone-tag-reader"></a> Standalone Tag Reader</h2>
<p>Having mobile tag readers is great, but there is more! The original RFID jukebox that peaked my interest worked with a dedicated RFID reader. This RFID reader was connected to a Raspberry Pi that was running a script to read the tags and send them to Home Assistant.</p>

<p>These solutions work great but were bulky and required hardware skills and technical skills to set up. The hardware cost for building a single reader could be around $30 (RFID reader + Raspberry Pi 0), but that’s just for 1 room. What if you want more rooms? That adds up quickly.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/adonno" rel="external nofollow">@adonno</a>, with the help of <a href="https://github.com/magnusoverli" rel="external nofollow">@MagnusO</a>, has been working on a smaller tag reader based on <a href="https://www.esphome.io/" rel="external nofollow">ESPHome</a>. It’s powered by an ESP8266 chip and a PN532 NFC module. The case is 3D printed.</p>
<p>Because it’s powered by ESPHome, setting up is a breeze. Once powered on, it will create an access point that allows you to add your WiFi configuration. After that Home Assistant will pick it up and you can start scanning tags.</p>

<p>The nice thing about standalone tag readers is that they are dedicated to a room. This means automations know in which room to act when a music card is scanned and can pick the right media player. This makes it easy to have cards that can work in every room.</p>
<p>The tag reader is open-source and <a href="https://github.com/adonno/tagreader" rel="external nofollow">available on GitHub</a>. You can make one yourself or buy one of the pre-built ones or DIY kits that Adonno is <a href="https://adonno-crafts.myshopify.com/" rel="external nofollow">selling</a>.</p>

September 15, 2020 | https://raelize.com/posts/espressif-systems-esp32-bypassing-flash-encryption/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://raelize.com/posts/espressif-systems-esp32-bypassing-flash-encryption/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>In our <a href="https://raelize.com/espressif-systems-esp32-controlling-pc-during-sb/">previous post</a> we described an attack where we load an arbitrary value indirectly into the PC register using <strong>EMFI</strong>. During that attack we achieved our initial goal where we wanted to last year's research, where we turn <strong>Data Transfers</strong> into <strong>Code Execution</strong>, into practice.</p>
<p>As we already pointed out, the <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> feature of the <strong>ESP32</strong> chip, which <strong>Espressif</strong> advises to use, significantly increases the complexity for bypassing <strong>Secure Boot</strong>. The typical approach of making modifications to the plain-text code or data stored in external flash is not possible any more once <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> is enabled.</p>
<p>In this post we describe an attack where we leverage the (hardware) vulnerability described in our <a href="https://raelize.com/espressif-systems-esp32-controlling-pc-during-sb/">previous post</a> in combination with another vulnerability (i.e. <a href="https://www.espressif.com/sites/default/files/advisory_downloads/Security%20Advisory%20CVE-2020-15048%2C%2013629%20EN%26CN.pdf" target="_blank">CVE-2020-15048</a>) in order to load an arbitrary value into the PC register.</p>

<p>The <strong>ESP32</strong> supports <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/release-v3.2/security/flash-encryption.html" target="_blank">Flash Encryption</a> which is used to assure the confidentiality of the code and data stored in external flash. Interestingly, decryption of the data is done transparently to the processor by the flash controller. It uses a tweaked <strong>AES-256</strong> hardware implementation to assure the plain-text data cannot be obtained from the cipher-text without knowledge of the decryption key.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-flash-encryption.png">
        <img src="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-flash-encryption.png" width="700px">
    </a>
</p>
<p>The <strong>decryption key</strong> is stored in <strong>OTP-memory</strong> and cannot be access directly from software. This secure key storage was found to be vulnerable to a <strong>Fault Injection</strong> attack for which the results are <a href="https://limitedresults.com/2019/11/pwn-the-esp32-forever-flash-encryption-and-sec-boot-keys-extraction/" target="_blank">published</a>. Our attack is not related to this research.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the <strong>decryption key</strong> is actually not used as-is. It is actually used to generate unique keys for each 32-byte block in the external flash. This is likely done to mitigate several of the issues applicable when the standard <strong>AES-256</strong> algorithm is used. These issues are mostly related to the <strong>cipher mode</strong> that is used as the underlying cryptographic algorithm is sufficiently secure. For example, when <strong>ECB</strong> mode is used it's possible to swap blocks and when <strong>CBC</strong> mode is used it's possible to flip bits.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, as the <strong>unique keys</strong> are only generated for each 32-byte block, and the block-size of the underlying cryptographic algorithm is 16 bytes, adjacent blocks are still encrypted with the same key. This is exactly what we leverage, in combination with several design and implementation issues, to bypass <strong>Secure Boot</strong> using a very similar attack as described in our <a href="https://raelize.com/espressif-systems-esp32-controlling-pc-during-sb/">previous post</a>.</p>

<h4 id="flash-communication">Flash communication</h4>
<p>The chip's communication with the external flash, shown in the picture below, already indicated to us that there were more stages loaded during boot than just the <strong>bootloader</strong>.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-spi-pin1-during-boot.png">
        <img src="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-spi-pin1-during-boot.png" width="600px">
    </a>
</p>
<p>We observe several patterns during which different parts of the external flash are copied from external flash to internal memory. Without further investigation we do not exactly know what the parts are.</p>
<h4 id="rom-printing">ROM printing</h4>
<p>Conveniently, the <strong>ROM</strong> prints during its execution, on the serial interface, information about these parts. This printing cannot be disabled as far as we know and is therefore always available. This information allows us to know, without analyzing the flash communication itself, exactly when what is copied.</p>
<p>We concluded the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>+ load:0x3fff0008,len:4         &lt;-- C
</span><span>+ load:0x3fff000c,len:3220      &lt;-- D
</span><span>+ load:0x40078000,len:4816      &lt;-- E
</span><span>+ load:0x40080400,len:18640     &lt;-- F
</span><span>+ entry 0x40080740
</span></code></pre></div><p>The <strong>ROM</strong> extracts the <strong>load address</strong> and <strong>length</strong> for each part from the external flash itself. This information is stored in so-called headers which is stored at the beginning of each part. For example, the header for part '<strong>C</strong>' is shown below. The last two 4-byte words are the <strong>load</strong> and <strong>len</strong> in the above snippet.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="plain">00001010    00 00 00 00 00 00 00 01 08 00 FF 3F 04 00 00 00
</code></pre></div><p>It's important to realize that this information is printed before any signature is verified. For example, the <strong>ROM</strong> will print the following if these values are set to <code>0x41414141</code>, even though it will result in a chip that does not boot as these values are invalid. Note, <code>1094795585</code> is <code>0x41414141</code> in decimal.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff">load:0x41414141,len:1094795585
</code></pre></div><h4 id="encryption">Encryption</h4>
<p>Unfortunately, all data is encrypted once <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> is enabled, including these headers. This means we cannot simply set the values contained in the header to arbitrary values as they will be decrypted into garbage as we do this research under the assumption that we do not have access to the decryption key.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Espressif's SDK stores the different parts of the flash image next to each other. This is shown in the picture below.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff">...
<span>+ 00002F70    20 00 A8 08 92 AB FF 90 9A 10 C0 20 00 99 08 C0
</span><span>+ 00002F80    20 00 A8 08 91 CE FB 90 5C 7A 00 40 00 99 08 8C
</span><span></span><span>- 00002F90    12 65 ED FF 1D F0 00 00 00 04 08 40 D0 48 00 00
</span><span>- 00002FA0    28 00 FF 3F 00 00 00 04 44 00 FF 3F 54 7D 00 40
</span><span></span>...
</code></pre></div><p>The <span>green</span> data is loaded during part '<strong>E</strong>' and the <span>red</span> data is loaded during part '<strong>F</strong>'. The last 16-byte block of part '<strong>E</strong>' is encrypted with the same key as the first 16-byte block of part '<strong>F</strong>'.</p>
<p>Interestingly, because last block of part '<strong>E</strong>' and the first block of part '<strong>F</strong>' are encrypted with the same key, we can leak the last two 4-byte words of part '<strong>E</strong>'. This works as the first block of part '<strong>F</strong>' is actually the header that contains the information that is printed on the serial interface prior to the <strong>Secure Boot</strong> check.</p>
<p>For example, if we overwrite the last block of part '<strong>E</strong>' with the first block of part '<strong>F</strong>', the <strong>ROM</strong> prints the following.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>+ load:0x3fff0008,len:4
</span><span>+ load:0x3fff000c,len:3220
</span><span>+ load:0x40078000,len:4816
</span><span></span><span>- load:0x40007a5c,len:2349373696    # last two 4-byte words of part 'E'
</span><span></span><span>+ entry 0x40080740
</span></code></pre></div><p>Please note that the both blocks are encrypted and we actually copy an encrypted block over another encrypted block. We cannot do anything else as we assume we do not have access to the <strong>decryption key</strong>, similarly as a real-world attacker.</p>
<h4 id="brute-forcing">Brute forcing</h4>
<p>This sequence of choices made during the design and implementation of the <strong>ESP32</strong>'s <strong>Secure Boot</strong> implementation allows us to <strong>brute force</strong> arbitrary values of the last two 4-byte words of part '<strong>E</strong>'. Nonetheless, brute forcing an arbitrary value, considering we do roughly 10 experiments per second, takes more than 10 years (i.e. search space is 2^32). Optimizations are likely possible, but we did not investigate this.</p>
<p>Regardless if we can optimize the brute force to something reasonable, we do not know if it's even feasible to load a value into the PC register if we can only control a single 4-byte value. Therefore, we decided to determine exactly that before we deal with the limitations imposed to us by the brute force requirement.</p>

<h4 id="approach">Approach</h4>
<p>We are performing the attacks on a development board and therefore we are able to set the <strong>Secure Boot</strong> and <strong>Flash Encryption</strong> keys. It allows us to identify if the attack is applicable using a fully controlled environment. Even though a real-world attacker is unable to do so, it's not unlikely an attack will do the vulnerability identification on a development board as well.</p>
<p>We started our experiments by overwriting part '<strong>E</strong>', in a plain-text flash image, entirely with address pointers to a function in <strong>ROM</strong> that prints something on the serial interfaces. This is the exact same address we used for identifying a successful glitch as during the attack described in the <a href="https://raelize.com/espressif-systems-esp32-controlling-pc-during-sb/">previous post</a>. This part is stored in flash from address <code>0x1cc0</code> to address <code>0x2f90</code>.</p>
<p>Then, we encrypt the plain-text flash image with the correct encryption key and program the encrypted result using the <strong>ESP32 SDK</strong>. This allows us to make arbitrary modifications to the plain-text flash image. Of course, this is definitely not possible by a real-world attacker as the encryption key will not be known. Nonetheless, this is definitely a valid approach for working towards attack identification.</p>
<h4 id="initial-experiments">Initial experiments</h4>
<p>For our first experiments we injected glitches while part '<strong>E</strong>' was being copied by the processor from external flash to internal memory. Even though this <strong>attack window</strong> is rather large, we are really affected by timing as we know that part '<strong>E</strong>' is entirely overwritten with the address pointer.</p>
<p>The results of this campaign are shown in the picture below.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-brute-1.png">
        <img src="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-brute-1.png" width="600px">
    </a>
</p>
<p>Interestingly, we observed four experiments for which we execute <strong>ROM</strong> function successfully. As anticipated, the successful results are spread out across the <strong>attack window</strong>. Like with the other attacks performed on the <strong>ESP32</strong> chip so far, we are able to reproduce the attacks with a high success rate (i.e. higher than once per minute).</p>
<h4 id="working-towards-success">Working towards success</h4>
<p>We set the glitch parameters to that of the successful glitch that is closest to the end of part '<strong>E</strong>'. The two 4-byte words that we can potentially brute force are copied last as they are present in the last 16-byte block of part '<strong>E</strong>'.</p>
<p>Then, we slow start overwriting part '<strong>E</strong>' with 0x100 byte chunks of <code>0x41</code> bytes until we cannot reproduce the successful glitch any more. This tells us exactly, which 0x100 byte chunk of data contains the pointer that is loaded into the PC register. For this first result we concluded the pointer is taken from the chunk at offset <code>0x2a00</code>.</p>
<p>Then, we start targeting the remaining <strong>attack window</strong> again in order to find a successful glitch closer to the end of part '<strong>E</strong>'. After a couple hours of testing we identified a successful glitch for which the result is shown in the picture below.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-brute-2.png">
        <img src="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-brute-2.png" width="600px">
    </a>
</p>
<p>Again, we fix the glitch parameters and we slowly start overwriting part '<strong>E</strong>' again until we cannot reproduce the attack anymore. This time we concluded the pointer is taken from the chunk at offset <code>0x2c00</code>.</p>
<p>Then, we start targeting the remaining <strong>attack window</strong> again in order to find a successful glitch closer to the end of part '<strong>E</strong>' which is shown in the picture below.</p>
<p>
    <a href="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-brute-3.png">
        <img src="https://raelize.com/img/esp32/esp32-brute-3.png" width="600px">
    </a>
</p>
<p>At this point it was late at night and the temperature in our office dropped significantly. As a result, we observed alterations in the behavior of the chip compared to the previous experiments. The result was that we could not reproduce the successful glitches any more.</p></article></div>

						Big Data’s Elephant In The Room	</h2>
						
<p>For many years, “Big Data” was a major buzzword in enterprise IT. The theory was that as data volumes grew, we would need different approaches to ingest, store, process and analyse this data and turn it into competitive advantage.</p>



<p>Responding to this, many enterprises implemented the associated technologies and architectures – Hadoop, Hortonworks, Datastaxx, MapR, Cloudera etc – and set to work sucking in data from across their enterprise into these databases ready for analysis.</p>



<p>Many of these projects took the approach of “build it and they will come”, building a centralised all-singing-all-dancing “big data platform” which would sit strategically across the enterprise. They also invested huge amounts of time, money and effort in ETL’ing data into these platforms from source systems around the business.</p>



<p>Interestingly, less effort was invested in actually using and drawing value from this data when it was there.</p>



<p>Over the years, thousands of these enterprise wide big data platforms were built and populated, but ultimately failed to deliver business value and began declining in strategic importance. By the time they are consigned to the graveyard, I suspect that very few of them ultimately will have had positive ROI.</p>



<p>Over the next decade, these will replaced by more modern cloud hosted data lake and streaming architectures, and my hope is that we don’t simply repeat the same mistakes.</p>



<p>The elephant in the room throughout this whole sad story was that most companies&nbsp;<em>simply do not have a big data problem.</em>&nbsp;For most use cases in most businesses, they can simply put their data into RDBMs databases such as MySQL or SQL server, maybe scale some of them up and out, and are then able to answer the questions that they need with little ceremony.&nbsp;<em>When you are reporting on business events and activities performed by humans, for the most part the data volumes simply don’t get that large.</em></p>



<p>If we accept this, as an industry, we could have invested their time much wore wisely:</p>



<p><strong>Focus on velocity rather than volume of data</strong>&nbsp;-Rather than recording everything that happened for all of time to enable ad-hoc centralised reporting and analysis, I would rather know about the few things which I’m actually going to act on, but much sooner and more proactively.</p>



<p><strong>Focus on sophistication of analytics over volume of data&nbsp;</strong>– Rather than capturing more and more data, I would rather focus on the really interesting statistical insights into the datasets and how they are changing over time. It’s interesting how data Science didn’t really hit enterprise until later in the decade, when to me the whole idea of sophisticated analysis of small data should have arrived before we scaled up to big data.</p>



<p><strong>Integrating data into customer experience and operational processes –&nbsp;</strong>Big data platforms and data warehouses can guide humans, but there was not enough focus on taking the insights and analytics and calling back out to source and destination systems to change the customer experience and operational processes in response to the data. Even now, very few companies are doing this when it’s a wide open opportunity to extract value from analytics.</p>



<p>I view the mistakes that were made as “working hard” rather than “working smart”. We’ve been moving all of this data around and making big investments in centralised platforms, when one small but more sophisticated and automated deployment with a clear business case would have had much higher impact.</p>



<p>These lessons from history are important to consider as we move forward to more modern data architectures. Otherwise, the risk is that we simply repeat the same mistakes with slightly more modern technology.</p>



<p>Bearing this in mind, our focus is very much on finding small discrete business cases, then deploying intelligent analytics which respond very quickly and proactively, and ideally impact the real world through automation as the insight is identified. To me, this has much more opportunity than simply building another data platform.</p>

<p><strong>It always takes more time</strong><br>
…to lose weight<br>
…to gain weight<br>
…to build good habits<br>
…to get rid of bad habits<br>
…to arrive on time<br>
…to finish the project on time<br>
…to reach your goal<br>
…for your project to start making money<br></p>

<p><strong>But that is OK</strong>. All we have to do is push forward. Every day. Giving our all.
And account that everything will take longer than we want it. Most of the time.</p>

<p>Two months ago, I started building a “simple” job board - <a href="https://99remotejobs.com/" target="_blank">99remotejobs.com</a>.
I thought it would take me a week. It took me a month!</p>

<p>This short post was supposed to take me only 15 minutes, of course, yet it took me 40.</p>

<p>When I started <a href="https://www.saashub.com/" target="_blank">SaaSHub</a> I though AND CALCULATED that
if the project had 10,000 visitors a day, I would be all set - making enough
passive income to have a comfortable life. That was naive. It will take much more.
The project has about 8,000 visitors a day today (80% of my initial target),
and it is making only 15% of my target.
But that is OK. I keep pushing forward - every day.</p>

<p>The moral of the story - be prepared both psychologically and financially that
our endeavours will take more time. If you are pressed to give an end date of a
project, multiply by 2 your initial guess (yes, it is a guess) and then
extend it a bit more.</p>

        <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I recently finished reading a reinforcement learning textbook (by Barto and Sutton), and throughout it I was constantly vexed by one important assumption that underlined all the algorithms: the Markov property, stating that a succeeding event depends only on the one preceding it, and not on ones far in the past. This kind of restriction is a helpful tool both practically and theoretically, but it causes problems when dealing with a rather natural situation where there is long-term dependence between events. The book doesn’t address this, so I tried to, and found out it’s a genuine problem with real research behind it. Here’s what I did.</p>

<p>And <a href="https://github.com/corazza/reinforcement-learning">here’s the Rust code</a> I wrote that includes several algorithm and environment implementations taken from the book and also my method for this dependence problem.</p>

<p>But first, a brief explanation of the basic concepts:</p>

<h2 id="the-basics-of-reinforcement-learning">The basics of reinforcement learning</h2>

<p>The point of RL algorithms is to learn a policy (for achieving some goal) from interacting with an environment. A policy is a mapping from states to actions (or, a mapping from actions to probabilities of taking them in some particular state), which is followed by an RL <em>agent</em>. The interaction consists of the agent taking actions which causes the environment to undergo state transitions and provide the agent with a <em>reward signal</em> evaluating its performance in achieving the goal. The point isn’t chasing after immediate rewards, but maximizing overall <em>cumulative reward</em> (or gain) from the interaction.</p>

<p>Many tasks can successfully be formulated in this framework: a game of chess where all moves give a reward of 0, except a win resulting in a reward of 1 and loss resulting in a reward of -1 (a draw also being 0).</p>

<p>The algorithms accomplish policy improvement indirectly by estimating the <em>value</em> of the environment’s states (or <code>(state, action)</code> pairs), and modifying the policy to better reflect that knowledge. Value is defined as the gain (cumulative reward) following a state (or state-action pair). If you are in state <code>S_t</code> with available actions <code>A1</code> and <code>A2</code>, then knowing that the state-action pair <code>(S_t, A1)</code> is <em>more valuable</em> than <code>(S_t, A2)</code> should be reflected in your policy so that the probability of taking <code>A1</code> is no less than the probability of taking <code>A2</code>.</p>

<p>This incremental process is called <em>Generalized Policy Iteration</em> and is a strong contender for the core idea of reinforcement learning. It actually consists of two competing processes:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Policy evaluation</strong>: for a given policy, estimate the values of states or state-action pairs for the agent following that policy (i.e. learn the <strong>value function</strong> of the policy)</li>
  <li><strong>Policy improvement</strong>: for a given value function, change the policy so that it is more likely to result in more valuable behavior (e.g. by making it greedy with respect to the learned value function)</li>
</ol>

<p>An important theoretical result that enables this is the <em>Policy improvement theorem</em>, which justifies the policy improvement step. It assures that the resulting policy is either strictly better, or that the original policy is already optimal. (There’s some very interesting math here derived from Bellman optimality equations, but I won’t get into that here.)</p>

<p>Another important idea is that the crucial problem all RL algorithms solve can be thought of as <strong>credit assignment</strong>, i.e. giving credit for future outcomes to past behavior.</p>

<h2 id="the-markov-property-and-breaking-it">The Markov property and breaking it</h2>

<p>The interaction process is a sequence of random variables: <code>(S_0, A_0, R_1, S_1, A_1, R_2, ...)</code> called a <strong>Markov decision process</strong>. This is where the Markov property comes into play: it is a restriction on the environment/interaction dynamics stating that the probability of the next state and reward is a <em>function of the previous state and action taken.</em> The only information that determines the probabilities of transitioning into <code>S_{t+1}</code> with reward <code>R_{t+1}</code> is the pair <code>(S_t, A_t)</code> (these probabilities usually aren’t known, however).</p>

<p>The restriction is worthwhile: it underlies the convergence proofs for estimating values and guarantees that policy iteration is possible and finds the optimal policy in the limit. Many examples of environments satisfy the Markov property so you can still get far. It also guarantees that it is possible to encode knowledge about values of states and actions “locally”: that we can rely on the gain following a taken action to really be due to that action, and not some past one. The relation to the credit assignment problem is obvious.</p>

<p>But it is also a genuine restriction that bothered me while reading: it’s not difficult to come up with meaningful tasks/environments where the Markov property <em>does not</em> hold. After finishing the book I wanted to see how hard it would be to modify the algorithms to handle credit assignment in these non-Markov environments. First, here’s an example of such a case:</p>

<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dhngozzmz/image/upload/v1600199392/IMG_20200915_215137_hfurfg.jpg" alt="corridor"></p>

<p>The task here is simple. There is a corridor that ends with a choice: up or down. On each trial, one of these paths is randomly <em>trapped</em>, meaning that taking it results in a large negative reward (the other path gives a positive reward). All other actions give a small negative reward to incentivize moving forward. The crucial part is that the location of the trap is <em>observable</em> but <strong>only at the start of the corridor</strong>. Afterwards, this information is unavailable.</p>

<p>Why does this break the Markov property? Because in the final state i.e. the “split” where the up/down decision has to be made, the reward probabilities depend on the starting state, i.e. on the observation made there. The choice “up” doesn’t have a set of probabilities for receiving rewards, but rather the probabilities are a function of what the agent had observed sometime in the past. The knowledge of the value of available actions cannot be encoded locally at the split state alone.</p>

<p>This is the general form of many of these Markov-breaking examples: long-term dependence of future events on past events. And none of the algorithms from the book can solve this example, even though it seems to correspond to a reasonable task.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution</h2>

<p>I came up with a simple solution and it works, although only if certain requirements are met by the algorithm. Later I found out that people already worked on this problem (of course), but I’m still glad I independently identified it and had a working solution.</p>

<p>The solution is giving agents a few bits memory and actions for mutating them. In fact, for the corridor problem, a single bit will suffice. But this has to be done <em>transparently</em>, with minimal changes to the algorithm itself. More precisely the agent should have its <code>(state, action)</code> pairs extended at each step: the state <code>S_t</code> becomes <code>(S_t, MS_t)</code> and the action <code>A_t</code> becomes <code>(A_t, MA_t)</code>, where <code>MS</code> and <code>MA</code> denote memory-state and memory-action. Effectively this means that you can take a regular RL algorithm and give it, in each step of the interaction, the ability to read and write to memory <code>M</code> (which can generally be a bit array), and <code>M</code> becomes a part of the environment state from the perspective of the agent–this is how the “transparency” is accomplished. The reading and writing of memory has to be completely subject to learning.</p>

<p>How can this solve the corridor problem? Well, for one, now it is at least <em>possible</em> to have a policy that solves it! The policy is simple: in the beginning, depending on the observation that tells the agent where the trap lies, either flip the bit or don’t (it starts in 0, always). Afterwards, don’t touch the bit (noop). Then, at the split where the up/down decision has to be made, your state is no longer <code>S_t=Split</code>, but <code>(S_t, M_t)=(Split, m)</code>, and <code>m</code> tells you the observation from the past! The policy at this stage has encoded the value for going up or down that is dependent on the memory set at the beginning: we’ve handled temporal dependency between the observation event and the decision event.</p>

<p>But the harder question is: can this policy actually be learned?</p>

<h2 id="the-limitation">The limitation</h2>

<p>To understand when this policy is learnable and when it is not, and why, it is best to look at the simplest RL control algorithm, SARSA, named after the basic segment in a Markov decision process <code>(S_t, A_t, R_{t+1}, S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})</code>. There’s no need to spell it out in detail, it only has two crucial parts corresponding to the two competing processes in Generalized Policy Iteration. Here, <code>Q(s, a)</code> denotes the state-action value function that the algorithm is learning, and epsilon-greedy means choosing an action that is best according to <code>Q</code> most of the time (with <code>1 - epsilon</code> probability) and a random action some of the time (with <code>epsilon</code> probability).</p>

<p>For each step of the episode:</p>

<ol>
  <li>From <code>S_t</code> take action <code>A_t</code>, observe transition to <code>S_{t+1}</code> with reward <code>R_{t+1}</code></li>
  <li>Choose next action <code>A_{t+1}</code> so that it is epsilon-greedy with respect to <code>Q</code> <em>(policy improvement)</em></li>
  <li>Update <code>Q(S_t, A_t)</code> slightly towards a new target value <code>R_{t+1} + Q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})</code> <em>(policy evaluation)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>The update target is the most important part: <code>R_{t+1} + Q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})</code> is a new estimate of the <em>gain</em> following <code>S_t</code> after <code>A_t</code> is taken, and what’s interesting is that it only takes into account the immediate reward and not rewards that come afterwards. However gain isn’t just the immediate reward: it is the cumulative reward, i.e. the sum of all rewards. Correcting that is the role of the <code>Q(S_{t+1}, A_{t+1})</code> term, the value of the succeeding state-action pair. As I said in the introduction, value functions represent the gain following a state-action pair.</p>

<p>My Rust code for SARSA is <a href="https://github.com/corazza/reinforcement-learning/blob/master/src/learner/sarsa.rs#L18">here</a>, it has more details.</p>

<p>Can this algorithm learn a policy that solves the corridor problem? Well, no. Too bad! Why? Because of the <strong>credit assignment problem</strong>. The algorithm cannot <em>give credit</em> to the action of <em>remembering the observation</em> because it only gives credit one step backwards! Here’s an illustration:</p>

<p>The agent moves from <code>S</code> into either <code>U</code> or <code>L</code> and this state represents the observation. Then it moves into the corridor <code>C(1)</code> (there can be multiple corridor …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <div><p>
                Hello!

                These are the results of a survey I posted recently, which aimed to ask the Github userbase what their
                thoughts on the controversial change of the default branch on Github (and by extension, Git) from 'master'
                to an alternative phrase like 'main' or 'trunk'.

                The name change was proposed as a response to the 2020 Black Lives Matter protests, demanding equal rights
                and restructure of the American police system in response to the violent, tragic and reckless murders of
                innocent black men, women and children at the hands of police.
                
                </p><p>
                This proposed change has divided opinions within Github's user base. Github has claimed that the use of the word
                'master' has connotations to slavery in many countries, and it is being changed to make black developers feel
                more comfortable on the platform. However, many others have argued that the change is meaningless to the cause,
                distracts the public from the actual issues faced by real black people, and that the change breaks CI solutions
                and other habits. However, many others also support the change, believing that it is expanding inclusivity, and
                it is also a chance to change the name of the branch to something more meaningful or a name which expresses the
                branch's purpose more clearly.

                </p><p>
                In the wake of this, I decided to create this survey to ask the users of Github directly what they thought about
                the change. I also decided to collect information about the responder's ethnicity, country of residence and gender,
                in order to gauge the demographics which were mainly for and against the change.

                The survey spanned many different countries, reaching people who identified with around 16 different
                ethnic groups. The survey was also taken by several people who did not identify as either male or female.
                However, the majority of people who responded were white, and the most prevalent gender identity to respond
                was male, followed up by females. This was expected based on how the majority of people involved in computer
                science (and therefore, users of Github) are white males. Despite this however, many users chose not to
                disclose their gender identity, so the true distribution is not known.

                Perhaps unsurprisingly, the United States came in with the most responses by 29.5%, followed closely by many
                European countries. I did not list all countries in Europe, but many responses from other countries in Europe
                responded, taking up about 29% of all responses. Based on the ethnic data, I'm guessing most of these are from
                countries like Russia, the Netherlands, Spain, and so on. In hindsight, I probably should have included more
                countries in the list.

                The general opinion for most users is that they are <b>against</b> this change. 70% of all participants said
                that they are against the change, with only 15.7% being in support of the change. The other 14.3% fall under
                'Maybe' and 'Don't care', though their actual opinions are usually mixed and lean towards one of the two main
                options. Based on the written responses from users who were asked to explain their responses, most reasoning
                for their responses is as follows:
                </p><p>
                <b>For</b></p></div><ul>
                    <li>It is outdated terminology, and changing it from 'master' to some other alternative in order to create
                        a more inclusive space is worth the effort.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an opportunity to pick a more meaningful name which better expresses what the branch actually does.
                        It is difficult to understand exactly what 'master' means on first encounter, whereas something like 'main'
                        would make much more sense.
                    </li>
                    <li>The name 'master' simply doesn't make sense to some users. It is now legacy terminology, and holding onto
                        it would simply be impractical.
                    </li>
                    <li>Some are not bothered either way, but feel that if individuals are offended by it they are supportive of
                        changing it to something else.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <b>Against</b>
                <ul>
                    <li>This action is being taken as a form of 'virtue signalling', Github and Microsoft merely did this in order
                        to jump onto a bandwagon while the Black Lives Matter movement was gaining momentum on social media.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several African Americans who responded stated that it was <i>more</i> offensive to change it, since it
                        comes across as white people "thinking we are "vulnerable" and need protecting" from a word which they
                        understand has multiple meanings in different contexts.
                    </li>
                    <li>It is an impractical change which will break workflows, continuous integration (CI) setups and several other
                        automated scripts which will require manual fixing later.
                    </li>
                    <li>Using the word 'master' depends on the context being used. In Git, it is widely understood that the word
                        'master' is used to mean master copy (the original copy which all derivatives are made from), and nobody
                        associates the word in this context with it's master/slave connotation.
                    </li>
                    <li>Several git tutorials and walkthroughs will become obselete.</li>
                    <li>It is introducing politics into a website which is not and has not ever been involved in politics, and it
                        is creating a social issue where there actually isn't one to begin with.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                It is clear that most users believe it is an unnecessary change, which breaks automated workflows, is insensitive
                given the current political landscape in the world, offensive to the group of people they are trying to be inclusive
                of, and suggests that Github and/or Microsoft are simply only interested in doing this to gain favor in public opinion.
            
                <p>
                However, some users also believe that it is time to rid the industry of questionable terminology, which could possibly
                offend certain people, is confusing and unclear in its meaning given the context it is used in, and should be
                swapped out with clearer and less ambiguous terminology.

                </p><p>
                Those who were in support of the change were asked to pick from a list of alternative names for the branch which they
                preferred, or suggest their own. The most popular one chosen by participants was 'main' with 47.6% of votes, followed
                by 'trunk' with 14.3%. Several other names were suggested which are listed below.

            <h2>Correlations</h2>
            <p>
                I originally ran this survey with the goal of discovering some kind of correlation between the different demographic
                groups which make up Github's user base, and how positive/negative their support is in relation to this issue. I also
                wanted to see which group was most supportive of the change, which group was least supportive, and how much the 
                response changed between ethnicities, genders and countries.

            <div><p>
                Something I was not expecting when gathering the data for this survey is that every single African American who
                answered the survey responded 'No' in support of the change. Not only that, when asked to explain their reasoning,
                all of them sounded fairly spiteful towards Github and it's executives, since they felt that these decisions were
                made by white executives who didn't actually consider whether it offended them or not, and these responses suggest
                that they were more offended by Github feeling the need to change it in the first place.
                
                </p><p>
                You can also see that most of the users in support of this change are of either caucasian or asian descent, while
                more marginalised groups like africans, indians, hispanics and otherwise are almost universally against the changes,
                reflecting that the main ethnic group which feels the need to change it (and take offense to it) are white.

This means that the regret an investor could have for missing a winning early stage investment is theoretically infinite. Theoretically infinite regret is not a particularly helpful concept, so consider the corollary to this: <strong>With a power law with an alpha less than two, the largest expected return multiple per investment increases faster than the number of investments made.</strong></p><p>The graph to the right <a href="http://reactionwheel.net/2015/06/power-laws-in-venture.html">illustrates this concept</a>. The x-axis is the number of picks and the y-axis the largest expected return multiple. The green line shows (for alpha = 1.9) the effect of increasing the number of investments vs the largest expected return multiple per investment. This illustrates that fund performance is likely improved with a larger number of investments. The lower the alpha, the more pronounced this trend becomes (i.e. the curve is steeper for alpha = 1.75 than for 1.95).&nbsp;</p><h3>Independent B2B SaaS company outcomes are power law distributed</h3><p>Does this also apply to Independent SaaS companies?

We obtained up to 5 years of monthly revenue (MRR) data from a set of ~500 SaaS companies with starting revenues between $500 MRR and $15k MRR, and at least 12 months of operating history (the average operating history was 47 months).</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1599146951954_66507"><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>JDK 15 hit General Availability today. While I spend most of my time in Kotlin these days, I do keep a close on Java, as it still has
a special place in my heart, so I thought I’d make a quick post highlighting some of its new features. :) There are quite a few changes
in the release, so I’ll list all of them, but focus on the ones I think most developers will find more interesting.</p>


<div>
<h2 id="general-notes">General Notes</h2>
<div>
<p>There are some pretty techincal changes here (it seems to me) that <strong>most</strong> people won’t care about. If you’re into crypto, the EdDSA change might be of interest,. If you’re performance-sensitive, ZGC will likely pique your interest, and if you’re a framework developer, hidden classes sound pretty awesome. Solaris, RMI, and Javascript users, though, may be in for a slight disappointment, but these changes were telegraphed long ago, so they shouldn’t come as a surprise.</p>
<p>For my money, the most interesting (read as: applicable to me) are</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Sealed classes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pattern matching instanceof</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Text blocks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Records</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Let’s take a super quick looks.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="sealed-classes">Sealed Classes</h2>
<div>
<p>There’s a good chance that at some point in your career, you’ve needed to define a hierarchy of classes and control where it can be extended. In languages like Kotlin, there is the <code>sealed</code> modifier that prevents the class from being extended without permission, so to speak. In Java however, you’re carefully curated list of system status codes, say, can be extended willy nill by any and all. Until now. the new feature, for those not familiar with the concept, allows the developer to "seal" a class, preventing its extension by all except a special few. In it’s simplest form, it might look like this:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">abstract sealed class Shape {
    abstract public draw();
}

final class Square extends Shape {
    public draw() {
    }
}

final class Circle extends Shape {
    public draw() {
    }
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In this example, <code>Shape</code> is abstract (though it need not be), and there are only two available shapes: <code>Square</code> and <code>Circle</code>. In this example, all three classes are declared in the same file, but, unlike, say, Kotlin, that need not be the case. If your classes are complex, have a lot of code, etc., and it would be better from a maintainability perspective, say, to have them in separate files, the compiler will let you do that, but you have to tell it which
classes are allowed to participate:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">public abstract sealed class Shape
    permits fully.qualified.class.Square,
            fully.qualified.class.in.another.package.Circle {
        ...
    }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Interfaces can also be sealed, with all of the same rules applying.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="pattern-matching-instanceof-preview-feature">Pattern-matching instanceof (Preview feature)</h2>
<div>
<p>For years, we’ve used <code>instanceof</code> to test the type of a variable, and for years, immediately after, we’ve type-casted that variable so we can use it:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">if (foo instanceof Interface1) {
    ((Interface1)foo).someMethod();
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Having to type (har har) twice was a bit annoying. JDK 15 brings a new syntax that lets us reduce that:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">if (foo instanceof Interface1 f) {
    f.someMethod();
} else {
    f.someOtherMethod(); // compiler error
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Notice that we can declare a variable after the <code>instanceof</code> check that we can then use in the <code>true</code> branch of the <code>if</code>. The variable is <em>not</em> available in the <code>else</code>.</p>
<p>This does not currently work in a <code>switch</code> statement, but that change is expected to come as well. This is only a preview feature so we can kick its tires, so use it with caution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="text-blocks">Text blocks</h2>
<div>
<p>One of the things I’ve loved about Kotlin is the ability to write multi-line strings and let the compiler do the hardwork for me. For example.</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="kotlin">val foo = """
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus luctus
    finibus velit dictum lacinia.
    """.trimIndent()</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>This allows us to write a text block, spanning lines, and the system does the work for us to make a single, properly formatted string. In Java, that might look like</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">String foo = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus luctus\n" +
    "finibus velit dictum lacinia.";</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>JDK 15 allows this:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">String foo = """
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Vivamus luctus
    finibus velit dictum lacinia.
    """;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Very neat and clean.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="records">Records</h2>
<div>
<p>Finally, we come to records.In a nutshell, Records, a new kind of class on the JVM, allow us to declare an new, immutable type primarily intended to carry data in a _very_concise manner. Take this example from the JEP:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="java">// The old way
class Point {
    private final int x;
    private final int y;

    Point(int x, int y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }

    int x() { return x; }
    int y() { return y; }

    public boolean equals(Object o) {
        if (!(o instanceof Point)) return false;
        Point other = (Point) o;
        return other.x == x &amp;&amp; other.y = y;
    }

    public int hashCode() {
        return Objects.hash(x, y);
    }

    public String toString() {
        return String.format("Point[x=%d, y=%d]", x, y);
    }
}
// The new way
record Point(int x, int y) { }</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>A <em>huge</em> improvement. The eagle-eyed may notice that the <code>record</code> definition is missing some methods. That is because, for <code>record</code> classes, the compiler generates <code>equals</code>, <code>hashCode</code>, and <code>toString</code> for you. It also generates getters and setters as well. While the JEP officially states that this isn’t the opening salvo of a War on Boilerplate, it’s at least a nice test shot. :P</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<div>
<p>There is, of course, more in the release than what I’ve discussed here, and you may find other bits more interesting, but these are the things that I’m most excited about.</p>
<p>You can download it <a href="https://jdk.java.net/15/">here</a> and read the official release notes <a href="https://jdk.java.net/15/release-notes">here</a>. Congrats to the entire JDK team!</p>

<p><strong>September 14, 2020</strong> – Viceroy Research is short Grenke AG (XTRA: GLJ).</p>







<p>Grenke’s global expansion through the purchase of dozens of undisclosed related party franchises is a fraudulent scheme perpetrated on a mass scale, designed to either hide fake cash or siphon off millions of euros to undisclosed related parties, or both.</p>



<p>Grenke’s banking division has been a conduit for the proceeds of crime and money laundering, and could face the loss of its banking license.</p>



<p>Grenke’s leasing model facilitates and encourages rampant fraud from resellers, resulting in bad debt, protracted legal disputes and the defrauding of small businesses, the government, and charities. Legitimate leasing of small ticket tech is becoming increasingly redundant, in outdated and fast diminishing business segments.</p>



<div><p>Viceroy Research believes Grenke AG’s stock is <strong>uninvestable</strong> due to blatant <strong>accounting fraud</strong>, including <strong>dozens of undisclosed related party transactions</strong>, and the <strong>complete lack of internal controls</strong>, right down to individual due diligence on customers.</p><p>Grenke’s bonds are hovering above junk territory due to capital adequacy stemming from its banking business, which we believe is <strong>hiding fake cash</strong>, and is actively used to <strong>launder money</strong> for <strong>binary options scams</strong>, <strong>crypto scams</strong>, and <strong>fraudulent</strong> <strong>unregulated trading platform</strong>.</p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage"><meta itemprop="thumbnailUrl image" content="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1599786975168/LY_-tbtvH.png?w=1600&amp;h=840&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=entropy&amp;auto=format&amp;q=60"><div><div itemprop="text"><p>I recently wrote a blog post about how I use NVM to <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.coreyodonnell.tech/managing-my-node-versions">manage my node version</a>. Someone commented on the post saying I should look into <a target="_blank" href="https://volta.sh/">Volta</a></p>
<h2 id="what-is-volta">What is Volta</h2>
<p>Volta is a command line tool used to manage your Node.js. It is built using Rust and is shipped as a static binary that can be run on Windows and all *nix shells. The goal is to make sure every developer working on the project seamlessly has the same tools and versions installed.</p>
<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>
<p>The installation is simple.</p>
<pre><code>
curl https://get.volta.sh | bash
</code></pre>
<p>The script installs the binary in <code>~/.volta</code> and adds <code>~/.volta/bin</code> to your systems path inside of your <code>~/.bash_profile</code>, <code>~/.profile</code>, and <code>~/.bashrc</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>export</span> VOLTA_HOME=<span>"<span>$HOME</span>/.volta"</span>
<span>export</span> PATH=<span>"<span>$VOLTA_HOME</span>/bin:<span>$PATH</span>"</span>
</code></pre><p>Now you can start using Volta to manage Node.js.</p>
<h3 id="using-volta">Using Volta</h3>
<p>You can easily install node using</p>
<pre><code>
volta install node

volta install node@12
</code></pre>
<p>Now node should be available to use whenever you open your terminal.</p>
<p>If you want to set Volta to always load a specific version of node for your active package you can use <code>pin</code>.</p>
<pre><code>volta pin node@12.18.3
</code></pre>
<p>This command will store your pinned version in your <code>package.json</code>.</p>
<pre><code><span>"volta"</span>: {
  "<span>node</span>": <span>"12.18.3"</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>Every time you navigate to your project, Volta will automatically set your active node version to whatever is pinned.</p>
<p>You can even install and pin global packages like yarn using Volta to make sure everyone on your team is using the same version for their global packages.</p>
<pre><code>volta install yarn
volta pin yarn
</code></pre>
<h2 id="how-does-volta-compare-to-nvm">How does Volta compare to NVM?</h2>
<p>NVM is just a node version manager. It only handles installing different versions of node. You can also set a default version of node to load whenever you open your terminal. Volta handles node versions and can set a default version to load also.</p>
<p>When opening a terminal, NVM usually takes about 0.5 to 2 seconds to source in bash if you have a default node version set. Volta does not seem to add any load time.</p>
<p>You can pin node version for your projects using both tools. NVM uses a <code>.nvmrc</code> file and Volta adds a key to your <code>package.json</code>. Volta can also pin versions for global NPM packages used for the project.</p>
<p>NVM does not automatically switch your active node version to your pinned version. You have to run <code>nvm use</code> or install another package call <code>AVN</code>. AVN usually takes 2 to 5 seconds to switch node versions. Volta does it automatically and usually takes less than a second.</p>

<p>Even though I have been using NVM for almost 4 years, I think Volta takes the crown. I plan to use Volta for managing all my Node.js needs from now on. The speed and simplicity of the tool just makes it the better choice. NVM, I am thankful you for all the headaches you have saved me in the past but I think it is time to move on.</p>

<p>
	Which sounds better to you?
</p><p>
	“In his best-selling book on behavioral science, <em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>, Nobel-prize winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman said, ‘Nothing in life is as important as you think it is when you are thinking about it.’.”
</p><p>
	… or just saying it:
</p><p>
	“Whatever’s on your mind is not as important as it seems.”
</p><p>
	When I first started reading a lot of books, I started quoting them a lot.
	When bringing up an idea in conversation, first I would mention its source — the book, the title, the author, and the subject of the book — before finally saying the idea.
</p><p>
	After far too many times hearing myself referencing this book and that book, always naming titles and authors, I realized it was a lot of unnecessary clutter.
	I could see my listeners waiting for me to get to the point.
<strong>
	It was inconsiderate.
</strong>
</p><p>
	Then I started noticing how annoying it was to read books that do the same thing.
	It’s really common in these <a href="https://sive.rs/book">pop non-fiction</a> books I like:
	“This person said this thing. That person said that thing.”
</p><p>
	It got me wondering:
<strong>
	Why don’t we just say the idea, instead of referencing and quoting it?
</strong>
</p><p>
	I think there are a few reasons:
</p>
<ol><li>
<strong>
	It feels like stealing.
</strong>
	It’s <em>their</em> idea, not mine.
	But all ideas come from somewhere.
	Maybe they were paraphrasing it from someone else.
</li><li>
<strong>
	School teaches us to reference.
</strong>
	But we’re not trying to impress a teacher anymore.
	And every unnecessary fact dilutes our point.
</li><li>
<strong>
	By quoting someone else, we can easily disavow the idea if attacked.
</strong>
	If someone says it’s wrong, we can avoid responsibility and say, “Don’t look at me! It’s his idea, not mine!”
</li></ol>
<p>
	So instead, I go the other way now.
</p><p>
	If I hear an idea, have considered it, and integrated it into my beliefs, <strong>it’s mine</strong>.
	I’ll say it succinctly in my own words, and stand behind it.
	Like adopting a child, I will take care of this idea and raise it as my own.
	If anyone wants to know the source, I’ll be happy to tell them.
</p><p>
	I highly recommend this.
	Stop referencing.
	Stop quoting.
	Paraphrase.
	Internalize it.
	Make it yours.
<strong>
	Tell me what <em>you</em> think, not what someone else thinks.
</strong>
</p>

<p>A lightweight F#/C# library for efficient functional-style pipelines on streams of data.</p>
<div>
  
  <div>
    <div id="nuget"><p>
      Install via <a href="https://nuget.org/packages/Streams">NuGet</a>:
      </p><pre>PM&gt; Install-Package Streams
PM&gt; Install-Package Streams.CSharp</pre>
    </div>
  </div>
  
</div>
<p>The main design behind Streams is inspired by Java 8 Streams and is based on the observation that many functional pipelines follow the pattern:</p>
<table><tbody><tr><td><pre><span>1: </span>
</pre></td>
<td><pre><code lang="fsharp"><span>source</span><span>/</span><span>generator</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>lazy</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>lazy</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>lazy</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>eager</span><span>/</span><span>reduce</span>
</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
<ul>
<li>Source/generator are functions that create Streams like Stream.ofArray/Stream.init.</li>
<li>Lazy functions take in streams and return streams like Stream.map/Stream.filter, these operations are fused together for efficient iteration.</li>
<li>Eager/reduce are functions like Stream.iter/Stream.sum that force the Stream to evaluate up to that point.</li>
</ul>
<p>The main difference between LINQ/Seq and Streams is that LINQ is about composing external iterators (Enumerable/Enumerator) and  Streams is based on the continuation-passing-style composition of internal iterators.</p>

Navigating the app is explicit with text whereas Stringer you had to poke around using icons without text descriptions.</p><figure><img src="https://lukesingham.com/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-31-at-09.46.28.png"></figure><p>There are several integrations to apps like Pocket, Instapaper and Wallabag. And after changing the theme. the reader is quite nice. Albeit, I do notice the entire page refresh from the server side oriented app - but I have to tell myself that the simplicity philosophy trumps the complexity of introducing a frontend framework.</p><figure><img src="https://lukesingham.com/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-31-at-13.36.10.png"></figure><p>⭐️ 8.5 / 10 - Whilst being minimalistic has all the features you need, dark theme and the most active development of them all with a clear software philosophy.</p><h2 id="winds-1"><a href="https://getstream.io/winds/">Winds</a></h2><p>The install is relatively long particularly with the external dependencies which include:</p><ul><li><a href="https://getstream.io/">Stream</a> - an API for building activity feeds + handle personalization (machine learning). </li><li><a href="https://www.algolia.com/">Algolia</a> - for search</li><li><a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas">MongoDB Atlas</a> - a DB as a service (DBaaS)</li></ul><p>At this point I opt to sign up for a free account to try it out. I get the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/winds-by-getstream-io/id1381446741">app from the apple store</a>. Upon opening Winds, you are first confronted with a selection of interests like 'Programming', 'News' etc. I pick a couple and click next. I then have to create an account 😑 which I do. Then once logged in I have a very populated set of feeds and podcasts.</p><figure><img src="https://lukesingham.com/content/images/2020/05/Screen-Shot-2020-05-31-at-14.02.22.png"></figure><p>I then want to try and remove all of these and start fresh, which no amount of clicking around can I figure out how to do other than clicking individually on each feed to remove it. I could create a new account and then add my OPML file - however at this point I'm already missing the bloat free approach of Miniflux.</p><p>⭐️ 7 / 10 &nbsp;- for a non self-hosted piece of software I can see this is actually really nice. However major downsides of the installation complexity for self-hosted installation combined with features I don't particularly want. For instance, I don't want a recommender system - I can find my own content and probably consume too much as it is! If I want reinforcing recommender systems I'd go into a walled garden like Facebook.</p><h2 id="-winner-miniflux-">🎉 Winner - Miniflux 🎉</h2><h2 id="rss-tips">RSS Tips</h2><p>Do you have a list of websites you want to follow?</p><ul><li>A lot of sites you can just <code>/rss</code> e.g <code>domainname.com/rss</code></li><li>For medium sites add <code>/feed/</code> e.g. <a href="https://medium.com/feed/@cjolowicz/"><code>https://medium.com/feed/@verygoodblogger/</code></a></li><li>I used <a href="https://opml-gen.ovh/">this site</a> to convert a list feeds into an OPML file I could mass import to the various RSS feed reader apps.</li><li>About a decade ago I used blogspot/blogger.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> Python framework allows people to build websites extremely fast. One of its best features is the Object-relational mapper (ORM), which allows you to make queries to the database without having to write any SQL. Django will allow you to write your queries in Python and then it will try to turn those statements into efficient SQL. Most of the time the ORM creates the SQL flawlessly, but sometimes the results are less than ideal.</p>
<p>One common database problem is that ORMs can cause N+1 queries. These queries include a single, initial query (the +1), and each row in the results from that query spawns another query (the N). These often happen when you have a parent-child relationship. You select all of the parent objects you want and then when looping through them, another query is generated for each child. This problem can be hard to detect at first, as your website could be performing fine. But as the number of parent objects grows, the number of queries increases as well — to the point of overwhelming your database and taking down your application.</p>
<p>Recently, I was building a simple website that kept track of expenses and expense reports. I wanted to use Sentry’s new <a href="https://sentry.io/for/performance/">Performance</a> tool to assess how the application was performing in production. I quickly set it up using the instructions for <a href="https://docs.sentry.io/performance-monitoring/getting-started/?platform=python">Django</a> and immediately saw results.</p>

<p>The first thing I noticed was that the median root transaction was taking 3.41 seconds. All this page did was display a list of reports and the sum of all of the expenses on a report. Django is fast and it definitely shouldn’t take 3.41 seconds.</p>

<p>The second thing I noticed was just how many queries the ORM had generated. It was at this point that I saw that I had a single query to fetch all of the reports and then another query for each report to fetch all of the expenses —an N+1 problem.</p>
<p>Django evaluates queries lazily by default. This means that Django won’t run the query until the Python code is evaluated. In this case, when the page initially loads, <code>Reports.objects.all()</code> is called. When I call <code>{{ report.get_expense_total }}</code> Django runs the second query to fetch all of the expenses. There are two ways to fix this, depending on how your models are set up: <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/querysets/#select-related"><code>[select_related()]</code></a> and <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/querysets/#prefetch-related"><code>[prefetch_related()]</code></a>.</p>
<p><code>select_related()</code> works by following one-to-many relationships and adding them to the SQL query as a JOIN. <code>prefetch_related()</code> works similarly, but instead of doing a SQL join it does a separate query for each object and then joins them in Python. This allows you to prefetch many-to-many and many-to-one relationships.</p>
<p>We can update ReportsList to use <code>prefetch_related()</code>. This cuts the number of database queries in half, since we’re now making one query to fetch all of the Reports, one query to fetch all of the expenses, and then n queries in <code>report.get_expense_total</code>.</p>
<div data-language="py"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ReportsList</span><span>(</span>ListView<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    model <span>=</span> Reports
    context_object_name <span>=</span> ‘reports’
    queryset <span>=</span> Reports<span>.</span>objects<span>.</span>prefetch_related<span>(</span>‘expenses’<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To fix the <code>n</code> queries from <code>report.get_expense_total</code> we can use Django’s <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/querysets/#django.db.models.query.QuerySet.annotate"><code>annotate</code></a> to pull in that information before passing it to the template.</p>

<p>In the event the number of queries increases to the point where it could take your application down, try using prefetch_related or select_related. This way, Django will fetch all of the additional information without the extra queries. After doing this, I ended up saving 950 queries on my main page and decreasing the page load by 91%.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>Giuseppe Paternò has worked on over 100 cloud projects and no two were exactly alike. Moving applications to the cloud is a start point for many businesses on their journey to the cloud. But every business should have its own tailored journey.</p>



<p>Cloud solutions can be complex and each project has to meet specific business needs and work within specific parameters. They can range from building large private clouds to moving everything to the cloud, and even implementing organisational changes.</p>



<p>In this book Giuseppe set out what he learnt in 25+ years of IT, sharing three different case histories that show how every business should have its own tailored journey to the cloud. The author also shares in the publication his own six pillars for delivering successful cloud projects.</p>



<p>The author aims to inspire businesses in finding their own path to increase their business agility, lower or rationalise their costs and better focus on the core business.</p>

<p>Money may not be your <em>only</em> concern for your next role, but getting paid more for doing a job you liked the look of anyway can’t hurt. <strong>This guide is going to help you to negotiate a better paycheck for your next JavaScript development role by showing you how to navigate a hiring process.</strong></p>

<p>We’ve got behind-the-scenes info on what happens during the hiring process. Who’s who, how to handle the external recruiter, the best way to answer the dreaded salary question during interview—it’s all here. Knowledge is power, and after learning what’s really going on during the hiring process, you’ll be well-equipped to hack it to your own advantage.

<p>Money makes the world go ‘round. Cash is king. A dollar makes you holler. A penny saved—well, you get the point. But here’s the kicker:</p>

<h2>Nobody cares about the number on your paycheque as much as you do.</h2>

<p>What’s an extra $10,000 worth? Let’s look at some cold, hard math.</p>

<p>To you, $10,000 more equals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An extra $6,000 after taxes, or $500 per month</li>
  <li>5-20% of your average technical salary</li>
  <li>Ramen that isn’t prepared in the microwave</li>
</ul>

<p>There are long-term effects, too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bigger bonuses, which are often expressed as a percentage of the current salary</li>
  <li>A better starting point when your next employer asks for your current salary</li>
  <li>A bank account that’s as full and delicious as a bowl of <em>edamame</em></li>
</ul>

<p>An extra $10,000 sounds great doesn’t it? No downsides for you—but what does it mean to the other people involved in the hiring process?</p>

<h3 id="the-external-recruiter">The External Recruiter</h3>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/1303d71d4384ec0334f4bc9f9071f554.png" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/external-recruiter.png"><figcaption>Me, profiting off your hard work</figcaption></figure>

<p>Let’s start with this guy/gal, who is coincidentally me. The External Recruiter doesn’t work for the hiring company directly, they work for a staffing agency / recruitment firm, and they work on commission. To an external recruiter, $10,000 more equals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An extra $1,500 for the agency at a 15% commission</li>
  <li>A personal commission to the recruiter of $375 at 25%</li>
  <li>After-tax earnings of $225</li>
</ul>

<p>That after-tax $225 buys a decent amount of ramen for the recruiter, but if the client chooses another candidate because you were too expensive—POOF. That $225 vanishes in a cloud of soy-scented smoke and the recruiter <em>is not pleased</em> that you cost him a commission.</p>

<p>Let’s face it: whatever you and the recruiter intend to buy with your newfound wealth, you both want to see a nice number in that letter of offer. Mo’ money, mo’ joy, right? But not everyone is looking to pay you as much as possible… meet:</p>

<h3 id="the-internal-recruiterhr">The Internal Recruiter/HR</h3>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/001fd846fa88d16e574eb527cb55b6cc.jpg" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/internal-recruiter.jpg"><figcaption>No more free lunches</figcaption></figure>

<p>Candidates flow from the External Recruiter to the Internal Recruiter/HR who <em>does</em> work for the hiring company, and is meant as the company’s first line of defense.</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’ve got to hire someone within a set time-frame and budget range</li>
  <li>That LinkedIn post about <em>“If you Think a Professional is Expensive, Wait until you Hire an Amateur”</em> has them shook</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81Nl7VYFEaI">guy in the $3,000 suit</a> said they have to hire “a rock star who knows CSS to build out the backend widget accounting system”—whatever that means</li>
  <li>The recruiter takes them for nice lunches, but that doesn’t mean they’ll pick his candidate. Unless it’s their favourite bistro on the corner and then … the candidate’s in</li>
</ul>

<p>An extra $10,000 a year on your salary doesn’t matter to the internal recruiter/HR <em>at all</em> as long as it’s within the range they’ve been given. If it’s outside of that range, it means they’ll need to exchange some emails with someone else in the company to see if an exception can be made for you.</p>

<h3 id="the-hiring-manager">The Hiring Manager</h3>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/265e2ec80c5cd1590a36bc8b51bd23a2.png" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/hiring-manager.png"><figcaption>Hiring Manager, <i>ad astra</i></figcaption></figure>

<p>The Hiring Manager is likely to be your line-manager (or a level up from that) in the role. She is (or was) probably a programmer like you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Often, they don’t control their own budget, which means they don’t <em>really</em> care how much you cost</li>
  <li><strong>BUT</strong> The Widget Automation project is six months behind, and they’ve got to hire someone now or it goes up in flames</li>
  <li>They can hire whomever they want if the salary falls within a certain range and can beg the boss for an increase if they meet a Widget Automation rock star</li>
  <li>Hiring makes them hungry. When’s lunch?</li>
</ul>

<p>An extra $10,000 a year on your salary mostly doesn’t matter to the Hiring Manager, as it’s not her money. But while the internal recruiter/HR will need to simply get someone to authorise going outside the normal salary range, the Hiring Manager will actually need to make the case for it. She’ll need to convince whomever does control the budget that you’re worth it … and that’s real, actual effort in a busy professional’s day.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-lose-a-job-offer">How To Lose A Job Offer</h2>

<p>Remember, knowledge is power. Once you understand what’s happening in the background, you will be light years ahead of your competition. Key to your success is one universal truth:</p>

<h2>Hiring people is HARD, so recruitment processes are inflexible</h2>

<p>External recruiters, internal recruiters/HR, and hiring managers follow rigid processes they’ve been given, because when they deviate from these well-trodden roads, trouble looms.</p>

<p>About the best way to experience this first hand is to decide on 4:45pm on the last day of the month that you’d like the job offer you said you were likely to accept at $90,000 to pay $90,500 instead.</p>

<h3 id="who-youve-annoyed-and-how">Who you’ve annoyed and how…</h3>

<h4 id="the-external-recruiter-1">The External Recruiter</h4>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/1303d71d4384ec0334f4bc9f9071f554.png" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/external-recruiter.png"></figure>

<p>The External Recruiter thought he had his commission in the bag for the quarter, but now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Accounts Department are closing up the month in 15m</li>
  <li>… which means this month’s sales target go the way of the Death Star</li>
  <li>… even though he had a frank and detailed discussion with you about wage expectations at the start, you’ve decided to roll the dice at the eleventh hour</li>
</ul>

<p>Frantic phone calls will be made to…</p>



<h4 id="the-internal-recruiter--hr">The Internal Recruiter / HR</h4>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/001fd846fa88d16e574eb527cb55b6cc.jpg" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/internal-recruiter.jpg"></figure>

<p>The Internal Recruiter/HR had to fill out a lot of forms to get a job offer authorised:</p>

<ul>
  <li>He camped out in the CEO’s office for half of Tuesday to get authorization to offer $90,000.</li>
  <li>Can’t get in touch with the CEO because she is at a technology-free week-long “Management Realignment Camp” in Tahiti.</li>
  <li>Needs to jump back through all those hoops because now you want an extra $500.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s time to check with the Hiring Manager how much she <em>really</em> cares about hiring you…</p>



<h3 id="the-hiring-manager-1">The Hiring Manager</h3>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/265e2ec80c5cd1590a36bc8b51bd23a2.png" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/hiring-manager.png"></figure>

<p>The Hiring Manager:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Was authorised to sign off on $90,000 because internal HR got it approved</li>
  <li>Can’t offer $90,500 without a formal review, three pieces of paper signed in triplicate, and the blood of an albino bat, because it’s just over an internal company threshold that means the hire needs referring to the Board</li>
  <li>Wants to make it home for dinner at least one night this week and has a candidate she likes almost as much as you who’s asking for $89,000…</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sorry, the other candidate got the job because you're not a good "cultural fit"</h2>

<p>If you know how the recruitment process works, you can get paid more by working <em>with it</em> rather than against it. Help them to help you! Let’s rewind and examine the four stages of recruitment to see what happened to lead to that missed opportunity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hiring Stage 1: Before the Job is Posted</li>
  <li>Hiring Stage 2: The Job is Posted</li>
  <li>Hiring Stage 3: Interview</li>
  <li>Hiring Stage 4: The Offer</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hiring-stage-1-before-the-job-is-posted">Hiring Stage 1: Before the Job is Posted</h2>

<p>The hiring manager didn’t wake up thinking, “My day’s looking a little slow—let’s hire a new employee!” The hiring process starts when a business need has been identified, and if you can find out what that need is, you’ll have useful intel.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-they-hiring">Why are they hiring?</h3>

<p>If the business is replacing an existing person:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’re likely looking for someone with similar experience</li>
  <li>They don’t want to pay a dramatically different salary</li>
  <li>They probably want to use the same job title</li>
</ul>

<p>In this situation, flexibility is usually low, but listen for an indication that the last person has “been there forever and needs replacing” or “wrote horrible legacy code and ran SQL ‘fixes’ against the live DB.” These can be indicative that the employer knows they need an upgrade in professionalism and skills, and this may be the cue to mention your <em>professionalism, experience, and ability to deliver more appropriate methods</em> for their business—at a price befitting those skills, of course.</p>

<p>If the business is hiring for a new project or team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Somehow, somewhere, someone got a funding sign-off for this project</li>
  <li>They’re likely drawing from a pot of money for the project or team, so they have the potential to make a few expensive hires (because who doesn’t want at least one rockstar on their team?)</li>
  <li>There may be a leadership position that offers a big title and the big bucks to go with it</li>
</ul>

<p>A new project or team has the most flexibility in hiring. They’re starting from square one, and they might as well start with a gem, like you. In an interview, take this as a signal to tout your past success in leading or collaborating on new and exciting projects.</p>

<p>What if the role is something between a replacement and a new hire? Say the business is undergoing incremental growth: they need new people, but aren’t ready to rain dollar bills on any developer who comes through the door. What do you do?</p>

<h2>You ask questions!</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How many people are they hiring?</li>
  <li>Is this a new role? A new team?</li>
  <li>Are you joining a team of people with the same job title?</li>
</ul>

<p>At worst, asking questions makes you seem interested in their business. Not a bad way to make a great first impression.</p>

<h3 id="a-challenger-appears-the-budget-controller">A Challenger Appears: The Budget Controller</h3>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/d3de9501b08c2e8decd9cc75d78d3e16.png" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/the-money-guy.png"><figcaption>The budget controller is so money</figcaption></figure>

<p>Earlier we said “someone got a funding sign-off” for the project. This somebody sits somewhere in the hierarchy above where you ultimately will. This person controls their budget, and your salary is part of that budget. Their performance is often measured on the health of this budget.

                    <p>Who has the most significant impact on your working pace? Does it help you to grow or slows you down?</p><p>In this article, I'll list several types of people we may unknowingly use as pacers to adjust own behaviour. If you know them, you can control this effect and even change how you affect others.</p><figure><img src="https://evgenii.info/content/images/2020/09/smartest-kindergartener.png"></figure><blockquote>This is the second article about pacers –&nbsp;people, who can impact the performance of teams and companies by just speeding up or slowing down.<p>The previous one is <a href="https://evgenii.info/pacers-driving-force-of-teams/">here</a>.</p></blockquote><h2 id="three-big-categories-">Three big categories.</h2><h3 id="pacers-in-your-team-">Pacers in your team.</h3><p>It's reasonable to assume that your teammates have many opportunities to impact your pace, but the level of this impact varies from person to person.</p><p>Most likely, <strong>colleagues with whom you interact more frequently</strong> will have more influence on your attitude and productivity than others. <br>If it doesn't surprise you that <a href="https://www.reed.edu/economics/parker/Peer_Effects_HEDS.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer">students living together often achieve similar results</a>, it should also sound normal when something like this happens in the office. People, who have adjacent desks, frequently synchronise schedules, including lunches, coffee-breaks and how much of productive time they have.</p><p><strong>People with similar backgrounds</strong> is a similar story. Graduated from one university? Hired in the same year? Same age as you? The more traits people have in common, the more likely they would influence each other.</p><p>If you have any grading system at work, <strong>colleagues with adjacent ranks</strong> can impact you a lot too. <br>What are people in the next grade suppose to do? May you be up for a promotion? Do you bring more value than people on a preceding level?</p><p>The last two types of teammates who can influence your pace are <strong>the most and least productive people</strong>. One shows the team <em>what is possible</em>, while another — <em>what is acceptable. </em><br>There is one caveat, though — since it's difficult to measure actual productivity, you will have to deal with <em>a perceived </em>one. Make sure you see the entire iceberg, not the tip of it, before your perception impacts the pace.</p><p>The last type definitely needs more attention, and I'll come back to it in one of the next articles. For now, let's move on to the next category.</p><h2 id="2-pacers-outside-of-your-team-">2. Pacers outside of your team.</h2><p>Not anybody can find a pacer within the team — what if you're already a most prolific worker and now you need somebody to push you harder? Luckily, the world doesn’t end outside your team, so there are several options.</p><p><strong>Company-wide stars</strong> is the option available for middle-size and large companies. <br><em>Joined Google because one famous developer works there?</em> Now you can have a chance to have more insights on how they work and pick their pace if you like to.</p><p>Family and friends is probably the most obvious example of pacers you can have outside the team. <br><em>Your colleagues work extra time, but you leave at 6 because this is how the pace of your partner looks like?</em> A hard-working and extremely productive best-friend can be better than all motivational programs in revealing what you re capable of.</p><h3 id="3-imaginary-pacers-">3. Imaginary pacers.</h3><p>Who said pacers have to be real? Some of them may exist only in your head, but it doesn't always mean that you're getting crazy.</p><p><strong>Memories of yourself from the past</strong> can be a genuine imaginary pacer. <br><em>What did you achieve last year? Are you improving or falling behind? </em><br>Although it may look like a good idea, it can become dangerous when those memories fade. We don't have complete control over what we remember, so our perception of how much we did and how hard it was can be very different from reality.</p><p>Now I want to return for a second to <strong>the most and least productive people</strong> because they're able to form long-lived imaginary pacers for the whole team.<br>Have you met someone who was considered extremely productive <em>because they were like that in the past</em>? Even if they no longer produce the same results, others may still try to keep up with the pace that the original pacer could not maintain. The same can go with low performers, even after they bounced back.</p><p>The last type of pacers I want to mention here is <strong>famous people</strong> — actors, athletes, entrepreneurs, writers and even prominent open-source contributors. Not all of them show the shortcomings and failures of the public, which makes it easy to build overly idealised and hard to follow role models.</p><h2 id="putting-all-together-">Putting all together.</h2><p>This is the whole list of most common types of pacers which you might pick for yourself:</p><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><ul>
<li>In your team
<ul>
<li>Close colleagues</li>
<li>People with similar backgrounds</li>
<li>Adjacent ranks</li>

<h2>Files</h2>

<p>The best way I've found to organize my files is to split them between "created by me" versus "created by strangers". If I write an article, it goes in one place. If somebody else wrote it, it goes someplace else. 

</p><p>This distinction is important, but it is also fuzzy. Plenty of photos of my family were not taken by me, but I store them in the "me" pile. I have an <code>install</code> directory designed for recreating my setup, full of drivers and profiles and so forth, and even though I didn't create most of that, it represents a configuration I did create. What about bookmarks? Bookmarks can show up in either pile, no big deal.

</p><p>"Did I make this or not?" really seems to be the highest-order bit for organization. Old PDFs of my LaTeX homework solutions are completely different from a magazine article I downloaded in PDF. They don't belong together in the same folder.

</p><p>In fact, it seems that the things I worked on are my <em>only</em> important files. Everything else is just cache. Out of ten top-level directories, only one is for non-personal files, <code>found</code>. That's where I store the infographics and other miscellanea from the internet. If I have to think twice about deleting it, it doesn't belong in <code>found</code>.

</p><p>For a long time now, the internet has had a sufficient number of people volunteering as archivists that the rest of us can take a breather when it comes to things like "rare B-sides" and "fan movies". I only archive things I need that no one else mirrors.

</p><h2>Emails</h2>

<p>You really only need the last three years or so of email online. I have offline archives going back about twenty years, and I have never once gone back to read old email. The stuff that's worth saving gets plucked anyway. I still can't justify deleting the emails—there's too much personal correspondence mixed in—so I compromise by moving them offline.

</p><p>When Gmail first appeared, Google encouraged users to stop pruning email. But they were wrong about that. It isn't enough to simply have the capacity. The downside to not pruning is that eventually your email becomes impossible to search. Real deletes help that. I now try to trash anything automated, impersonal, recurring, or replicated. Letters that other people have written me are high value. Shipment IDs are already saved on Amazon.com.

</p><h2>Posts</h2>

<p>We save the things we make forever, but most of the stuff we post online has a limited shelf-life, at least when it comes to outside appreciation. In practical terms, the only time people ever read through old tweets is when they're looking for something damaging. Which means they don't need access to them.

</p><p>Initially, Snapchat sounded absurd. How could you stop anybody from taking screenshots? But the system works, not because it stops people from saving any one snap, but because it makes it prohibitive for anyone to keep a running archive of all snaps. The archive is where the liability is.

</p>

September 15, 2020 | https://www.osohq.com/post/django-access-control | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.osohq.com/post/django-access-control">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Nearly every application needs to enable its users to see only their data. Many other applications go further and add more controls, like sharing, or making some content private and public. These concepts are increasingly important to get right as data privacy consistently finds itself at the center of the conversation in technical, business and political communities.</p>
<p>In this post, we will explore how to build a simple social app that allows users to share posts, like Twitter.  We will use <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/">Django</a>, a popular Python web framework that includes an ORM and templating system.  Unlike Twitter, our application will include post visibility control.  We will implement this access control using oso, an open source policy engine that is embedded in your application.  The <a href="https://pypi.org/project/django-oso/">django-oso</a> package makes it possible to use oso in a Django app with little configuration.</p>
<p>This tutorial will walk through:</p>
<ul>
<li>Starting a Django project</li>
<li>Creating a custom User model</li>
<li>Creating Django models and views to list and create posts</li>
<li>Adding oso to our Django app to implement public &amp; private posts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The tutorial is self-contained, but if you prefer, you can follow along in the <a href="https://github.com/osohq/oso-social-django">github repo</a>.</p>
<h2>Starting our project</h2>
<p>To get started, we will need Python 3 (at least 3.6) installed.  Let's start a new directory for our project, and create and activate a virtual environment.</p>
<pre><code>$ mkdir oso-social
$ cd oso-social
$ python -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's install <code>django</code> &amp; <code>django-oso</code> in our virtual environment.</p>
<pre><code>$ pip install django
$ pip install django-oso
</code></pre>

<p>Django includes the <code>django-admin</code> tool which has commands for scaffolding django apps &amp; developing them.  We will use it to start a new project:</p>
<pre><code>$ django-admin startproject oso_social
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new <code>oso_social</code> directory within our top level directory:</p>
<pre><code>ls -l oso_social
total 392
-rwxr-xr-x   1 dhatch  staff     666 Sep  3 16:14 manage.py
drwxr-xr-x   8 dhatch  staff     256 Sep  3 17:55 oso_social
</code></pre>

<pre><code>ls -l oso_social/oso_social
total 32
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff     0 Sep  3 16:14 __init__.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff   397 Sep  3 16:14 asgi.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff  3219 Sep  3 17:55 settings.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff   798 Sep  3 16:44 urls.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff   397 Sep  3 16:14 wsgi.py
</code></pre>

<p>Every Django project is organized into multiple apps.  Apps are Python modules that are reusable across projects.  The <code>oso_social/oso_social</code> module is the project module, which includes settings &amp; configuration for our <code>oso_social</code> project.</p>
<p>Let's create an app now to contain our database models and views.  In the <code>oso_social</code> directory:</p>
<pre><code>$ cd oso_social
$ ./manage.py startapp social
</code></pre>

<pre><code>ls -l social
total 56
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff     0 Sep  3 16:14 __init__.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff   206 Sep  3 16:33 admin.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff    87 Sep  3 16:14 apps.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff   638 Sep  3 17:46 models.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff    60 Sep  3 16:14 tests.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff   394 Sep  3 17:52 urls.py
-rw-r--r--  1 dhatch  staff  1312 Sep  3 17:59 views.py
</code></pre>

<p>We just used the <code>manage.py</code> utility, which does the same thing as django-admin, but is aware of the project settings.  This allows it to perform project specific tasks, like database operations.</p>
<p>To finish setting up our <code>social</code> app we need to add it to the settings file to make Django aware of it. In <code>oso_social/oso_social/settings.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code># Search for this setting in the file, and add 'social'.
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # ... existing entires ...
    'social',
]
</code></pre>

<h2>Creating our User model</h2>
<p>First we are going to create a User model to represent users in our app.  This model will be used to store User information in our database.  Django has a built-in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/auth/default/">authorization system</a> that handles things like password management, login, logout, and user sessions.  A custom User model provides flexibility to add attributes later to our User.</p>
<p>Let's create one in our <code>oso_social/social/models.py</code> file.  Use the following contents:</p>
<pre><code>from django.db import models

from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser

class User(AbstractUser):
    pass
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>django.contrib.auth</code> built-in app provides authentication for Django projects.  We will use it to jumpstart our authentication setup.  To create a custom user model, we simply inherit from <code>AbstractUser</code>.  We haven't defined any custom fields, so the class body is empty.</p>
<p>Next, we'll add an entry to our settings file in <code>oso_social/oso_social/settings.py</code>.  The settings file configures the Django projects and apps within it.  It is a standard Python file, where each configuration entry is stored as a global variable.  We will add the following line:</p>
<pre><code>AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'social.User'
</code></pre>

<p>This indicates to the <code>django.contrib.auth</code> app to use the <code>User</code> model from the <code>social</code> app for authentication.</p>
<p>Finally, we will create a <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/migrations/">database migration</a>.  Django's built in database migration tool keeps your database schema in sync with the models used in your app.  To make a migration, run:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./manage.py makemigrations social
</code></pre>

<p>This will create <code>oso_social/social/migrations/0001_initial.py</code>.  Now, apply this migration to our database (since we haven't customized our database settings it is a SQLite database by default).</p>
<pre><code>$ ./manage.py migrate
</code></pre>

<h2>Logging in</h2>
<p>Now, let's make sure we have set up our authentication properly and can login.  We haven't built any views yet, but we can use the built-in <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/contrib/admin/">Django admin</a> interface to test out our authorization.</p>
<p>First, add our custom User model to the admin site in <code>oso_social/social/admin.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code>from django.contrib import admin
from django.contrib.auth.admin import UserAdmin

from .models import User

# Register your models here.
admin.site.register(User, UserAdmin)
</code></pre>

<p>Then, create a super user using the <code>manage.py</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./manage.py createsuperuser
</code></pre>

<p>This will prompt you for user credentials, which you will then use to login to the admin site.</p>
<p>Let's start our app:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./manage.py runserver
</code></pre>

<p>And visit http://localhost:8000/admin. From here, we can login and access the admin interface.</p>
<p><img alt="Building%20a%20Django%20app%20with%20data%20access%20controls%20in%204b3da60512dd49e58b9f8e0cbdfbba6d/Screen_Shot_2020-09-10_at_4.14.59_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/django-twitter-clone/Building%20a%20Django%20app%20with%20data%20access%20controls%20in%204b3da60512dd49e58b9f8e0cbdfbba6d/Screen_Shot_2020-09-10_at_4.14.59_PM.png"></p>
<h2>Creating our Post model</h2>
<p>Now that we've setup our login, let's start building the post functionality.  Our app will allow users to create new posts, and view a feed of posts.  To support this, we will create a Post model that stores the post information in our database.</p>
<p>In <code>oso_social/social/models.py</code>, create a <code>Post</code> model below the <code>User</code> model:</p>
<pre><code>class Post(models.Model):
    ACCESS_PUBLIC = 0
    ACCESS_PRIVATE = 1
    ACCESS_LEVEL_CHOICES = [
        (ACCESS_PUBLIC, 'Public'),
        (ACCESS_PRIVATE, 'Private'),
    ]

    contents = models.CharField(max_length=140)

    access_level = models.IntegerField(choices=ACCESS_LEVEL_CHOICES, default=ACCESS_PUBLIC)

    created_by = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
</code></pre>

<p>This defines a model class called <code>Post</code> with four fields: <code>contents</code>, <code>access_level</code>, <code>created_at</code> and <code>created_by</code>.  The <code>contents</code> field will store the message submitted by the user, while <code>created_at</code> &amp; <code>created_by</code> store post metadata.  We will use <code>access_level</code> later to implement post visibility with oso.</p>
<p>Save this file, and create a migration to make the table to store the <code>Post</code> model in our database:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./manage.py makemigrations social
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>makemigrations</code> command will check the models against existing migrations and create new migration scripts as needed.  Most types of database changes are auto-detected. Apply this migration as we did before with the <code>migrate</code> command.</p>
<p>Now, we've made our <code>Post</code> model. Let's check that things are working as intended.  Instead of making a view, we will use the admin interface to create some posts.  Register the Post with the admin interface by adding the following to <code>oso_social/social/admin.py</code>:</p>
<pre><code># Add Post import (in addition to User)
from .models import User, Post

# ...
admin.site.register(Post)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, we can visit the admin site at: <a href="http://localhost:8000/admin/">http://localhost:8000/admin/</a>.  The Post model is available, let's use the admin interface to create a post.  Click on <strong>Posts</strong>, then <strong>Add Post</strong> in the upper right.</p>
<p><img alt="Building%20a%20Django%20app%20with%20data%20access%20controls%20in%204b3da60512dd49e58b9f8e0cbdfbba6d/Screen_Shot_2020-09-08_at_12.38.05_PM.png" src="https://images.osohq.com/django-twitter-clone/Building%20a%20Django%20app%20with%20data%20access%20controls%20in%204b3da60512dd49e58b9f8e0cbdfbba6d/Screen_Shot_2020-09-08_at_12.38.05_PM.png"></p>
<p>Fill out the form as we did above, and save the new Post.  This example illustrates the power of the Django admin interface.  With no custom code, we were able to test out our model and interact with it!</p>

<p>Ok, enough time in the admin interface.  Let's move on with creating the feed view that users will use.  Every page in a Django web app has an associated <strong>view.</strong>  When a user visits a particular URL, the view function is responsible for handling the request and producing a response.  Let's write a simple view to display Posts.</p>
<p>In <code>oso_social/social/views.py</code>, write the following code:</p>
<pre><code>from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import HttpResponse

from .models import Post

def list_posts(request):
    # Limit to 10 latest posts
    posts = Post.objects.all().order_by('-created_at')[:10]

    posts_text = ""

    for post in posts:
        posts_text += f"@{post.created_by} {post.contents}"

    return HttpResponse(posts_text)
</code></pre>

<p><code>list_posts</code> is our view function.  It first uses the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/ref/models/querysets/">Django QuerySet API</a> and our <code>Post</code> model to get the first 10 posts from the database, ordered by latest post first.  Then, we produce a string to respond with using Python format strings.  Finally, we return an <code>HttpResponse</code> containing the <code>posts_text</code>.</p>
<p>We wrote our view function, but we aren't done yet! We still have to tell Django when to call it.  Django uses <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/http/urls/#example">URLconf</a> modules for this purpose.  Open <code>oso_social/oso_social/urls.py</code> in your editor. This is the root URLconf.  It specifies what view functions are run when a request is made for a particular URL.  Right now, you will see the url pattern: <code>path('admin/', admin.site.urls)</code> which drives the admin site.  Let's add one more pattern:</p>
<pre><code># Add include import
from django.urls import path, include

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('', include('social.urls'))
]
</code></pre>

<p>This tells Django to use the <code>oso_social/social/urls.py</code> file to resolve any urls that do not …</p></div></div></div>

<p>The sky is clear, the breeze is strong. A perfect day to make the long sea voyage to Mythyn. You prepare your galley, hire a crew of sailors, and cast off.</p>

<p>But a few hours into your trip, the dreaded words appear: “Thou seest rippling waters…”</p>

<p>Sea serpent? Giant squid? Something’s out there, and it’s headed your way.</p>

<p>So it goes in “Thieves’ Guild,” a unique <span>BBS </span>door game for the Atari <span>ST.</span></p>

<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/456419073" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>For me, the quest to play Thieves’ Guild properly has been my own 7-year voyage, something akin to Captain Ahab chasing the whale.</p>

<p>Though Thieves’ Guild debuted for Atari ST <span>BBS</span>es in the early 1990s, I didn’t learn of its existence until 2013, which means this post will be unlike previous installments of my <a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/category/door-game-memories/">“door game memories”</a> series.</p>

<p>I came across Thieves’ Guild as I was researching <a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/2020/09/09/a-different-way-to-play-front-ends/">graphical front-end clients for <span>BBS </span>games</a>. I was astonished to find that someone had created one on the Atari <span>ST, </span>my favorite computer platform, and I quickly became obsessed with finding a way to play it. If you’re so inclined, you can read about my <a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/2014/11/12/hatari-lantronix-and-cosmosex-my-quixotic-quest-to-play-thieves-guild/">quixotic quest to run the TG front-end client</a> years ago.</p>

<p>In the years since, I’ve made many attempts to play the game, most of which fizzled out. But today, finally, I can say that I have completed it!</p>

<p>So let’s talk about what makes it unique, what I enjoyed, and what was tedious — but with the obvious caveat that I played this game 30 years after its heyday.</p>

<div id="attachment_1604"><p><a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tg_title2.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1604" src="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/tg_title2.gif" alt="" width="600" height="345"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1604">This animated <span>GIF </span>shows the title screen for the Thieves’ Guild Emulator for the Atari <span>ST.</span></p></div>

<h2>The game</h2>

<p>Paul Witte wrote Thieves’ Guild beginning around 1988, using <a href="https://archive.org/details/OSSPersonalPascal">Personal Pascal</a> for the Atari <span>ST.</span></p>

<p>Initially Witte hosted the game on his <span>BBS,</span> Dark Fortress, where friends and acquaintances in Utah play-tested it and gave him feedback. He released it as shareware in 1993, and sold about 100 registered copies to sysops.</p>

<p>But that wasn’t all — Witte and his primary collaborator Herb Flower, also released a <a href="http://breakintochat.com/files/doors/Mythyn/thieves-guild/distributions/TG_EMUL.ZIP">graphical front-end</a> for Thieves’ Guild in 1993.</p>




<p>Flower, a talented pixel artist, drew dozens of backgrounds and animated sprites for the front-end, such as the three temple images above. He also created a detailed paper map of the game world, which they sold to users.</p>

<p>Myron Crandall, another collaborator, later ported the game to Turbo Pascal on the <span>PC.</span> While <a href="https://github.com/Kirkman/mythyn-archive/tree/master/thieves-guild/pc">a PC version</a> seems to have been completed in 1995, it appears to have been used on only one <span>BBS, </span>and was never publicly released.</p>

<h2>The setting</h2>

<p>Thieves’ Guild has many of the trappings of other text-based <span>BBS </span>role-playing games set in medieval times such as Legend of the Red Dragon or Assassin. Like Assassin, it uses deliberately archaic language to make you feel like you’re in another time. Like LoRD, you must face a dragon at the end of the game.</p>

<p>On its face, the game seems simple: You are a thief and you want to increase your skill and steal as much loot as you can. But there’s a lot more.</p>




<p>TG is in fact a <a href="https://breakintochat.com/wiki/Category:Meta-BBS">meta-BBS game</a>. Its hefty 1,500-word backstory establishes the premise that your player character is a <span>BBS</span>er who one day is sucked through a vortex into another world. You land on Rogues’ Isle where you are recruited by the Master Thief, who assures you there must be a portal back to Earth. To find it, you will have to solve many quests and navigate mazes, in addition to fighting and stealing from almost everyone around. Once any player on the <span>BBS </span>successfully resolves the final quest and goes through the portal, the game will reset, and that player’s name will be added to the “Masters of Riddles” screen to memorialize the achievement.</p>

<p>You begin on the Rogues’ Isle, which is just one small part of a large world of interconnected towns. You travel between them by boat or by horse. Each town has the staple locations you’d expect — tavern, inn, jail — but most towns have also have one unique location such as the Temple of Balor, the Torture Chamber, or the Silver Pyramids.</p>

<div id="attachment_1577"><p><a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thieves-guild-map.jpg"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1577" src="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thieves-guild-map-1024x778.jpg" alt="" width="625" height="475" srcset="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thieves-guild-map-1024x778.jpg 1024w, https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thieves-guild-map-300x228.jpg 300w, https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thieves-guild-map-768x584.jpg 768w, https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thieves-guild-map-1536x1167.jpg 1536w, https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thieves-guild-map-624x474.jpg 624w, https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/thieves-guild-map.jpg 1592w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1577">Herb Flower created drew this world map for Thieves’ Guild. He and Paul Witte sold paper copies of it to players of the game.</p></div>

<p>The world is complex enough that Flower drew an extremely detailed paper map showing all the locations, with illustrations that offer hints toward solving the quests. Witte sold copies of this map directly to users, and advertised its existence within the game. It’s very much like an Infocom “feelie” that adds to the depth of the game. I have a low-resolution scan of the map, and I found it essential when I was playing. Without it, mapping the game world on my own would have taken an enormous amount of time (more on why later).</p>

<h2>Getting hooked</h2>

<p>The thing that makes TG special among <span>BBS </span>games is its graphical front-end (which they called the “Thieves Guild Emulator”). When you play in a traditional <span>ASCII, ANSI, </span>or VT-52 terminal, the game looks much like any other text-based <span>BBS </span>game. But if you install and run the graphical front-end, the experience is greatly enhanced.</p>

<p>First, you hear a voice say “Welcome to Thieves’ Guild.” Then you see the title screen. It’s fantastic, animated pixel art. A torch flickers, mounted to a gray wall covered with detailed glyphs of skulls, ankhs, mermaids, wolves, and other things. The flames of the torch burn a slowly-expanding hole in the parchment “Thieves’ Guild” banner across the top. The text of the credits dissolve and reform as Old English runes. This opening screen, so full of small thoughtful details, made a huge first impression on me. I had never seen such well-drawn pixel art in any other <span>BBS</span>-related project or front-end client.</p>

<p>What do I mean by a “front-end client?” <a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/2020/09/09/a-different-way-to-play-front-ends/">I wrote about this at length last week</a>, but in brief: It’s an enhanced terminal program designed to work with one specific <span>BBS </span>game. Normal terminal programs would render only text and symbols on an 80-character, 25-line screen. But some <span>BBS </span>game authors wanted to offer an experience more like a video game with detailed pixel graphics, animation, or sound. Their solution was to develop their own custom terminal programs that could display such graphics when they received special codes from a specific game. And that’s exactly what the “Thieves Guild Emulator” does.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/456419066" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Keep in mind that most <span>BBS </span>games were pet projects of individual programmers. Often they were middle-aged men with regular jobs and families, coding during stolen hours at night. Sometimes they were teenagers, teaching themselves how to program by writing the game. But seldom were these programmers also skilled pixel artists.</p>

<p>That’s why the title screen of the TG front-end client captivated me. I hadn’t seen anything like it among other <span>BBS </span>games. It spurred me to keep going over the years to find, first, a way to use the TG front-end client successfully; and second, to play a sustained game where I didn’t die if I had to stop playing for a while.</p>

<div id="attachment_1361"><p><a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/thieves-guild-comparison.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1361" src="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/thieves-guild-comparison-1024x315.png" alt="" width="625" height="192" srcset="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/thieves-guild-comparison-1024x315.png 1024w, https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/thieves-guild-comparison-300x92.png 300w, https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/thieves-guild-comparison-768x236.png 768w, https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/thieves-guild-comparison-624x192.png 624w, https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/thieves-guild-comparison.png 1300w" sizes="(max-width: 625px) 100vw, 625px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1361">This side-by-side comparison shows the title screen for Thieves’ Guild as seen in an Atari ST VT-52 terminal (left) versus the graphical Thieves’ Guild front-end client (right).</p></div>

<h2>The front-end</h2>

<p>What is it like to play TG in the TG front-end client? For a modern-day user, it is both delightful and a little bit of a let-down.</p>

<p>This client was designed to overcome limitations of the Atari <span>ST.</span> The <span>ST’</span>s 80-column mode can display only four colors. In the front-end client, most menus are displayed in this 80-column text mode. But when the front-end wants to display an image, it will change to low resolution in order to use 16 colors. Consequently, any text that appears on screen with an image will use the Atari <span>ST’</span>s wider 40-column font.</p>

<p>Each location in the game gets its own small 160×100 image, on top of which sprites might be placed. These images are customized from town to town, depending on conditions in the game. For example, if it’s midnight in the town square, the front-end client will adjust the color palette of the image to make the image look like night time.</p>

<div id="attachment_1632"><p><a href="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/town-day-night.gif"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1632" src="https://breakintochat.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/town-day-night.gif" alt="" width="720" height="480"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-1632">This animated <span>GIF </span>shows how the Thieves’ Guild front end simulates night time in a town by by adjusting the color palette of the background image. The daytime frame shows a “large elf” sprite; the nighttime frame shows a “young guard” sprite as well as animated rain drops.</p></div>

<p>If it’s raining in the town, then you will see animated white pixels move across the scene. The sea coast images have little tree sprites that are positioned differently from town to town. If a storm is coming, the sky will fill with clouds, and they will gradually darken.</p>

<p>Wind is important in Thieves’ Guild, as it determines whether you can sail, and how successful your sea journey might be. The various wind speeds are reflected in the movement of rain or snow.</p>

<p>Gameplay and menus remain text-based, exactly the same as they would be in a normal terminal. You press “3” to enter a tavern, for example. When fighting an opponent, you press a number between 1-6 to choose what type of attack to make, then press a letter corresponding to a part of the body to target.</p>

<p>In the front-end, though, when an event takes place or you encounter a person or monster, the front-end will switch to low resolution and display an image with a sprite on the top half of the screen. The bottom half is reserved for text. Each <span>NPC’</span>s sprite has a few frames of simple animation. The sprites are not controllable and do not walk or fly across the screen — this is still a turn-by-turn <span>BBS </span>adventure, not a video game.</p>

<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/456418954" width="625" height="352" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Combat is where sound and animation get the most immersive. As you fight, there are animations for when you hit hit an opponent, when they take attack you, when they fall to the ground, and for when they are killed. I have commented before about the death animation: it’s a short, vivid animation of the character disintegrating into a bloody pulp (or a pile of bones). Each character has a unique sound effect. For example, wizards yell the incantation “Ful nox or!” when attacking; some characters scream “Please, …</p></div></div>

September 15, 2020 | https://christopher-russo.github.io/sep-dashboard-launch/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://christopher-russo.github.io/sep-dashboard-launch/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Today, I launched the <a href="https://christopher-russo.github.io/dashboard/sep/">Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) Dashboard</a>. Its purpose is to better communicate the economic projections of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), the body which sets monetary policy for the United States. The dashboard is free to access, with the intention of helping the public make better-informed economic decisions. In this post, I provide additional guidance on understanding these data and projections.</p>

<p>The FOMC regularly prepares and releases these projections as part of their public communications strategy. Each FOMC participant submits their projections for inflation, unemployment, GDP growth, and the federal funds rate. These projections are their individual assessments of how the economy will evolve under appropriate monetary policy. In my experience, participants take great care in compiling their submissions. Underlying these submissions are weeks of work by research staffs around the Federal Reserve System. For each economic variable, I show the median projection of FOMC participants. I also show two measures of disagreement: range and central tendency. Finally, I contextualize these projections using historical data.</p>

<p>In addition to projecting the next few years, participants provide â€œlonger-runâ€� projections. These values represent the policymakerâ€™s belief about where the economy would ideally converge over time in the absence of further disruption. For illustration purposes, I assume that these â€œlonger-runâ€� values are attained within about five years. In practice, we may arrive at these longer-run figures sooner, later, or not at all.</p>

<p>Policymakers submit projections for five economic variables.</p>

<p><strong>PCE Inflation:</strong> The Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index is the Federal Reserveâ€™s preferred price measure. It measures the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers in the United States. The Fed has a price stability mandate from Congress and, under its interpretation of this mandate, the Fed targets a 2 percent annual increase in this index.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The inflation rate over the longer run is primarily determined by monetary policy, and hence the Committee has the ability to specify a longer-run goal for inflation. The Committee reaffirms its judgment that inflation at the rate of 2 percent, as measured by the annual change in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, is most consistent over the longer run with the Federal Reserveâ€™s statutory mandate.<a href="#note1">[1]</a><a name="back1"></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of writing, PCE inflation has generally run below 2 percent since the adoption of this target in January 2012. Still, policymakers have regularly emphasized that 2 percent is an intended average and not a cap. If policymakers are successful under their recently-adopted policy of Average-Inflation Targeting, PCE inflation will first overshoot before returning to 2 percent.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Committee seeks to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, and therefore judges that, following periods where inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.<a href="#note2">[2]</a><a name="back2"></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So far, policymakers have been intentionally ambiguous about how high they intend to let inflation run, as well as for how long. As recently explained by FOMC Chairman Powell,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In seeking to achieve inflation that averages 2 percent over time, we are not tying ourselves to a particular mathematical formula that defines the averageâ€¦ Our decisions about appropriate monetary policy will continue to reflect a broad array of considerations and will not be dictated by any formula.<a href="#note3">[3]</a><a name="back3"></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As a result, I have omitted the â€œlonger-runâ€� projections for PCE inflation. Consistent with their consensus target, all participants have a longer-run projection of 2 percent.</p>

<p><strong>Core PCE Inflation:</strong> The Personal Consumption Expenditures Excluding Food and Energy (PCEXFE) price index ignores the volatility in food and energy prices. Policymakers generally use changes in PCEXFE, or so-called â€œcoreâ€� inflation, to better understand inflation trends. FOMC participants do not submit a longer-run projection for core PCE inflation.</p>

<p><strong>Unemployment Rate:</strong> The Unemployment Rate (also called U-3) measures the number of people without a job who are actively looking and available for work, as a percentage of the labor force. Although the Fed has a maximum employment mandate from Congress, the Fed does not specify a fixed target for U-3. While U-3 is informative, policymakers consider a range of indicators.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The maximum level of employment is a broad-based and inclusive goal that is not directly measurable and changes over time owing largely to nonmonetary factors that affect the structure and dynamics of the labor market. Consequently, it would not be appropriate to specify a fixed goal for employment; rather, the Committeeâ€™s policy decisions must be informed by assessments of the shortfalls of employment from its maximum level, recognizing that such assessments are necessarily uncertain and subject to revision. The Committee considers a wide range of indicators in making these assessments.<a href="#note4">[4]</a><a name="back4"></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Real GDP Growth:</strong> Real GDP is a comprehensive measure of U.S. economy activity. It measures the value of goods and services in the United States after accounting for changes in prices. This adjustment allows for comparisons between different periods. Real GDP is closely tied to the income of houses and firms in the United States, and hence growth in real GDP is a key economic indicator.</p>

<p><strong>Federal Funds Rate:</strong> The fed funds rate is the rate at which banks borrow from each other overnight. Under current policy, this rate is closely tied to the interest rate the Fed pays eligible banks on their reserve deposits held at the Fed.</p>

<p>The fed funds rate is the Fedâ€™s primary tool for monetary policy. Raising (lowering) the fed funds rate tends to raise (lower) other dollar-denominated interest rates. This includes interest rates on Treasury securities, repurchase agreements, mortgages, auto loans, and consumer savings. Using this transmission, the Fed adjusts the fed funds rate to expand or contract credit in the economy, thereby stimulating or constraining growth in economic activity.</p>

<p>We all know the story. Some of us have even lived it. Forgotten, overshadowed, and pushed aside. Being the middle child was the worst. The oldest sibling received all the accolades and rewards, the youngest received all the attention. And there we were, waving our hands in the air trying to say, “Hey! I’m right here and I’m not like them!” And here we are, still waving our hands, still trying to push our way past the shoulders of our surrounding siblings. A little older, a little wiser, but still just as frustrated. Being a 90’s kid is tough.</p>


<p>“<em>Damn Millennials</em>.” Many times have these words been uttered through the lips of baby boomers and Gen X’s. “All they care about is social media! They don’t know how to work hard!” We hear it. And we take it. But it’s a load of bulls**t. Sorry, I’m getting ahead of myself. Let’s go back. The definition of a Millennial is someone who was born between around 1980 and around the early 2000’s. While the characteristics of a Millennial can vary depending on the source, the gist is relatively the same. Lazy, narcissistic, coddled, materialistic, disengaged. Positive isn’t it? However in reality, the term “Millennial” isn’t as generalizable as many make it out to be.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.partyfeverltd.co.uk/media/catalog/category/Disco-section.jpg?resize=500%2C200" alt="" width="500" height="200" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.partyfeverltd.co.uk/media/catalog/category/Disco-section.jpg?resize=500%2C200&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></p>
<p>People born in the 1980’s are currently aged anywhere between 26 and 35 years old. Having been in the working world for around four or five years, this decade of people are usually seen as responsible employees and entrepreneurs, creating a name for themselves and making short work of corporate ladders all around the world (sounds like the eldest sibling doesn’t it?). Racking up accomplishments and higher salaries, they’re already integrated with Gen X and often aren’t thought of when someone mentions Millennials. People born in the latter half of the term “Millennial” are currently in the height of their teenage years, and because of their youth, are usually grouped in with the rest of the post-century birth crowd. This is where the stereotypes of being a Millennial stem from. But I’ll come back to that later. Right smack in the middle, as always, are 90s kids. Currently aged 16 to 25, we are forced to be grouped into this almost derogatory term, “Millennial”. However we couldn’t be more different than our two surrounding siblings.</p>

<p>I was born in 1994. A great year if I allow myself to say so. Nelson Mandela, Netscape, Rwanda massacre, World Trade Center Bombing…Kurt Cobain…O.J. Simpson… Okay so maybe it wasn’t that great of a year. My point though is that all this happened in one year. Look at what 90’s kids have been through over the course of their short lives: Y2K, 9/11, the dot com boom and bust, the Gulf War, the War in Afghanistan, and the War in Iraq, Apple’s rise to power, the Great Recession, the first black president, the legalization of gay marriage. And those are just a few off the top of my head. We’ve been left to solve the energy crisis and are the last generation that can reduce climate change and global warming before it’s too late. The world has changed immensely in the past 25 years. It’s led to one of the greatest qualities that 90’s kids possess. Nostalgia. And a whole lot of it. We grew up in a time that was almost entirely analog and the biggest fear was Y2K instead of war and the economy. We came of age in a time of great turmoil both domestic and abroad. We became adults in an entirely digital age and a slowly recovering economy. We are incredibly young, and yet possess the nostalgia of an old man.</p>

<p>We yearn for the simpler times, when the TV was turned on only after finishing family dinners and calling our friend’s home phone was the only way to reach them (other than AIM). And now I’m currently sitting in front of two computer screens as my phone sits within an arm’s reach dinging with updates of text messages, emails, and social media updates (perhaps this nostalgia is why hipsters came about). This dichotomy in ways of life leaves us 90’s kids wishing we were kids again. And that age was only 15 years ago! This isn’t a bad thing though. Growing up through all of this change has allowed us to adapt to all of the new tech and be very proficient with it. But we also see the value in writing a handwritten note to an employer after a job interview and enjoy relaxing with a good book. In a way, we are the most tech savvy analog people out there. Yes, I know what a tape deck is and watched VHS movies. I also owned a CD player. 90’s kids learned on Gateway computers but can do programming on any Mac book or PC no problem. I could go on and on but my point is that in our eyes, technology doesn’t seem to be advancing that fast. See, we grew up at the same time Apple did. At the same rate Google and Microsoft did. The pace of new technological advancements is about as routine as our birthday coming around every year. And it’s allowed us to be a pretty rare breed. Yes, we are different. But don’t you dare tell me I’m a Millennial.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, I believe the term Millennial comes from the stereotypes derived from the post-turn of the century kids. All these kids know is digital. This group of kids was seven years old when the first iPhone came out. Is it their fault? Not to me it isn’t. It’s the result of being thrust into a rapidly advancing, tech dependent world and having a cell phone in their hands since 1<sup>st</sup> grade (that’s not an exaggeration, see the link at the bottom**). Look, our society is convenience oriented. Everything is about what makes things easier and faster. Is it any surprise that it has rubbed off on the very kids that are in their peak of susceptibility? Call it lazy if you want, I call it the effects of their environment. And everything <em>is</em> faster and easier. My cell phone (or mini-computer, however you look at it) has the capability to do anything I want and more. It houses the ability to connect with anyone I know in about 30 different ways. It’s no wonder these kids live and breathe social media. When everyone is connected to everyone else at all times, it’s easy to want to keep attention on yourself (after all, they are the youngest sibling; attention is everything). Has it implanted an entitled “me, me, me” loop track in these kids heads? Gen X seems to think so. And I’m inclined to agree. This is what is scaring employers and causing feelings of regurgitation every time they encounter a so called Millennial.</p>

<p>Sure, call me bitter. I think all of us 90s kids are. We are sick of being grouped into all these <em>Millennials</em> stereotypes. <em>But it is not us</em>. I suppose it’s our fault we’re included in this. We’ve had our heads down, working hard to build a name for ourselves. Haven’t heard of us? Well you’re about to. We are the kids from the 90’s. And we’re about to step out from behind our siblings and shake up the world.</p>

But what does that mix look like? Is it working well for the team, or is it getting in the way of product development?</p><p data-baseweb="block">This article attempts to describe the "Ideal Sprint" or well, to put my thoughts down on what I've seen working well during my years as a software engineer and engineering manager.</p><h2 data-baseweb="block" id="characteristics-of-efficient-sprints">Characteristics of Efficient Sprints <a href="#characteristics-of-efficient-sprints"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p data-baseweb="block">When I think about what makes sprints efficient, my thoughts are usually around these goals:</p><ul><li data-baseweb="block"><strong>The team always works on the most important stories.</strong> The most important work item can be defined broadly, but it can be the features that provide the most value for the customer or eliminating the tech debt that slows the team down.</li><li data-baseweb="block"><strong>We have a healthy feedback culture on the team.</strong> Retrospectives are about discussing real problems and solutions for them.</li><li data-baseweb="block">The team has estimations to ensure that we have a rough idea of when given projects are shipping.</li><li data-baseweb="block">We have to ensure that there are no single points of failure on the team: multiple engineers should work on the same problems. This enables the team to work together: stories are not created for individuals, but for the group as a whole.</li></ul><h2 data-baseweb="block" id="the-framework">The framework <a href="#the-framework"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p data-baseweb="block">Let's start with a few rough definitions:</p><ul><li data-baseweb="block">The <strong>backlog</strong> is a semi-prioritized list of things that the team eventually wants to work on. Stories in the backlog may never get picked up, depending on priorities.</li><li data-baseweb="block"><strong>Stories</strong> are work items that never take more than a week to accomplish. The time limit on them is critical. It helps teams with story sizing.</li><li data-baseweb="block">During <strong>backlog refinement</strong> (or grooming), the whole team gets together to estimate stories using story points and prioritize the backlog taking the new stories and potentially shifting priorities into account.</li><li data-baseweb="block"><strong>Story points</strong> are abstract units for measuring complexity. During backlog refinement, story points are assigned to new stories.</li><li data-baseweb="block">The <strong>scrum master</strong> is the team member responsible for running the scrum meetings and helping unblock engineers on the team. The team can decide to rotate the scrum master every few sprints.</li><li data-baseweb="block"><strong>Velocity</strong> is the sum of the story points the team takes on and finishes in any given sprint.</li></ul><hr><p data-baseweb="block">Now that we got most of the definitions out of the way, let's take a look at what processes the team follows and the lifecycle of stories.</p><h3 data-baseweb="block" id="meetings-and-their-purpose">Meetings and their purpose <a href="#meetings-and-their-purpose"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3><h4 data-baseweb="block" id="backlog-refinement">Backlog refinement <a href="#backlog-refinement"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="14" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h4><p><span data-baseweb="tag"><span title="Frequency: once every two weeks">Frequency: once every two weeks</span></span><span data-baseweb="tag"><span title="Length: 30 mins">Length: 30 mins</span></span><span data-baseweb="tag"><span title="Owner: scrum master">Owner: scrum master</span></span></p><p data-baseweb="block">Every other week, the team has a backlog refinement session. <strong>The goal of this meeting is to estimate any new stories and change their order (priority) in the backlog.</strong> To get the most out of this session, the scrum master has to prepare: they need to know what stories will be estimated, and if the stories have enough context so the team can estimate them. If not, the scrum master has to ask for clarification before the meeting takes place. If by the time of the backlog refinement meeting there is not enough information to estimate a story, the team skips the story.</p><p data-baseweb="block">The estimation of a story may go something like this:</p><ol><li data-baseweb="block">The scrum master summarizes the story on hand in less than a minute and asks if anyone on the team has questions or can proceed to estimation.</li><li data-baseweb="block">If the team has questions, we first discuss them and ensure that everyone has the same understanding of the work item.</li><li data-baseweb="block">The group estimates the story by anonymously voting using tools like <a data-baseweb="link" href="https://hatjitsu.toolforge.org/" target="_blank">Hatjitsu</a> or <a data-baseweb="link" href="https://scrumpoker.online/" target="_blank">Scrum Poker</a>.</li><li data-baseweb="block">If there was a close to a unanimous vote, the scrum master picks the estimation and assigns it to the story.<ul><li data-baseweb="block"><em>Useful phrases: "Is everyone okay going with a 3?" or "Seems like an even split between 2 and 3, let's go with a 3."</em></li></ul></li><li data-baseweb="block">In case of a big spread, the scrum master asks the team who wants to speak up and reason why they thought the given story should be estimated the way they estimated it. After some discussion, the team re-estimates the story.<ul><li data-baseweb="block"><em>Useful phrases: "Who'd like to speak up and let us know why they voted the way they did?" or "Jane, as someone who worked on this feature recently, what are your thoughts?"</em></li></ul></li></ol><blockquote><p data-baseweb="block">When a team adopts estimation that never did it before, it may be helpful to think about story points as time estimations: one story point for one day of work should do. After a few sprints, the team can slowly move away from the time estimation and start trying to assign story points based on each story's complexity.</p></blockquote><h4 data-baseweb="block" id="retrospective-and-sprint-planning">Retrospective &amp; Sprint planning <a href="#retrospective-and-sprint-planning"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="14" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h4><p><span data-baseweb="tag"><span title="Frequency: once every two weeks">Frequency: once every two weeks</span></span><span data-baseweb="tag"><span title="Length: 60 mins">Length: 60 mins</span></span><span data-baseweb="tag"><span title="Owner: scrum master">Owner: scrum master</span></span></p><p data-baseweb="block">This meeting consists of two parts. The first part is a retrospective for the sprint the team is about to close and <strong>the goal of this part is to give kudos and discuss problems</strong>. The group spends the first few minutes highlighting what went well and what needs to be improved by collaborating on a shared document. After five minutes, or when folks stop typing, the scrum master starts going through the items, and the team briefly discusses them. One of the most important parts of this meeting is to discuss what needs to be improved and assigning clear owners of the action items.</p><p data-baseweb="block"><strong>The second part of this session is sprint planning, with the goal to understand the team's velocity, and what will be the main focus for the next sprint.</strong></p><p data-baseweb="block">You could follow an agenda similar to this:</p><ol><li data-baseweb="block">Go through the current sprint's open stories, and make sure they are up-to-date. Move the in progress and unstarted stories to the next sprint.</li><li data-baseweb="block">Take a look at holidays and planned vacations for the next two weeks. This both helps with capacity planning and ensures team members know when their peers will be out.</li><li data-baseweb="block">Agree on the targeted velocity for the next sprint by looking at past sprints and considering planned vacations.</li><li data-baseweb="block">If there are new stories that will need to be included in the next sprint, do a quick estimation session.</li><li data-baseweb="block">Discuss what the next sprint priorities should be and start pulling in stories. Decide if the stories spilled over from the previous sprint are still a high priority, or if they should be moved out. A key input for priorities should come from the prioritized backlog: a big chunk of the capacity should be filled in with stories from the top of the backlog.<ul><li data-baseweb="block"><em>Useful phrases: "It seems like we are close to our target velocity - did we miss anything important that we want to work on in the next sprint?"</em></li></ul></li></ol><blockquote><p data-baseweb="block">You can use this <a data-baseweb="link" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1myAewuUZLuJvcYyqr1R19QZEt3HPqsqVBY-RTHuRFIw/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">template to keep track of retros and sprint plannings</a>. The planning section is filled out during sprint planning, and the retro section is filled out during the Retrospective meeting in two weeks. So in practice, you'll edit two of these documents during this meeting, one for the past sprint, and one for the next one.</p></blockquote><h4 data-baseweb="block" id="standups">Standups <a href="#standups"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="14" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h4><p><span data-baseweb="tag"><span title="Frequency: twice every week">Frequency: twice every week</span></span><span data-baseweb="tag"><span title="Owner: scrum master">Owner: scrum master</span></span></p><p data-baseweb="block">As most of us have a slightly (or vastly) different schedule, daily standups can be challenging, especially if you are part of a globally distributed team. Instead of doing daily standups, I prefer doing standups twice a week, using Slack.</p><p data-baseweb="block">It has the following benefits:</p><ul><li data-baseweb="block">Standups provided through Slack are easier to consume and follow up on: using threads, we can have longer conversations without taking up time from the entire team.</li><li data-baseweb="block">In my experience, standups are more structured if provided through Slack. Every Tuesday and Thursday, a Slack bot can remind people to provide their standup using a template, reminding folks what should be included in their update.</li></ul><h4 data-baseweb="block" id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together <a href="#putting-it-all-together"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="14" height="14" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h4><p data-baseweb="block">I found it best to start sprints on Mondays and close them the next Friday. This way, calendar weeks directly maps to sprints, without any cognitive overhead (like starting sprints on Wednesday).</p><p data-baseweb="block">With this in mind, a calendar for a sprint for a scrum team may look like this:</p><p data-baseweb="block"><picture><source srcset="https://nemethgergely.com/webp/sprint-planning/team-calendar.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="https://nemethgergely.com/sprint-planning/team-calendar.png" type="image/png"><img src="https://nemethgergely.com/sprint-planning/team-calendar.png" alt="sprint calendar"></picture></p><h3 data-baseweb="block" id="the-lifecycle-of-a-story">The lifecycle of a story <a href="#the-lifecycle-of-a-story"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h3><p data-baseweb="block">Now that we covered the definitions and the meetings involved in efficient sprints let's also recap the lifecycle of stories.</p><p data-baseweb="block">Every story is created equal - we do not differentiate between bugs, feature work, or discovery (spike). They go through the same estimation and prioritization sessions. This way, the team can better plan each sprint the amount of work they can take on.</p><ol><li data-baseweb="block">The story/bug/spike is created and placed at the bottom of the backlog<ul><li data-baseweb="block">In case of bugs coming from customers/other teams, you probably want to set up a way to triage them more frequently, so they don't sit in the backlog for a week. This could be a rotating responsibility, as a support engineer role, or can be done by the scrum master.</li></ul></li><li data-baseweb="block">The team meets for backlog refinement and sprint planning to look at new items, estimate and prioritize them.</li><li data-baseweb="block">The story gets pulled into one of the next sprint (or will sit in the backlog for eternity).</li></ol><h2 data-baseweb="block" id="sprints-and-planning-cycles">Sprints &amp; planning cycles <a href="#sprints-and-planning-cycles"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="18" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a></h2><p data-baseweb="block"><strong>Okay, okay, but how does this process fit into quarterly/semi-annual planning cycles?</strong></p><p data-baseweb="block">Ideally, in your planning cycles, you set goals using <a data-baseweb="link" href="https://www.whatmatters.com/get-started/" target="_blank">OKRs</a>. These goals will be the primary inputs for your prioritization discussions during sprint planning and backlog refinement.</p><p data-baseweb="block"><strong>Another question that can also come up when following this framework is how the team will meet deadlines?</strong></p><p data-baseweb="block">Taking a look at the team's average velocity and summing up the estimations for stories required for a feature or release gives a relatively accurate picture of when a team can ship a feature. Estimations also empower the engineering team to help decide what parts could be cut to make a deadline.</p><p data-baseweb="block"><em>I realize that these answers barely scratch the surface, but they deserve an article of their own.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			
<p>Merriam Webster defines a <strong>system</strong> as a <strong>regularly interacting or interdependent group of items forming a unified whole</strong>.</p>



<p>Almost every aspect of product today exists in and is thought of as a system: design systems, UI patterns, React components, variables, constants, and inheritance in engineering — we could go on. At Ditto, we think text should also be thought of (and implemented!) as a system.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.dittowords.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/textasasystem-3-1024x595.png" alt="" width="512" height="298" srcset="https://blog.dittowords.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/textasasystem-3-1024x595.png 1024w, https://blog.dittowords.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/textasasystem-3-300x174.png 300w, https://blog.dittowords.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/textasasystem-3-768x446.png 768w, https://blog.dittowords.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/textasasystem-3-1536x893.png 1536w, https://blog.dittowords.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/textasasystem-3.png 1996w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"></figure></div>



<h4>Let’s take a step back. What is the purpose of a system?</h4>



<ul><li><strong>Systems make the relationships between individual items in a group explicit.</strong> Codifying implicit connections provides the space to be intentional and consistent about how things are related.</li><li><strong>Improving something in a system improves the entire system.</strong> Rather than one-off changes that exist in isolation, making changes to a system improves it as a whole.</li><li><strong>Systems help identify outliers. </strong>As things grow and scale, things don’t always fit into existing patterns. Systems help to identify outliers to your existing structure — and how to grow your system to fit new constraints.</li></ul>



<h4>Why should we also think about text as a system?</h4>



<p>When we think about text without an understanding of its reuse and context, improving it is like redetermining the font, size, and color each time a designer creates a new button.</p>



<p>So much of text — and specifically product copy — is written ad hoc. Why should that change?</p>



<ul><li><strong>Communication is context-driven. </strong>What does the end user already know? What do they expect? In design and engineering, these contexts are commonly codified as states — error states, progress states, etc. The mapping of these states to what a user sees (and reads!) provides consistency in a user experience.<br></li><li><strong>Text is inherently reused and interconnected. </strong>Over time, users build familiarity around a glossary of terms unique to your product. (I mean, what is a Facebook Wall or an Airbnb Experience or a Slack Channel but an understanding formed from repeat exposure?) But these individual terms don’t exist on their own — they function as building blocks that ladder up to entire sentences, content blocks, and paragraphs that get repeated when the user enters a similar context. <br>Text in product is also frequently interconnected, whether branching off from different translations, states, or variations of an A/B test.<br></li><li><strong>Product copy exists from end to end. </strong>The role of text in so many existing systems (design, product, i18n, legal, development) makes it all the more crucial that it’s managed in its own overarching system. Because most teams currently update copy manually, outdated copy is so often scattered across different places: docs, sheets, mockups, and codebases.<br></li><li><strong>Style guides (often) aren’t systems.</strong> Although style guides lay down a lot of groundwork in identifying the edges and boundaries, they have little control over how text (or design!) is actually carried out. They rely on the ability of individual contributors to remember and replicate, even as they get changed.</li></ul>



<h4>What does text as a system look like?</h4>



<p>Rethinking the process as it is today — a patchwork of copying/pasting between documents, spreadsheets, and designs — means no longer treating product copy as a series of one-offs. Thinking about text as a system informs how we build Ditto, especially in the absence of existing tooling for product text.</p>



<p>We’ve started to tackle this in a couple of ways:</p>



<ul><li><strong><a href="https://www.notion.so/dittov3/Components-in-Ditto-12a47b62afdf4a5298bea3da6605a519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Components</a> </strong>– Similar to design <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038662654-Get-started-with-Components" target="_blank">components</a>/<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.sketch.com/docs/symbols/" target="_blank">symbols</a>, text components in Ditto allow teams to build a reusable bank of text (and corresponding metadata) and sync copy across projects (and Figma files!).</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.loom.com/share/79c7ec66203844678f3ab7815d415bee" target="_blank"><strong>Blocks</strong></a> – Even independent of the design, product copy exists in groups and hierarchy — whether as headings, sections, lists, or more. To bring this text-based organization into Ditto, we’ve recently built the ability to drag and drop text into labeled groups (aka Blocks!).</li><li><strong>API / CLI</strong> – Bridging the gap from design to development has been top-of-mind since we first integrated with Figma. We’re currently in the process of beta testing our API (and corresponding CLI), which brings the latest copy directly to production files.</li></ul>



<p>We’ve just scratched the surface on what working with text as a system looks like! Communicating clearly and building great product are both immensely complex tasks, each with a lot of remaining pieces to improve and figure out. However, we think the first step is taking a big picture view and recognizing how the words across your product work together.</p>

<p>If you’re not living under a rock, then you’ve surely encountered the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfsVAYSMwsksjfpy8P2t_I52mugGeA5gR">Heroes of Deep Learning</a>, an inspiring, heterogeneous band of Deep Learning all-stars whose  sheer grit, determination, and—[dare we say?]—genius, catalyzed the earth-shaking revolution that has brought to market such technological marvels as DeepFakes, GPT-7, and Gary Marcus.</p>



<p>But these are <em>no ordinary times</em>. And as the world contends with a rampaging virus, incendiary wildfires, and smouldering social unrest, <em>no ordinary heroes </em>will suffice. However, you needn’t fear. Hope has returned to the Machine Learning Universe, and boy, oh boy the timing couldn’t be better.</p>



<p>As confirmed to us by several independent witnesses, the sun, moon, and stars have been joined in the night’s sky by new, supernatural, sights. After a months-long meticulous investigation, including consultations with NASA, MI6, and Singularity University, we can confirm the presence, on Earth, of <strong>the</strong> <strong>Superheroes of Deep Learning</strong>!</p>



<h2>Superheroes of Deep Learning</h2>



<p>Who are these superheroes, you ask? What makes them so <em>super</em>? Let’s get one thing clear. These ain’t your run-of-the-mill GPU jockeys. The Superheroes of Deep Learning physically manifest the marvels of AI through psychokinetic powers. <em>Can any obstacle stand in their way?</em></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://approximatelycorrect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/622x452xMOOC-1024x745.png.pagespeed.ic.B3kCPJjZ9r.png" alt="MOOC — Educator by day, vigilante by night." width="622" height="452" srcset="http://approximatelycorrect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MOOC-1024x745.png 1024w, http://approximatelycorrect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MOOC-300x218.png 300w, http://approximatelycorrect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MOOC-768x559.png 768w, http://approximatelycorrect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MOOC-1536x1117.png 1536w, http://approximatelycorrect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MOOC-2048x1489.png 2048w, http://approximatelycorrect.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MOOC-1200x873.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px"><figcaption>MOOC — Educator by day, vigilante by night.</figcaption></figure>



<p>With legions of students and quad-rotors at the ready, MOOC never goes into battle alone! Legend has it that in his last appearance on Earth, MOOC narrowly escaped an ambush by The Syndicate of Stanford Statisticians. With the dreaded Lasso constricting, MOOC was abruptly snatched from the jaws of defeat and carried to safety by a swarm of drones. Then, following his expert demonstrations, the drones acquired paranormal fighting skills via imitation learning. The Statistics Department has never recovered from the smashing defeat that followed!</p>

Need we say more?</figcaption></figure>



<p>A million data points isn’t cool. You know what’s cool? A billion data points. The superheroes of deep learning might seem powerful, but their powers only come to life when fueled by (st)reams of data. At one with the internet, Benchmark conjures epic datasets from thin air. Her powers can tip the scale in any battle.</p>

<p>You thought TPUs were fast? Better upgrade your drivers if you want to keep up with Q-silver! Warping the space-time continuum, he has acquired over 20 million lifetimes of experience. With such speed, he can even learn tabula rasa.</p>

<p>What cannot be solved by the power of convolution? If Captain Convolution continues at this pace, the answer may prove to be… “nothing!”. When he’s not taking supervillains to the mat or sliding his feature detectors across surveillance footage in search of ne’er-do-wells, The Captain enjoys rap battling vs. Ali Rahimi, convolving on the floor laughing, and feeling the learn.</p>

<p>Step out of the way, you low-dimensional nincompoops. If 0 dimensions can represent only a point, and 4 dimensions all of space time, just imagine what magic lives in higher-order realms. The Tensorial Professor travels these esoteric spaces with the ease of a native, and her famed <strong>tensor decomposition</strong>s will cut any villain down to size.</p>



<h2>Other Paranormal Sightings</h2>



<p>While the DL Superheroes have captured the lion’s share of public attention, they are far from the only supernatural beings to show up on the scene. We can confirm that at least three additional super-humans have been identified.</p>

<p>Don’t take your eye off of The Kernel for a split second or you might find yourself ripped off the ground and exploded into infinite-dimensional space. Some say the pain is even greater than tensor decomposition. With his powerful kernel machine in hand, can anyone stand in the way of Kernel Sch<span>ö</span><span></span>lkopf? Let’s hope he’s on our side.</p>

<p>While the DL superheroes’ arrival has been met by hordes of breathless fans and endless fawning on /r/machinelearning, not everyone is convinced that they’re on the side of justice. Wielding an arsenal of diagnostic probes and rocking a black belt in verbal jiu jitsu, Code Poet has convened the Algorithmic Justice League to hold the DL Superheroes to account. </p>

<p>Perhaps the DL Superheroes’ most vocal detractor, DAGman himself possesses extraordinary abilities. Rumor has it, he scaled The Ladder of Causation,  acquiring the ability to intervene on arbitrary facts in the world! But how can we verify these deeds if we can only ever observe just one … <em>potential outcome</em>?</p>

That’s why some organizations actually register nose prints to help identify individual dogs.</p><h3>There’s a Scientific Reason for That Cute Head Tilt</h3><p>It’s no surprise that dogs can hear a large range of frequencies — and part of that may be thanks to the way they move their heads to catch sounds.</p><p>If your dog tilts its head when you’re talking to it, it’s not just to be cute. It’s thought that <a href="https://www.rd.com/article/scientific-reason-dogs-tilt-heads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>dogs do this to adjust their pinnae</u></a>&nbsp;— that cute floppy or upright outer portion of the ear — so they can locate the source of a sound.</p><p>It’s also believed that dogs may reposition their heads when you’re talking to them so that they can better see your face, which helps them understand the emotion you’re conveying (more on that later).</p><h3>There’s a Reason Dachshunds Are So Small Yet So Mighty</h3><p>Among the <em>many</em>&nbsp;things we didn’t know about <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/things-you-didnt-know-about-the-dachshund/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Dachshunds is that they were bred to hunt badgers</u></a>. “Dachshund” is German for badger dog and their short legs keep them close to the ground where they can track smells while their narrow frames enable them to crawl into badger burrows.</p><h3>Weaker Taste Buds Explain a Lot</h3><p>Compared to their noses and ears, dogs are pretty underpowered in the taste department.</p><p><a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/lifestyle/can-dogs-taste/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Your dog has about one-sixth of the taste buds you have</u></a>, which makes it a lot easier to understand why they’re so quick to scarf down old food scraps, dirty puddle water, and other unsavory snacks if given any chance at all.</p><h3>Dogs Can Sense When You Have Bad Feelings About Someone</h3><p><a href="https://www.rd.com/list/dog-knows-about-you/"><u>Dogs are incredibly perceptive to body language</u></a>&nbsp;and their heightened senses mean they can hear small breathing changes and smell the pheromones you release. All of these senses enable them to pick up on subtle shifts that may happen when you feel uncomfortable around someone. So it might not be that your dog doesn’t like that weird neighbor you always avoid on walks —&nbsp;they can just tell that <em>you</em>&nbsp;don’t like them!</p><h3>Three Dogs Survived the Titanic Catastrophe</h3><p><a href="http://www.vetstreet.com/our-pet-experts/the-dogs-of-the-rms-titanic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Only three dogs survived the tragic sinking of the RMS Titanic</u></a>&nbsp;in 1912.

In one study, they were 88% accurate at sniffing out breast cancer and 99% accurate at detecting lung cancer.</p><h3>Yes, They Can Sense Fear — But in a Good Way</h3><p>Does your dog ever “check on you” after you hear a startlingly loud noise from outside? Do they seem to stay right on your heels when everyone is out and you’re the only one at home?</p><p>That’s because <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/dog-knows-about-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>dogs can sense “fear” in the form of adrenaline</u></a>&nbsp;that your body releases when you’re afraid or startled by something. They recognize this scent and stay close to you in order to comfort and protect a cherished member of their pack.</p><h3>Pooches Are Savvier Than Their Goofy Grins Let On</h3><p>And it’s not just their razor-sharp senses that dogs use to pick up on clues, they’re savvier than you think. Just like they can pick up on your body language to tell how you feel about someone, they can also use it to tell what you’re thinking to an extent. For example, in one study, <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/dog-knows-about-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>dogs were able to find hidden food</u></a>&nbsp;just by following their human’s gaze.</p><h3>They Can Read Human Facial Expressions</h3><p>In addition to reading body language, <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/dog-knows-about-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>dogs can also accurately unravel your emotional state</u></a>&nbsp;just by seeing your facial expressions. One study found that dogs can definitely tell when a face is sad — even in a photo.

Generally speaking, that makes <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/dog-facts-you-didnt-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>dogs about as smart as the average two-year-old</u></a>&nbsp;human.</p><h3>Dogs’ Noses Are Wet Thanks to a Special Mucus That Absorbs Chemicals</h3><p>That cold, wet dog nose is <a href="https://www.purina.co.uk/dogs/behaviour-and-training/understanding-dog-behaviours/amazing-dog-facts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>the result of special mucus dogs secrete</u></a>&nbsp;to absorb scent molecules and chemicals. When the dog licks its nose, it can then taste those particles to better understand what the smell is.</p><p>And for a bonus fact, it’s totally normal for a dog to have a warm and dry nose for a variety of reasons! <a href="https://www.hillspet.com/dog-care/healthcare/dry-dog-nose-concerns#:~:text=Most%20often%2C%20a%20dog's%20dry,of%20water%20from%20slight%20dehydration." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>What you should look out for is changes in the regular texture of their nose</u></a>&nbsp;or what it’s secreting.</p><h3>Dogs Are Great for Your Love Life!</h3><p>Nearly 70% of people report that they <a href="https://www.ctvsh.com/services/dogs/blog/23-amazing-facts-about-dogs-you-probably-didnt-know-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>wouldn’t date a person who didn’t like pets</u></a>. Can you blame them?</p><h3>A Wag Is Worth a Thousand Words</h3><p>You’ve probably wondered what your dog is thinking from time to time. If you learn to understand what they’re saying with their tail, you might get a little closer to figuring it out.</p><p><a href="https://www.rd.com/list/dog-facts-that-are-false/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>According to Jess Trimble</u></a>, a Doctor of Veterinary Medicine and chief veterinary officer for the online veterinary consultation company <a href="https://www.home.yourfuzzy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Fuzzy Pet Health</u></a>, a vigorous wag from side to side often means happiness, a slow wag with the tail held low may signify fear or insecurity, and a very high tail wagged quickly might show fear or even aggression.</p><h3>Dogs Experience Jealousy!</h3><p>Going along with the theory that dogs are about as mature as toddlers, it makes sense that <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/dog-facts-you-didnt-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>they experience jealousy</u></a>&nbsp;the same way young kinds might. You’re not imagining that your dog fights for your attention when you’re busy fawning over other animals — or that they’re extra suspicious about your smell when you come home from another household with pets.</p><h3>No Surprise — The US Has a Lot of Pet Pooches</h3><p>The United States has the highest population of pet dogs in the entire world. In fact, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2012/11/the-dog-economy-is-global-but-what-is-the-worlds-true-canine-capital/265155/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>there’s one pet pooch for every four Americans</u></a>! <a href="https://www.akc.org/expert-advice/news/labrador-retriever-most-popular-breed-29th-year-row/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Labs have been the most popular breed</u></a>&nbsp;among Americans for nearly 3 decades now.</p><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1250" height="698" src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors.jpg" alt="No Surprise — The US Has a Lot of Pet Pooches" srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors.jpg 1250w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors-1024x572.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors-768x429.jpg 768w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors-512x286.jpg 512w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors-60x34.jpg 60w" sizes="(max-width: 1250px) 100vw, 1250px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20width%3D%221250%22%20height%3D%22698%22%20viewBox%3D%220%200%201250%20698%22%3E%3Cfilter%20id%3D%22b%22%3E%3CfeGaussianBlur%20stdDeviation%3D%2212%22%20%2F%3E%3C%2Ffilter%3E%3Cpath%20fill%3D%22%23d0a232%22%20d%3D%22M0%200h1250v693H0z%22%2F%3E%3Cg%20filter%3D%22url(%23b)%22%20transform%3D%22translate(2.4%202.4)%20scale(4.88281)%22%20fill-opacity%3D%22.5%22%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23a76472%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22matrix(56.53058%205.30418%20-3.77804%2040.26531%20173%2062.3)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23ffd460%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22matrix(-2.5443%20-38.30636%2074.19082%20-4.92775%2062%2062.4)%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23cdb400%22%20cx%3D%2246%22%20cy%3D%22126%22%20rx%3D%2297%22%20ry%3D%2229%22%2F%3E%3Cellipse%20fill%3D%22%23d4bb00%22%20rx%3D%221%22%20ry%3D%221%22%20transform%3D%22rotate(168.1%2019.2%209)%20scale(67.51459%2022.10641)%22%2F%3E%3C%2Fg%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E" data-src="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors.jpg" data-srcset="https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors.jpg 1250w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors-300x168.jpg 300w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors-1024x572.jpg 1024w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors-768x429.jpg 768w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors-150x84.jpg 150w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors-512x286.jpg 512w, https://www.gethuan.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/05-HUAN-dog-facts-labradors-60x34.jpg 60w"></figure><h3>They Can See More Color Than We Think</h3><p>Contrary to a very common belief, dogs can actually see colors. However, since they only have one-tenth of the cones that humans have, they see those colors differently.</p><p><a href="https://petsdoc.org/through-the-eyes-of-your-dog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>Dogs are dichromatic</u></a>, which means they can see two color families — blue-violets and yellows. This makes them unable to clearly distinguish between green, yellow, orange, and red; much like color-blind humans. Instead of color, dogs use a variety of other cues (including smell, texture, brightness, etc.) along with superior night and motion vision to navigate the world around them.</p><h3>Dogs Understand Your Tone More Than Your Words</h3><p>Since dogs can’t really grasp the breadth of human language, they’ve developed ways to tie meaning to what they <em>can</em>&nbsp;understand — sound. The pitch, intonation, rhythm, and other <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/dog-facts-you-didnt-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>tones in your voice communicate more to your dog</u></a>&nbsp;than your actual words (and pure volume!) do a lot of the time. So, yelling commands at your dog might not be as effective as consistently using a stern tone for admonishment and an upbeat tone for praise. &nbsp;</p><h3>Petting a Dog Can Drop Your Blood Pressure — And Other Ways They’re Good for Your Health</h3><p>We already know that dogs are pretty great at detecting ailments, but did you know that just having one around can improve your overall health?</p><p>Studies have found that <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/benefits-having-pet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>older adults who own pets are 36% less likely to suffer from loneliness</u></a>, petting a dog can lower the “stress hormone” cortisol and increase the “happy hormone” oxytocin, lower heart rates, increase executive function, reduce the need for pain medication, and <a href="https://www.rd.com/list/dog-facts-you-didnt-know/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><u>lower your blood pressure by 10%</u></a>.</p><h2>And Now a Not-So-Fun Fact: A Microchip Isn’t Enough</h2><p>Our final fact is less of a fun-to-know and more of a need-to-know that <em>every</em>&nbsp;dog owner should be aware of: <a href="https://www.gethuan.com/can-you-track-your-dog-with-a-microchip/"><strong><u><strong>You cannot track your dog with a microchip</strong></u></strong><u>.</u></a>&nbsp;</p><p>Mi…</p></div></div></div>

I’ve added half again as many logos as well as updated many existing logos as new reference material has surfaced. I’ve put in quite a few hours, scouring for typefaces that may or may not exist, giving up and making things from scratch, and of course, finding that perfect reference to make something perfect. In the process, I’ve found lots of fun easter eggs, plenty of mistakes, and lots of friends who share the same love as I do of these particular logos and designs. I am so happy that I have been able to do as much as I have and I hope to continue in the coming year. Thanks to all of you who have supported me be it in materials submitted, advice, references, financial aid, linking, etc! I am very humbled by the community and will continue to try to support these as long as I can.</p><p>This is a personal project that I began working on once the Cyberpunk 2077 Gameplay reveal came out, remaking many of the assets that the game has to offer in terms of graphic design. Its diversity in styles makes it such a fantastic game to replicate and I hope that these will come in handy for anyone hoping to make their own custom assets along with any cosplayers, modelmakers, or printers who need these files to lend authenticity to their own work. I truly appreciate the amount of time and effort the team at CD Projekt Red and their designers/artists have put out towards making such a real and visceral world. I am very excited for the game and look forward to finding many more amazing examples of their fine handiwork!</p><p>If there is an asset you would like to see recreated from the game, trailer, or something else, <a href="https://www.valencygraphics.com/contact">please let me know</a>. My WIP list is at the end of this page, but subject to change as new logos are found. These logos are also subject to change due to the fact that I am working with low-res screenshots and odd angles when recreating the logos from reference, thus some proportions might be off, certain designs may be modified, or some fonts might be off completely. Just know that I tried my best and if anything, that’s just my extra “spin” on things for now. :)</p><p>Special thanks to Eli (<a href="https://twitter.com/hey_elium" target="_blank">@hey_elium</a>) for contributing a few of these logos as well as The Madqueen (<a href="https://twitter.com/MadqueenShow">@MadqueenShow</a>), herself! They are denoted by the *. Also thanks to <a href="https://www.twitter.com/coolpollution">@coolpollution</a> for reference materials! </p><p>Follow me on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/ValencyGraphics">twitter</a> for any updates to this page!</p></div><h3><strong>WARNING / LICENSING INFORMATION:</strong></h3><p><strong><em>These assets are not for redistribution or for commercial use and are owned by CD Projekt Red.</em> </strong><br>Unless express permission is obtained through CD Projekt Red for commercial usage, you will be subject to licensing laws in your country and possible legal action may be taken against you.

Taylor Swift Vs The World - Musical Copyright Issues in the World of Vexatious Litigants

It has been five years since the first litigant commenced proceedings against her and Swift is in Court again, defending herself over allegations of stolen lyrics.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The lyrics in question, 'the players gonna play, play, play, play, play and the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate'. These 16 words have been the cause of multiple million-dollar lawsuits. Judges have read these words in full earnest; law students will spend hours reading precedents using these words, and people have sung these words in their car when they were stuck at traffic lights. But is the fact that you wrote words similar to this enough to claim the profits of a song? A lot of hopeful plaintiffs seem to think so, and in the United States, the courts appear to entertain most notions of copyright infringement at least to a trial level, at which they are quickly dismissed.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In one matter the Judge used Swift's lyrics in their judgement stating that the Complainant had 'a blank space' in their documents and that 'merely pleading BandAids will not fix the bullet holes in his case'.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So it seems that the even the courts themselves are poking fun at the sheer ridiculousness of some cases but how did it get this way?</span></p><p><strong>Musical Copyright Infringement in the USA</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Musical copyright cases are not unheard-of in the United States. Since they invented a way to record music, there has been someone trying to sue over it. But this recent spate of high-value cases has resulted from one significant case… that of Blurred Lines.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Robin Thicke &amp; Pharrell Williams v Marvin Gaye was a pivotal case in further expanding the ways that an artist could claim copyright to music that they had written by allowing artists to claim copyright to the 'feel' of music. In this case, the estate of Marvin Gaye successfully argued that the song Blurred Lines had the vibe of a Marvin Gaye song. Long gone are the days of Vanilla Ice's intellectual property case where the number of beats in a bar of music were counted, now the 'vibe' is sufficient. This case was resolved with a $5 million settlement and 50% of the future royalties being awarded to the estate of Marvin Gay, and it led to the floodgates being opened and a significant amount of out-of-court settlements using this case as precedent.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Another significant c</span>ase was in 2019 regarding Katy Perry's song Dark Horse where a relatively unknown artist successfully sued for millions over a claim that her music had breached his copyright. It may be also worth pointing out that Katy Perry's legal representatives are in the process of appealing this ruling.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>But how will this affect Taylor Swift's matter?</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Firstly, Taylor Swift is no stranger to litigation. She settled over a dispute with the band Right Said Fred over an instrumental in one of her other songs. However, she refuses to settle in this matter. She has faced multiple cases over Shake It Off, with parties claiming (often at the same time) to be the source of the lyrics as mentioned above.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">She has argued that the lyrics are commonly used expressions that fall into the public domain, which refers to the concept that certain creative materials that are not protected by intellectual property laws. The public owns these works, not an individual author or artist. Anyone can use a public domain work without obtaining permission.</span></p><p><strong>Could this happen in Australia?</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Australia has already had several significant musical copyright cases result in extensive damages cases. With the most famous case being the Men at Work case,&nbsp;</span><em>Larrikin Music Publishing Pty Ltd&nbsp;</em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">v&nbsp;</span><em>EMI Songs Australia Pty Ltd&nbsp;</em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">[2010] FCA 29, which the Court ordered the songwriters hand over 5% of all the royalties for the song to the owners of the 'Kookaburra sits in the Old Gum Tree' music.  In this case, the courts looked at the amount of the infringing work and saw that 50% of&nbsp;</span><em>Kookaburra</em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;had been copied and this was found to be significant enough to infringe copyright.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In Australia, it is still essential that copyright infringement refers to the infringement on actual work rather than the look or feel of the artwork/artist.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>What's Next?</strong></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">As the Court refused Taylor Swift's motion for dismissal, this case will now have its day in Court, and we will have to wait to see what the Judge's ruling will be and also whether she releases an album about it as well.&nbsp;</span></p><br>

						<p><em>[Jaime Sevilla is a Computer Science PhD Student at the University of Aberdeen. In this guest post, he describes our recent forecasting work on quantum computing. – Jess Riedel]</em></p>
<p><strong>In Short:</strong> We attempt to forecast when quantum computers will be able to crack the common cryptographic scheme RSA2048, and develop a model that predicts less than 5% confidence that this capability will be reached before 2039. A preprint is available at <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.05045">arXiv:2009.05045</a>.</p>

<p><span>Advanced quantum computing comes with some new applications as well as a few risks, most notably </span><a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gYtQvHKYhqARKpcRw/assessing-the-impact-of-quantum-cryptanalysis"><span>threatening the foundations of modern online security</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>In light of the recent experimental crossing of the </span><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5"><span>“quantum supremacy” milestone</span></a><span>, it is of great interest to estimate when devices capable of attacking typical encrypted communication will be constructed, and whether the development of communication protocols that are </span><a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-quantum_cryptography"><span>secure against quantum computers</span></a><span> is progressing at an adequate pace.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Beyond its intrinsic interest, quantum computing is also fertile ground for quantified forecasting. Exercises on forecasting technological progress have generally been sparse — with </span><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733315001699"><span>some </span></a><a href="https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/"><span>notable</span></a> <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1548512919875523"><span>exceptions</span></a><span> — but it is of great importance: technological progress dictates a large part of human progress.</span></p>
<p><span>To date, most systematic predictions about development timelines for quantum computing have been based on expert surveys, in part because quantitative data about realistic architectures has been limited to a small number of idiosyncratic prototypes. However, in the last few years the number of device has been rapidly increasing and it is now possible to squint through the fog of research and make some tentative extrapolations. We emphasize that our quantitative model should be considered to at most augment, not replace, expert predictions.&nbsp; Indeed, as we discuss in our preprint, this early data is noisy, and we necessarily must make strong assumptions to say anything concrete.</span></p>
<p><span>Our first step was to compile an imperfect </span><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pwb4gf0FxlxgfVhtXTaqEGS9b7FwsstsJ0v7Zb1naQ0/edit#gid=0"><span>dataset of quantum computing devices</span></a><span> developed so far, spanning 2003-2020.&nbsp; This dataset is freely available, and we encourage others to build on it in the future as the data continues to roll in.</span></p>
<p><span>To quantify progress, we developed our own index – the generalized logical qubit – that combines two important metrics of performance for quantum computers: the number of physical qubits and the error rate for two-qubit gates. Roughly speaking, the generalized logical qubit is the number of noiseless qubits that could be simulated with quantum error correction using a given number of physical qubits with a given gate error.&nbsp; Importantly, the metric can be extended to fractional values, allowing us to consider contemporary systems that are unable to simulate even a single qubit noiselessly.</span></p>
<p><span>To forecast historical progress into the future, we focus on superconducting-qubit devices.&nbsp; We make our key assumption of exponential progress on the two main metrics and use statistical bootstrapping to build confidence intervals around when our index metric will cross the frontier where it will be able to threaten the popular cryptographic protocol RSA 2048.</span></p>
<p><span>Note that since we are modelling progress on each metric separately we are ignoring the interplay between the two metrics. But a simple statistical check shows that the metrics are likely negatively correlated within each system – that is, quantum computer designers face a trade off between increasing the number of qubits and the gate quality. Ignoring this coupling between the metrics results in an optimistic model.</span></p>

The 4100 threshold is where we estimate quantum computing will be able to solve the popular cryptographic scheme RSA-2048. Past recorded values of the metric are shown as purple icons on the graph.</p></div>

<hr>
<p><span>As a point of comparison, last year </span><a href="https://globalriskinstitute.org/publications/quantum-threat-timeline/"><span>Piani and Mosca</span></a><span> surveyed quantum computing experts and found that 22.7% think it is likely or highly likely that quantum computers will be able to crack RSA-2048 keys by 2030, and 50% think that is likely or highly likely that we will be able to crack RSA-2048 keys by 2035.</span></p>
<p><span>Will this be enough time to deploy adequate countermeasures? I discuss this in depth in </span><a href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gYtQvHKYhqARKpcRw/assessing-the-impact-of-quantum-cryptanalysis"><span>this other article about quantum cryptanalysis</span></a><span>. Given the current rate of progress on the standardization of quantum-resistant cryptography there seems to be little reason for concern (though it should be considered that </span><a href="https://aiimpacts.org/discontinuous-progress-in-history-an-update/"><span>the yearly base rate for discontinuous breakthroughs</span></a><span> for any given technology is about 0.1%).</span></p>

Also shown a summary of expert prediction on attack capabilities. As comparison, our statistical prediction assigns &lt;5% confidence to having quantum computing hardware capable of breaking RSA 2048 before 2039.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_70_576"><div><p>In this react hooks series, we have already explored the react hooks <a href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/react/react-hooks-and-local-storage-lets-build-a-todo-app/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">useState, useEffect</a>, and <a href="https://www.wisdomgeek.com/development/web-development/react/understanding-the-usereducer-hook-in-react/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">useReducer</a>. The next react hook we will look into is the useContext hook.</p><p>As we saw while building our sample application, we had to lift the state up to our root component in order to be able to share it among multiple children components. We then passed in the corresponding state objects to the children components as props to have shared state and a single source of truth at the parent level.</p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>This problem was initially solved by using third party libraries for state management such as Redux. But in React 16.3, the React team introduced an official context API.</p><h2>The React context API</h2><p>Now that context API is built directly into the react library, we can use this context API to avoid the problem of passing data down through multiple layers of components. The context API makes it possible to pass data through components without having the need to pass props down manually through every level of the component tree.</p><p>Thus context is useful when the same data is needed by many components at different levels of a React application. It is worth noting that it makes component reuse a bit more difficult, so it should be used sparingly.</p><p>Context lets you broadcast data and changes to that data to components that have subscribed to it.</p><h3>Context Object</h3><p>To start using the API, we need to create a context object:</p><pre><code>const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue);</code></pre><p>This object will be our source of values to components that subscribe to it. Whenever React is going to render a component that has subscribed to a context object, it will read it’s value from the nearest Provider above it in the tree.</p><h3>Context Provider</h3><p>Every context object comes with a Provider component which ,as the name suggests, provides the value of the context object to all children components. It also allows the consuming components to subscribe to changes in the context value. It can be declared as:</p><pre><code>&lt;MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}&gt;</code></pre><p>A provider can be connected to more than one consumers and providers can be nested as well. They might override values deeper in the tree, since the subscribers consume values from the nearest provider.</p><h3>The useContext react hook</h3><p>Now that we have a provider, we can start consuming the value that was assigned.</p><pre><code>const value = useContext(MyContext);</code></pre><p>Making use of the useContext hook, we subscribe to the context object and any changes that are made to it. The value that we receive from the useContext hook will always be equal to the value being passed from the nearest provider in the tree. If there is no provider above the component, the value will be equal to the default value that was passed to createContext().</p><p>All subscribers/consumers of a provider are re-rendered whenever the value prop of the provider is changed.</p><p>Now that we understand the context API, let us get into using it with hooks.</p><h2>Putting it all into place in our sample To-Do list application</h2><p>If you have not been following along our sample to-do list application, you can find the code that we have built <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/saranshkataria/todo-list-react-hooks-demo/tree/d2f2c98c1b9918eac8a909a3d8153497ff289156" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. We will now start hooking in the context API to pass the items using the context API instead of passing them as props from the App component. We will use the useContext hook for doing so, but we first need to create the context object.</p><p>So, we will create a new context folder and in it, we will add a items context file:</p><pre><code>import React from 'react';

const ItemsContext = React.createContext();

export { ItemsContext as default };</code></pre><p>Next, we will hop into our App component to create a provider for the context object that we created.</p><p>The render function part of the component changes from:</p><pre><code>return (
    &lt;div className="App"&gt;
      &lt;header className="App-header"&gt;
        To Do items
        &lt;ItemList items={items} removeItem={removeItem} /&gt;
        &lt;AddItemForm addItem={addItem} /&gt;
      &lt;/header&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );</code></pre><p>to:</p><pre><code>return (
    &lt;ItemsContext.Provider&gt;
      &lt;div className="App"&gt;
        &lt;header className="App-header"&gt;
          To Do items
          &lt;ItemList items={items} removeItem={removeItem} /&gt;
          &lt;AddItemForm addItem={addItem} /&gt;
        &lt;/header&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/ItemsContext.Provider&gt;
  );</code></pre><h3>What do we want to share using the context API?</h3><p>We need to provide the value to the provider now. But what do we want to share among components? That is up to us. In this instance, we want to share the items so that components that need it can access it. And we also want to share the items dispatch function as well, so that components that need to change the components data can do so.</p><p>Doing so will remove the need for all the props that we are passing from the App component right now.</p><p>Thus, we will be creating an object with those two properties on it, and that will also be the default value for our context object. Thus the initialization of the context object changes to:</p><pre><code>const ItemsContext = React.createContext({
  items: [],
  itemsDispatch: () =&gt; {},
});</code></pre><p>and the provider gets the value as:</p><pre><code>&lt;ItemsContext.Provider value={{ items, itemsDispatch }}&gt;</code></pre><p>With this in place, we do not need to pass in any props to the ItemList and AddItem components. It is now upto them to extract what they need from the context API using the useContext hook.</p><h3>Refactoring the ItemList component</h3><p>The item list component no longer needs items as a prop. We can refactor it to get the items using the useContext react hook. We will refactor this first, and then see if we can also remove the removeItem prop later.</p><p>Since we will be using the useContext hook, we will need to import that in the ItemList component as well as the items context that we had created since useContext needs that too.</p><pre><code>const ItemList = ({ items, removeItem }) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div className="items-container"&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        {items.map((item) =&gt; (
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;Item key={item} item={item} removeItem={removeItem} /&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        ))}
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};</code></pre><p>will be changed to:</p><pre><code>const ItemList = ({ removeItem }) =&gt; {
  const { items } = useContext(ItemsContext);

  return (
    &lt;div className="items-container"&gt;
      &lt;ul&gt;
        {items.map((item) =&gt; (
          &lt;li&gt;
            &lt;Item key={item} item={item} removeItem={removeItem} /&gt;
          &lt;/li&gt;
        ))}
      &lt;/ul&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};</code></pre><h3>Removing the remove item prop</h3><p>Notice that the remove item function is eventually calling the dispatch function in our application. And we have already added that function to the context object. So we can remove that prop as well, and refactor our Item component too.</p><pre><code>const Item = ({ item, removeItem }) =&gt; {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;{item}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; removeItem(item)}&gt;X&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};</code></pre><p>can now be changed to:</p><pre><code>const Item = ({ item }) =&gt; {
  const { itemsDispatch } = useContext(ItemsContext);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;span&gt;{item}&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;button
        onClick={() =&gt;
          itemsDispatch({ type: 'REMOVE_ITEM', itemToBeDeleted: item })
        }
      &gt;
        X
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};</code></pre><p>You can see all the changes until now <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/saranshkataria/todo-list-react-hooks-demo/commit/8a0eee1191050fa1754f96d0a283d21b282a6bc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a> and the code until now <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/saranshkataria/todo-list-react-hooks-demo/tree/8a0eee1191050fa1754f96d0a283d21b282a6bc8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><p>Now that we have combined our useContext with useReducer, we have created our own mini version of Redux. We are sharing our dispatch function and the application data in our store just like we do with Redux. This does not make Redux obselete and there are use cases for using it. But for smaller applications, useContext and useReducer are sufficient to get the job done without relying on any third party packages.</p><h3>Refactoring the AddItemForm component</h3><p>This will be fairly similar to what we did above for the ItemList component. If you are interested, you can see the changes for this component <a href="https://github.com/saranshkataria/todo-list-react-hooks-demo/commit/8a0eee1191050fa1754f96d0a283d21b282a6bc8" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><p>And once we are done, we will see that we are no longer passing any props to our children components at all. We are relying on useContext to get state from the context API and solve our initial problem of passing props down.</p><p>The final code for this application can be found on <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://github.com/saranshkataria/todo-list-react-hooks-demo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a>. And if you have any questions, feel free to drop a comment below. If there is any other hook that you want us to cover next, do let us know too.</p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>It’s interesting to watch young children use home assistants.
They treat them like people, asking questions like “Alexa, how are you feeling?” and “Alexa, where are you?”.
I often wonder what their motivation is.
Maybe they don’t know the responses are scripted.
Maybe the designers’ choice of which response to script is just as interesting to them as a human’s response would be.</p>
<p>Adults are no less inclined to anthropomorphization — Alexa is marketed as a <em>her</em> and not an <em>it</em> — but they’ve grown used to Alexa’s shortcomings as a conversationalist.
Indeed, if you ask them whether they want Alexa to be a better conversation partner, they usually respond with indifference or mild aversion, perhaps recalling a movie like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Her_(film)"><em>Her</em></a> and envisioning a society gone too far.
But children would be thrilled by the improvement: they haven’t had time to grow to love Alexa for her flaws.</p>
<p>It’s the same with search engines.
When someone learns to use Google, they write queries we might consider silly, like “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=soft+kind+movie">soft kind movie</a>” or “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=where+are+the+good+places%3F">where are the good places?</a>”.
It’s because they haven’t yet learned that Google is almost completely silent on matters of taste — try searching for “<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=well-written+blog+post">well-written blog post</a>” and counting the number of well-written blog posts in the results.
But if you’re like me, you’ve grown so used to this situation that you don’t see this as a flaw of Google, but rather a result of the user’s innocent inexperience.</p>
<p>To be fair, the problem is hard: what’s “well-written” to one reader might be “Jacob stop using so many commas” to another.
And it would be a mistake to assume that a page which advertises itself as well-written is, in fact, well-written. This is different from something like furniture, since it’s more reasonable to trust a page to be honest about whether it contains furniture.</p>
<p>What if we could avoid these difficulties entirely by changing the problem?
Instead of requiring the system to determine whether something is well-written, we can give it some writing and ask it to find other writing in the same style.
This lets us sidestep the difficult question of defining “good writing”.
Instead, we ask the user to provide an example of what they personally view as good writing.</p>
<p>Finding writing “in the same style” might sound just as subjective as finding good writing.
But it’s not: if you’re given two sets of documents, and you want to know whether they’re written in the same style, you can test it by training a model to classify which set each document comes from.
If it does better than chance, the sets of documents have different styles.</p>
<p>I was curious how this mode of interacting with a search engine would work, so I created a proof of concept.</p>
<h2 id="sameenergyhttpssameenergytweets"><a href="https://same.energy/tweets/">same.energy</a></h2>
<p>A central constraint when searching for similar style is that the search query needs to have the same form as the content you’re searching for.
That means that if you’re looking for music, the query must be music, and if you’re looking for text, the query must be text.
To make queries easy to write, I wanted to search for text, and I didn’t want the text to be too long.
So I made a search engine for Twitter.</p>
<p>You can try it out at <a href="https://same.energy/tweets/">same.energy</a>.
It tends to work well when you give it a query that’s long enough (one or two complete sentences).
Here’s a video of some queries it does well on:</p>

<p>It’s implemented by using a neural network (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11692">RoBERTa-Large</a>, with 355 million parameters) to map each tweet to a vector such that similar tweets have similar vectors (high dot product).
When you submit a query, it’s processed by the neural network into a 128-dimensional vector and then matched against all 15,541,670 vectors in the index, without optimizations like locality-sensitive hashing.
This is fast enough because it runs on a GPU.
(This is light on technical details, and I plan to add more sometime in the future.)</p>
<p>The system has difficulties when people try to use it like a traditional search engine.
If you give it a query like “<a href="https://same.energy/tweets/?q=funny+tweets">funny tweets</a>”, it won’t search for funny tweets.
Instead it will find phrases similar to “funny tweets”, which are mostly nonsense:</p>
<p><img src="https://jacobjackson.com/img/use-mention.png" alt="The top results are 'funny original tweet' and 'tweeted'. The use-mention distinction strikes again."></p><p>During development, I tried to fix this problem by training the model to match using prefixes of tweets rather than full tweets.
This gave better results for short queries because the model would imagine plausible continuations for them and match using those instead.
In the end it hurt performance too much on full tweets to be worth it, but it did reveal something interesting: if you asked it to match the style of a tweet starting with “Liberal”, it returned tweets with right-wing opinions.
And if you asked it to match the style of a tweet starting with “Conservative”, it returned tweets with left-wing opinions.
This suggests that “liberal” and “conservative” are labels more often used by the groups’ opponents than the groups themselves.</p>
<p>Overall, the Twitter search engine was a fun experiment, and it will be nice to see what uses people find for it.</p>
<h2 id="is-this-idea-new">Is this idea new?</h2>
<p>The idea of searching by similarity is old. It’s attracted the most interest in the domain of images, where its advantages are clearest.
The earliest product I know of is <a href="https://tineye.com/">TinEye</a>, released in 2008, which focuses on very close matches.
Google introduced <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/google-rolls-out-reverse-image-search-rip-tineye/">reverse image search</a> in 2011.
In 2017, Pinterest developed a visual similarity search engine called <a href="https://newsroom.pinterest.com/en/post/search-outside-the-box-with-new-pinterest-visual-discovery-tools">Lens</a>, which is quite good, especially for finding products given an impromptu photo of the product. (Please <a href="https://jacobjackson.com/about/">contact</a> me if you think there’s anything else I should mention here.)</p>
<p>Recommender systems (such as Netflix’s algorithm) look a lot like similarity search, but they usually use metadata about the objects rather than observing the objects themselves, which means they can’t be queried like a search engine. For example, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering">collaborative filtering</a> uses metadata about who viewed the objects, so you can’t ask it about an object unless it’s already in the database. But the opposite direction works: every similarity search engine can be used as a recommender system.</p>
<p>I think the reason similarity search isn’t widespread yet is because we’ve only recently developed the algorithms and hardware to create a good similarity search engine.
My <a href="https://same.energy/tweets/">proof of concept</a> uses a <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762">transformer</a>, which was only invented in 2018, and it would be too expensive to host in its current form given the cloud computing prices of five years ago (2015).</p>
<p>This is exciting because the technology has great promise.
Imagine if upon seeing a beautiful image, piece of music, or passage of text, you could show it to a search engine and see hundreds like it, beautiful in just the same way.
I believe this will soon be reality.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How is Google so fast? It’s so fast we take it for granted.  It feels instant from the time you search to when results are displayed.  What can we learn about the techniques they use to make their site so fast?</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="google-search-results-are-fast">Google Search Results are Fast</h2>
<p>The Google homepage is known for it’s speed, but that’s partly a function of how sparse it is.  For this discussion, let’s focus instead on the Google <strong>search results</strong> page.  There’s a lot more functionality and content, and it still loads incredibly fast.  Here we’re searching for “request metrics” from a mobile phone.</p>

<figure>
    <video controls="" muted="" preload="metadata">
        <source src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/results-load.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>Google Search Results for "Request Metrics"</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Wow.  That is almost instant. If we compare the speed of Google’s search results to our <a href="https://requestmetrics.com/web-performance/performance-profiling-nike">web performance profile of Nike.com</a>, there’s no question which experience is preferable.  But how does Google load those results so quickly?</p>

<h3 id="search-result-page-statistics">Search Result Page Statistics</h3>
<p>Let’s look at the statistics for this page load (gathered in the Network tab in Chrome Developer Tools)</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/page-load-totals.png" alt="Network resources loaded for search results">
</figure>
<ul>
  <li><strong>130</strong> requests total to load the search results</li>
  <li><strong>707 KB</strong> of assets over the wire (compressed using gzip)</li>
  <li><strong>9</strong> JS files</li>
  <li><strong>104</strong> image files</li>
  <li><strong>0</strong> CSS files</li>
</ul>

<p>Compared to many sites this is a “lightweight” page load, but there’s still over one hundred requests.  And there’s three quarters of a megabyte of assets shipped over the wire.</p>

<p>Interestingly, Google is using <strong>gzip</strong> for compression instead of their own <a href="https://github.com/google/brotli">Brotli algorithm</a>, even though my browser will accept either.  In benchmarks <a href="https://blogs.akamai.com/2016/02/understanding-brotlis-potential.html">Brotli can be configured to increase compression and performance</a> compared to gzip, so it’s not clear why they’re making this choice.</p>

<p>Overall these statistics are OK, but they don’t explain the speed we see.  The most notable insight here is that there are <em>zero</em> external CSS files.</p>

<h4 id="where-are-the-styles-coming-from">Where are the styles coming from?</h4>
<p>The browser did not request a single CSS file, and yet the page is styled nicely. Let’s look at the HTML that we got back from Google to see if we can figure out where the styles are coming from.</p>

    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/inline-styles.png" alt="Inline styles">

<p>They are inline!  Google is inlining the CSS and sending it out with the page response.  This allows the browser to render the styled content without waiting for an external resource to come back.  But Google doesn’t just inline CSS.</p>

<h2 id="inline-every-static-resource">Inline Every Static Resource</h2>
<p>Google takes inlining seriously.  Not only do they inline the styles, they inline their JavaScript!</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/inline-script.png" alt="Inline scripts">
    <figcaption>Inlining JavaScript too.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In fact, we can run some selectors against the page to see just how pervasive the inlining of scripts and styles is.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/inline-stats.png" alt="Inline scripts">
    <figcaption>Inline vs. external script and style resources.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We can see that of <em>all</em> the scripts and styles on the page, everything is inlined except <strong>2</strong> external JavaScript files.  (<em>Note:</em> those two external scripts dynamically load additional JS files which is how we get <strong>9</strong> total on page load).</p>

<h3 id="what-if-we-dont-load-any-external-assets">What if We Don’t Load Any External Assets?</h3>
<p>To illustrate just how far Google has taken the concept of inlining static resources, let’s <em>only</em> load the HTML.  <strong>No other external assets</strong>.  No external JavaScript, no external images, no external anything.  I saved the HTML response from Google and opened it with my network turned off. How does it look?</p>

<figure>
    <video controls="" muted="" preload="metadata">
        <source src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/doc-only.mp4" type="video/mp4">
    </video>
    <figcaption>The source HTML only.  No external assets.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It looks great!  There’s even favicons for all the search results.  The hamburger menu doesn’t work, and the images carousel towards the end is missing its images. But everything else looks pretty good.</p>

<p>Earlier we saw that <strong>104</strong> image files were loaded during the real page load.  And yet, we see most of the images working here.  What gives?</p>

<h3 id="inlining-images-with-data-uris">Inlining Images with Data URIs</h3>
<p>Google is using a clever optimization with most of the images.  If we look at the Request Metrics favicon image in the inspector we can see that the image has a special <code>src</code> URI - a <a href="https://css-tricks.com/data-uris/">Data URI!</a> The binary image content is Base64 encoded and shoved directly into the <code>src</code> attribute.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/base64-rm.png" alt="Data URI base64 encoded favicon">
    <figcaption>The Base64 encoded Request Metrics favicon Data URI source.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Using Data URIs is yet another way Google shows their committment to inlining assets.  It’s a perfect technique to use when there’s many small images to display. The Data URI approach has diminishing returns for larger images since it bloats the page size. That’s why the “Images” carousel is blank - they are still using externally sourced images to populate that section.</p>

<p><em>Important:</em> It’s worth noting that each one of these Base64 encoded images is counted as a “request” in the Network tab of Chrome developer tools.   This explains why there are so many images “requested” but the page is so fast.  The browser never goes over the network to get them!  Here’s what they look like in the developer tools:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/data-img.png" alt="Network tab showing data uri images.">
    <figcaption>Data URI Image "Requests" in the Network Tab</figcaption>
</figure>

<h3 id="inlining-for-speed">Inlining For Speed</h3>
<p>Google’s dedication to inlining JS, CSS and images shows how important it is for maximizing performance. Every external request the browser makes is a performance problem waiting to happen.</p>

<p>Google is taking no chances here.  Once a user’s browser receives that <em>very first</em> response from Google, it can render <strong>90%</strong> of the UI without going over the wire again.  This speeds things up and also mitigates slow or unreliable networks.</p>

<p>Of course, getting that first response to the user <em>quickly</em> is also important.  And 90% is not 100% - there <em>are</em> other requests necessary for a fully featured experience.  Inlining is not the only thing Google does to be fast.</p>

<h2 id="googles-fast-edge-network">Google’s Fast Edge Network</h2>
<p>Optimizing the content of a page is important, but perhaps equally important is delivering that page and its associated resources quickly over the wire.</p>

<h3 id="a-globally-distributed-infrastructure">A Globally Distributed Infrastructure</h3>
<p>Google runs <a href="https://peering.google.com/#/infrastructure">a robust network with multiple layers of infrastructure</a> to ensure that requests are handled as close to the end user as possible.  They have numerous <a href="https://www.peeringdb.com/net/433">peering arrangements</a> with ISPs around the world, and a comprehensive edge caching setup that ensures static resources are almost always nearby.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/ggc-nodes.png" alt="Google Edge Cache Nodes">
    <figcaption>Areas with at least one Google Global Cache edge node.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>It’s <a href="https://peering.google.com/#/learn-more/faq">difficult to objectively measure</a> the performance of Google’s network with traditional tools like <code>ping</code>, but we can look at how things perform in our browser.</p>

<h3 id="the-initial-search-results-response">The Initial Search Results Response</h3>
<p>Here’s what the developer tools say about our search results loading times:</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/doc-load.png" alt="Search results page load">
    <figcaption>Search results page load timing.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The initial request to Google had a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_to_first_byte">time to first byte</a> (TTFB) of <strong>145 ms</strong> (the blue box).  That is, the browser started receiving the response from Google after 145 milliseconds.  <a href="https://web.dev/time-to-first-byte/">That’s pretty fast</a>. The overall time to finish reading the response was <strong>880 ms</strong> (orange box).  This includes the time to download the entire response from Google.</p>

<p>Remember, because of Google’s aggressive static content inlining, 90% of the UI can be displayed to the user once the response is finished.</p>

<h3 id="the-static-content-is-even-faster">The Static Content Is Even Faster</h3>
<p>There are a few external JavaScript files retrieved during page load.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://requestmetrics.com/assets/images/webperf/perf-google/static-load.png" alt="JS file load times">
    <figcaption>JavaScript File Load Times</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>These files all have an average TTFB of <strong>~30 ms</strong>. This suggests the server is nearby, with minimal hops between my browser.  Considering I loaded this page over a Comcast internet connection, this is a solid response time.</p>

<h4 id="the-protocol-makes-a-difference">The Protocol Makes A Difference</h4>
<p>Not only are the Google servers nearby, they’re also serving files using a new protocol.  You might have noticed the value <strong>h3-Q050</strong> in the screenshots above. That’s because the browser is talking to Google over <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP/3">HTTP/3</a>.</p>

<p>It’s still a draft standard, but the main difference between HTTP/3 and HTTP/2 is that TCP is no longer the underlying connection protocol.  They’ve adopted <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QUIC">QUIC</a> instead of TCP because it improves performance:</p>

<blockquote>
[QUIC] does this by establishing a number of multiplexed connections between two endpoints over User Datagram Protocol (UDP). This works hand-in-hand with HTTP/2's multiplexed connections, allowing multiple streams of data to reach all the endpoints independently, and hence independent of packet losses involving other streams.
</blockquote>

<h2 id="how-to-be-fast-like-google">How to Be Fast, Like Google</h2>
<p>Most companies don’t have access to Google’s network or vast developer pool, but the same ideas they use to make their pages load quickly can be applied to any site.</p>

<h3 id="make-less-requests">Make Less Requests</h3>
<p>Google takes it to a new level, but avoiding network requests is major factor in improving web performance. Even with newer HTTP protocols, bundling assets to coalesce static content is still a good idea.  If you can inline some JavaScript or CSS that’s even better.  Using data URIs to transmit small images can also help. Networks are unreliable, and every request the browser makes has the potential to fail or be delayed.</p>

<p>Webpack is a staple in modern front-end tool chains, and there are several plugins that can help if you want to go the inlining route:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/DustinJackson/html-webpack-inline-source-plugin">html-webpack-inline-source-plugin</a> - for inlining all CSS <em>and</em> JS.</li>
  <li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/style-loader/">style-loader</a>- if you just want to inline your styles.</li>
  <li><a href="https://webpack.js.org/loaders/url-loader/">url-loader</a> - building Data URIs from images or other sources.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="use-cdns-and-modern-protocols">Use CDNs and Modern Protocols</h3>
<p>It’s unlikely you’ll have access to a network quite as sophisticated as Google’s, but modern cloud providers offer many similar features. Things like purpose-built CDNs and dynamic geo-based DNS routing are available to anyone.</p>

<p>Hosting static content on a CDN is an easy way to get some of the network benefits Google enjoys, including HTTP/2 or HTTP/3 support.  And using a geo-aware DNS solution let’s you take data locality to the next level if that’s important for your use case or customer base.</p>

<p>Even if you don’t use the cloud, third parties like <a href="https://www.stackpath.com/maxcdn/">MaxCDN</a> and <a href="https://www.fastly.com/">Fastly</a> make it simple to deliver static content from around the globe.  And there are DNS providers like <a href="https://easydns.com/dns/pro/">easyDNS</a> offering full GeoDNS routing.</p>

<p>Google is one of the premier web properties on the Internet, and the company is driving many new web standards.  It’s no surprise their site is one of the fastest.  For everyone else, we’ve built <a href="https://requestmetrics.com/">Request Metrics</a>. Now you can see how your users really experience your site.</p>

<p>In the book <em>Refactoring</em>, Martin Fowler talks about splitting up long functions:</p>



<blockquote><p>How do you identify the clumps of code to extract? A good technique is to look for comments. They often signal this kind of semantic distance. A block of code with a comment that tells you what it is doing can be replaced by a method whose name is based on the comment. Even a single line is worth extracting if it needs explanation.</p><cite>Martin Fowler, <em>Refactoring</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>To find an example, I opened up the <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost">Github repo for Ghost</a> (the first major open source project that came to mind). Within 15 seconds I <a href="https://github.com/TryGhost/Ghost/blob/7b5401b26841fbed839b5d964f27897b8bb15cf3/core/frontend/helpers/ghost_head.js#L141-L144">found this chunk</a> within a ~100 line anonymous callback function:</p>



<pre><code>// don't allow indexing of preview URLs!
if (_.includes(context, 'preview')) {
    head.push(writeMetaTag('robots', 'noindex,nofollow', 'name'));
}</code></pre>



<p>The book quote says to replace the block with “a method whose name is based on the comment.” So we could create <code>excludePreviewFromIndexing()</code> and remove the comment. </p>



<p>What would that get us? A few things:</p>



<p>We’d have<strong> no risk of the comment becoming outdated</strong>. The classic book <em>Clean Code</em> by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_C._Martin">Uncle Bob</a> talks about this:</p>



<blockquote><p>The problem with comments is that they have no compile-time check and&nbsp;tend to be forgotten. It’s very easy to change your code but forget about the comments.</p><cite>Uncle Bob, <em>Clean Code</em></cite></blockquote>



<p>We’d also get <strong>self documenting code</strong>. You wouldn’t need to read a comment to grok it at a glance.</p>



<p>Plus, we’d have a <strong>shorter parent method</strong>, and it would get <em>much </em>shorter if we did that in a few more places.</p>



<p>But how can this be?! I always learned that comments are good, and that uncommented code is bad code. I always felt guilty if I submitted a pull request without some solid code comments. I’ve asked other people to add comments countless times in code review. Have I had it backwards for all these years?</p>



<p>And what about “code tells you how, comments tell you why”?</p>



<p>I went looking for other opinions and found another, spicier quote from Uncle Bob:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>A comment is an apology</strong> for not choosing a more clear name, or a more reasonable set of parameters, or for the failure to use explanatory variables and explanatory functions. Apologies for making the code unmaintainable, apologies for not using well-known algorithms, apologies for writing ‘clever’ code, apologies for not having a good version control system, apologies for not having finished the job of writing the code, or for leaving vulnerabilities or flaws in the code.</p><p>[…] Is there any use of comments that are not apologies? I don’t think so. I can’t think of one. <strong>Is there any good reason to write a comment? Only if you’ve done something “wrong”.</strong></p><cite><a href="http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.TimOttinger.ApologizeIncode">Uncle Bob</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Vicious, right? There’s never a good reason to write a comment, ever? Comments always mean you’ve done something wrong?</p>



<p>Jeff Atwood doesn’t go <em>quite</em> as far, but he’s close:</p>



<blockquote><p>You should always write your code as if comments didn’t exist.&nbsp;This&nbsp;<em>forces</em>&nbsp;you to write your code in the simplest, plainest, most self-documenting way you can humanly come up with.</p><p>[…] <strong>If your feel your code is too complex to understand without comments, your code is probably just bad</strong>. Rewrite it until it doesn’t need comments anymore. If, at the end of that effort, you still feel comments are necessary, then by all means, add comments. Carefully.</p><cite><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/coding-without-comments/">Jeff Atwood</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>Jeff also referenced <a href="http://www.codeodor.com/index.cfm/2008/6/18/Common-Excuses-Used-To-Comment-Code-and-What-To-Do-About-Them/2293">this blog post</a>. It ends with a tiny list of legitimate reasons to add comments:</p>



<blockquote><p>There are only four situations I can think&nbsp;of&nbsp;at the moment where I need to comment code:</p><p>1. In the styles&nbsp;of&nbsp;Javadoc, RubyDoc, et cetera for documenting APIs others will use.<br>2. In the off chance it really is that complex: For example, on&nbsp;a&nbsp;bioinformatics DNA search function that took 5 weeks to formulate and write out. That’s how rare it is to have something complex enough to warrant comments.<br>3. TODOs, which should be the exception, not the rule<br>4. Explaining why the most obvious code wasn’t written. (Design decisions)</p><cite><a href="http://www.codeodor.com/index.cfm/2008/6/18/Common-Excuses-Used-To-Comment-Code-and-What-To-Do-About-Them/2293">Sam Larbi</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>I guess I’ve had it backwards. Comments are not a sign of craftsmanship. Comments do not imply good code. It’s the opposite – comments imply bad code. If the code was good then the comments wouldn’t need to exist. </p>



<p>Comments should be an absolute last resort. And even then, I should feel a little guilty about them. </p>

<p>Recently, I was working on deployment of a Windows Service on multiple in instances. It involves multiple steps &amp; was time consuming process.&nbsp; So, I thought of creating a PowerShell script for automating the Windows Service deployment. In this post, I will share how we can create a simple PowerShell script for doing the same.</p>
<h2>Step 1: Stop &amp; delete the service if already existing</h2>
<pre data-enlighter-language="powershell">if (Get-Service -Name $ServiceName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)
{
Stop-Service -Name $ServiceName

sc.exe delete $ServiceName
}</pre>
<p>Here:</p>
<p><strong>$ServiceName</strong> : Name of the Service which we want to manage/deploy.</p>
<h2>Step 2 (optional): Set System Environment Variables required by the Service</h2>
<p>In my case, Service require <strong>ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT </strong>system environment variable to be set with value “<strong>Production</strong>”</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="powershell">[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT','Production',[System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)</pre>
<h2>Step 3 (optional): Modify service configuration settings</h2>
<p>In my case, I need to modify <strong>appsettings.Production.json&nbsp;</strong>file &amp; replace a setting value of “InstanceId” from “&lt;PlaceholderInstanceId&gt;” with the one supplied by user as argument.</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="powershell">(Get-Content -Path $ServiceConfig -Raw) -Replace "&lt;PlaceholderInstanceId&gt;", $args[0] | Set-Content -Path $ServiceConfig</pre>
<p>Here:</p>
<p><strong>$ServiceConfig</strong>: Path of <strong>appsettings.Production.json </strong>file</p>
<h2>Step 4 (optional): Copy files to Service folder</h2>
<p>In my case, I need to copy a instance config file to Service root folder</p>
<pre data-enlighter-language="powershell">Copy-Item $InstanceConfig -Destination $ServiceRootPath</pre>
<p>Here:</p>
<p><strong>$InstanceConfig</strong>: Path of instance config file</p>
<p><strong>$ServiceRootPath</strong>: Path of Service Root Folder</p>
<h2>Step 5: Add new Service</h2>
<pre data-enlighter-language="powershell">New-Service -Name $ServiceName -BinaryPathName $ServicePath -Description $ServiceDescription</pre>
<p>Here:</p>
<p><strong>$ServiceName</strong>: Name of the Service</p>
<p><strong>$ServicePath</strong>: Service Root Folder Path</p>
<p><strong>$ServiceDescription</strong>: Service Description</p>
<h2>Step 6 (optional): Set Service Start Type to “Automatic”</h2>
<pre data-enlighter-language="powershell">Set-Service -Name $ServiceName -StartupType Automatic</pre>
<h2>Step 7: Start the Service</h2>
<pre data-enlighter-language="powershell">Start-Service -Name $ServiceName</pre>
<h2>Step 8: Check Service Status</h2>
<pre data-enlighter-language="powershell">Get-Service -Name $ServiceName</pre>
<h2>Step 9: Full sample PowerShell script for deploying the Windows Service (<strong>SampleWindowsService.ps1</strong>)</h2>
<pre data-enlighter-language="powershell">if($args.count -eq 1)
{
  $ServiceName = "MyTestService"
  
  $ServiceRootPath = "D:\MyTestService\"

  $ServicePath = $ServiceRootPath + "\MyTestService.exe"

  $ServiceDescription = "My Test Service"
  
  $ServiceConfig = $ServiceRootPath + "\appsettings.Production.json"
  
  $InstanceConfig = "D:\InstanceConfig.config"
  
  (Get-Content -Path $ServiceConfig -Raw) -Replace "&lt;PlaceholderInstanceId&gt;", $args[0] | Set-Content -Path $ServiceConfig
  
  Copy-Item $InstanceConfig -Destination $ServiceRootPath

  if (Get-Service -Name $ServiceName -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue)
  {
    Stop-Service -Name $ServiceName

    sc.exe delete $ServiceName
  }

  New-Service -Name $ServiceName -BinaryPathName $ServicePath -Description $ServiceDescription

  [System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT','Production',[System.EnvironmentVariableTarget]::Machine)

  Set-Service -Name $ServiceName -StartupType Automatic

  Start-Service -Name $ServiceName

  Get-Service -Name $ServiceName
}
else
{
  $Message = "Need to specify InstanceId argument"
  write-output $Message 
}</pre>
<h2>Step 10: Execute script</h2>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-11873">  <div> <p>This essay was originally written in 2015 after years of “race to the bottom” in the WordPress space, especially among service providers who sell low-cost solutions without revealing the drawbacks of their work.</p> <p>For some unknown reason, the number of “WordPress Developers” out there is probably&nbsp;nearing the number of Java developers, despite the fact that all&nbsp;Java developers do program extensively whilst the WordPress developers far too often have no idea what’s going on behind the admin panel.</p> <p><em>Full disclosure: I am a WordPress Core contributor since version 3.7 with background in Java and Python. Many of our agency projects serve over 100 million monthly page views and we integrate with hundreds of APIs, analytics solutions, ad providers, and more.</em></p> <p>I do conduct interviews on a weekly basis for various reasons, and over the past several years I’ve probably shortlisted over 1,000 applications for WordPress development. This includes hiring locally, virtually, and telecommuters interested in joining our team or any of the technical teams led by our ongoing retainer clients.</p> <div><figure><img alt="Existing programming solutions.

Via http://dilbert.com/</figcaption></figure></div> <p>A small chunk of the applicants had any exposure to actual programming at all. The rest of them usually fall in one of the following categories:</p> <ul><li><strong>WordPress installers</strong> – setting up WP websites and installing themes</li><li><strong>WordPress administrators</strong> – people who use theme options panels from premium themes and a multitude of plugins to “build” a website</li><li><strong><a href="https://mariopeshev.com/hiring-virtual-assistants/">Virtual assistants</a></strong></li><li><strong>Bloggers</strong></li><li>People who have in fact <strong>edited some HTML/CSS</strong> to align a menu or hide an element</li></ul> <h2>Developers Actually Code</h2> <p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia</a>, “Software Development” is:</p> <blockquote><p>Software development is the process of <strong>computer programming</strong>, documenting, testing, and <strong>bug fixing</strong> involved in creating and maintaining applications and <strong>frameworks</strong> involved in a software release life cycle and resulting in a software product. The term refers to a process of <strong>writing and maintaining the source code</strong>, but in a broader sense of the term it includes all that is involved between the conception of the desired software through to the final manifestation of the software, ideally in a planned and structured process.</p></blockquote> <p>There is no ambiguity here. At all.</p> <p>Programming, writing code, building products, maintaining code and bug fixing. None of those means “<em>installing a platform with a few clicks</em>” or “<em>customizing options built by other programmers</em>“.</p> <p>I used to find that amusing over the first dozen or two interviews and applications. Nowadays, I do receive submissions by various people, including folks with little to no exposure to power user Internet usage or even “developers” who don’t own a computer (but rather use a smartphone to change themes, write short posts and&nbsp;post statuses on Facebook).</p> <p>Most people suffer from the <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Dunning-Kruger_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dunning-Kruger effect</a>&nbsp;and know nothing, hence claim to be developers. But far too often this is not the case.</p> <p>I stumbled upon a tweet that was defined in a proper&nbsp;manner:</p> <figure><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a WordPress Designer/Super Admin – I can't wait to give <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blog?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#blog</a> insights from <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/mnblogcon?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#mnblogcon</a> to my blogger clients!</p>— Erica Schaaf (@EricaSchaaf1) <a href="https://twitter.com/EricaSchaaf1/status/665557797912743936?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2015</a></blockquote><template data-nitro-marker-id="372de9843891598aa58675a785cc4349-1"></template> </div></figure> <p>Running a website could be WordPress administration&nbsp;or&nbsp;operation, or a number of different terms that have nothing to do with&nbsp;web development.</p> <p>This wouldn’t have been&nbsp;a major problem unless it affected the entire industry:</p> <ul><li>Millions of amateurs selling WordPress services claiming to do what they don’t, in fact, do</li><li>Various clients looking for expert programmers and getting lost in the pool of amateurs</li><li>New clients receiving ridiculously low price offers from “<em>super admins</em>” which leads to huge gaps when receiving an offer for a custom solution on top of WordPress</li><li>Large customers picking another platform due to disappointment by their experience with “WordPress developers” (or generally being unable to find any decent ones)</li><li>Amateurs not knowing what “development” entails and lacking the&nbsp;scope of work a developer deals with on a day-to-day basis</li><li>WordPress customers being hacked, suffering from slow page load times and broken websites</li><li>WordPress plugin repository filled in with plugins causing various issues related to performance, compatibility, broken UI and more</li><li>I’m not even going to touch on the premium WP themes</li></ul> <p>I’ve written about that plenty of times in different context:</p> <ul><li><a href="http://devwp.eu/why-wordpress-expert-is-not-a-real-title/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Why “WordPress Expert” is Not a Real Title?</a></li><li><a href="http://devwp.eu/the-wordpress-industry-is-just-as-every-other-field/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The WordPress Industry Is Just As Every Other Field</a></li><li><a href="http://devwp.eu/on-wordpress-talent-shortage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On WordPress Talent Shortage</a></li><li><a href="http://devwp.eu/wordpress-job-titles-skills-stand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress Job Titles and Skills â€“ Where Do We Stand?</a></li><li><a href="http://devwp.eu/setting-wrong-example/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Setting the Wrong Example</a></li><li><a href="http://devwp.eu/envato-or-why-race-to-the-bottom-is-dangerous/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Envato Or Why Race To the Bottom Is Dangerous?</a></li><li><a href="http://devwp.eu/code-quality-and-free-plugins/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code Quality and Free Plugins</a></li><li><a href="http://devwp.eu/your-wordpress-business-is-not-there-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Your WordPress Business is Not There Yet</a></li><li><a href="http://devwp.eu/keeping-wordpress-date-not-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Keeping WordPress Up-To-Date Is Not Enough</a></li><li><a href="http://devwp.eu/the-problem-with-having-to-educate-your-customers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Problem With Having To Educate Your Customers</a></li><li><a href="http://devwp.eu/blogging-and-helping-the-wordpress-business-ecosystem/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blogging And Helping the WordPress Business Ecosystem</a></li></ul> <h2>The State Of WordPress Development</h2> <p>For everyone working actively in the software engineering industry programming all day long and shaming WordPress, there is some merit to the global perception of the WordPress community. A good percentage of the small business websites and blogs are often DIY solutions or merely WordPress installations with a bunch of themes and plugins installed.</p> <p>And this is totally fine for a hobby blog or a single page app that displays general information about the business.</p> <p>That said, there are more than enough use cases that require heavy programming, scaling large systems, performing migrations from 3rd party frameworks to WordPress platforms, enhancing security for enterprises, building educational multisite networks for universities, crafting Software as a Service solutions on top of WordPress and more.</p> <p>We’ve been involved in each of these cases. Currently, we do&nbsp;provide ongoing development for several sites generating over 10M page views a month, as well as franchise networks ran by enterprises, large media outlets, professional event management platforms and several more.</p> <h2>WordPress as An Application Framework</h2> <p>While WordPress has initially started as a blogging platform, its popularity has led to increasing the scope of applications that WordPress is a suitable solution for.</p> <p>Back in WordPress 3.0, custom post types and an editable taxonomy engine were introduced. Over the years, WordPress became a tool of choice for application framework development as well. In 2016, the REST API had been included as a part of the WordPress Core, making it possible to build single page applications or completely detached software solutions interacting with a WordPress website through its various APIs.</p> <p>Moreover, the most popular eCommerce solution nowadays is WooCommerce – currently powering 41% of all eCommerce websites using a known eCommerce platform:</p> <div><figure><a href="https://trends.builtwith.com/shop"><img alt="" data-recalc-dims="1" nitro-lazy-src="https://nitrocdn.com/mdqikLgfKYGSrbmTldEJjFfznWndiqoY/assets/static/optimized/rev-89836d7/devwp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/73d9f63cbf68d5d7391d41bb4dcbecbf.ecommerce-usage-statistics.png" nitro-lazy-empty="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNjQwIDM3OCIgd2lkdGg9IjY0MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIzNzgiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+"></a></figure></div> <p>WordPress has been used by thousands of reputable brands, high-traffic websites, Fortune 500 companies and some of the leading giants on the Internet. Their teams are comprised of capable PHP and JavaScript engineers, devops experts, integration specialists and other qualified folks who make sure that the system is up and running, compatible with&nbsp;upcoming features and additional enhancements, secure, and fast.</p> <p>I wrote the definitive guide to the skills taught at a Computer Science specialty that is relevant to WordPress development at WP Elevation:</p> <div><figure><a href="http://www.wpelevation.com/2015/11/wordpress-install-developed-solutions/"><img alt="Building a Web Product Requires a Set of Skills" data-recalc-dims="1" nitro-lazy-src="https://nitrocdn.com/mdqikLgfKYGSrbmTldEJjFfznWndiqoY/assets/static/optimized/rev-89836d7/devwp.eu/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/73d9f63cbf68d5d7391d41bb4dcbecbf.disconnect-wordpress-install-developed.png" nitro-lazy-empty="" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNjQwIDU3MCIgd2lkdGg9IjY0MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1NzAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+"></a><figcaption>Building a Web Product Requires a Set of Skills</figcaption></figure></div> <p>My guide includes a list of skills such as: Computer Architectures, Operating Systems, Networks, Databases,&nbsp;Programming Languages, Data Structures, Algorithms and more that are used by developers while building a web solution in order to build a robust, scalable and reliable end product for the right stack while considering other aspects related to building, operating and running a web solution.</p> <h2>Should Web Developers Use WordPress?</h2> <p>Yes, there is no practical reason for web developers to avoid WordPress whenever the platform provides a good chunk of the required functionality.</p> <p>Let’s take into account the fact that WordPress comes with a bunch of features out of the box:</p> <ul><li>An engine for creating pages and posts (news entries, articles)</li><li>A role&nbsp;engine with several roles and different capabilities having access to various features</li><li>A media component for uploading media, resizing images, creating post thumbnails</li><li>A full-fledged dashboard with limited features depending on the user role</li><li>A large suite of themes and plugins that you can extend further</li><li>Comments, additional tools, default website settings</li></ul> <p>With that in mind, as a web developer, you don’t need to reinvent the wheel when you can use WordPress. Put your PHP and JavaScript skills in use, study the default database schema and the plugin APIs provided by WordPress and use it as an application framework accordingly – just as you’d do with Laravel, FuelPHP, CakePHP, CodeIgniter or any of the other frameworks out there (excluding the UI element).</p> <p>Otherwise, if you’re someone who offers “WordPress development” but don’t code, and you haven’t read about the different layers under WordPress itself, <strong>please change your title to something relevant to your skills</strong> and service offering.

          <p>We’re excited to release the first preview of Stargate, an open source API framework for data. This project came about because we got tired of using different databases and different APIs depending on the work that we were trying to get done. With “read the manual” fatigue and lengthy selection processes wearing on us every time we created a new project, we thought - why not create a framework that can serve many APIs for a range of workloads? From this, Stargate was born.</p>

<p>For example, if you’re a JavaScript developer building a website, saving and searching JSON is great and maybe you also have some GraphQL sprinkled throughout. If you’re a Java or C# developer working on an enterprise application, SQL is likely more your style. The goal of Stargate is to make your data available for you through whatever API you can dream up regardless of the backing datastore.</p>

<p>So far we’ve started with Apache Cassandra as the first backend and implemented the Cassandra Query Language (CQL) and a REST API for CRUD access to data in tables and have many more APIs coming soon.</p>

<p>For any project to thrive it needs to be easy to work with and contribute to. We kept that in mind while architecting Stargate and the core codebase is modularized to facilitate extensibility and collaboration. We hope that you’ll join us on this journey to redefine what’s possible when it comes to interacting with data at scale and if you’re interested in getting involved you can check out the code on <a href="https://github.com/stargate/stargate">GitHub</a>, join our <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stargate.io/g/stargate-users">mailing list</a>, or follow us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/stargateio">@stargateio</a>! 🚀</p>

<h2 id="how-does-stargate-work">How does Stargate work?</h2>

<p>Stargate is a data gateway component that is deployed between your client applications and database. We chose Cassandra as the first database because it solves the world’s hardest scale and availability challenges and we think there’s low hanging fruit in terms of APIs for the database.</p>

<p>Stargate itself is based on the concept of a Cassandra <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/latest/architecture/dynamo.html">coordinator node</a> and is very similar to the “fat client” that Eric Lubow explains in his <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/DataStax/optimizing-your-cluster-with-coordinator-nodes-eric-lubow-simplereach-cassandra-summit-2016">presentation</a> at Cassandra Summit in 2016. This means when Stargate is deployed, it joins the Cassandra cluster as a coordinator node but does not store any data. We chose this design because coordinator nodes in Cassandra already handle most of the request handling and routing that’s needed for a highly available storage proxy and it made sense to reuse that time-tested logic. This architecture allows for compute to be scaled independently of storage; a common model when using cloud infrastructure.</p>

<p>The high-level architecture diagram below explains where Stargate fits in the stack and the vision for new APIs and integrations.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/init-stargate/kubernetes.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/init-stargate/kubernetes.png"></p>

<p>Taking a closer look, when a request is sent to Stargate, it is handled by the API Service, translated to the database query, and dispatched to the Persistence Service. The Persistence service then sends the request to the storage replicas of that row using Cassandra’s internal QueryHandler. The Persistence Service processes the request and responds to the client once it receives acknowledgements from the number of storage replicas specified by the request consistency level.</p>

<p>This is a pretty classic implementation of “<a href="https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf">Dynamo-based</a>” coordination. Stargate’s ultimate goal is to have pluggable APIs on the front-end and pluggable storage engines on the <em>back-end</em> with all the Dynamo magic happening in the middle.</p>

<p>To understand how this distributed coordination works a bit more, in a single 6-node datacenter cluster with 3 storage replicas, an incoming request will go to all 3 replicas that own the requested row. In this case, the nodes labeled 1, 3, and 4 are storages nodes that own the data for the request. In the example below, the consistency level is LOCAL_QUORUM which means that Stargate will read or write data to 2 of the 3 storage replicas in order to satisfy the client request and ack the success.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/init-stargate/steps.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/init-stargate/steps.png"></p>

<h2 id="get-started">Get Started</h2>
<p>Below is an example of the REST API for CRUD operations that serves the data stored in Cassandra tables over HTTP. You can try this example by downloading <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">Postman</a> and importing the Stargate REST API collection in the <a href="https://github.com/stargate/docs/blob/master/modules/developers-guide/examples/stargate-rest-api.postman_collection.json">documentation</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1: Pull down the docker image</strong> (<a href="https://hub.docker.com/u/stargateio">https://hub.docker.com/u/stargateio</a>)</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">docker pull stargateio/stargate-3_11:v0.0.3</code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 2: Start the docker container</strong> using the <code>DEVELOPER_MODE=true</code> env variable. This removes the need to install a separate Cassandra instance.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  docker run <span>--name</span> stargate <span>-p</span> 8081:8081 <span>-p</span> 8082:8082 <span>-p</span> 127.0.0.1:9042:9042 <span>-d</span> <span>-e</span> <span>CLUSTER_NAME</span><span>=</span>stargate <span>-e</span> <span>CLUSTER_VERSION</span><span>=</span>3.11 <span>-e</span> <span>DEVELOPER_MODE</span><span>=</span><span>true </span>stargateio/stargate-3_11:v0.0.3</code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 3: Generate an auth token</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>-L</span> <span>-X</span> POST <span>'http://localhost:8081/v1/auth'</span> <span>-H</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>--data-raw</span> <span>'{
    "username": "cassandra",
    "password": "cassandra"
  }'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"authToken"</span><span>:</span><span>"{auth-token-here}"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 4: Create a keyspace</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>--location</span> <span>--request</span> POST <span>'localhost:8082/schemas/keyspaces'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--data-raw</span> <span>'{
      "name": "users_keyspace",
      "replicas": 1
    }'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span>"users_keyspace"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 5: Create a table</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>--location</span> <span>--request</span> POST <span>'localhost:8082/schemas/keyspaces/users_keyspace/tables'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--data-raw</span> <span>'{
      "name": "users",
      "columnDefinitions": [
        {
          "name": "firstname",
          "typeDefinition": "text"
        },
        {
          "name": "lastname",
          "typeDefinition": "text"
        },
        {
          "name": "email",
          "typeDefinition": "text"
        },
        {
          "name": "favorite color",
          "typeDefinition": "text"
        }
      ],
      "primaryKey": {
        "partitionKey": ["firstname"],
        "clusteringKey": ["lastname"]
      },
      "tableOptions": {
        "defaultTimeToLive": 0,
        "clusteringExpression":[
          {
            "column": "lastname",
            "order": "ASC"
          }
        ]
      }
    }'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"name"</span><span>:</span><span>"users"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 6: Add rows</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>--location</span> <span>--request</span> POST <span>'localhost:8082/v2/keyspaces/users_keyspace/users'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--header</span> <span>'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--header</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>\</span>
  <span>--data-raw</span> <span>'{
    "firstname": "Mookie",
    "lastname": "Betts",
    "email": "mookie.betts@gmail.com",
    "favorite color": "blue"
  }'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"firstname"</span><span>:</span><span>"Mookie"</span><span>,</span><span>"lastname"</span><span>:</span><span>"Betts"</span><span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p><strong>Step 7: Get rows</strong></p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="bash">  curl <span>-G</span> <span>--location</span> <span>'http://localhost:8082/v2/keyspaces/users_keyspace/users'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'X-Cassandra-Token: {auth-token-here}'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--header</span> <span>'Content-Type: application/json'</span> <span>\</span>
    <span>--data-urlencode</span> <span>'where={"firstname": {"$eq": "Mookie"}}'</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Expected Output:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>  </span><span>{</span><span>"count"</span><span>:</span><span>1</span><span>,</span><span>"data"</span><span>:[{</span><span>"firstname"</span><span>:</span><span>"Mookie"</span><span>,</span><span>"favorite color"</span><span>:</span><span>"blue"</span><span>,</span><span>"email"</span><span>:</span><span>"mookie.betts@gmail.com"</span><span>,</span><span>"lastname"</span><span>:</span><span>"Betts"</span><span>}]}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>Voila! You can find the full reference for the table-based REST API and more in the <a href="https://stargate.io/docs">docs</a>.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-get-involved">How can I get involved?</h2>
<p>Check out the code and start building with us! We’ve architected this project with exploration, flexibility, and API and storage agnosticism as our <em>first class</em> citizens; the goal is that this makes it easy for the community to innovate and add new APIs and extensions.</p>

<p>The diagram below shows how the Stargate modules fit together.</p>

<p><img alt="" data-src="/assets/images/init-stargate/stargate-modules.png" src="https://stargate.io/assets/images/init-stargate/stargate-modules.png"></p>

<p>To get started building a new API extension, have a look at the existing <a href="https://github.com/stargate/stargate/tree/master/restapi">REST API</a> implementation in the Stargate repo first. To get started building a new storage extension, check out the <a href="https://github.com/stargate/stargate/tree/master/persistence-cassandra-3.11">persistence-cassandra-3.11</a> implementation. Once you have an idea of what you want to build, shoot us a note on the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/lists.stargate.io/g/stargate-users">mailing list</a> to discuss. Note that the internal APIs are under active development and they are likely to change before the first version is released.</p>

<p>To request new features or file bugs, create a new GitHub issue in the <a href="https://github.com/stargate/stargate">stargate/stargate</a> repository and we’ll take it from there.
Let’s Explore
We can’t wait to see where this project takes <em>us</em> and we’ll be rolling out a few new APIs in the coming weeks. You can get updates by following us on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/stargateio">@stargateio</a> and throw us a star on Github if you like what you see!</p>

<p>We’re ready for lift-off, see you in the stars! ✨</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-5d5f64f48c8c140d2a51"><div><p>XFM2 is a powerful tool for microtonal music creation. It features 256 different scales available at any time, and each program can use any scale (both units in XFM2 could be playing different scales simultaneously). The scales selected are recalled on Program Change, so changing scales during performance is snappy.</p><p>After many years of developing musical instruments with microtonal capabilities and microtuning, I’ve learned one fundamental fact: microtonal musicians do not limit themselves to any particular scale, or set of scales :-)</p><p>So the 256 scales in the default factory pack have been picked by “popularity” (if that term means anything in the context of microtuning). But what about the other infinite number of scales that were not included, and microtonal musicians might want to use?</p><p>Here’s where Microtuning User Banks come to the rescue. XFM2 allows the user to upload her or his own microtuning scales to replace the factory ones. </p><h2>Overall procedure</h2><p>Essentially, the process consists of three steps:</p><p>1- Selecting the desired scales<br>2- Converting them into XFM2 format<br>3- Uploading to XFM2</p><h2>#1 - Selecting/Creating the scales</h2><p>Here’s where all your microtonal knowledge comes in. </p><p>XFM2 supports the <a href="http://www.huygens-fokker.org/scala/">de-facto standard Scala format</a> which is the most extensive and powerful, freely available program for microtonal, intonation and alternate tuning scales research and creation. Scala is just fantastic and has been around for decades already (I recall I wrote my first Scala file parser in the early 00s). </p><p>Creating your own Scala definition file does not require the Scala program, btw. It can be typed in Notepad, and the process is super simple. Maybe I’ll write a small article on how to get started with that if you express any interest. Or in any case, you might find that someone already did the job you are after and that the scale you are after is already part of the <a href="http://www.huygens-fokker.org/docs/scalesdir.txt">~5000 Scala files in stock</a> available as a <a href="http://www.huygens-fokker.org/docs/scales.zip">free download</a>.</p><p>As said, XFM2’s microtuning processing is extensive: there’s no restriction on the number of notes per octave you can use, nor the constraint of having the concept of ‘octave’ at all. Each note in the MIDI range could be assigned to anything. The Scala format also supports the concept of “flexible keyboard mapping”, but as long as there’s a way to specify the center note and tuning that notion is largely redundant. In short, there’s simply no limitations to what can be achieved in regard to microtuning.</p><p>You need to create or select 256 scales and collect all those .scl files in a folder. The files will be uploaded in the same order they appear in your folder, so in order to sort them it helps to add a number prefix to each file (i.e. “Standard.scl” -&gt; “000 - Standard.scl”). BTW, there’s no reason to have the first scale as the 12-tone standard tuning, but that’s the way it’s set in the factory bank and serves well as reference.</p><h2>#2 - Converting to XFM2 format</h2><p>Once you have the 256 .scl files (make sure you have that exact count), just extract the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/391h98gv6xmnsi9/XScala_100.zip?dl=0">XScala conversion utility</a> in the same folder, and run <em>XScalaConvert.bat</em>.</p><p>In a second or so, the script will convert all .scl files into binary (.bin), and then will stitch them together into a single composite file called <em>tunings.bin</em>. Also, it’ll create a <em>log.txt</em> file to conveniently keep a record of what’s in the file.</p><p>As mentioned above, the XScala utility allows to set any MIDI note as the scale center or reference point, with any specified tuning; just run <em>XScala</em> without any parameters for syntax details. But in general, that is not needed. XFM2 <em>transpose</em> and <em>tune </em>parameters will allow for keyboard shifting and retuning.</p><p>The <em>tunings.bin</em> file is then ready to upload.</p><h2>#3 - Uploading to XFM2</h2><p>The tunings are uploaded with our old friend XLoad. like the image, banks or programs. Syntax is:</p><p><strong>XLoad &lt;port&gt; -t &lt;file&gt;</strong></p><p>Here’s an example:</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1583320055222_5786"><div><p>That’s it. Now you have a whole new set of microtuning scales installed in your XFM2, and there’s now essentially no limits on how many scales you can use in your music :-)</p><p>Happy microtonalities!</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>The US market indexes entered bear market territory in March of 2020. It has been a long time since the US has experienced a bear market, 13 years to be precise.  Since the best way to learn about the present is to look at the past, it is a good time for comparing the last 10 bear markets before 2020.</p>



<p>They range in time from 1956 to 2020 and lasted between 18 and 87 months before a total recovery was achieved.  By almost any measurement, the current 2020 bear market is the mildest on record so far.  Lets look at the last 10 bear markets.</p>

<p>Looking at the data quite a few things stand out.  The average bear market lasts 42 months overall, but sees 35% drop in the stock market over 14 months before it recovers.  Lets look a little closer.</p>



<h3>How Often Do Bear Markets Occur</h3>



<p>Between 1956 and 2020 there have been a total of 10 bear markets.  This is spread out over 64 years for an average of 6.4 years between markets.   Our last bear market was all the way back in 2007, or 13 years ago.   </p>



<p>By the laws of averages we were way overdue.  Previously, the last longest time between bear markets was also 13 years with the bear market starting in 2000.  Also note, the 2000  bear market saw the second largest drop on record of 49.1%!</p>



<h3>How Long Do Bear Markets Take to Bottom Out</h3>



<p>Bear markets bottomed out over an average of 14 months from the time they begun.  The fastest a market every bottomed out was in 1987 with 3 months. </p>



<p>If the current bear market has bottomed out, and don’t assume it has, it would win the fastest drop to the bottom at a rapid 2 months.</p>



<h3>How Much Do Stocks End Up Dropping</h3>



<p>On average a bear market sees a 35% decline from peak to trough.  The all time peak was 56.8% caused by the great financial crises created by the housing bubble of 2007.</p>



<p>By comparison, 2020’s current max drop of -26.7% from peak is pretty tame.    Don’t assume that stocks have found the bottom though, as of August 2020 this is still a very young bear market.</p>



<h3>How Long Do They Last</h3>



<p>Bear market last 42 months on average, with the shortest on record at 18 months.  This is bad news for those that believe the 2020 bear market is already over.  If this ends up being true, it would be by far the shortest bear market on record.  Let’s just hope we don’t end up at 87 months, which is the longest on record.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>It is interesting to look back in time comparing the last 10 US stock bear markets.  It is impossible to say how bad the current bear market will get or how long it will last, but judging from the past bear markets it is likely not over yet.  </p>



<p>Considering the economic turmoil that we may still yet have in front of us, it is a good time to review your financial positions and make sure you are comfortable you can weather the storm.  Make sure your assets are diversified and that you are comfortable with your risk profile.  You should be very careful with any <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/speculating-vs-investing/">speculative</a> holdings that risk total loss.</p>

Warning: this is the perspective of a mathematician who tried and failed (twice)
as a youngster to learn piano (via sheet music and very old-schoool teachers).

Here are links to some music sites and videos that I have found helpful of late.

<p>
I've long consumed music voraciously, from Charles Alkan and Janelle Monae to
the Modern Jazz Quartet and Sean O Riada and Warren Zevon. I can pick out the
elements of a melody on a piano, but that's extent of my musical prowess. 
</p><p>

Many people find the basics of mathematics and the basics of music challenging. 
These two fields are of course related, something that has been known since the
time of Pythagoras and Plato.  Plenty of mathsy prople are musical, and sing or
play an instrument, but I am not one of them.  However, having mastered maths,
I'm curious if there is any hope of rewiring my brain to handle introductory
musical theory. I have no desire to sing or play guitar.
</p><p>

In the mathematical world, at the introductory level, there are thousands of
books, websites and videos out there that claim to teach novices the rudiments.
Do they succeed?  Some are much better than others, some are very good, and a
few others, frankly, are terrible.

</p><p>

As a seasoned teacher of mathematics, I certainly have strong opinions about
how to present that subject, while also being keenly aware that the hardest
topics to teach are the very basic ones.  The reason is partly that the easy
stuff seems to obvious to a seasoned pro that it's often hard to break it down
into terms that a newcomer will find helpful.

</p><p>

It also has to be admitted that there are issues with definitions and language,
we often use different words for the same concepts, and we sometimes say "or"
when we really mean "equivalently" (not "alternatively"). Furthermore, there are
notational and naming conventions that are seemingly random and lacking in logic.


</p><p>
It's no different for the basics of music.  Is a measure the same as a bar?
Do tonic and key mean the same thing?  What about scale and key?
The standard symbols for full, half and quarter notes (and their silent
equivalents, the rests "or" pauses) may have interesting historical origins,
but seem totally arbitrary and non-intuitive to a newcomer. In what sense is
4/4 different from 8/8?


</p><p>

There are some highly questionable websites and online videos that try and fail
to explain basic algebra, geometry and trig.  The writing or presenters may be
confident, enthusiastic and maybe even slick, but the cracks are obvious to one
familiar with the material.  From unfixed typos to outright howlers, dodgy hand
waving explanations, self-refential definitions, too much nitty-gritty detail
for beginners, bad habits encouraged, misguided tangents wandered off on, and
poor choice of order of the information provided, such websites and video cry
out for improvement.  Some have no business being available at all, as they may
do more harm than good.

        <div>
            <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p><em>The saying "You only get out what you put into it" applies to a lot of topics in life. This can also apply to food and health. However, when it comes to those import topics, people are usually not aware of what's good and bad for them and thus cannot decide which action plan to follow for themselves; myself included. That's why I decided to learn more on the topic (on my own), by following the recommendations of the book <a href="https://www.rayandterry.com/transcend/">TRANSCEND by Ray Kurzweil and Terry Grossman (MD)</a></em>.</p>
<p>Reading a 400+ pages books can be quite tedious if you are busy, thus I decided to write this article, which sums up (distills) the most important things to optimize for health and longevity (from my own point of view &amp; understanding; keep in mind I'm not a specialist). I still advise buying the book, as there is so much I didn't say there, and it provides explanations for all the statements it makes.</p>
<p><strong>This article will focus on 2 easily actionable concepts: supplement intake &amp; lifestyle changes</strong>. The book describe other critical concepts to achieve a better health, such as a regular exercise (it provides an easy-to-follow exercise routine, comprising aerobic, strength and flexibility exercises), which is not described here.</p>
<p>Young people won't likely need most supplements described in the article, although it's always better to acquire that routine soon enough to ensure it sticks. Around 30 years old and later, the body starts its <em>downward aging spiral</em>, and thus the TRANSCEND program becomes useful starting this age. However, this is not a reason not to have a healthy diet and exercise regularly before 30.</p>
<p>The overall goal of the book is to teach you how to extend your lifespan (using current scientific knowledge), which ultimately increases the probability you are still alive when life extension technologies come to the market (enabling you to live much longer).</p>
<p><strong>Before you start reading the contents of the article, please be reminded I'm not into the medical field at all (I'm a Software Engineer), and thus I cannot guarantee the validity of what I state. Always seek medical advice before implementing the article recommendations in your own life. I cannot be held responsible for any health issue incurred. I'll reference every piece of information to specific pages in the book for you to double-check and do your own search. Also, please be advised our bodies don't all work the same way, or you may have unknown conditions which render unsafe some supplement intake or lifestyle changes. Ensure any diet change is safe with your doctor.</strong></p>

<p>TRANSCEND (Nine Steps to Living Well Forever) is a book that was written in 2009 by <a href="http://www.rayandterry.com/bio-kurzweil">Ray Kurzweil</a> and <a href="http://www.rayandterry.com/bio-grossman">Terry Grossman</a> (MD), with the purpose of gathering all actionable present-day knowledge to enable people to live longer &amp; healthier.</p>
<p>Through our childhood, we have all been told about the good and bad food &amp; lifestyle choices for our health. Overall, this has worked well and is beneficial to us, but still, that's far from enough. We rarely check our body metrics, we never supplement except when we feel tired and need our shot of Vitamin C. Most of us are far from doing enough exercise, or those who do omit important kinds of exercise (they only focus on one kind of exercise).</p>
<p>If you are interested in buying the book, it is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Transcend-Nine-Steps-Living-Forever/dp/1605292079">available on Amazon</a> for less than $20. I highly recommend reading it using the references from this article.</p>

<p>Time for a plan. I organized it into <em>concepts</em>. It's important to consider each concept; as a whole they are inter-dependant and necessary for longevity.</p>
<p>I'm using raw lists for each concept, so don't be surprised. I find lists to be more effective for the reader (and writer!) than full texts.</p>

<p><img src="https://journal.valeriansaliou.name/content/images/2017/10/Sleep.png" alt="sleep"></p>
<p>Sleep is critical to achieve good, productive days. Also, it helps reduce your crave for caffeine; which is a stimulant that can cause all sort of side-effects when abused. You want to get better sleep, but not too much! <strong>Some sources say it's better for long-term health to sleep consistently 6 to 7 hours a night</strong>, while more hours of sleep has been linked to shorter lifespan (<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/02/15/us/study-ties-6-7-hours-of-sleep-to-longer-life.html">read this article</a>).</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally, you want to avoid caffeine in the day, and prefer a longer &amp; better night of sleep.</li>
<li><strong>To help with sleep, you may supplement with <em>(refer to p.18 in the book)</em>:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>L-theanine</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reason: Improves relaxation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>GABA</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reason: Tranquilizer.</li>
<li>Dosage: <code>500</code> - <code>1000</code> mg before going to bed (<em>as recommended in the book</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Melatonin</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reason: Sleep hormone (ie. it is useful for jet lag, to force sleep).</li>
<li>Dosage: <code>0.2</code> - <code>10</code> mg / day (<em>as recommended in the book</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>

</ul>
<h3 id="heart">Heart</h3>
<p><img src="https://journal.valeriansaliou.name/content/images/2017/10/Heart.png" alt="heart"></p>
<p>Heart disease is the most prevalent condition in the population; <a href="https://www.heart.org/idc/groups/ahamah-public/@wcm/@sop/@smd/documents/downloadable/ucm_470704.pdf">give a look to those whopping statistics</a> on the US population: <em>"cardiovascular deaths represented 30 percent of all global deaths"</em>. Luckily, their likelihood can be dramatically lowered by lifestyle changes and supplementation.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Main heart disease factors <em>(refer to p.34 in the book)</em>:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Factor 1</strong>: Optimize your cholesterol levels to reduce the risk of heart attacks in the future
<ul>
<li><strong>LDH cholesterol</strong>: The bad cholesterol, you want it lower</li>
<li><strong>HDL cholesterol</strong>: The good cholesterol, you want it higher</li>
<li><strong>It's all about your cholesterol ratios</strong>: Given <code>Total = LDL + HDL</code>
<ul>
<li>Total: <code>160</code> to <code>180</code> mg/dL in blood</li>
<li>LDL: <code>80</code> mg/dL in blood (or lower)</li>
<li>HDL: <code>60</code> mg/dL in blood (or higher)</li>
<li><code>Total / HDL</code> ratio: <code>2.5</code> (or less)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Generally, a lower LDL means you are much less at risk to suffer heart attacks</li>
<li><em>Get a blood test to control your cholesterol levels</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Factor 2</strong>: Lower the free-floating triglycerides in your blood (ie. free-floating fat)
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid alcohol and high glycemic carbohydrates</strong> (eg. avoid potatoes, white bread, white pastas and white rice, more generally all highly refined grains), as those add up triglycerides in your blood.</li>
<li>High triglycerides is a sign of metabolic syndrome (coming with a combination of high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low good cholesterol), <strong>which increase your risk of heart disease, diabetes and stroke</strong>. You want them low, but not too much as they are still required in the body for energy.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ways to optimize cholesterol levels <em>(refer to p.39 in the book)</em>:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>In your nutrition:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Avoid egg yolks</strong> (it's 220 mg of cholesterol per yolk, while the maximum recommended daily intake is 300 mg, and the one recommended by the book is only 100 mg)</li>
<li><strong>Reduce your general caloric intake</strong> (the liver produces 75% of your cholesterol — by itself — from carbohydrates, saturated fats and trans fats)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Supplement with:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Red yeast rice</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reason: Said to lower the risk of death by any cause by roughly 30%!</li>
<li>Dosage: <code>600</code> - <code>900</code> mg twice / day (<em>as recommended in the book</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Plant sterols</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reason: Lowers LDL cholesterol.</li>
<li>Dosage: <code>1800</code> mg twice / day (<em>as recommended in the book</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Policosanol</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reason: Lowers LDL and raises HDL cholesterol.</li>
<li>Dosage: <code>10</code> mg twice / day (<em>as recommended in the book</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Vitamin E</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reason: 75% fewer heart attacks (in an experiment).</li>
<li>Dosage: <code>200</code> UI twice / day (<em>as recommended in the book</em>)</li>
</ul>

<li>Dosage: <code>900</code> - <code>1800</code> mg twice / day (<em>as recommended in the book</em>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Ways to lower blood pressure <em>(refer to p.43 in the book)</em>:</strong>
<ul>
<li>The optimal pressure is less than <code>120/80</code> mm Hg</li>
<li>You want to reduce stress exposure in your life (also, reduce adrenaline levels, which incur stress)</li>

				<p>You can find an endless number of blog posts, conferences talks, and podcasts on fundraising for technology startups. <strong>Before you think about how to do it, think hard about why you want to do it.</strong> You don’t need to raise money to build a great, successful company. Most Venture-Capital-backed companies fail. That’s not a bug. It’s a feature of a system that depends on outliers. Power-law distributions dictate venture fund returns. The best-performing company is more successful than the sum of all other companies in a fund combined.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Power-Law---Version-B---Cut.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Power-Law---Version-B---Cut.jpg 600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Power-Law---Version-B---Cut.jpg 1000w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Power-Law---Version-B---Cut.jpg 1268w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>If you want to build an industry-defining company, you will likely end up taking Venture Capital. More money used wisely means more resources, more and better people, and a higher market share. Capital is abundant for early-stage startups right now, especially in the US. Additionally, to the well-known VCs (Benchmark, Sequoia, etc.), you have lots of small micro-VCs. Sector-specific funds. Scout funds. Professional angel investors and operator angel investors. AngelList launched the concept of “<a href="https://angel.co/blog/rolling-venture-fund-launch">Rolling Funds</a>” recently, leading to a Cambrian explosion of small funds over the next years. This concept commoditizes access to capital. Everybody who has access to an audience can raise a small fund. All of this is good for you as a founder. More funding sources means more choice, a higher likelihood of getting funded, and a more diverse and better investor pool. But, there’s a flip side to it: More bad actors and unsophisticated investors. I might follow up on how to best construct your funding round in this environment with a dedicated blog post. Regardless of the composition of the cap table, companies leveraging VC follow a similar trajectory.</p><h2 id="fundraising-is-a-series-of-step-functions">Fundraising Is a Series of Step Functions</h2><p>An investment announcement usually looks something like this: “<em>Company x raises a $yM Series-something</em>”. The first investment is generally called “Seed Round”, followed by “Series A”, “Series B”, etc. Nowadays, you can find more and more outliers. For example, a company that bootstraps then raises a large round once they have already achieved scale. Calling that “Seed Round” or “Series A” is misleading. The framework isn’t perfect. What matters is the logic behind the naming convention. <strong>Fundraising is a series of step functions.</strong> You make progress, achieve certain milestones, and leverage that to raise a funding round. Then you make more progress, hit more milestones, and raise money again. And so on. You must make sufficient progress. It must be a step function, and not just a small incremental increase.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Step-Functions---Cut.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Step-Functions---Cut.jpg 600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Step-Functions---Cut.jpg 1000w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Step-Functions---Cut.jpg 1600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Step-Functions---Cut.jpg 1983w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The first time I remember hearing about this framework was back in 2012. We just raised our first investment for Codeship, and <a href="https://twitter.com/cee">Carlos Espinal</a> walked us, and a couple of other founders, through the step function concept. No successful company looks the same. There are many paths to success. Yet, on average, companies progress through roughly the same stages:</p><p><strong>Founding Team</strong>: First, you assemble your founding team. Maybe you already have an idea, or even an initial product, perhaps not.</p><p><strong>Validation</strong>: Ideally, before you write a single line of code, you validate your idea. You ask yourself (and your team): Is the problem you are trying to solve painful enough for a broad enough audience?</p><p><strong>MVP (Minimal Viable Product)</strong>: Once you have sufficient conviction that the problem is “real”, you start building. “Building” doesn’t need to imply writing code. It could mean mockups and designs, whatever helps you validate the problem and your proposed solution further.</p><p><strong>PMF (Product-Market-Fit)</strong>: At this point, you have a full-blown prototype, early users, and high conviction. Your approach for solving the problem works, and you can measure the excitement of your initial users (engagement/retention metrics, first revenue, virality, etc.). Listen to <a href="https://greatness.floodgate.com/episodes/andy-rachleff-on-how-to-know-if-youve-got-product-market-fit">this podcast with Andy Rachleff</a> if you want to learn more about PMF<sup>[1]</sup>.</p><p><strong>Initial GTM (Go-to-Market)</strong>: Achieving product-market-fit feels like magic. Most ideas don’t make it to this point. Yet, the majority of startups that achieved PMF won’t result in successful companies. Now you need to figure out how to acquire more customers than your initial user/customer base.</p><p><strong>Scalable GTM</strong>: Growing beyond your initial users isn’t enough. To build an industry-changing company, you need to figure out how to grow efficiently at scale. Put $1 into the GTM motion and get many more $ back.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Step-Functions---Seed-Series-A---Cut.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Step-Functions---Seed-Series-A---Cut.jpg 600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Step-Functions---Seed-Series-A---Cut.jpg 1000w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Step-Functions---Seed-Series-A---Cut.jpg 1600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Step-Functions---Seed-Series-A---Cut.jpg 2293w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The above is a simplified but powerful view on how to build a high-growth technology startup. Various things matter depending on where you are in the journey. Your goals and objectives are different. The skills you need in your team are different, and also your fundraising depends on it a lot. If you want to learn more about the step function framework, I recommend <a href="https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/growth-academy-videos/">this presentation</a> from David Skok or <a href="https://www.unusual.vc/field-guide-enterprise/fundraising-milestones-valuations">this blog post</a> from John Vrionis. Both are terrific and incredibly successful early-stage investors. Next, I want to get into the specifics of raising money for an open source business. Open source companies are still companies. All the above applies. But, there are some significant differences you need to keep in mind. Most importantly, you need to achieve project-market-fit before working on finding product-market-fit.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/David-Skok-Presentation.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/David-Skok-Presentation.jpg 600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/David-Skok-Presentation.jpg 1000w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/David-Skok-Presentation.jpg 1600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/David-Skok-Presentation.jpg 1920w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><em>From David Skok’s 0 to 100 Presentation - </em><a href="https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/growth-academy-videos/"><em>Link</em></a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-importance-of-project-market-fit">The Importance of Project-Market-Fit</h2><p>Building a company around an open source project provides you with a considerable advantage in the context of the step function concept. <strong>The initial validation happens in public through the open source project.</strong> It also means that it takes you longer before you start building and offering an actual product. This is an important distinction. Product implies money. You create value, you charge for it. Even if initially, you let your early user try the product for free. If you diligently work with those first users, flipping the switch and charging for the product is relatively simple. Thanks to the ongoing feedback loop, qualitative and quantitative feedback &nbsp;(NPS, Sean Ellis Test, etc.), you know when you get closer to product-market-fit. You understand the value the product is creating for your users, and you can define a pricing model accordingly.</p><p><strong>It’s different with open source. You don’t have a product for quite some time.</strong> You don’t need one, and you shouldn’t have one. It will distract you from what matters. Your focus should be on generating traction with the open source project. Get early users, spend lots of time with them, fix their issues, and achieve project-market-fit. You can measure <strong>project-market-fit</strong> similarly to product-market-fit. NPS or the Sean Ellis Test both work for open source projects as well. You will get incredibly valuable insights by interviewing all your early users. But, you can’t start charging by flipping a switch once you are confident that you are creating enough value. You don’t have a product. “All” you have is an open source project. That’s not negative - quite the opposite. In the long term, this provides you with a vast go-to-market advantage. In the short term, it means that it will take you longer to get to product-market-fit. First, you need to achieve project-market-fit. Only then can you start building your proprietary product (assuming you will use <a href="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/open-core-first-principles/">Open Core as a monetization model</a>).</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Project-Market-Fit---Cut-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Project-Market-Fit---Cut-1.jpg 600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Project-Market-Fit---Cut-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Project-Market-Fit---Cut-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Project-Market-Fit---Cut-1.jpg 2128w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>This requires immense patience</strong> from you as a founding team, your whole company, and your investors. Finding investors that understand this progression is crucial. If you try to jump ahead, you won’t reap the benefits of having a successful open source project. It’s one of the reasons why open source companies always seem to have a slow start. The advantages become apparent over time. Once you provide a proprietary product on top of your open source project, you can start scaling and growing your revenue at a breathtaking speed (<a href="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/saas-and-moving-downmarket-mongodbs-transformation/">take a look how fast &nbsp;MongoDB scaled their SaaS revenue</a>). It’s hard to prove this by numbers because of the small number of public open source vendors (and the lack of historical data). I firmly believe it will become the “new normal” once some newer open source startups like Confluent or HashiCorp go public.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Step-Functions---Open-Source---Cut-1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Step-Functions---Open-Source---Cut-1.jpg 600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Step-Functions---Open-Source---Cut-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Step-Functions---Open-Source---Cut-1.jpg 1600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Step-Functions---Open-Source---Cut-1.jpg 2243w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>If it’s possible for you, you can also bootstrap until you have project-market-fit. </strong>Raising a seed round from great investors is significantly easier and doable with better terms if you can show that your open source project has already validated your idea. This option is particularly attractive if you are currently working on an open source project for a larger tech company and consider leaving and building a business around that open source project. The perfect time for leaving and founding your startup is after achieving project-market-fit (e.g., LinkedIn open-sourced Kafka in ~2011, and Confluent started in 2014).</p><h2 id="open-source-project-and-proprietary-product-focus-on-different-personas">Open Source Project and Proprietary Product Focus on Different Personas</h2><p><strong><strong>Your proprietary product monetizes a different persona than your open source project early adopters.</strong> </strong>This is critical to understand. It’s the reason why finding project-market-fit doesn’t automatically imply product-market-fit. A few weeks ago, I wrote about <a href="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/open-core-first-principles/">a simple framework to determine which features should be open source</a> and which capabilities should be proprietary. I recommend reading it. In a nutshell, the best approach is to open-source every feature that primarily creates value for the developer (or end-user). The monetization happens through manager/team or executive/organizational capabilities. Think advanced scalability, security, team/user/access management, or governance capabilities. &nbsp;Depending on your open source project, you might get some proprietary traction by simply offering it as a SaaS. This is an excellent first step, but not defensible long-term. If your differentiator is “running the project aaS”, other companies, including the large cloud providers, will do the same. Additionally, you need to build proprietary capabilities and serve the manager/exec persona.</p><figure><img src="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut-3.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut-3.jpg 600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut-3.jpg 1000w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut-3.jpg 1600w, https://www.moritzplassnig.com/content/images/2020/09/Open-Source-vs.-Proprietary-v2---Cut-3.jpg 2206w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The beauty of that approach is that you are moving up-market naturally.

    <article>
      
<p>On Thursday, September the 10th of 2020, three and a half months after the release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.senx.io/may-2020-warp-10-release-2-6-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.6.0</a>, we published the 2.7.0 release of Warp&nbsp;10. Some exciting new features and functions as well as a few optimizations and several bug fixes come with this new release.</p>



<h2>New Features</h2>



<p>Fetching the right data is the first step in creating fast and concise scripts for data analytics. That’s why Warp&nbsp;10 offers multiple parameters to precisely select the data you want. In the 2.3.0 release, <a href="https://blog.senx.io/warp-10-release-2-3-0/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we introduced skip, sample, and boundaries</a>. </p>



<p>In this 2.7.0 release, we introduce <a href="https://github.com/senx/warp10-platform/pull/772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">step and timestep</a>. <em>Step</em> allows you to get one point every <em>N</em> points by stepping over points. <em>Timestep</em> works similarly, but on time, allowing you to get one point every at least <em>N</em> time unit. These 2 parameters as well as the sample parameter let you choose a technique to subsample your data when using all of it is irrelevant.</p>



<p>While adding these new parameters, we noticed <code>Warp10InputFormat</code> was lagging behind in terms of functionalities. It was not offering the same parameters fetch had, so we updated it to make it on par with standard fetching. In Spark or Pig, you can now use both a time window and a count as well as boundaries and subsampling to fetch data from Warp&nbsp;10.</p>



<p>For those seeking performance while having a very high number of GTSs, we added the <a href="https://github.com/senx/warp10-platform/pull/777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labels priority feature</a>. This lets you define the order with which the labels are used to select the GTS you requested by a FIND or a FETCH. By prioritizing the most discriminating labels, you can improve the performance of FIND and FETCH. Remember that the benefit is only visible for a very high number of GTS, more than millions.</p>



<p>Finally, we modified the mechanism of custom JSON serializers<a href="https://github.com/senx/warp10-platform/pull/802" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> to make it easier</a> to implement. Instead of returning a raw string, you can choose between a raw string or a serializable object. This makes the serialization code easier to write and understand.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>FLoWS is Coming</h2>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FLoWS-1024x262.png" alt="FLoWS syntax" width="245" height="62" srcset="https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FLoWS-1024x262.png 1024w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FLoWS-300x77.png 300w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FLoWS-768x197.png 768w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FLoWS-1536x394.png 1536w, https://blog.senx.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/FLoWS-2048x525.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 245px) 100vw, 245px"></figure></div>



<p>We heard you! </p>



<p>WarpScript has a too steep learning curve for some of the new users. We will introduce the FLoWS language which will simplify the onboarding of new users by making functions input and output clearer. </p>



<p>What differentiates FLoWS from WarpScript is its functional approach, hence the name FLoWS for Functional Lineage of WarpScript. FLoWS is fully compatible with WarpScript, enabling the use of all core functions plus all those from extensions.</p>



<p>The 2.7.0 release is the first to be able to support FLoWS by providing the necessary functionalities for FLoWS to operate. Be sure to update to this release if you plan to use FLoWS!</p>



<p>We will release it very soon, be sure to keep an eye on the blog, or subscribe to the <a href="https://senx.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=322486758928f239c3698c600&amp;id=bc195bb85c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">newsletter</a> to be notified!</p>

<h3>Prior to the release of React Hooks, we all used class components, higher-order components and React lifecycle methods… they worked and are still working properly, but in some cases, they can also be a struggle to write. This so-called “old” style of writing code in React can sometimes be troublesome, unclean and hard to manage. And that’s where hooks come to the rescue! </h3>
<p>This new style of coding sets many ReactJS developers’ minds at ease. But wait, it sometimes isn’t that easy to just flip the switch and use hooks. There are plenty of projects that are fully based on class components… and then there’s the unfinished projects. </p>
<p><strong>What do we do with those? How do we approach further development of such cases? Well, I’ll give you some of the answers right here.</strong></p>
<p>The focus of this blog will mainly be a comparison between class component and hooks style of coding, as well as what to do to transfer between the two. But before we start… if you would like to read more about the basics of using React Hooks, take a look at my previous blog post which explains <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.bornfight.com/blog/how-to-create-custom-reactjs-hooks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to write custom hooks in React</a>.</p>
<h4>Let’s get started with ReactJS hooks</h4>
<p>Apps in React always revolved around using class components for stateful or smart components, and function components for stateless or dumb components. React’s core methods and properties such as state, lifecycle methods and re-rendering based on a change of state could only be used in sturdy class components. That is exactly why those types of components were mostly used inside projects. Such components made the magic of React work and were a correct way of using all the goods that the library offered. </p>
<p>In addition to them, functional components were used on the bottom level — structurally speaking. This solely means that the last, hierarchical part, which presents the view layer itself, was mostly functional components. It is a part of the app which doesn’t need state as it gets the data from their parents and renders elements to the client. </p>
<p>Class-based components are often used along with HOCs or Higher-Order Components. HOCs represent a function that takes a component as an argument and returns an upgraded component (which can be stateful or stateless). It is a pattern used for connecting class components to external packages such as React Router and Redux. keep this in mind as it will be one of the factors used for translating from classes to function components with hooks.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/bornfight_blog_bubalo_remote_body01-1536x864.jpg 1536w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>
<p>On the other side of the story, the new proposed way of doing React coding is with hooks. Hooks represent a way of “hooking” into React’s methods, and providing access to all of the great features that React is offering within a function component. Since hooks enable you to use the state, function components are no longer named stateless components. Writing code using hooks makes a ton of stuff more trivial to implement. It makes the code cleaner, more DRY and reusable, simpler and easier to work with… and that is especially true when it comes to maintenance, upgrading and adding new features. All in all, React hooks greatly reduce the amount of code one has to write. </p>
<p>Another aspect of hooks that is very important to remember is that hooks cannot be used within class-based components. That is because they already have a way of using React’s methods… but there is a catch. HOCs can be used to provide hooks functionality to the class-based components. Since HOC is actually a function, it can use all of the hooks that React provides and pass data as props to a class-based component.</p>
<p><strong>Here’s an example of such a case:</strong></p>
<pre>const authStateHOC = (WrappedComponent) =&gt; {&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;const initialState = createContext({&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;authState: {&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;email: "",&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;password: "",&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;},
&nbsp;});&nbsp;&nbsp;

const authStateContext = useContext(initialState);&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;
return (&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &lt;WrappedComponent&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; {...props}&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp; value={authStateContext.value}&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp;setValue={authStateContext.setValue}&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;/&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;);&nbsp;&nbsp;
};</pre>
<p>So yes, components can actually be tweaked using the HOC pattern to enable the usage of hooks inside class-based components. However, this is not suggested as the HOC pattern is something that developers are moving away from. Hard issues that HOCs solved, such as reusing logic, are now all in hooks. On top of that, by using this pattern you could end up lost in callback loop hell.</p>
<h4>So what’s the solution?</h4>
<p>React docs suggest that class-based components will not be deprecated with newer versions. But it also does not recommend writing class components anymore, since hooks are considered the future and a way to go. It is stated that further development should be done with the new hook syntax. Why? Because everything that was possible with class-based components is now achievable by using hooks… and in a much simpler way.</p>
<p>So, what should we do with class components then? Well, refactoring could be an option, but it isn’t mandatory because support for classes isn’t going anywhere. Also, it could end up really costly if we were to look at time consumption and/or project’s financial status. And this is especially true if the project is massive in scope. </p>
<p>While it might sound amazing to rewrite applications in order to use hooks, it does come at the cost… and that should not be treated lightly. If you do end up taking the refactor approach, take into consideration all that it would take to rewrite the code, so that it can use hooks… for example, how long will it take, or how many people need to be working on it.</p>
<figure><img src="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_brozovic_fixed_price_body04.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_brozovic_fixed_price_body04.jpg 1920w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_brozovic_fixed_price_body04-300x169.jpg 300w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_brozovic_fixed_price_body04-768x432.jpg 768w, https://www.bornfight.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bornfight_blog_brozovic_fixed_price_body04-1024x576.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></figure>
<p>The second way revolves around writing all of the new code with function components and hooks. And when you see yourself working in an older environment with classes, try to refactor a component or a couple of them to use hooks. Every time you go back and modify or update a particular feature which previously used classes, try rewriting it into hooks. This approach will allow you to slowly, but surely improve your codebase… and make it simpler and easier to maintain.</p>
<p>Quite a big number of libraries now offers support for hooks. For example, the aforementioned React Router and Redux (which are one of the most popular packages available for React) support it. They are used in almost every React app. This also suggests that if your project used, for example, the container pattern with HOCs, you can now use it much more easily with hooks. It also offers hooks such as useDispatch, useSelector and more. The router is more accessible with useHistory, useParams and useLocations hooks.</p>
<p><strong>Hooks can do everything a class component can… and their reusable, clean and simplified functions are just another reason to implement them into your workflow.</strong></p>
<h4>Let’s conclude this story of hooks and class components</h4>
<p>Many paradigms and patterns are moving more and more toward functional programming. Functional programming has so far solved or simplified problems that developers have been facing when using the object-oriented programming paradigm… problems such as getting lost in the obscurity of the code, or its WET state. </p>
<p>With functional programming, developers can focus on more items of importance, such as proper implementations and problem-solving. Also, keep in mind that refactoring an application is not a mandatory procedure, and you should always consider what’s best for your team and the project itself.</p>

					<p dir="ltr"><strong>Can a team of hard-core backend developers do marketing?</strong></p>
<p>One of the main marketing challenges I faced over and over again was how to do effective marketing with a minimal or nonexistent budget. I always relied on the people I worked with, getting them to write, design and help me build creative campaigns. This didn’t prepare me for my next marketing challenge, though: &nbsp;no marketing budget and 5 out of 6 team members being developers––everyone but me. I decided to build our marketing strategy around the thing my team does the best: coding.</p>
<p>Here are some of the techniques we used in order to get from a few hundred to 100K unique visitors in three months (to our website, blog, and mini-sites). It’s a proof the new marketer is techier than ever.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Coding content</strong></span></h3>
<p>You don’t need great writing skills (or any at all) if you have exclusive, fascinating data. One of the first companies to use this technique for content marketing was OKCupid, which mined its database to answer important questions like “Do taller guys have more sex?” You can find the answer <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-biggest-lies-in-online-dating/">here</a>. The first time we published content that relied solely on developers’ work was pretty random. When we had to choose in which Amazon region we wanted to store our data, we ran some tests and found out there was a big difference between the regions. Sounded like an interesting story. We spent an extra day improving our script and making sure we got the data right. The output was super interesting––the AWS Olympics. The results were featured on VentureBeat and published on our blog, bringing massive traffic of our target audience––over 15,000 unique visitors.</p>

<div id="attachment_202"><p><a href="http://www.startupmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/VB.png"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-202" title="Our AWS Olympics featured on VentureBeat " src="http://www.startupmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/VB.png" alt="AWS Olympics " width="615" height="574" srcset="http://blog.oribi.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/VB.png 854w, http://blog.oribi.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/VB-300x279.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 615px) 100vw, 615px"></a></p><p id="caption-attachment-202">Our AWS Olympics featured on VentureBeat</p></div>
<p dir="ltr">That post might have happened by mistake, but when we saw its impact we decided that about 10% of the developers’ time would be dedicated to writing apps and scripts which would result in data for content marketing. The next “coding marketing” project was completely planned and “engineered” to get high traffic. My first decision was to build something around GitHub. Just because it’s a hot topic? Well, yes. We wrote a small app that relied on the GitHub API and downloaded the 30,000 most popular projects. Then we wrote a script that analyzed all the projects and produced a list of all the libraries used in these projects. The outcome was fascinating: we identified the most popular libraries today and what the leading trends were. Writing the code and analyzing the results took us about three days. The result: over 40,000 unique visitors to our blog, most of them developers.</p>

<p>Here are a few other examples of content our developers created:</p>
<p dir="ltr">– The Anatomy of a Great Stack Overflow Question (After Analyzing 10,000) – <a href="http://www.takipiblog.com/2014/02/03/the-anatomy-of-a-great-stack-overflow-question-after-analyzing-10000/">link</a></p>
<p dir="ltr">– The Logging Olympics – A Race Between Today’s Top 5 Java Logging Frameworks – <a href="http://www.takipiblog.com/2013/12/18/the-logging-olympics-a-race-between-todays-top-5-logging-frameworks/">link</a></p>
<p>Our target audience is developers, so all of the examples above are pretty technical. However, I truly believe this method can work for other markets. Most of the large websites/ services offer some kind of API, and using it wisely can uncover amazing data.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Mechanizing market research – what happens when you replace an analyst with a developer?</strong></span></h3>
<p>When I decided content marketing would be our main channel, I started researching other sites and blogs. My goal was to learn what content tends to be more popular, which posts gain more engagement, and what the hottest topics concern. It took a while. So,</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">We wrote a script that sorted blog posts according to the number of shares, using Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and LinkedIn APIs.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">We ran it on a few dozen blogs (technical blogs, blogs of other companies).</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">The result was a list of all the popular posts in different blogs. That was a great starting point from which to choose the focus of our blog. By easily comparing content which spread well vs. less popular content, I was able to recognize trends I wasn’t aware of. Here are some examples from this research on content that is likely to be popular: comparing different products, any case study that involves an interesting company (one paragraph about Twitter’s backend can make a post fly through the roof), data and benchmarks.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">Another interesting “extension” we wrote was a tool that helped me analyze the titles of successful posts. I believe a great title does 30% of the work. I was able to see which words appear more often, whether it is better to use short or long titles, and what the effect of numbers in the title is. You can read more about it here: The dark science of naming your post, based on studying 100 posts (<a href="http://www.startupmoon.com/the-dark-science-of-naming-your-post-based-on-studying-100-blogs/">link</a>).</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3 dir="ltr"><span><strong>Slice and dice – cut an existing part of the product and launch it as a new one</strong></span></h3>
<p dir="ltr">This is a very interesting strategy, as it enables creating great content with minimal investment. The idea behind this approach is taking one feature from the existing product and launching it as a completely new product (I’m not talking about a core feature that might compete with your main product.) Here are some advantages of recycling parts of your code:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">You’re able to put up a pretty nice app within a day or two.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">This app doesn’t need to generate revenue so it can be very light and even silly.</p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr">A brand new product is great marketing material, and it’s relatively easy to get some attention to it. Here is a list of all the websites that are dedicated to new products; just by putting a service in a few of these places, you can gain thousands of visits. <a href="https://github.com/mmccaff/PlacesToPostYourStartup">Places to post your startup</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p dir="ltr">Here’s an example of how a minor feature got to play the main role in marketing. One of our UI elements is presenting the flow of the code. Instead of using text we have this cute element:</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="http://www.startupmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/metro.png"><img src="http://www.startupmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/metro.png" alt="metro" width="484" height="415" srcset="http://blog.oribi.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/metro.png 484w, http://blog.oribi.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/metro-300x257.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 484px) 100vw, 484px"></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">In no way is this Takipi’s core technology. In two days we built the “<a href="http://stackifier.takipi.com/scala.html">Stackifier</a>,” an app that allows developers to paste their stack trace (a file with the input of the app) and see it in a nice and organized way. &nbsp;It’s not a “wow” product, nor one we can charge for, but it’s a practical tool. We got about 10,000 visitors in the month of the launch, and we still have some new users coming to the “Stackifier.” We mention that this tool was built by Takipi, and put it under our domain. About 10% of the visitors continue on to check out what Takipi is.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.startupmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/stackifier.png"><img src="http://www.startupmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/stackifier-1024x598.png" alt="stackifier" width="819" height="478" srcset="http://blog.oribi.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/stackifier-1024x598.png 1024w, http://blog.oribi.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/stackifier-300x175.png 300w, http://blog.oribi.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/stackifier.png 1416w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px"></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">Of all the different marketing channels this one has the best conversion rate of installations; that is, a user coming to Takipi from the Stackifier is more likely to install Takipi than a user coming from our blog. I realized that users are more likely to convert to the same action: if they’re reading, they’re more likely to read something else, if they’re playing, they’re more likely to play a different game, and if they’re testing a new product–you know the answer.</p>
<p>Some other interesting examples:</p>
<p>Visual.ly used its broad set of infographics tools and created a super-focused product to reach out to a specific type of users: marketing managers. They launched the “<a href="https://create.visual.ly/graphic/google-analytics">Google analytics report</a>” which automatically creates a weekly report based on Google analytics, presented as an infographic.</p>
<p>HubSpot used parts of their blogging software and recently launched the “<a href="http://www.hubspot.com/blog-topic-generator">HubSpot Blog Topic Generator</a>.” It’s more of a fun game than a product, but it’s a great and cheap marketing tool.</p>
<h3><span><strong>Using existing APIs to create amazing content in a few hours</strong></span></h3>
<p>This great post made me think of using existing APIs to create a new site which would drive traffic to Takipi: &nbsp;<strong>Stop Writing Blog Posts: Ideas for Interactive Content</strong> (<a href="http://www.portent.com/blog/design-dev/stop-writing-blog-posts-ideas-for-interactive-content.htm">Link</a>). I decided to go with a calendar. We created java2014.org and scala2014.org. It’s a simple calendar, with all Java and Scala events for this year. We outsourced collecting all the events and used ODesk to build the events list. It’s useful, has high SEO potential and drives nice traffic of very targeted users.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.startupmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshotJava.jpg"><img src="http://www.startupmoon.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshotJava.jpg" alt="screenshotJava" width="644" height="622" srcset="http://blog.oribi.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshotJava.jpg 920w, http://blog.oribi.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/screenshotJava-300x289.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 644px) 100vw, 644px"></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">In the three weeks after launching it, we had about 4000 Java developers visiting the site. It might sound cheesy, but in a way, I feel it’s very honest marketing: you really give value to the prospects, even if they don’t visit your website. Check out : <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">MapBox</a>, <a href="http://arborjs.org/">Arbor.js</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://timeline.knightlab.com/">TimelineJS</a>.</p>

<p>xm is a tiny compiler for HTML that adds</p>
<ul>
<li><code>&lt;import&gt;</code> tag to inline external HTML files</li>
<li><code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;fill&gt;</code> tags to define slots and fill them with content</li>
<li><code>&lt;markdown&gt;</code> tag to portal into Markdown</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>xm CLI comes with a <strong>dev mode</strong> that compiles and serves built HTML.</p>
<p>Furthermore xm is built on top of <a href="https://posthtml.org/#/cli">posthtml-cli</a> and therefore it is <a href="https://posthtml.org/#/cli?id=options">extensible</a>.</p>
<h2 id="install">Install</h2>
<pre><code>npm i -g xm</code></pre><h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<pre><code>Usage: xm &lt;command&gt; [options]

Commands:

  dev     Compiles HTML files on change and serves the root folder
  build   Compiles the HTML files once
  help    Displays help

Options:

  --root       Folder to compile (default ./)
  --output     Output (destination) folder. This is necessary only when using xm build
  --htmlOnly   Compile and copy only the built HTML files</code></pre><h4 id="import-element"><code>&lt;import&gt;</code> element</h4>
<p>Allows to inline (import) HTML files into the current one.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;import href="file.html" /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Paths are relative.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- src/folder/index.html --&gt;

&lt;import href="file.html" /&gt;
&lt;!-- file.html -&gt; src/folder/file.html --&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can prefix paths with <code>/</code> to make them absolute i.e. relative to the <code>--root</code> value.</p>
<pre><code>$ xm build --root ./src
# &lt;import href="file.html" /&gt;
# -&gt; ./src/file.html</code></pre><h4 id="importing-markdown-files">Importing markdown files</h4>
<p>xm supports importing <code>.md</code> (markdown) files too. When importing such files the front matter declarations are converted to <code>fill</code> elements.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;style&gt;
  /* theme */
&lt;/style&gt;
&lt;import href="README.md" /&gt;</code></pre>
<p>💡 This feature can be used to generate styled docs sites for your open source project!</p>
<h4 id="slot-and-fill-elements"><code>&lt;slot&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;fill&gt;</code> elements</h4>
<p>HTML files can define <code>slot</code> elements with an attribute <code>name</code>. slots can be filled when importing HTML files using the <code>fill</code> tag.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- base.html --&gt;

&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;

  &lt;h1&gt;About&lt;/h1&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;welcome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/main&gt;</code></pre>
<p>You can also define a special unnamed <code>slot</code> that will be filled with the <code>import</code> children that are not <code>fill</code> tags:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;!-- base.html --&gt;

&lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;
&lt;footer&gt;&lt;slot name="footer"&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;&lt;/footer&gt;

<![CDATA[Jenkins Is Getting Old – and We Need an Alternative]]>

September 15, 2020 | https://microtica.com/jenkins-is-old-we-need-an-alternative/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://microtica.com/jenkins-is-old-we-need-an-alternative/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div>
<p>By far, Jenkins is the most adopted tool for continuous integration, owning nearly <a href="https://www.datanyze.com/market-share/ci--319/jenkins-market-share">50% of the market share</a>. As so many developers are using it, it has excellent <strong>community support</strong>, like no other Jenkins alternative. With that, it has more than 1,500 plugins available for continuous integration and delivery purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We love and respect Jenkins. After all, it’s the first tool we encountered at the beginning of our automation careers. But as things are rapidly changing in the automation field, Jenkins is <strong>left behind with his old approach</strong>. Even though many developers and companies are using it, most of them aren’t happy with it. Having used it ourselves on previous projects, we quickly became frustrated by its <strong>lack of functionality</strong>,<strong> numerous maintenance issues</strong>,<strong> dependencies,</strong> and <strong>scaling problems</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We decided to investigate if other developers face the same problems and quickly saw the need to create a tool ourselves. We asked some developers at last year’s AWS Summit in Berlin about this. Most of them told us that they chose Jenkins <strong>because</strong> <strong>it’s free</strong> in the first place. However, many of them expressed interest in trying to use some other Jenkins alternative.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When using Jenkins, teams tend to make more mistakes with the delivery and end up with <strong>broken pipelines</strong>. As a result, they implement inefficient practices, can’t adopt agility well, and lose the flexibility to innovate. When problems come up, you instantly need an expert that will resolve the issues to unblock developers.</p>



<p><strong>So if you’re using Jenkins out of necessity, now is the time to switch!&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p><strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica</a> is a Jenkins alternative with modern DevOps in its foundations. Say goodbye to plugins and dependencies, late maintenance nights, backup, scaling, patching issues.</strong></p>



<h2>Solving modern problems with old technology</h2>



<p>CI servers date back to the mid-2000s when containers and microservices weren’t so popular. Coming from this pre-cloud era, Jenkins is designed primarily for manual installations. It doesn’t really help in taking the <strong>maximum advantage of Docker containers</strong> to create modern infrastructure. Docker integration is handled through multiple plugins (around 30 different ones are available with the name “docker”). For a world that is Dockerized, this is not what you’re looking for in a CI tool.</p>



<figure><ul><li><figure><img src="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm-1024x839.png" alt="" data-id="2814" data-full-url="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm.png" data-link="https://microtica.com/?attachment_id=2814" srcset="https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm-1024x839.png 1024w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm-300x246.png 300w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm-768x629.png 768w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm-1536x1259.png 1536w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm-488x400.png 488w, https://mk0microtica2di3k2co.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/jenkins-plugins-sm.png 1600w" sizes="100vw"></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>Challenges arise with access management, configuration usability, and setting up jobs. Even with a <em>Jenkinsfile</em> that helps you define the job structure, you need to recreate new jobs from scratch. With the CLI, you need to have good knowledge of how Jenkins stores its configurations, and the documentation doesn’t really help you there at all. The tool is hard to learn, especially from a beginner’s perspective.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All in all, Jenkins setup is hard to create, maintain, and automate. <strong><a href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica</a> requires a single YAML file to define pipeline configurations (microtica.yaml), which makes it one of the simplest Jenkins alternatives.</strong></p>



<h2>Maintenance nightmares</h2>



<p>Jenkins requires a lot of maintenance, so you need to have dedicated experts to resolve problems efficiently.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You need to create and manage scripts to orchestrate everything. Even the core concepts of a deployment pipeline like build, artifact, environment, variables, steps, triggers, workflows, applications and services, rollback, testing, and monitoring <strong>all require a Jenkins job or script to manage</strong>. Hardcoding a deployment pipeline with scripts doesn’t work in today’s world of public clouds, containers, and microservices.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Doing this will bring more problems than benefits since you have to maintain those scripts as technologies and applications change and evolve. In the end, you <strong>spend more time maintaining</strong> then deploying new versions of the product. Your DevOps team should be <strong>innovating</strong> around your deployment process, not dealing with broken pipelines. Your pipelines should be dynamic and easily adaptable to changes by the ecosystem.</p>



<p><strong>With <a href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica</a> as a Jenkins alternative, you need NO additional setup and maintenance. You deploy in minutes so that developers focus on writing code and spend less time maintaining the tool.</strong></p>



<h2>Plugin overload</h2>



<p>Plugins are great as they can provide extensibility to a system’s core functionalities. But, what happens when you have to use a plugin for everything, even basic tasks? Build for a Docker environment, Kubernetes, pull from GitHub, authentication… All pretty common tasks, for which you need to <strong>install and maintain a plugin</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Jenkins has 1500+ plugins available today. How do you decide which one to use? Most of them are written by third parties, which means they can lose support without any notice.</p>



<p>Also, worth mentioning is the dependency chain. Many services change all the time, making plugin <strong>dependencies very problematic</strong> and one of the most common causes of broken pipelines. This doesn’t really provide availability and stability.</p>



<p>Plugins require developers to install and configure them before they can start working. <strong>With <a href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica</a>, you can start working right away! No need to use plugins and maintain them to build a complete solution.</strong></p>



<h2>Microservice support</h2>



<p>Jenkins was born way before microservices became popular. So it does a very poor job of supporting microservices. Especially the <strong>observability and monitoring</strong> aspects when having a more significant number of microservices, each having its own pipeline process.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With no support for integrating and testing multiple services at once, Jenkins lacks essential functionalities for microservice applications.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica</a> is a Jenkins alternative that offers multiple pipelines and automates your entire CI/CD microservices process. With integrated production-ready Kubernetes, you can deploy all your microservices in just a few clicks and monitor how they’re running &amp; detect issues.</strong></p>



<h2>Continuous delivery</h2>



<p>Continuous integration is part of the entire continuous delivery process, but you need more than CI to achieve a company maturity in CD.&nbsp;</p>



<p>With Jenkins, you can try and build a CD platform yourself, but be aware you’ll need a whole team for it, a load of time and maintenance.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica</a> enables you to define complex cloud infrastructure through full integration with AWS and Kubernetes. Automate your deployments and deliver on the cloud with confidence. </strong>If something fails during deployment, Microtica has the ability to rollback the environment to a previously successful state. This is especially important for a production environment, where system availability is a must.</p>



<p>Microtica also integrates with communication tools to enable software delivery teams to collaborate seamlessly.</p>



<h2>Wrap up</h2>



<p>Jenkins comes with a limited set of features. You need plugins to integrate with a lot of tools we use in today’s ecosystem. The biggest pro of Jenkins is that it is used and managed by the community, so you can mostly find answers to your questions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Jenkins is best for:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>On-premise solutions</li><li>Code hosted in-house&nbsp;</li><li>Highly customized workflows</li><li>Companies that have the resources to dedicate a team to manage and maintain it</li><li>Companies that don’t want to spend on a tool</li></ul>



<p><a href="https://microtica.com/" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microtica,</a> on the other hand, <strong>covers both infrastructure provisioning and delivery of applications on Kubernetes, so you don’t have to use additional tools for that</strong>. In Microtica, with a few clicks, you can set up an entire Kubernetes infrastructure (plus databases, storages, cache clusters, etc.) and automate the delivery.</p>

<p>When I ask people whether or not they know what Qt is, they have either never heard of it, or know pretty well what it is. And usually the people who know what it is, have used it for software development, or simply built it because some other piece of software needs Qt. For you who don’t know what Qt is, I’d say without quoting Wikipedia or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.qt.io/" target="_blank">our own web site</a>, that Qt is a software platform with which you can easily create software that after written once, runs on all platforms supported by Qt. Meaning that you could have your calculator app running on an infotainment screen in your car, any desktop operating system, phone, tablet… you name it, but it would always run because of Qt. Honestly, the amount of supported target devices is huge. But to be able to support all these target devices, we at <strong>The Qt Company</strong> need to ensure that your app actually works everywhere. That’s, where our <strong>Continuous Integration</strong> (CI) comes in.</p>



<p>We spawned over <strong>4 million virtual machines</strong> during 2019, with the intent of testing something perhaps you created. Qt is <strong>open source</strong>. Anyone can suggest or implement a new feature or fix a bug they might have found. Your commit would then be peer reviewed and thrown in the mouth of the CI. The CI’s job is either to accept the change and merge it into the code base, or reject it when it doesn’t pass the vigorous testing done to it.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coin_for_blog-1024x453.jpg" alt="" width="768" height="340" srcset="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coin_for_blog-1024x453.jpg 1024w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coin_for_blog-300x133.jpg 300w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coin_for_blog-768x339.jpg 768w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coin_for_blog-1536x679.jpg 1536w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/coin_for_blog.jpg 1708w" sizes="(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px"></figure></div>



<p>The back bone of our CI is <strong>OpenNebula</strong> along with <a href="https://testresults.qt.io/coin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Coin</a>. Coin is our own tool which monitors <a href="http://codereview.qt-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gerrit</a> for any changes staged for the CI. Coin is quite complex actually and does the work of figuring out what exactly needs to be built or tested. One staged commit in Gerrit causes a cascade of events where Coin requests OpenNebula for dozens of virtual machines at a time followed by yet dozens if not hundreds. One staged commit in Gerrit can in some cases produce over 2000 virtual machines, running various Windows, Linux and macOS distributions. These virtual machines compile the new code both natively and by cross compiling to different target architectures / devices and they also run automated tests.</p>



<p>The important task of <strong>maintaining the life cycle</strong> of all these virtual machines lands in the hands of OpenNebula. OpenNebula monitors the capacity of our infrastructure and queues up all requests it can’t handle yet due to lack of computing capacity on the servers. It keeps a constant eye on the servers watching that they respond and are healthy and takes them offline for maintenance if something goes amiss.</p>



<p>The <strong>orchestration of the virtual machines</strong> happens on the fly. Coin knows what needs to be built, and in the request for a virtual machine it defines the amount of CPU and RAM we wish to have, all depending on the task at hand. OpenNebula takes care of creating these virtual machines instantly using backing files over the network and not by doing slow deep clones out of the VMs.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grafana_for_blog.jpg" alt="" width="688" height="431" srcset="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grafana_for_blog.jpg 917w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grafana_for_blog-300x188.jpg 300w, https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/grafana_for_blog-768x481.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 688px) 100vw, 688px"></figure></div>



<p>Combined with an SQL database, OpenNebula stores all the data about what it has done. This allows us to collect that data and send it to <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> for easy tracking. There we can further visualize the loads in different time scales combined with the graphs from the servers as well. And OpenNebula’s <strong>support for custom hooks</strong> enables us to do various things whenever OpenNebula goes from one state to another with a virtual machine, further allowing us to <strong>optimize or track the performance</strong> of our CI system.</p>



<p>With the support of VNC within OpenNebula, we can go in to the desktop view and watch the progress within the virtual machine, and possibly start debugging a problem. We can also leave VMs up and running for longer periods of time, if we enable breakpoints in our flow so that in case of a test failure, we stop right there and allow a developer to go in and have a look.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/one_for_blog_.jpg" alt="" width="912" height="408"></figure></div>



<p><strong>Setting up OpenNebula</strong> is or can be very easy. Sometimes the flexibility of a software can be its downfall. If the software is too generic or works by dozens of plugins there’s a risk that the learning curve is too steep. Naturally, the more you can change the behaviour, the more you must also answer questions about how you want it to work. OpenNebula is quite flexible in those areas in which it works, yes, but luckily we have pretty good documentation regarding those other tweaks—at least if you ask me. And the OpenNebula dev team hasn’t thrown in a bunch of plugins that are not related to the core idea that’s behind it.</p>



<p>The documentation actually provides us with the means of <strong>self implementing drivers</strong> we use, and we even did so when we implemented the support for <a href="https://www.parallels.com/">Parallels</a>. So instead of only running virtual machines via KVM (in Linux), we can also run them in Parallels (in macOS). The code for the drivers isn’t very complex either, so by looking at the existing code you can quite easily figure out what you need to do and whether you might need to start working on your own driver.</p>



<p>The last piece of the puzzle is then how OpenNebula really doesn’t care about how these build servers came to be. We use <a href="https://maas.io/">MAAS</a> to automatically deploy our servers. After the fully deployment process, we have a server online which OpenNebula can connect to. Add the server to the list and it is ready to serve. Ta-da!</p>



<p>I’m eager to see if some day in the near future OpenNebula incorporates Grafana and MAAS as a part of their standard delivery… Although this again starts to sound a bit like the plugin world where everything seems so complex, when all you wanted to do was schedule tasks on hosts, right? Maybe, sometimes, a tool is simply just complete and good enough to perform its original purpose? Wasn’t Winamp actually ready at 2.91? 😉</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
        <p>I’ve got a big news to share with you today - after (over) 9 years of
development, <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude">Emacs Prelude</a> finally made it to version 1.0! There’s nothing
really big or groundbreaking there, as Prelude has been in a pretty good place for a very
long time feature-wise, but I felt like tagging a 1.0 release, because it’s 2020 and
all sort of crazy things are happening the entire year. Most of you probably
don’t know this, but Prelude was one of my first open-source projects<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>,
that’s why making it to 1.0 means a great deal to me. Open-source projects are a
product of love, plain and simple.</p>

<p>I know that Prelude has probably lost some of its significance in the era of
Spacemacs, Doom Emacs, and a myriad other great Emacs distributions with more
features, sophisticated plugin systems, bells, whistles, kitchen sinks, and all that jazz, but
I don’t really care. I’m happy that we made it so far, I’m glad that Prelude was
the gateway to Emacs for many people, I’m proud of the community we’ve built,
I’m proud that it inspired many other distributions to go in different
directions, and I’m proud that Prelude always stood true to its core philosophy:</p>

<ul>
  <li>simple</li>
  <li>easy to understand and extend</li>
  <li>stable</li>
  <li>a foundation for you to build upon, as opposed to some end-user product that you’re supposed to use as-is</li>
</ul>

<p>This means that it intentionally doesn’t pack all the bells and whistles that it could.
Prelude aims to enhance the classic Emacs experience without deviating a lot from it - e.g.
it would never enable something like <code>evil-mode</code> (vim keybindings) by default and so on.</p>

<p>All the third-party packages that it bundles are carefully vetted and are known to be of
good quality and to have reliable maintainers. That generally means that Prelude’s unlikely
to immediate adopt some shiny new package, that has established tried and true alternatives.</p>

<p>I know some people were pissed/disappointed that in recent years Prelude didn’t
change much, but for me this was never a problem - it was actually a feature, in
the same way that stability is a feature for Clojure. Fewer changes mean fewer
breakages, fewer things to learn, fewer confused users, etc. They also mean that
I believe that in terms of functionality and experience Prelude is where I want
it to be. Believe it or not, from time to time software projects are (mostly)
done.  Yeah, there’s always some room for more improvements, but after a certain
point the return on investment is simply not worth it (or even worse - it
becomes negative).</p>

<p>I’m always amused by how many people come to CIDER’s issue tracker reporting basic
issues with packages like <code>sayid</code> and <code>clj-refactor</code> (CIDER plugins) that were automatically
installed and enabled by their distribution. Most casual CIDER users don’t need those
packages and the complexity that comes with them, and power users can obviously
install and configure the packages themselves. That’s not a good user experience
in my book, and it’s a classic example of the power of the “less is more”
philosophy. Prelude bundles only CIDER (no extensions) and it just works.
Same with many other programming languages.</p>

<p>Rest assured that Prelude will continue to evolve in the future, but don’t
expect anything massive to change.  Lately I’ve been pondering switching to
<code>use-package</code> for the internals, although I don’t see a strong reason to do so,
and to leverage more of LSP here and there. Leveraging some Emacs 27 features is
also on the agenda. Better documentation would be an awesome improvement as
well!<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p>

<p>One thing I’ve vowed to do going forward is to keep a better track of changes
and to tag releases more often. As a result the project finally has a
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md">changelog</a> and
better contribution templates. I plan (hope) to cut a couple of “stable” releases 2-3
times a year. I also plan to find a couple of co-maintainers to ensure I can
retire quietly down the road, but I’m in no rush to do this.</p>

<p>I guess that was one pretty weird release announcement, but that’s the release
announcement I felt like writing.  Thanks to everyone who helped and used
Prelude for almost a decade! I love you all! Keep hacking!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-526">

<div>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><strong>Google Maps</strong> is an excellent – probably the best – solution for displaying an interactive map on your website. A few years back, though, they decided to put a limit on their free API, beyond which you begin getting charged. While this decision makes total sense, and the free limit is high enough for most use cases, it has an important drawback: to use the API, you need to create an account, providing a valid credit card. That can be no issue for a one-off site, but if you are a web developer can cause a few headaches, as you have to ask each client to create a billing account and enable the required APIs. Clients can get overwhelmed by that, and supporting them could eventually cost you a few extra hours of work.</span></p>
<h2>The alternatives</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Therefore, searching for an alternative using data from <strong>OpenStreetMap</strong>, which has no such limits, was the reasonable thing to do, at least for projects that need no complex implementations, but just a map with a few locations on it (which is the majority of my projects). Searching at the WordPress’ repository can give you plenty of such plugins. More or less, they fall in two distinct categories:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Those that organize locations as custom post types, retrieving the maps with shortcodes. Some of them are quite powerful, with a handful of features. Managing them, though, becomes too complicated. First, you need to (sometimes painstakingly) create your locations either as post types or as repeater fields on a single post type, one location at the time. Then, you get a shortcode which you have to paste on the post/page that you want the map to appear. Those plugins can be excellent solutions for more complicated maps, but not practical enough for our simple use case. Also, <em>using shortcodes when you can have Gutenberg blocks is like sending a fax when you can use email</em>.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Gutenberg blocks. They are not many, and they are more user-friendly, but they usually require you to copy the locations’ coordinates, which makes them OK but not great.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>The ideal requirements</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So, if there were no restrictions at all, how would we want a simple map block to work, for it to be as easy as possible for the non-tech-savvy content manager? After all, Gutenberg allows us to think out of the box here (or should we say, out of the block?). Based on my own needs, I identified the following requirements:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It should be a Gutenberg block. No shortcodes, and no custom post types. The whole functionality should exist entirely inside the post/page hosting the map.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">It should work out of the box. No setting of API keys, and no options to be set beforehand. Just click on the block and start adding your locations.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You shouldn’t have to manually add coordinates. Just point and click on the map to drop a marker.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A marker’s popup should be allowed to accept formatted text, links, and images.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">We live in the Gutenberg era. You don’t need a separate text field to add your popup’s content. You can just open the popup and start typing in it.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The map should remember the zoom level that you last set when adding your markers.</span></li>
<li><span data-preserver-spaces="true">You should be able to adjust a few basic things on the map, like height, minimum and maximum zoom, dragging, and clicking behavior.&nbsp;</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the end, we should end up with something like this:</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img src="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/ootb-openstreetmap.gif" alt="" width="1462" height="980" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201462%20980'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></span></p>
<h2>UX challenges</h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Building the above functionality turned out to be relatively straightforward on the technical front. <strong>Gutenberg</strong>, <a href="https://leafletjs.com/" rel="noopener noreferrer">leaflet.js</a> and <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenStreetMap</a> were all the tools that we needed. In the process, though, a few interesting UX challenges came up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<h3>Removing a marker</h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Click-and-drop is probably the most straightforward way to add markers. How do you remove them, though? In general, how should you deal with marker-specific options? For example in a future version of the plugin, you will have the option to add a different icon per marker.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Well, that was an easy one: just keep those options inside the marker’s popup.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img src="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup.png" alt="" width="1195" height="519" srcset="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup.png 1195w, https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup-500x217.png 500w, https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup-1024x445.png 1024w, https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup-768x334.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1195px) 100vw, 1195px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201195%20519'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup.png 1195w, https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup-500x217.png 500w, https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup-1024x445.png 1024w, https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup-768x334.png 768w" data-lazy-src="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/popup.png"></span></p>
<h3>Accidental drops</h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Click-and-drop markers is a great feature but it can easily get problematic in two scenarios: when you accidentally quick-click anywhere on the map, and when you click and hold intending to drag.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To work around this issue, a small delay has been added, to create an “opportunity window” where you can perform the drop. That way, accidental quick clicks will have no effect. Similarly, if you fail to release the click quickly enough, you miss your window, as it assumes that you intend to drag.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To identify the opportunity window and make it apparent to the user, the cursor changes to a crosshair, and a notice pops up.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img src="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/drop-marker.gif" alt="" width="616" height="482" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20616%20482'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></span></p>
<h3>Drop an overlapping marker</h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">When you haven’t zoomed enough and you click-and-drop too close to an existing marker, the new marker appears on top of the old one and you can’t tell if the drop was successful or not unless you either zoom in or drag the marker to see if there is another one underneath. Solving this was as simple as adding a CSS animation to the dropping marker.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Not only does that make the dropping apparent, but it makes our interface more visually appealing, and it’s just a few lines of CSS. Win-win, in all regards!</span></p>
<h3>Sane minimum and maximum zoom levels</h3>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The map allows you to set the maximum and minimum limits that the user can zoom on the frontend. What if you set a min-zoom higher than the max-zoom, or a max-zoom lower than the min-zoom? Of course, you could always ignore the illogical values on your frontend, or let leaflet.js deal with it with whatever way it does, but still, your admin interface would make no sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">To fix this, we need to make sure that whenever one value goes beyond the limits posed by the other, the other value gets updated as well. As a bonus, setting the same minimum and maximum zoom will lock the frontend zoom at that level, practically disabling it.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true"><img src="https://www.gsarigiannidis.gr/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/zoom-limits.gif" alt="" width="263" height="539" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20263%20539'%3E%3C/svg%3E"></span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">So far, the plugin has been tested only by me, though I saw no serious bugs. It will probably need some polishing here and there, as well as some important additions. More specifically, the development roadmap includes, among others, features like separate icons per marker, an option to change the map’s colors and styles, a way to import and export the markers to a JSON file, and, probably the most important, a location finder with autocomplete capabilities, as a complementary way of adding locations.</span></p>
<p>In fact, I consider the location search to be an essential tool for the plugin’s UI to be complete. It’s a big feature, though, which needs some good thinking and careful implementation to make it as user-friendly as possible. So, I thought I’d release that basic version first, so that people start using it, and fix possible bugs before continuing to implement new features.</p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">If you think that the above functionality would work well for your needs as well, you can give the plugin a try, downloading it either from <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ootb-openstreetmap/" rel="noopener noreferrer">wordpress.org</a> or from <a href="https://github.com/gsarig/ootb-openstreetmap" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a> and let me know about your impressions in the comments.</span></p>

<p>Many people think Big Idea Productions died because of the lawsuit brought against it by Lyrick Studios over general market distribution rights to VeggieTales home videos.&nbsp; While it is fair to say that it was the loss of that lawsuit that forced Big Idea into bankruptcy, it certainly wasn’t the only factor causing Big Idea’s downfall.&nbsp; Others believe the money spent producing and marketing our first movie, Jonah, brought the company down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Originally I had hoped to produce and release the film for less than $15 million total.&nbsp; When the final production and marketing costs came in at nearly twice that, our hopes of recouping our investment vanished.&nbsp;&nbsp; In the end our distributor got all of its marketing investment back, but not a penny made it back to Big Idea to recoup the money we had spent producing the film.&nbsp;&nbsp; So surely that killed the company, right?&nbsp;&nbsp; Not exactly.&nbsp;&nbsp; These two factors were certainly the straws that broke the camel’s back, but the camel was pretty sickly before Jonah even began production, and long before the owner’s of Barney the Dinosaur and Bob the Builder turned a litigious eye toward Bob and Larry.</p>
<p>So what killed Big Idea?&nbsp;&nbsp; Pour yourself some tea, and I’ll tell you the real story.</p>
<p>We Americans love to be ranked.&nbsp;&nbsp; People magazine keeps track of our “50 Most Beautiful People.”&nbsp;&nbsp; Forbes tracks the “400 Wealthiest Americans” and the “200 Highest-Paid Entertainers.”&nbsp;&nbsp; Not to be outdone, every year Inc. magazine puts out a list of the 500 fastest growing private companies in America.&nbsp;&nbsp; These companies tend to be on the small side, but for whatever reason, they’re growing like gangbusters.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inc. tracks and ranks them all, and then the entrepreneurs behind each company can hang the magazine cover in their conference room and beam like proud parents when their friends notice their amazing fast-growing-ness.</p>
<p>If I had put a lot of value on such lists or if Inc. magazine had noticed us, it’s fairly likely Big Idea would have made the list a year or two.&nbsp;&nbsp; Between 1996 and 1999 our revenue grew by 3300%, from $1.3 million to $44 million.&nbsp; Pretty impressive by anyone’s standards.&nbsp; But by early 2000, just as Jonah was headed into production, the company was in serious financial trouble. How could that be, you ask?&nbsp; Let me tell you.</p>
<p>It’s interesting to note that only one-out-of-three companies that make the Inc. list repeat their appearance the following year.&nbsp;&nbsp; What happens to the rest?&nbsp;&nbsp; Many see their growth stall, never to fully recover.&nbsp;&nbsp; Others simply cease to exist.&nbsp;&nbsp; Vanish.&nbsp;&nbsp; You see, when a small company experiences extremely rapid growth, it soon ceases to be a “small company.”&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet just because it no longer qualifies as “small” doesn’t necessarily mean it is now “big.”&nbsp;&nbsp; In other words, just because you’re no longer “Tim’s Software Hut” doesn’t necessarily mean you’re “Microsoft.”&nbsp;&nbsp; And somewhere in the middle, many, many companies fail.</p>
<p>Inc. magazine noticed this dynamic and had several business researchers look into it.&nbsp;&nbsp; What emerged was a picture of a treacherous period in any business’s growth when a company finds itself “too big to be small yet too small to be big.”&nbsp;&nbsp; The researchers dubbed it “No Man’s Land.”</p>
<p>The year was 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp; VeggieTales was booming in a big way, and I was taken off guard by the success.&nbsp;&nbsp; Frankly, I thought 1996 was amazing, yet here was 1997 making 1996 look like… well, 1995!&nbsp;&nbsp; Every year since 1993 every VeggieTales video had sold more than the year before, and the trend seemed to be continuing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could remember the days when Christian publishers wouldn’t return my calls, and now the Wall Street Journal was calling for an interview!</p>
<p>In the midst of this mayhem, I read the book Built to Last, a classic business study of what makes great companies great.&nbsp;&nbsp; The analysis of the Walt Disney Company struck me as particularly relevant, and I found myself asking the question, “Do I just want to make a few films to leave behind when I’m gone, or do I want to build a company that can keep making great films for the next 100 years?”&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer seemed obvious.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to build the next Disney.</p>
<p>By the time I finished the book I had a new vision for Big Idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; We would attract top artists from all over the country. We would build a culture of biblical values and great storytelling.&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, the big one: The book said you needed to pick a “Big, Hairy Audacious Goal,” or a “BHAG” in Built to Lastparlance. Golly gosh… what was my “BHAG?”&nbsp;&nbsp; Hmm. I wasn’t sure.&nbsp; I had always felt that God wanted me to tell the stories and teach the lessons he laid on my heart, but he hadn’t given me any particular big, hairy audacious goal.&nbsp; But the book said I needed one to inspire and focus my employees. Okay… deep breath… “We will build a top-four family media brand within 20 years!”&nbsp;&nbsp; Huh? Where did that come from?&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no idea.&nbsp;&nbsp; All I knew was that now I had my “BHAG.” And if it was going to come true, we were going to have to get a lot bigger. What I didn’t know was that my new path would take us right smack through “No Man’s Land.”&nbsp;&nbsp; (Cue sinister score here.)</p>

<p>I try to be a friendly citizen of the web. I try to keep my site in good
   shape. It should load quickly, track nothing beyond your basic server logs,
   not hassle you about cookies, GDPR or my newsletter. I do have a newsletter
   but it won't pop up in your face here. I try to stay firmly on the side of
   friendly and a good experience in how I run this site.
</p>
<p>I do these things because I want my site to be not just bearable but an
   actually great experience in its own quiet way. Just
   as important to me as replying to email in a reasonable timeframe, doing
   what I've told people I will and following up on things that require my
   attention. I try my best and I want this to also be true for my website.
   As a consequence it also happens to have a perfect Lighthouse score most
   of the time.
</p>
<p>A while back I had an idea that smells a bit funny.
   It has the scent of some poor web ethics. But it may also be a very useful.
   I'm not the first to discover it but I also haven't seen a lot about it.
   It seems to be usable for reasonable things but it is also somewhat
   abusable. Also, it definitely breaks the principle of least astonishment
   (or least surprise) in that it makes your browser do things you do not
   expect.
</p>
<p>I'm talking about <strong>tracking users via CSS</strong>. So one of the
   potential downsides of only knowing your traffic via server logs is that
   <a href="https://plausible.io/blog/server-log-analysis#the-total-number-of-unique-visitors">they are not a very good
      indicator of readership</a>
   as outlined by the Plausible Analytics people. Lots of automated traffic
   on the web, bots, crawlers and scrapers. So if there is a way that can
   remove most of the automated traffic without loading any JS, is that a win?
</p>
<p>Consider this CSS:</p>
<pre>    body:hover {
        background-image: url("https://underjord.io/you-was-tracked.png");
    }
</pre>
<p>There are endless ways to do it. This has a certain elegance because it
   actually requires mouse interaction. You could probably cover accessibility
   with some use of <code>:focus</code> as well. CSS won't load the URL until
   the selector is hit and it will only load it once for a given page view.
   You'd want a separate URL per page, which is trivial enough, query params
   would likely be enough. I'm convinced that this would give me better data.
</p>
<p><em>I am</em> <strong>not</strong> <em>going to be implementing it.</em>
   I think it's mostly fine to use things like Plausible or Fathom that are
   privacy-oriented analytics platforms because it is a lot better than what
   was going on before and I think the exchange between visitor and site isn't
   entirely clearcut. The negotiation is implicit and the browsers set the
   outer boundary terms. But what we do within that space is what determines
   our character. And I think the best way to serve my audience is to be
   mindful of this stuff, not stare myself blind at the numbers and keep
   working to maintain the trust and attention I've built up.
</p>
<p>The ugly side is that there are things that you can do to indicate every
   single link your users hover, even if they are blocking all JS. You can
   absolutely use this to do things I consider somewhat of an overstep that
   are probably just table stakes in the analytics space. One could also
   measure how long people stay using invisible animations, doing the same
   thing I believe.
</p>
<p>But it is a neat hack and I hadn't really thought about the possibility
   before. It is already somewhat known. I haven't checked who does and doesn't
   do this. So I figured I'd share. Because I do like a neat hack.
</p>
<p>If you want to register your opinion in the aggregate you can just click one
   of the following links and you and all the bots will be recorded in the
   server logs:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://underjord.io/it-is-evil.html" target="_blank">It is evil</a></li>
<li><a href="https://underjord.io/it-is-not-evil.html" target="_blank">It is not evil</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Where do you draw your lines on privacy? Are there things sites are fine to
   do to understand their traffic and visitors or should even the server log
   be abolished?</p>
<p>I'm genuinely curious how you feel. Feel free to get in touch via <a href="mailto:lars@underjord.io">lars@underjord.io</a> or just find me on Twitter as <a href="https://twitter.com/lawik">@lawik</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Net Neutrality: European Court of Justice ruling on ISP 'zero rating' services]]>

September 15, 2020 | https://decoded.legal/blog/2020/09/the-end-of-zero-rating | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://decoded.legal/blog/2020/09/the-end-of-zero-rating">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            <p><img src="https://decoded.legal/blog/content/images/20200915121345-person_pointing_at_screen.jpg" alt="Person pointing at green text on screen"><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The Court of Justice of the European Union has <a href="http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf;jsessionid=FF6118823515E4E307895CFC0627E18A?text=&amp;docid=231042&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=req&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=2438278">ruled in its first case</a> on the interpretation of the EU's "open Internet" regulation — known by some as the "net neutrality" framework.</p>

<p>The Court was asked to consider the issue of "zero rating", in the context of two packages offered by Hungarian telco Telenor:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>‘My Chat’ is a package which enables subscribing customers, first, to purchase 1 GB of data and use it without restriction until that data has been used up, accessing freely the available applications and services. Moreover, the use of six specific online communication applications, namely Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, Twitter, Viber and Whatsapp, which are covered by a ‘zero tariff’, is not deducted from that 1 GB data limit. Secondly, the ‘My Chat’ package provides that once the 1 GB of data has been used up, subscribers may continue to use those six specific applications without restriction, whereas measures slowing down data traffic are applied to the other available applications and services.</p></li>
  <li><p>‘MyMusic’ is a package available in three different formats, ‘MyMusic Start’, ‘MyMusic Nonstop’ and ‘MyMusic Deezer’, respectively, which are accessible to customers with a pre-existing internet-access services package. Those formats enable subscribers, first, to listen to music online using four music streaming applications in particular – Apple Music, Deezer, Spotify and Tidal – and six radio services, and the use of those ‘zero tariff’ applications and services is not deducted from the data volume included in the format purchased. Secondly, the ‘MyMusic’ package provides that once that data volume has been used up, subscribers may continue to use those specific applications and services without restriction, whereas measures blocking or slowing down data traffic are applied to the other available applications and services.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>In essence, users can buy a package which lets them use any services they want, up to their data allowance, but which lets them use certain, specific services as much as they like: traffic to and from those services does not count towards their data allowance. Once the user has used all of their data allowance, access to other services is blocked or degraded, but they can still access these specific services.</p>

<p>The CJEU was asked to look at four specific questions, which it condensed into one: is the approach to zero rating taken here compatible with either or both Articles 3(2) and Article 3(3) of the open Internet Regulation.</p>

<p>The Court's answer was that such a service is incompatible with both. The Court said that those services:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li><p>are incompatible with Article 3(2) of Regulation 2015/2120, read in conjunction with Article 3(1) of that regulation, where those packages, agreements, and measures blocking or slowing down traffic limit the exercise of end users’ rights, and</p></li>
  <li><p>are incompatible with Article 3(3) of that regulation where those measures blocking or slowing down traffic are based on commercial considerations.</p></li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>



<p>The Court limited its finding in respect of Article 3(2) to the situation in which the measures in question "limit the exercise of end users' rights".</p>

<p>The Court analysed whether this was the case for the measures here, and concluded that it was. However, its determination on this point is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the conclusion of such agreements <em>on a significant part of the market</em> is liable to limit the exercise of end users’ rights, within the meaning of Article 3(2) of Regulation 2015/2120 (my emphasis)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Moreover, the Court felt that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>the greater the number of customers concluding subscription agreements to such packages, the more likely it is that, given its scale, the cumulative effect of those agreements will result in a significant limitation of the exercise of end users’ rights, or even undermine the very essence of end users’ rights</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Does this give a provider scope to argue about the uptake of a particular package, and whether it is sufficiently limited that it poses no risk?</p>

<p>Or whether any limitation of rights is likely to be "significant"?</p>

<p>Or what if the "zero rated" services just consumed data at a lesser rate, rather than zero rate?</p>

<p>Or what if the user could pick which services fell within their zero rating bundle? (Although perhaps not appealing to communications providers, especially if they have commercial agreements with the zero-rated services.)</p>

<p>Possibly, if Article 3(2) was the only barrier to overcome.</p>

<p>But it's not. And the decision on Article 3(3) seems to be the nail in the coffin here, if zero rating leads to some services being degraded.</p>



<p>Even if a provider could find some way to wiggle around Article 3(2), the Court's ruling on Article 3(3) offers little assistance.</p>

<p>While providers can adopt "reasonable traffic-management measures", these must be based on "objectively different technical quality of service requirements of specific categories of traffic", and not on "commercial considerations".</p>

<p>Is there scope to argue that the kind of zero rating at issue here is not based on "commercial considerations"? Not really:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In particular, any measure of a provider of internet access services in respect of an end user [which is one of the zero rating approaches described above], which, without being based on such objective differences, results in the content, applications or services offered by the various content, applications or services providers not being treated equally and without discrimination, <em>must be regarded as being based on such ‘commercial considerations’</em>. (my emphasis)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second, the Court reiterated the requirements of the Regulation, that the measures must be only a fixed period and must be limited to those necessary to comply with a legal obligation, to preserve the integrity and security of the network or to prevent or remedy network congestion.</p>

<p>The Court ruled that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>all measures consisting in blocking, slowing down, altering, restricting, interfering with, degrading or discriminating between specific applications or services cannot be considered reasonable within the meaning of the second subparagraph of Article 3(3) and must, therefore, in themselves be regarded as incompatible with [these requirements]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is no need, the Court said, to assess the impact of the measures of end users' rights, because that is not a factor in assessing compliance with Article 3(3).</p>



<p>I wish I had some thing pithy and wise to say here. But I don't.</p>

<p>On its face, the ruling appears to pose a considerable challenge to communications providers which currently offer zero rated services. And, while the ruling in terms of Article 3(2) seems to offer some room for manoeuvre, this appears to me to be taken away by the blunt finding in terms of Article 3(3) if the outcome would be blocking or degrading of services.</p>

<p>I suspect some operators will look to see what they can do within the parameters of the judgment. If they can find a way to continue to offer zero rated services without triggering Arts 3(2) and 3(3), they may well do so. For example, by zero rating certain services only while a user has credit which lets them also access other services, a provider may be able to argue that Article 3(2) is satisfied, and Article 3(3) is not triggered.</p>

<p>Or perhaps we’ll see an end to zero rating. Is this a bad thing? It depends on your perspective.</p>

<p>These packages are attractive to telcos and, presumably, are attractive to some customers too.</p>

<p>But, if you are trying to launch a competing service to one included in a zero rating bundle, and traffic to your service comes out of a user's data allowance while traffic to your competitor's service does not, well, you've got another barrier to entry to overcome.</p>

<p>We'll need to see how this pans out but, seemingly, this is a pretty clear strike against many current approaches to zero rating.</p>

            <!-- content --><p>The world of training big AI models is no longer the realm of a desktop or a few servers. Big AI research organizations are using thousands of accelerators to train huge models. Google, a major force in AI training, designs its own accelerators and systems to use both for internal purposes, as well as to rent via the Google Cloud platform. At Hot Chips 32 (2020) we had the chance to learn a bit more about the Google TPUv3 and the improvements over <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-enables-tpu-v2-pod-training-gcp/">TPUv2 pods</a>.<span id="more-46464"></span></p>
<h2>Google TPUv3 at Hot Chips 32</h2>
<p>Starting with the basic building block, the chips under the cold plates in the cover image above, this is the basic block diagram for the TPUv3. One can see the two cores, their vector, scalar, matrix multiply, and transpose/ permute units. There is HBM memory as well. One can see PCIe connectivity to a host as well as a high-speed interconnect.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46470" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46470"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-tpuv3-discussed-at-hot-chips-32/hc32-google-tpuv3-overview-diagram/" rel="attachment wp-att-46470"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram.jpg" alt="HC32 Google TPUv3 Overview Diagram" width="1370" height="747" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram.jpg 1370w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-400x218.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-800x436.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-696x379.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-1068x582.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Overview-Diagram-770x420.jpg 770w" sizes="(max-width: 1370px) 100vw, 1370px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46470">HC32 Google TPUv3 Overview Diagram</figcaption></figure>
<p>A big change with TPUv3 is that the matrix multiply units are doubled, just like the HBM capacity. This is an ugly image as we took it from the PDF version of Google’s talk. The presented version did not have the diagram over the text. It is somewhat amazing that Google can make massive AI training systems and index the world, but Google Slides gives this kind of export to PDF experience in 2020.</p>
<figure id="attachment_46469" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-46469"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/google-tpuv3-discussed-at-hot-chips-32/hc32-google-tpuv3-architecture/" rel="attachment wp-att-46469"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture.jpg" alt="HC32 Google TPUv3 Architecture" width="1458" height="580" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture.jpg 1458w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-400x159.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-800x318.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-696x277.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-1068x425.jpg 1068w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/HC32-Google-TPUv3-Architecture-1056x420.jpg 1056w" sizes="(max-width: 1458px) 100vw, 1458px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-46469">HC32 Google TPUv3 Architecture</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are a number of other improvements beyond the MMU and HBM capacity doubling. The core frequencies, memory bandwidth, and interconnect link bandwidth all went up by 30% as well. When you see “4x nodes” in this diagram below, that is referring to the number of nodes per pod is scaling to 4x the previous generation (1024 up from 256.)</p>

<p>The TPUs are connected via a 2D Torus network for high-speed accelerator communication. There is also a PCIe link to host machines that provide the link to storage.</p>

<p>Taking a step back here, there are quite a few people who think that this is completely different from what NVIDIA is doing. As we showed in our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/inspur-nf5488m5-review-a-unique-8x-nvidia-tesla-v100-server/">Inspur NF5488M5 review</a> as well as our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-dgx-a100-leapfrogs-previous-gen/">NVIDIA DGX A100</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-dgx-a100-superpod-detailed-look/">NVIDIA DGX A100 SuperPod look</a>, NVIDIA is doing something similar. We can even look back to our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/a-quick-hardware-overview-of-deeplearning12/">DeepLearning12</a> Tesla P100 build and see a similar theme. The NVIDIA A100 (and V100’s) have an interconnect on a HGX-2/ HGX A100 board. That scales from 4x A100 GPUs <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-tesla-a100-4x-gpu-hgx-redstone-platform/">HGX Redstone Platform</a> up to 8 or 16 GPUs per platform with <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/nvidia-nvswitch-details-at-hot-chips-30/">NVSwitch</a>. Interconnect is NVIDIA-Mellanox Infiniband that with GPUDirect RDMA and effectively bypass going to the host to get on the training fabric. For storage, one goes back to the host system and storage is via another NIC.</p>

<p>There are a few differences and some significant ones, but we just wanted to point out that there are, indeed, a lot of similarities in how the solutions are built at a high-level. From this high-level, we are comparing a BMW to a Tesla (car) rather than a BMW automobile to a bullet train.</p>
<p>The TPUv2 Google showed using large air coolers. With the TPUv3 we get liquid cooling which means a lower server height. As a result, the standard rack seems to have gone from the TPUv2’s 4×8 four across and eight high of TPUv2 boards to 2×16 of TPUv3 boards.</p>

<p>There are other changes, however, at the system level, we have 4x the number of accelerator chips but 9-10x the petaflops and 8x the memory. We can also see a big change to the cabling connectors on the left side of these nodes.</p>

<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>The TPUv3 was announced in 2018 so hearing talk on it with a lot of obfuscated details in 2020 seems strange. This is especially so given the relatively open manner NVIDIA offerings are discussed. That may be due to NVIDIA having partners and a stack that is scaling from low-power to high-power chips and software across multiple domains. Still, we wish Google had used its multiple talks at Hot Chips 32 to go into more detail about the systems themselves especially since we are around two years after TPUv3 announcement. Google tends to be relatively opaque on its hardware (e.g. there is very little public information on the company’s Arm CPU usage.) Facebook and Microsoft tend to be much more open, AWS is somewhere in the middle. At this point, given Google’s scale, they are hard to imitate except for the other hyper-scale outfits. While it is great to see more, we wish Google would let its engineers show off their engineering prowess a bit more.</p>

            <h2>Abstract</h2>

            <p>
              3D photography is a new medium that allows viewers to more fully experience a captured moment.
              In this work, we refer to a <i>3D photo</i> as one that displays parallax induced by moving the viewpoint (as opposed to a stereo pair with a fixed viewpoint).
              3D photos are static in time, like traditional photos, but are displayed with interactive parallax on mobile or desktop screens, as well as on Virtual Reality devices, where viewing it <i>also</i> includes stereo.
              We present an end-to-end system for creating and viewing 3D photos, and the algorithmic and design choices therein.
              Our 3D photos are captured in a single shot and processed directly on a mobile device.
              The method starts by estimating depth from the 2D input image using a new monocular depth estimation network that is optimized for mobile devices.
              It performs competitively to the state-of-the-art, but has lower latency and peak memory consumption and uses an order of magnitude fewer parameters.
              The resulting depth is lifted to a layered depth image, and new geometry is synthesized in parallax regions.
              We synthesize color texture and structures in the parallax regions as well, using an inpainting network, also optimized for mobile devices, on the LDI directly.
              Finally, we convert the result into a mesh-based representation that can be efficiently transmitted and rendered even on low-end devices and over poor network connections.
              Altogether, the processing takes just a few seconds on a mobile device, and the result can be instantly viewed and shared.
              We perform extensive quantitative evaluation to validate our system and compare its new components against the current state-of-the-art.            </p>

<p>In today’s world, data has played a huge role in the success of technology giants like Google, Amazon, and Facebook. All of these companies have built massively scalable infrastructure to process data and provide great product experiences for their users. In the last 5 years, we’ve seen a real emergence of AI as a new technology stack. For example, Facebook built an end-to-end platform called <a href="https://code.fb.com/core-data/introducing-fblearner-flow-facebook-s-ai-backbone/">FBLearner</a> that enables an ML Engineer or a Data Scientist build Machine Learning pipelines, run lots of experiments, share model architectures and datasets with team members, scale ML algorithms for billions of Facebook users worldwide. Since its inception, millions of models have been trained on FBLearner and every day these models answer billions of real-time queries to personalize News Feed, show relevant Ads, recommend Friend connections, etc. &nbsp;</p>



<p>However, for most other companies <strong>building AI applications remains extremely expensive</strong>. This is primarily due to<a href="https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/06/forget-agi-lets-build-really-useful-ai-tools/"> a lack of systems and tools</a><strong> </strong>for supporting end-to-end machine learning (ML) application development — from data preparation and labeling to operationalization and monitoring [1][9][10][11]<strong>.</strong></p>



<p>The goal of this post is 2-fold: </p>



<ol><li>List the challenges with adopting AI successfully: data management, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring; </li><li>List the tools I think we need to create to allow developers to meet these challenges: a data-centric IDE with capabilities like explainable recommendations, robust dataset management, model-aware testing, model deployment, measurement, and monitoring capabilities.</li></ol>







<figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/eHHhzc1HYAh18oRETgjri9drWQpHZwF6OkyDRJ5E4r9YxSwqRViLC6LDTOt4UGLhdg0zMmTj7ScuMCOStrJk_jcmLqRrOkm5z7qIDjEIsyeIi8vpw3q8wAhltmiWA3LfUjDGcT3J" alt=""></figure>



<p>In order to build an end-to-end ML platform, a data scientist has to go through multiple hoops of the following workflow [3].</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/O29ZMh7AatXlnuiH8_QAxbnpcxrVvl_ioNedmGNdks2QMDJbSWt-XpN757fu41qtdpoNgZ_kNYWBOV70s8LSGnMjA96sfW7A6FVX2naSq1Ukav1WlnmD3br_gw4ijLGnG8DDg1L9" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><strong>End-to-End ML Workflow</strong></p>



<p>A big challenge to building AI applications is that different stages of the workflow require new software abstractions that can accommodate complex interactions with the underlying data used in AI training or prediction. For example:</p>



<p><strong>Data Management</strong> requires a data scientist to build and operate systems like Hive, Hadoop, Airflow, Kafka, Spark etc to assemble data from different tables, clean datasets, procure labeling data, construct features and make them ready for training. In most companies, data scientists rely on their data engineering teams to maintain this infrastructure and help build ETL pipelines to get feature datasets ready. </p>



<p><strong>Training models</strong> is more of an art than science. It requires understanding which features work and what modeling algorithms are suitable to the problem at hand. Although there are libraries like PyTorch, TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn etc, there is a lot of manual work in feature selection, parameter optimization, and experimentation.</p>



<p><strong>Model evaluation</strong> is often performed as a team activity since it requires other people to review the model performance across a variety of metrics from AUC, ROC, Precision/Recall and ensure that model is calibrated well, etc. In the case of Facebook, this was built into FBLearner, where every model created on the platform would get an auto-generated dashboard showing all these statistics. &nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Deploying models </strong>requires data scientists to first pick the optimal model and make it ready to be deployed to production. If the model is going to impact business metrics of the product and will be consumed in a realtime manner, we need to deploy it to only a small % of traffic and run an<strong> A/B test</strong> with an existing production model. Once the A/B test is positive in terms of business metrics, the model gets rolled out to 100% of production traffic.</p>



<p><strong>Inference of the models </strong>is closely tied with deployment, there can be 2 ways a model can be made available for consumption to make predictions. </p>



<ul><li><strong>batch inference</strong>, where a data pipeline is built to scan through a dataset and make predictions on each record or a batch of records.</li><li><strong>realtime inference</strong>, where a micro-service hosts the model and makes predictions in a low-latency manner.</li></ul>



<p><strong>Monitoring predictions </strong>is very important because unlike traditional applications, model performance is non-deterministic and depends on various factors such as seasonality, new user behavior trends, data pipeline unreliability leading to broken features. For example, a perfectly functioning Ads model might need to be updated when a new holiday season arrives or a model trained to show content recommendations in the US may not do very well for users signing up internationally. There is also a need for alerts and notifications to detect model degradation quickly and take action. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/4Km_x5ON36tuOWCwHEXI1pvbchanrGvk6ZZr0Zv789WO1g25Qo6T2_St-fnLKIwfitW_l6c304-ZVppb2iz6QRcvcq_cWoQAwrk2XWh26ZhgydZxjXKC0T140HnuJ5hyAMuY9qMt" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>As we can see, the workflow to build machine learning models is significantly different from building general software applications. If models are becoming first-class citizens in the modern enterprise stack, they need better tools. As Tesla’s Director of AI Andrej Karpathy succinctly puts it, <strong>AI is</strong><a href="https://medium.com/@karpathy/software-2-0-a64152b37c35"><strong> Software 2.0</strong></a><strong> and it needs new tools</strong> [2].<br></p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ZN2xWg5G0-EYYH2iEQ7b_Vza4SO9wU8YFrKfQyl3NlWatWmz2Z2hMsKtprxOofb7PtwZAXHfeKBjvyF9tKqE4aLSLDOSS_OvaTV1PZ10CbY4N2NEdHogmhoFRVpC3rb2fot3GO9x" alt=""></figure>



<p>If we compare the stack of Software 1.0 with 2.0, I claim we require transformational thinking to build the new developer stack for AI.</p>







<p>In Software 1.0, we have seen a vast amount of tooling built in the past few decades to help developers write code, share it with other developers, get it reviewed, debug it, release it to production and monitor its performance. If we were to map these tools in the 2.0 stack, there is a big gap!<br></p>



<blockquote><p>What would an ideal Developer Toolkit look like for an AI engineer?</p></blockquote>



<p>To start with, we need to take a <strong>data-first approach</strong> as we build this toolkit because, unlike Software 1.0, the fundamental unit of input for 2.0 is data. </p>



<p><strong>Integrated Development Environment (IDE): </strong>Traditional IDEs focus on helping developers write code, focus on features like syntax highlighting, code checkpointing, unit testing, code refactoring, etc. </p>



<figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/ArLnwbA3Hkj2cjWIVDKgHGTjLaNidh98es1ZdDFfETtPEdQpsUiVwuay3LKdkkKVa3Q33TR5PIZPo1ggbI9H1g6ZSv4RuhX8utUkLLI_b40h509nBk7OR3a34oKZ4DZa2cFgJvXj" alt=""></figure>



<p>For machine learning, we need an IDE that allows easy import and exploration of data, cleaning and massaging of tables. Jupyter notebooks are somewhat useful, but they have their own problems, including the lack of versioning and review tools. A powerful 2.0 IDE would be more data-centric, starts with allowing the data scientist to slice and dice data, edit the model architecture either via code or UI and debug the model on egregious cases where it might be not performing well. I see traction in this space with products like StreamLit [13] reimagining IDEs for ML.  <br></p>



<p>Tools like Git, Jenkins, Puppet, Docker have been very successful in traditional software development by taking care of continuous integration and deployment of software. When it comes to machine learning, the following steps would constitute the release process. </p>



<p><strong>Model Versioning:</strong> As more models get into production, managing the various versions of them becomes important. Git can be reused for models, however, it won’t scale for large datasets. The reason to version datasets is that to be able to <strong>reproduce a model</strong>, we need the snapshot of the data the model was trained upon. Naive implementations of this could explode the amount of data we’re versioning, think 1-copy-of-dataset-per-model-version. DVC [12] which is an open-source version control system is a good start and is gaining momentum. </p>



<p><strong>Unit Testing </strong>is another important part of the build &amp; release cycle. For ML, we need unit tests that catch not only code quality bugs but also data quality bugs. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/I99g74dfzW1-4MoswbrjtOeSnw7aH0W8UpbwdumvSxN0FgshNyH-Jpa1WNmsJ-uoNScx6qRnw7IfnWSdcEuZekOwX-UMDliYVP69vDAyGpi4CiD0LQfE_lrfYVUWaHmYIwwBqXmS" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><strong>Canary Tests</strong> are minimal tests to quickly and automatically verify that the everything we depend on is ready. We typically run Canary tests before other time-consuming tests, and before wasting time investigating the code when the other tests are failing [8]. In Machine Learning, it means being able to <strong>replay a previous set of examples</strong> on the new Model and ensuring that it meets certain minimal set of conditions. </p>



<p><strong>A/B Testing </strong>is a method of comparing two versions of an application change to determine which one performs better [7]. For ML, AB testing is an experiment where two or more variations of the ML model are exposed to users at random, and statistical analysis is used to determine which variation performs better for a given conversion goal. For example in the dashboard below, we’re measuring click conversion on an A/B experiment dashboard that my team built at Pinterest, and it shows the performance of the ML experiments against business metrics like repins, likes, etc. CometML [14] lets data scientists keep track of ML experiments and collaborate with their team members. </p>

<p><strong>Debugging: </strong>One of the main features of an IDE is the ability to debug the code and find exactly the line where the error occurred. For machine learning, this becomes a hard problem because models are often opaque and therefore exactly pinpointing why a particular example was misclassified is difficult. However, if we can understand the relationship between feature variables and the target variable in a consistent manner, it goes a long way in debugging models, also called<a href="https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/"><strong> </strong>model interpretability</a>, which is an active area of research. At Fiddler, we’re working on a product offering that allows data scientists to debug any kind of models and perform root cause analysis. </p>



<p><strong>Profiling: </strong>Performance analysis is an important part of SDLC in 1.0 and profiling tools allow engineers to figure out slowness of an application and improve it. For models, it is also about improving performance metrics like AUC, log loss, etc. Often times, a given model could have a higher score on an aggregate metric but it can be performing poorly on certain instances or subsets of the dataset. This is where tools like &nbsp;Manifold [5] can enhance the capabilities of traditional performance analysis. </p>



<p><strong>Monitoring: </strong>While superficially, application monitoring might seem similar to model monitoring and could actually be a good place to start, we need to track a different class of metrics for machine learning. Monitoring is crucial for models that automatically incorporate new data …</p></div></article></div>

This seems far more interesting and the concepts I’m going to describe are more generally applicable than the language features and syntax itself.

This is where the DSL comes into play, it allows users to define rules on how the input data is to be “mapped” into the output format. The input may contain deeply nested JSON structures, but the output needs to be in a flat form. Embedding this mapping as a simple DSL allows non-technical users to define how the data is transformed without having to write actual code. The language requires a lot of domain specific knowledge about the analytics tool and its intricacies, so it makes a lot of sense not to involve developers when the mapping rules need to be changed. Conversely having non-technical colleagues messing around with a production service might pose certain risks. To keep those risks in check, we established some safeguards as part of the process of changing the mapping rules:</p><ol><li>The “rule” files containing the code written in the DSL are part of the service’s source code. As such they are versioned within our version control system (VCS). This makes changes very transparent: It is obvious what was changed when and by whom. In case of an error, rollbacks are as easy as doing $ git revert. The downside of this is having our (non-technical) users work with git, which poses its own challenges. An integrated IDE like IntelliJ lends a hand here, providing an approachable interface to the VCS.</li><li>Testing for syntactic and semantic errors is part of the service's CI/CD pipeline. This helps catching minor mistakes before the service is even deployed to the development environment. The mapping syntax can also be verified via a simple web form exposed on the service’s status page.</li><li>Mapping changes trigger a new deployment of the service. At this point we sacrifice a bit of velocity, but we can be confident in the current state of the system. There won’t be any bad surprises due to changes made during runtime. This has a similar effect as having the mapping files versioned in git: It’s transparent what’s currently running in production. Currently the rule files see a lot of changes, so this might be a show stopper in the near future. We are looking into ways to improve on that front.</li></ol><h2>Parsing a DSL </h2><p>The DSL itself is syntactically similar to the YAML format, but is obviously more specific. For example the language provides helper functions for array and string manipulation and implements basic conditionals:                                  </p></div><div><pre><code>MerchandisingVars: 
  DefaultFunction: replace($mEvar, "|", "~")
  Vars: 
    var1: /access_path
    var6: ./topic_id
    var19: concat(findFirst(./assortment, /assortment), ./search_assortment, ";")

... 

Events: 
  event1: "1"if /breakpoint_change == "true"
  event2: "1"if /first_visit == "true"</code></pre></div> <p>As we are not a 100% on par with the official YAML specification, the mapping files are parsed by our own parser. The Scala parser-combinator library allows this to be implemented rather concisely: The actual parser is only about 200 lines of source code. A parser combinator approach encourages splitting the parser code into small, composable functions. The library provides the “plumbing” to stick those functions back together to build a powerful but comprehensible program. For example this is how the parser of the “replace” function looks like:<br></p><div><pre><code>/**
  * Parses the replace function: 'replace(./foo, "ü", "ue")'  
  */
 def replaceFnParser: Parser[ReplaceFn] = { 
   "replace(" ~&gt;
     (expressionParser &lt;~ ",") ~
     (stringLiteralParser &lt;~ ",") ~
     (stringLiteralParser &lt;~ ")") ^^ { 
     case expression ~ substring ~ replacement =&gt; ReplaceFn(expression, substring, replacement)   
 
     } 
   } </code></pre></div> <p>The example shows how easily multiple small parsers, for expressions and string literals, are compiled together to form a larger more complex parser.We chose to use parser combinators because it is a good fit for our usual programming model: functional, readable and highly composable. Parser combinators are ahead of seemingly simpler solutions like regular expressions, which are neither easily composed <br>nor very readable. We specifically opted for the Scala parser combinator library, because it is a mature implementation, which even was part of the Scala standard library before becoming a community maintained library. Scala being the team’s primary programming language made it easy to integrate the library, there was no need for any intermediate representation format. The parser reads in the mapping files and parses them directly into Scala objects when the service starts up.</p><div> <figure><picture title="Mapping Picture" data-lazyloading="1" data-rwid="59b862a1666975feaf73416910f0475d"><source media="(min-width: 9999.1360px)" srcset="https://www.otto.de/jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@795w.jpg 795w, https://www.otto.de/jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@800w2x.jpg 800w" sizes="795px" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width: 9999.1200px)" srcset="https://www.otto.de/jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@795w.jpg 795w, https://www.otto.de/jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@800w2x.jpg 800w" sizes="795px" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width: 9999.992px)" srcset="https://www.otto.de/jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@795w.jpg 795w, https://www.otto.de/jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@800w2x.jpg 800w" sizes="795px" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width: 9999.768px)" srcset="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20version%3D%221.1%22%20width%3D%22794%22%20height%3D%22429%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E 795w" data-src="/jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@795w.jpg 795w, /jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@800w2x.jpg 800w " sizes="795px" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width: 9999.576px)" srcset="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20version%3D%221.1%22%20width%3D%22400%22%20height%3D%22216%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E 641w" data-src="/jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@641w.jpg 641w, /jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@800w2x.jpg 800w " sizes="641px" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(min-width: 9999.415px)" srcset="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20version%3D%221.1%22%20width%3D%22400%22%20height%3D%22216%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E 481w" data-src="/jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@481w.jpg 481w, /jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@800w2x.jpg 800w " sizes="481px" type="image/jpeg"><source media="(max-width: 99.414px)" srcset="data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8,%3Csvg%20xmlns%3D%22http%3A%2F%2Fwww.w3.org%2F2000%2Fsvg%22%20version%3D%221.1%22%20width%3D%22320.5%22%20height%3D%22173%22%3E%3C%2Fsvg%3E 319w" data-src="/jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@319w.jpg 319w, /jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@638w2x.jpg 638w " sizes="319px" type="image/jpeg"><img src="https://www.otto.de/jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@ll.jpg" data-src="/jobs/media-karriere/img/technology/techblog/weblication/wThumbnails/f502dbbd-cad3-4d18-9551-22457b658bb4-4cf050f1-6e4e3d30@ll.jpg" alt="Mapping Picture"></picture><figcaption><p>Mapping Picture</p></figcaption></figure></div> <div><p>Once the service starts consuming input messages, those rules, now encoded in objects, are applied to the incoming messages by an interpreter. The interpreter encapsulates most of the services business logic in a component separate to the DSL parser, which again favours testability and maintainability. Zooming out farther, this interpretation is done in a single pipeline step in a kafka-streams based service.<span><br></span></p><h2><span>Final Thoughts&nbsp;</span></h2><p>This gave a rough overview on how we integrate a simple DSL into our operations process. I also highlighted some of the advantages of parser combinators and how they fit into our programming model. There are of course other approaches to such problems. For example I could imagine a graphical interface, which lets users configure how data is to be mapped from one format to another. Though I doubt this would have been a sustainable solution for our backend-heavy team. We established a solid foundation with parser combinators and Scala, which we can now build and optimise upon.</p> </div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

            <header>We believe software development will become ubiquitous. You will be able to create your own custom apps according to your specific needs from a simple text editor.</header>

            <p> The text editor is the living force of the modern world. We use it everyday for countless use cases. It’s our go to tool for putting words down. But it seems there’s room to improve the text editor for the next generation of makers and builders that grew up with the cloud, collaboration and information at the tip of their fingers.</p>

            <p>So, we tried to reimagine this piece of software from the ground up. The result is a simple text editor tool that helps you do more and be more productive.</p>

            <p>Main features</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Build with growing collection of components</li>
                <li>Connect your text editor document to a database</li>
                <li>Integrate logic operations to build custom no code applications</li>
                <li>Markdown editor to take notes, scribble ideas or plan your work</li>
                <li>Call APIs to get information quickly. Build your own internal tools</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We’ve decided to have a fairly large set of features in the beginning but with limited functionality (e.g. we only have a handful of Components and Functions to start with). This will allow us to learn from our users and build new features for them.</p>
            
            <call-to-action></call-to-action>

            <p>Next steps</p>            

            <p>We are working hard every single day to improve our product. We are in a very early stage and bugs <i></i> can appear from anywhere. <a href="https://zecoda.com/contact">Drop us a note</a> if you catch one of those 🙏</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Downloading, modifying, uploading, in general exchanging data is fundamental for modern apps. Using API (defined set of rules how apps can communicate with each other) is the most popular way of setting up a communication system between external systems.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>What makes a good API?</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>First of all, it needs to be easily understandable and legible for all its potential users. A decent API should have well-documented examples and do not leave any room for guessing. There is a solution that comes in handy if you want to create a solid API, it’s a tool called <strong><a href="https://api-platform.com/">the API Platform</a></strong>.</p>
<h2>API Platform</h2>
<p>API Platform is a set of tools that combined build a next-generation REST and GraphQL framework to build modern API. The server API Platform is built on top of enterprise-proven solutions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Server-side</strong> - Symfony 4 microframework and the Doctrine ORM.</li>
<li><strong>Client-side</strong> - we have an option to choose between ReactJS &amp; Vue.js  for the web and React Native for mobile. </li>
<li><strong>Development &amp; deployment environments</strong> -  Docker, Kubernetes, and Helm.</li>
</ul>
<p>All that powers the modules responsible for API creation, schema generation, admin panel &amp; client generation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>API Platform Core Library</strong> - a highly flexibly, stacked with cool features core library allowing you to build fully-featured REST or GraphQL API in minutes. </li>
<li><strong>The Schema Generator</strong> -  a CLI tool that instantly generates a PHP data model from the Schema.org vocabulary allowing ORM to create corresponding tables.</li>
<li><strong>API Platform Admin</strong> - a tool to automatically adds a React-based admin interface to your API, all that without writing a single line of code.</li>
<li><strong>API Platform Client Generator</strong> - the fastest way to scaffold fully-featured web apps (powered by React or Vue.js) or native mobile apps (based on React Native).</li>
</ul>

September 15, 2020 | https://rcoh.me/posts/cache-oblivious-datastructures/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://rcoh.me/posts/cache-oblivious-datastructures/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        

<p>If you read my recent <a href="https://rcoh.me/posts/postgres-indexes-under-the-hood">post</a> about Postgres you may have noted that Postgres operates primarily with fixed-size blocks of memory called “pages.” By default, Postgres pages are 8KB. This number is tuned to match operating system page sizes which are tuned to match hardware cache sizes. If you were to run Postgres on hardware with different cache sizes than Postgres was tuned for, you may be able to pick a better page size.<sup id="fnref:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Along these lines, today’s post explores the question:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Can we design data structures and algorithms that perform optimally regardless of underlying cache sizes?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we could do this, our code would optimally utilize all cache layers without tuning. In academia, algorithms and data structures that have these properties are referred to as <em>cache-oblivious</em>. (This is a pretty confusing name. A clearer name might be cache-<strong>size</strong> oblivious.) I find cache-oblivious data structures very satisfying because they can yield huge performance gains in practice. I’m going to skip to the punchline, a graph comparing the lookup performance of binary search trees:</p>

<p><img src="https://rcoh.me/images/cache-oblivious-graph.png" alt="BST Read Performance"></p>

<p>The graph shows the time in nanoseconds to retrieve an element from a binary search tree vs. the number of elements in the tree. The series show 3 different ways of laying out the tree in memory.</p>

<ul>
<li>The blue line is a tree that’s been laid out level by level, essentially, a breadth first traversal of the tree.</li>
<li>The orange line is a tree that’s been laid out in a preorder (depth first) traversal.</li>
<li>The green line is a tree that’s been laid out with a so-called “recursive blocking” approach which is cache-oblivious. <strong>It is almost twice as fast for a tree with 16 million elements!</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>You can find the code I wrote to test out different strategies <a href="https://github.com/rcoh/treelayout">on Github</a>. It’s written in Golang and utilizes their very helpful <em>built in (!)</em> benchmarking tools.</p>

<p>The rest of this post is dedicated to answering 2 questions:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>How is the green-line tree laid out in memory?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Why is it so much faster?</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to know more about anything I’m talking about here, Erik Demaine’s <a href="http://erikdemaine.org/papers/BRICS2002/paper.pdf">2002 survey paper</a> covers the subject with far more rigor and detail than I’ll go into in this post.</p>

<!--

1. The overall goal is to make use of every byte we read when we read an entire block.

If your data structure or algorithm is recursive (like a tree), it should be laid out in larger and larger chunks, starting from the smallest atomic unit, going up to the entire data structure. At _each level_ of the hierarchy, the data should be stored in a contiguous section of memory. If the hardware has some cache size `\(B\)`, then there will be some block size within your data structure that is nearly `\(B\)`.

2. -->

<h2 id="a-new-scheme-for-analyzing-algorithms">A new scheme for analyzing algorithms</h2>

<p>Big-O notation by itself can’t explain the differences we’re seeing. The code to search the trees is identical – the only difference is the order the nodes in the tree are laid out in memory.</p>

<p>In standard algorithmic analysis, we implicitly assume that the cost of reading from memory is directly proportional to amount of bytes we read. Read one byte, pay for one byte. But the real world doesn’t work this way: the layers of software and hardware below your programming language don’t work in individual bytes; they work in blocks.<sup id="fnref:2"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:2">2</a></sup> If you want to read one byte, you need to pay for the whole block. If you read more bytes from that block, those reads are nearly free. To analyze our algorithms, we’ll develop a model that’s closer to how things work in the real world.</p>

<p>In developing algorithms that perform optimally regardless of cache size, we’ll assume that we have 2 areas of memory: the small fast layer, and the big slow layer. Memory can only be moved from the slow layer to the fast layer in fixed size blocks of size <code>\(B\)</code>. The slow layer is infinitely sized, and the fast layer has size <code>\(M\)</code>.<sup id="fnref:assum"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:assum">3</a></sup> When we analyze our algorithms we’ll analyze them in terms of <code>\(M\)</code>, the size of our cache, and <code>\(B\)</code>, the size of blocks in the cache. Our analyses must hold for any values of <code>\(M\)</code> and <code>\(B\)</code>. Futhermore, the unit of work we’ll be analyzing is loading a block from slow memory into fast memory – other work is considered much faster and not included.</p>

<p>Algorithms that make good use of the cache have the following very important property: <strong>When we read a block of data, we make use of every byte in that block.</strong> This property means that our algorithm will read fewer blocks as <code>\(B\)</code> increases.</p>

<h2 id="warm-up-finding-the-maximum-in-an-array">Warm up: Finding the maximum in an array</h2>

<p>A lot of algorithms are cache-oblivious  without modification. Consider finding the maximum element in an array. Unless you’ve preprocessed the array in some way, you can’t do better than scanning the array and tracking the maximum. It’s pretty easy to see why this algorithm is cache optimal: Assuming the array is contiguous in memory, we’ll make use of every byte from every block we read, <em>except</em> for the ends. At each end if the array, we may make only partial use of 1 block on either end due to alignment.<sup id="fnref:scanproof"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:scanproof">4</a></sup></p>

<h2 id="binary-search-trees">Binary Search Trees</h2>

<p>Onto the main event: Binary search trees. For ease of reference, here’s the graph from the intro again:
<img src="https://rcoh.me/images/cache-oblivious-graph.png" alt="BST Read Performance"></p>

<p>Looking at this graph, you can see that for small values of N, the performance doesn’t differ much. This because for small N, the layout doesn’t matter: the whole tree fits in one block! The weird flat spots in the graph are real and persist across many runs. They come from interaction with specific internal cache sizes. As N gets bigger, the differences between the slow and fast memory structures get larger and we eventually spill into main memory. The bigger the difference, the better the cache-oblivious version does.</p>

<p>Let’s dig into the ways we’ve laid these trees out in memory:</p>

<h3 id="by-level-breadth-first">By Level (Breadth First)</h3>

<p><img src="https://rcoh.me/images/breadthfirst.svg" alt="Breadth First BST"></p>

<p>This approach is the blue line in the graph.
In the tree diagrams above and below, <strong>the numbers in the tree refer to the position the elements would lie in the array.</strong> The orange boxes show how the data is grouped in memory.</p>

<p>This is the “standard” way to layout a BST in memory that you have probably seen in textbooks. From a caching perspective, it’s one of the worst. It’s not too hard to see why:</p>

<p>If we’re traversing this tree from root to leaves, each row will be in a different block once the rows get large enough! We’ll only use 1 element we read from each block. Because of that, we’ll end up reading about <code>\(\log_2N\)</code> blocks.</p>

<h3 id="preorder-depth-first">Preorder (Depth First)</h3>

<p><img src="https://rcoh.me/images/depthfirst.svg" alt="Depth First BST"></p>

<p>This approach is the orange line in the graph. it’s a bit better than the blue line, but pretty similar in the limit. This approach use what might be called a “depth-first” layout, proceeding down each branch before continuing on to the next one. As an aid, I’ve circled consescutive groups of 4 items within the tree to get an idea of the type of blocking behavior we’ll see. It’s easy to see these blocks are a little more useful than the breadth first approach. If we’re going down the far left branch, we’ll only have to read a single block. But it’s also easy to see the shortcomings: In a large tree, going down the far right branch will only use 1 item from each block.</p>

<h3 id="recursive-block-approach">Recursive Block Approach</h3>

<p>This approach is the green line in the graph. In designing cache-oblivious data structures and algorithms, a divide and conquer strategy frequently bears fruit. This stems from the fact that divide and conquer algorithms naturally break the work in subproblems of increasingly smaller sizes – one of those sizes will be close to <code>\(B\)</code> and constrain the number of blocks you need to read. We’ll take a similar approach in laying our our cache-oblivious static BST.</p>

<p>To start, split the tree at half height. If the height of the tree is <code>\(\log(N)\)</code>, the top section will contain <code>\(2^{log_2(N)/2}=\sqrt{N}\)</code> nodes. Each of the child nodes will also contain <code>\(\approx \sqrt{N}\)</code> elements. This splitting process is recursive – each section of the tree is split until there are no nodes left to split.</p>

<p><img src="https://rcoh.me/images/van-layout.svg" alt="Recursive Block Layout"></p>

<p>The figure above demonstrates a cache-oblivious memory layout for a binary search tree with 5 levels. The blocks are circled in green and the super-blocks are circled in orange. I’ve omitted the right branch to remove some visual clutter.</p>

<p>The key property of our layout strategy is that all “blocks” are laid out contiguously in memory. Critically, all “super blocks” are also contiguous. This means that no matter what <code>\(B\)</code> is, we’ll always be reading useful data. The key here is that the bigger the block you’re reading, the more levels you will go down the tree before needing to read an additional block. Specifically, if we read a block of size <code>\(B\)</code>, we’ll be able to go <code>\(\log_2B\)</code> levels down the tree. The tree has <code>\(\log_2N\)</code> levels. This leads to the following result for what I’m calling <code>\(F(N)\)</code>, the number of blocks read for a tree of size <code>\(N\)</code>:</p>

<p><code>$$F(N)=\frac{\log_2N}{\log_2B}=\log_BN$$</code></p>

<p>I’m dropping some complexity in favor of simplicity; if this feels hand-wavy, you can find a more rigorous proof in the paper. Here’s the important part: as <code>\(B\)</code> grows, the number of blocks we read shrinks. Success!</p>

<h2 id="cache-oblivious-data-structures-irl">Cache-Oblivious Data structures IRL</h2>

<p>A static search tree isn’t really a general purpose data structure, but the ideas about recursively grouping data in memory are widely applicable. Beyond static BSTs, there are cache-oblivious sorting algorithms, hash tables, B-Trees, priority queues, and more. I won’t go into detail here, but you can read about them in <a href="http://erikdemaine.org/papers/BRICS2002/paper.pdf">Demaine’s survey paper</a>. Cache-oblivious B-Trees are especially effective in practice. They are typically referred to as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fractal_tree_index">Fractal Tree Indexes</a>. Given the fractal nature of cache oblivious BSTs, the name shouldn’t be a surprise. Tokutek, acquired by Percona in 2015, created cache-oblivious storage engines for several major databases with significantly improved performance. Personally, I find theory working out in practice especially satisfying.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Snowflake was destined for obscurity or worse. Snowflake seems like such an obvious winner today with the likes of risk-averse Berkshire Hathaway taking an unprecedented stake in their IPO. But it wasn’t always the case.</p><p>I remember talking to several venture capitalists and industry insiders in 2013 and this was the consensus:</p><blockquote><p>Snowflake is not a viable long-term company.</p></blockquote><p>At best, people believed they could be a me-too provider of analytics in a world dominated by cloud leaders like AWS, Microsoft, and Google. They weren’t entirely wrong.</p><h2>#1: AWS will kill them</h2><p>The fact that Snowflake was built to run exclusively on the AWS cloud platform was considered the biggest risk. Just like Veeva on Salesforce, the conventional wisdom was that the platform owners like AWS (or Salesforce) could squish them at will.</p><p>It turns out platforms like AWS do want companies on their platforms to succeed — they win when more startups build on their platform.</p><h2>#2: Hadoop will kill them</h2><p>Snowflake was a closed proprietary system whereas the industry was headed towards open source and Hadoop was the clear winner. Here’s a news headline from 2013:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2013/10/29/with-141-million-in-capital-ipo-bound-cloudera-sprints-to-1-billion-in-revenue/#f726156368b0" target="_blank">With $141M in Capital, Cloudera sprints to $1B in Revenue</a>.</p><p>It turns out that very few customers really care about their ability to touch and feel your source code. Even the best open-source companies are now pivoting to a cloud-first approach.</p><h2><b>#3: Gross Margins will kill them</b></h2><p>Snowflake pays a lot of money to AWS and the thinking was they can never walk out of that abyss.</p><p>It turns out that scale and pricing power can lead to great gross margins (61%) and here’s what Snowflake says about it in it’s IPO prospectus:</p><blockquote><p><i>Our improved gross margin during the last four quarters presented is primarily attributable to higher volume-based discounts for purchases of third-party cloud infrastructure, increased scale across our cloud infrastructure regions, and improved platform pricing discipline.</i></p></blockquote><h2>#4: Low Switching Costs will kill them</h2><p>Snowflake runs on data stored in AWS (or Google’s GCP or Microsoft Azure). This means customers can easily switch analytics providers to others that run on the same platform especially the platform owners themselves like AWS.</p><p>It turns out that while it’s true in theory — enterprises don’t really switch if they are being well served. In fact, Snowflake has a net negative churn — people buy more of it every year.</p><h2>#5: Lack of Subscriptions will kill them</h2><p>Unlike the SaaS players Salesforce, Workday, etc., Snowflake was not a subscription sale. You paid every month based on actual usage and not some pre-determined pre-negotiated dollar amount. This means you can’t model 3 to 5-year Total Contract Value of millions like Veeva &amp; Workday could.</p><p>It turns out that pay as you go pricing is an even more powerful model. As customers’ data increases and they run more queries, they end up paying a lot of money. Snowflake has some customers paying them north of $10M a year!</p><h2>#6: Public cloud strategy will kill them</h2><p>While people could envision storing sales leads or marketing emails in the cloud, it was conventional wisdom that the cloud was still not ready for prime time when it comes to financial services and healthcare companies. Why would a bank like Capital One put their most important data in the public cloud?</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/5vb3k5tov1cb/1UWMrldK94Fds7CesgnYgd/f6226fad31f7e359e1af7991eed5f00d/1_jXwaBmIrosFQE1BRc-6M2Q-1.png"></p><p>                                                 Snowflake runs on public clouds (only).</p><p>It turns out Capital One and many like them decided it was just too damn hard to compete against the tsunami of startups without being able to use the public cloud. They went all in and never looked back.</p><h2>#7: SaaS Analytics will kill them</h2><p>This was my favorite. With all the cloud data sitting in the likes of Salesforce and Workday which offered their own analytics, why would companies bother to take a DIY approach? Wouldn’t all customer data end up in Salesforce, marketing data in Adobe, and employee data in Workday?</p><p>It turns out that few enterprises rely on just one SaaS provider. To get a sense of your business and your data, you have to combine data from internal and external systems, on-premise, and cloud apps, and so you do need a data warehouse.</p><h2>#8: Sales &amp; Marketing Costs will kill them</h2><p>Snowflake is in a very competitive business. Likes of Google, Salesforce &amp; AWS are willing to spend a lot of money to get you to use their data platforms. This criticism rings true even today as they have to spend about a dollar in sales &amp; marketing every quarter for every dollar in revenue they have. It literally burned through a $100M to get to its first few millions in revenue and has gone on to raise $1.4B so far.</p><p>It turns out that the market is willing to be very patient for big winners.</p><h2>#9: Data Platforms will kill them</h2><p>Snowflake is just a data warehouse solution whereas the companies it competes with like AWS, Azure, GCP — all have end to end platforms that include not just the data warehouse but also relational databases, analytics tools, and much much more.</p><p>It turns out best of breed wins if you are truly better than your competition.</p><h2>#10: Hired CEOs will kill them</h2><p>Snowflake is an oddity in the startup world. We love companies started and run by founders. I am personally in that camp too. And here we have a startup that went out and hired a Microsoft executive as the first CEO.

    <p>In his book—<a target="_blank" href="https://amzn.to/2Z2SI3I">Atomic Habits</a>—James Clear presents a four-step pattern as the backbone of every habit.
The four stages of habit are: cue, craving, response, and reward.</p>
<p>In his own words, "The cue is what triggers your brain to initiate a behavior. […]
Cravings are the motivational force behind every habit. […]
The response is the actual habit you perform. […]
Rewards are the end goal of every habit."<sup id="fnref:james-clear-how-to-start-new-habits"><a href="#fn:james-clear-how-to-start-new-habits" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Clear mentions that we chase rewards because they satisfy us and they teach us.
His framework involves four laws to create a good habit that go hand in hand with the four stages of a habit I just mentioned: make it obvious, make it attractive, make it easy, and make it satisfying.</p>
<p>By inverting these four laws to create good habits, Clear establishes four laws to break bad ones: make it invisible, make it unattractive, make it difficult, and make it unsatisfying.</p>

<p>This text is an excerpt of my <a target="_blank" href="https://gettingsimple.com/atomic-habits">Getting Simple podcast episode on Atomic Habits</a>, where you can learn more on how I try to apply this method to strengthen my habits.</p>

Dies verstoße gegen den&nbsp;Grundsatz der Netzneutralität, wonach alle Daten im <a href="https://www.sueddeutsche.de/thema/Internet">Internet</a> diskriminierungsfrei gleich behandelt werden müssen.</p><p>Hintergrund ist ein Fall in Ungarn, bei dem es um Tarife mit begrenztem Internet-Datenvolumen geht. Ist dieses Volumen verbraucht, wird der weitere Datenverkehr verlangsamt oder blockiert. Der Datenverkehr bestimmter Dienste wie Video- oder Musikstreaming-Apps wird jedoch nicht auf das Volumen angerechnet und ist auch nicht von der Verlangsamung betroffen.</p><p>Ähnliche Tarife werden aber auch in Deutschland angeboten. Susanne Blohm von der Verbraucherzentrale Bundesverband erklärte am Dienstag jedoch, dass die bekanntesten deutschen Angebote wohl nicht von dem EuGH-Urteil betroffen seien, weil bei ihnen alle Apps - also beispielsweise auch die bevorzugten Musik- oder Streaming-Dienste - von der Tempo-Drosselung betroffen seien.</p><p>Dies betonten am Dienstag auch Vodafone und die Telekom: Vodafone habe seine Tarife sorgfältig gemäß EU-Recht konzipiert, sagte ein Sprecher. "Aus diesem Grunde drosseln wir bei Aufbrauchen des Tarif-Datenvolumens auch die Surfgeschwindigkeit der zusätzlich gewählten Pass-Option." Telekom-Sprecher Dirk Wende äußerte sich ähnlich: "Bei uns wird alles gleichbehandelt. Wenn reduziert wird, gilt das für alle Dienste." Wegen des Telekom-Tarifs "StreamOn" ist derzeit noch ein Gerichtsverfahren in Deutschland anhängig. Das Verwaltungsgericht Köln rief dazu im Januar den EuGH an.</p><p>Denn Verbraucherschützer sehen auch die Angebote in Deutschland kritisch. Auf den ersten Blick seien sie für den Kunden attraktiv, sagte Blohm. "Über kurz oder lang besteht jedoch die Gefahr, dass sich solche Angebote negativ auf die Wahlfreiheit der Verbraucher und Angebotsvielfalt am Markt auswirken." Ziel sollte Blohm zufolge sein - wie in vielen EU-Ländern längst Standard - grundsätzlich mehr Inklusivvolumen für den monatlichen Tarifpreis zu bekommen.</p><p>Grundsätzlich begrüße sie das Urteil vom Dienstag. Zugleich forderte sie jedoch Rechtssicherheit für die Verbraucher. Der Umgang mit derlei Tarifen müsse grundsätzlich geklärt werden - auch mit Blick auf die deutschen Angebote.</p><p>Die Luxemburger Richter argumentierten in ihrem Urteil vom Dienstag unter anderem, dass derlei Tarife die Rechte der Nutzer erheblich einschränken könnten. Sie könnten unter anderem dazu beitragen, dass die Nutzung der bevorzugt behandelten Anwendungen erhöht und der anderen Anwendungen verringert werde.</p><p>© dpa-infocom, dpa:200915-99-568762/4</p></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Hey there, welcome back. If you have been following my ongoing series <strong>Introduction to Elements Positioning</strong>, well you've made it to the third part of the series and here we're are going to be focusing on <strong>FlexBox</strong>.</p>
<p>At the end of this article, you would be able to use the flexbox module and it's properties to layout a webpage beautifully. Alright, let's carry on.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-flexbox">What is Flexbox?</h2>
<p>Flexbox is a CSS module, designed as a one-dimensional layout model which means it deals with one dimension at a time either rows or columns in contrast to the CSS grid which is a two-dimensional model and can take rows and columns together. 
Just like the CSS grid, it is a module because it has a whole lot of properties that help the flexbox model come to life.</p>
<p>Flexbox is activated by setting the display property of a parent element to Flex or inline-flex.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>: flex || inline-flex;
}
</code></pre><h2 id="flexbox-properties">Flexbox Properties</h2>
<p>In this article, We're only going to be focusing on  Properties for the Parent Elements(Flex Container).</p>
<p>We're going to be looking at properties from the parent elements property group, that will help you create beautiful and responsive page layouts.</p>
<h2 id="parent-elementsflex-container-properties">Parent Elements(Flex Container) Properties</h2>
<ul>
<li>Display</li>
<li>Flex-direction (row, row-reverse, column, column-reverse)</li>
<li>Flex-wrap (wrap, nowrap, wrap-reverse)</li>
<li>Flex-flow </li>
<li>Justify-content (center, flex-start, flex-end, space-around, space-between)</li>
<li>align-items (center, flex-start, flex-end, stretch)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="display">Display</h2>
<p>By setting a parent element's display property to Flex or Inline-flex, you have activated Flexbox. let's look at the example below ;</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>: flex;
}
</code></pre><h2 id="flex-direction">Flex-direction</h2>
<p>The flex-direction property defines what direction the flex-items would be arranged in, this could be in rows or columns i.e horizontally or vertically. </p>
<p>let's look at some examples to show us the various flex-direction values; </p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span> {
    <span>display</span>:flex;
    <span>flex-direction </span>: row;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The row value sets the horizontal direction of the flex-items, from left to right.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>: flex;
    <span>flex-direction</span>:row-reverse;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The row-reverse value sets the horizontal direction of the flex-items, but this time from right to left.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>: flex;
    <span>flex-direction</span>:column;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The column value sets the vertical direction of the flex-items, from top to bottom.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
    <span>display</span>: flex;
    <span>flex-direction</span>:column-reverse;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The column-reverse value sets the vertical direction of the flex-items, but this time from bottom to top.</p>
<h2 id="flex-wrap">Flex-wrap</h2>
<p>The flex-wrap specifies whether or not flex-items should continue on their specified direction which may cause some scrolling or wrap. let's look at some examples that explain better; </p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-direction </span>: row;
  <span>flex-wrap </span>: wrap;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Notice how the flex-items wraps? So that now there is no more scrolling </p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-direction </span>: row;
  <span>flex-wrap </span>: nowrap;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>nowrap</code> value is the default value for flex-items, which means there still is going to be some scrolling.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-direction </span>: row;
  <span>flex-wrap </span>: wrap-reverse;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The wrap-reverse value wraps the flex-items in reverse.</p>
<h2 id="flex-flow">Flex-flow</h2>
<p>The flex-flow flexbox property is a shorthand property for setting the <code>flex-direction</code> and <code>flex-wrap</code> of a flex-box container.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-flow </span>: row wrap-reverse;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="justify-content">Justify-content</h2>
<p>Justify-content property is used for aligning items in a flex container.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-flow</span>: row wrap-reverse;
  <span>justify-content</span>: center;
}
</code></pre>
<p>the center value aligns items to the center of the flexbox container.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-flow</span>: row wrap-reverse;
  <span>justify-content</span>: flex-start;
}
</code></pre>
<p>flex-start value aligns items to the start of the flexbox container.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>flex-flow</span>: row wrap-reverse;
  <span>justify-content</span>: flex-end;
}
</code></pre>
<p>flex-end value aligns items to the end of the flexbox container.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>justify-content</span>: space-around;
  <span>background-color </span>: black;
}
</code></pre>
<p>the space-around value specifies space before, between, and after a flex-item in a  flexbox container.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>justify-content</span>: space-between;
  <span>background-color </span>: beige;
}
</code></pre>
<p>the space-between value specifies space between a flex-item in a  flexbox container.</p>
<h2 id="align-items">Align-items</h2>
<p>While the <code>justify-content</code> property aligns items on the horizontal axis, the <code>align-items</code> property aligns items on the vertical axis.</p>
<p>let's look at the values for the <code>align-items</code> property;</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>background-color</span>:yellow;
  <span>height</span>: <span>600px</span>;
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>align-items</span>:center;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>align-items: center</code> aligns the flex-items to the center of the flex-container on a vertical axis.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>background-color</span>:yellow;
  <span>height</span>: <span>600px</span>;
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>align-items</span>:flex-start;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>align-items: flex-start</code> aligns the flex-items to the start of the flex-container on a vertical axis.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>background-color</span>:yellow;
  <span>height</span>: <span>600px</span>;
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>align-items</span>:flex-end;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>align-items: flex-end</code> aligns the flex-items to the end of the flex-container on a vertical axis.</p>
<pre><code><span>.container</span>{
  <span>background-color</span>:yellow;
  <span>height</span>: <span>400px</span>;
  <span>display</span>:flex;
  <span>align-items</span>:stretch;
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>align-items: stretch</code> stretches flex-items to fill the flex-container on a vertical axis.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The <code>flexbox</code> module has eased front-end web development and brought a new way to position items with ease. It's comes packed with simple to read properties that make it have an even better learning experience.</p>
<p>This brings me to the end of this article. In this part of the series, we looked at how to layout a webpage,  using the Flexbox module. I hope you had a wonderful time, cheers ;-)</p>

<h3 id="1-the-origins-of-big-data-processing">1. The Origins of Big Data Processing</h3>
<p>The origin of the internet in 1989 enabled us to produce and consume data in all forms of life. This ensured a huge boom in data and in the following years essentially every organization and app became data reliant regardless of their scale.</p>
<p>Big Data/Data Engineering, which deals with the Collection, Processing and Storage of huge volumes of data became a matter of prime importance for business applications. For operational efficiency, demand prediction, user behavior, and other use cases like fraud detection, we need data and also in correct format. This is also know as ETL or Extract(Collection), Transform(Processing) and Load(Storage).</p>
<p>At this inflection point of data growth traditional tools (ex: Relational Databases) fell short this kind of new tasks which required processing petabytes scale datasets and providing the results quickly. This was very pronounced at companies like Google, which essentially crawls the whole internet and indexes the webpages for search results at planetary scale.</p>
<p>Google then came up with a very clever solution to their ever growing data problems called <a target="_blank" href="https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//archive/mapreduce-osdi04.pdf">MapReduce</a>, which later became <a target="_blank" href="https://opensource.com/life/14/8/intro-apache-hadoop-big-data#:~:text=Hadoop%20was%20created%20by%20Doug,after%20his%20son%27s%20toy%20elephant.">Apache Hadoop</a>; and later on it went on to became the watershed moment in Big Data Processing and Analytics.</p>
<h3 id="2-hadoop-mapreduce">2. Hadoop MapReduce</h3>
<p>A <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce">MapReduce program</a> is composed of a map procedure, which performs filtering and sorting (such as sorting students by first name into queues, one queue for each name), and a reduce method, which performs a summary operation (such as counting the number of students in each queue, yielding name frequencies). </p>
<p>The "MapReduce System" (also called "infrastructure" or "framework") orchestrates the processing on distributed servers, running the various tasks in parallel, managing all communications and data transfers between different parts of the system, and providing for redundancy and fault tolerance.</p>
<p>This initially solved the problems like building a large clusters of data and processing it. But this solution had a huge efficiency problem over time and as the data grew exponentially.</p>
<h3 id="3-hadoops-shortcomings">3. Hadoop's Shortcomings</h3>
<p>The verbose batch-processing MapReduce API, cumbersome operational complexity, brittle fault tolerance became evident while using Hadoop. With large batches of data jobs with many pairs of MR tasks, each pair’s intermediate computed result is written to the disk. This repeated disk I/O took large MR jobs hours on end, or even days.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1600066142687/47oUN3zqD.png?auto=format&amp;q=60" alt="Spark-HadoopShortcomings.png"></p>
<p><em>Intermittent iteration of reads and writes between map and reduce
computation</em></p>
<h3 id="4-what-is-apache-spark">4. What is Apache Spark?</h3>
<p>Spark is a unified engine designed for large-scale distributed data processing, on premise data centers or in the cloud. Spark provides in-memory storage for intermediate computations, making it much faster than Hadoop MapReduce.</p>
<h3 id="5-the-spark-way-of-doing-things">5. The Spark Way Of Doing Things</h3>
<p>Spark achieves simplicity by providing a fundamental abstraction of a simple logical data structure called a <a target="_blank" href="https://databricks.com/glossary/what-is-rdd">Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD)</a> upon which all other higher-level structured data abstractions such as DataFrames and Datasets are constructed. By providing a set of transformations and actions as operations, Spark offers a simple programming model that you can use to build big data applications in familiar languages.</p>
<p>Once an application is built using transformations and actions Spark offers, it builds its query computations as a <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph">Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</a>; its DAG scheduler and query optimizer construct an efficient computational graph that defines the path of execution and can usually be decomposed into tasks that are executed in parallel across workers on the cluster.</p>

<p><em>Spark Components and API Stack</em></p>
<p>Spark Supports languages like</p>
<ul>
<li>Scala</li>
<li>SQL</li>
<li>Python - PySpark</li>
<li>Java</li>
<li>R</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="71-spark-sql">7.1. Spark SQL</h4>
<p>Spark SQL works well with structured data and you can read data stored in an RDBMS table or file formats with structured data like CSV, text, JSON, Avro, ORC, Parquet and etc.</p>
<p>We can write the SQL queries and access the resulting data as a Spark Dataframe.</p>
<pre><code>// Spark SQL Example
// In Scala
// Read data off Amazon S3 bucket into a Spark DataFrame
spark.read.json("s3://apache_spark/data/committers.json")
.createOrReplaceTempView("committers")
// Issue a SQL query and return the result as a Spark DataFrame
val results = spark.sql("""SELECT name, org, module, release, num_commits
FROM committers WHERE module = 'mllib' AND num_commits &gt; 10
ORDER BY num_commits DESC""")

//Note: You can write similar code snippets in Python, R, or Java, 
//and the generated bytecode will be identical, 
//resulting in the same performance.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="72-spark-mllib">7.2. Spark MLlib</h4>
<p>Spark comes common machine learning (ML) algorithms library called MLlib. It provides many popular machine learning algorithms built on top of high-level DataFrame-based APIs to build models.</p>
<p>These APIs allow you to extract or transform features, build pipelines (for training and evaluating), and persist models (for saving and reloading them) during deployment. Additional utilities include the use of common linear algebra operations and statistics.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>Starting with Apache Spark 1.6, the MLlib project is split between two packages: spark.mllib and <a href="http://spark.ml/" target="_blank">spark.ml</a>. spark.mllib is currently under maintenance mode and all new features go into <a href="http://spark.ml/" target="_blank">spark.ml</a>.</em></p>
<pre><code>

<span>from</span> pyspark.ml.classification <span>import</span> LogisticRegression
...
training = spark.read.csv(<span>"s3://..."</span>)
test = spark.read.csv(<span>"s3://..."</span>)

lr = LogisticRegression(maxIter=<span>10</span>, regParam=<span>0.3</span>, elasticNetParam=<span>0.8</span>)

lrModel = lr.fit(training)

lrModel.transform(test)
...
</code></pre>
<h4 id="73-spark-structured-streaming">7.3. Spark Structured Streaming</h4>
<p>Spark Continuous Streaming model and Structured Streaming APIs, built atop the Spark SQL engine and DataFrame-based APIs.</p>
<p>It is necessary for big data developers to combine and react in real time to both static data and streaming data from engines like Apache Kafka and other streaming sources, the new model views a stream as a continually growing table, with new rows of data appended at the end. Developers can merely treat this as a structured table and issue queries against it as they would a static table.</p>
<p>Underneath the Structured Streaming model, the Spark SQL core engine handles all aspects of fault tolerance and late-data semantics, allowing developers to focus on writing streaming applications with relative ease.</p>
<h4 id="74-graphx">7.4. GraphX</h4>
<p>GraphX is a library for manipulating graphs (e.g., social network graphs, routes and connection points, or network topology graphs) and performing graph-parallel computations. </p>
<p>It offers the standard graph algorithms for analysis, connections, and traversals, contributed by users in the community: the available algorithms include PageRank, Connected Components, and Triangle Counting.</p>
<h2 id="8-spark-use-cases">8. Spark Use Cases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Processing in parallel large data sets distributed across a cluster</li>
<li>Performing ad hoc or interactive queries to explore and visualize data sets</li>
<li>Building, training, and evaluating machine learning models using MLlib</li>
<li>Implementing end-to-end data pipelines from myriad streams of data</li>
<li>Analyzing graph data sets and social networks</li>

	<div>
		
<p>In <a href="https://www.sicpers.info/2020/09/the-manifesto-for-anarchic-software-development/">The Manifesto for Anarchic Software Development</a> I noted that one of the agile manifesto principles is for self-organising teams, and that those tend not to exist in software development. What would a self-organising software team look like?</p>



<ol>
<li>Management hire a gang and set them a goal, and delegate all decisions on how to run the gang and who is in the gang to members of the gang.</li>
<li>The “team lead” is not in charge of decision-making, but a consultant who can advise gang members on their work. The team lead probably works directly on the gang’s product too, unless the gang is too large.</li>
<li>One member of the gang acts as a go-between for management and communicates openly with the rest of the gang.</li>
<li>Any and all members of the gang are permitted to criticise the gang’s work and the management’s direction.</li>
<li>The lead, the management rep, and the union rep are all posts, not people. The gang can recall any of them at any time and elect a replacement.</li>
<li>Management track the outcomes of the gang, not the “productivity” of individuals.</li>
<li>Management pay performance-related benefits like bonuses to the gang for the gang’s collective output, not to individuals.</li>
<li>The gang hold meetings when they need, and organise their work how they want.</li>
</ol>

<p>Does anyone now if I can prevent the reloading of a tab when switching between them?</p>
<p>I would like to keep the app running. The unity player is already configured to keep running in the background, but the iframe containing the player is reloaded when returning to the page. Something like a CSS display:none or attach it to the HTML body with a large negative margin, or…</p>

<p>Nice!</p>
<p>Easy way to bump the graphics a bit:</p>
<ol>
<li>apply some materials and play with the smoothes &amp; metallic values for some reflections.</li>
<li>add a <strong>static</strong> directional light or some area lights (the windows)</li>
<li>try marking all your non moving objects ‘static’ and <strong>bake the lighting</strong> using the universal render pipeline</li>
<li>Use only dynamic lights for the ‘controllable’ ones</li>
</ol>
<p>I switch the LightMaps to get the day/night functionallity.</p>
<p>Good graphics is all about lighting. I learned a lot from this tutorial: <a href="https://youtu.be/U3bN14B7nmE" rel="nofollow noopener">https://youtu.be/U3bN14B7nmE</a></p>

<p>I don’t know sweet home 3D. Probably you can export your model to a <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/3D-formats.html" rel="nofollow noopener">recognized format</a>(e.g. .dae; collada) and import it into Unity.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><hr><p><em>This is an automatic translation, we apologize for any mistakes. You can read the original spanish <a href="https://auamstrad.es/hardware/mundo-cpc/amstrad-cpc-472/">version here</a>.</em></p><hr><p><strong>The Amstrad CPC 472 is an 8-bit Microcomputer of the Amstrad brand, </strong>belonging to the classic range of <strong>CPC </strong>(<strong>Colour Personal Computer</strong>) and sold exclusively in Spain between 1985 and 1986. It is a personal computer almost identical to its predecessor, the CPC 464.</p><p>At the sight, it is only distinguished by the screen printing of the case, where the «64» is replaced by a «72», however, it has a particularity that <strong>makes it special: those extra 8 KB of RAM</strong> that indicates its name and that are accompanied by a hilarious and sometimes even crazy story. A succession of anecdotes, occurrences and arguing that will delight the most curious by the history of microinformatics.</p><p>For example, not everyone knows that <strong>t</strong>he CPC 472<strong> owes its existence to another 8-bit microcomputer: the Dragon</strong>. Had it not been for the emergence of Dragon computers in the Spanish computer scene, the Range of the Amstrad CPC would have gone from version 464 to 664 and completed in the 6128 (not counting the plus range). However, the Dragon brand was decisive for Amstrad to take out in Spain, and only in Spain, its version 472.</p><p><strong>How and why did it all happen?</strong> It’s a fascinating story, full of ambitious characters, business odagos, influence-trade and even palatial intrigue. But let’s start at the beginning….</p><h3>Dragon, the microcomputer made in Spain</h3><p>In 1982<strong>, <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Data" target="_blank" aria-label="Dragon Data (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dragon Data</a> was a subsidiary of a British toy company called Mettoy,</strong> which then had financial problems. They get more funding from a number of sources, one of them bein<strong>g the Welsh Development Office</strong>. As a result, this UK-constituting nation moves the Dragon factory and began producing mass microcomputers.</p><p>However, after various commercial vicissitudes, in 1984 the majority distributor decided to abandon its distribution and try to settle the brand. Several bids from companies such as Tandy or Philips come into play, but eventually it was <strong>Spain’s</strong> Eurohard who bought Dragon’s<strong> right</strong>s for 150 million pesetas (almost one million euros), which accounted for less than a third of its real value. In principle, it seemed like a good deal.</p><figure><img width="640" height="499" src="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp" data-src="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg" alt="The Amstrad CPC 472, an unusual case 2" data-srcset="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg 640w, https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer-300x234.jpg 300w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" title="The Amstrad CPC 472, an unusual case 2" data-src-webp="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp" data-srcset-webp="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp 640w, https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer-300x234.jpg.webp 300w" srcset="https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer.jpg.webp 640w, https://auamstrad.es/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Dragon_32_computer-300x234.jpg.webp 300w"><figcaption>Dragon 32</figcaption></figure><p>Eurohard’s di<strong>rective</strong> moved in the high circles of Spanish politics.

    <p>At times I use different services for sharing text or code snippets. Pastebin is a well known term for such services (where you <em>paste</em> whatever you want to share). The functionality is also simple (mostly) and that’s why I decided to build a pastebin service using only NGINX.</p>

<p><img src="https://usamaejaz.com/images/nginx-lua.png" alt="NGINX and Lua"></p>

<p>I have been a fan of NGINX the moment I learnt of it. In my earlier days (about 5 yrs ago), I was an <em>Apache guy</em>. But the moment I became familiar with NGINX and its vast power, I never looked at any other webserver software.</p>

<p>I often share text or code snippets online and that is why, It was fun to build it without using any “backend”. NGINX alone was enough with its <a href="https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module">awesome Lua module</a> which offers unlimited possibilities. I wanted to make it simple so there is not much in it other than the only feature of storing plain-text pastes.</p>

<h2 id="nginx-config">NGINX Config</h2>

<p>The whole backend of this pastebin is inside of the NGINX config. The Lua code within <code>content_by_lua_block</code> is all responsible for saving the paste. The code is saving the pastes to the local filesystem but there are endless possibilities (for example, storing in a database like mysql or redis).</p>

<p>The following location block is responsible for all <code>/api/pastes</code> requests. The directory to which the paste is saved must also be writeable by the webserver user.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># api for storing paste
location = /api/pastes {
	default_type "text/plain";

		client_max_body_size 128k;
		client_body_buffer_size 128k;
			
	content_by_lua_block {
		ngx.req.read_body()
		
		local method = ngx.req.get_method()

		if method == "POST" then
			local args, err = ngx.req.get_post_args(1)

			if err == "truncated" then
				ngx.say("error: only one POST parameter allowed.")
				ngx.exit(403)
			end

			if not args then
				ngx.say("error: failed to get post args: ", err)
				ngx.exit(500)
			end
			
			local content = args.content

			if content == nill then
				ngx.say("error: required parameter 'content' not set")
				ngx.exit(400)
			elseif content == "" then
				ngx.say("error: required parameter 'content' is empty")
				ngx.exit(400)
			end

			math.randomseed(os.clock()+os.time())
			local random = math.random
			local function randid()
				local template ='xxxx4xxxxxxyxxxx'
				return string.gsub(template, '[xy]', function (c)
					local v = (c == 'x') and random(0, 0xf) or random(8, 0xb)
					return string.format('%x', v)
				end)
			end
			local name = randid()
			local file, err = io.open("/var/www/nginx-pastebin/pastes/" .. name, "w")
			if file == nill then
				ngx.say("error: couldn't open file: ", err)
			else 
				file:write(content)
				file:close()
			end
			
			ngx.say("https://", ngx.var.host, "/", name)

		elseif method == "GET" then
			ngx.say("send a post request with 'content=your_text_content'")
		else 
			ngx.say("error: not allowed")
			ngx.exit(405)
		end
	}
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is an example of how services involving simple (or even complicated?) logic can be written using Lua inside NGINX.</p>

<p><code>ngx</code> has many other APIs and you can perform almost every NGINX-related action in your Lua code (rewriting, redirects, caching, serving content and much more).</p>

After seeing his post, and realizing I was meaning to go buy a Raspberry Pi 4, it just seemed natural to try and replicate his results in the hope of taking it a bit further. I am known for <a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/pi-on-the-wall-wall-mounted-home-server-part-2-diet-pi/">Raspberry Pi Butchery</a>, after all.</p>
<p>Before I tried desoldering anything, I set up my Pi for remote use; enabling SSH, WiFi, serial UART+ boot messages. The USB ports on the Pi board will not function after this modification, so this is super important.</p>

<p>As Tomasz lays out in his article, we need to remove the VL805 USB3 chip in order to access the PCIe interface. I used a hot air soldering station at low volume and medium-high temperature, with small nozzle head in order to not disturb the components nearby. I used flux along the edges and after a while the chip came away.</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip.jpg"><img src="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip.jpg" alt="" width="1521" height="1140" srcset="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip.jpg 1521w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip-300x225.jpg 300w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip-768x576.jpg 768w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip-1024x767.jpg 1024w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/removechip-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1521px) 100vw, 1521px"></a>I tried to remove the solder from the large pad by mixing some low-temperature solder paste into whats there, but it’s not needed. Just cover it with capton or poor electrical tape. I used electrical tape just to make seeing the small wires I’d be soldering above it easier to see.</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare.jpg"><img src="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare.jpg" alt="" width="1521" height="1140" srcset="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare.jpg 1521w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare-300x225.jpg 300w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare-768x576.jpg 768w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare-1024x767.jpg 1024w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1521px) 100vw, 1521px"></a></p>

<p>The VL805 datasheet is confidential which makes posting parts of it here tricky. However, an image search for “VL805-Q6 QFN68” may yield interesting results for those interested in finding out more. The pins we are interested in, are as follows (note differing polarity from Tomasz’s work):</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout.jpg"><img src="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout.jpg" alt="" width="1382" height="1024" srcset="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout.jpg 1382w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout-300x222.jpg 300w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout-768x569.jpg 768w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout-1024x759.jpg 1024w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/bare_pinout-405x300.jpg 405w" sizes="(max-width: 1382px) 100vw, 1382px"></a></p>
<p>I used 0.1mm enameled wire, with each differential pair cut to nearly the same length. Tinning the end of the wire by scraping with a knife and dipping in a molten solder ball makes soldering to the pads we need easier. Holding the wires down with kapton tape, and using flux, with the smallest iron tip I had made the job just bearable under a microscope.</p>

<p>The rather untidy looking result:</p>

<p>I was using a cheap PCIe riser as my “first interface” which was then to be connected to a PCIe switch card, which would then enable another 4 PCie slots. This first socket, as Tomasz mentioned in his article, needs the PCIe Reset pin pulled to 3v3, and both Reset and Wake signal traces to the USB socket cut. Note that whilst we now know where the PCIE Reset line is on the Pi, I have not needed to connect this as yet.</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys.jpg"><img src="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys.jpg" alt="" width="1152" height="864" srcset="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys.jpg 1152w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys-300x225.jpg 300w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys-768x576.jpg 768w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/firsttrys-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1152px) 100vw, 1152px"></a></p>
<p>The first attempt to boot with this setup resulted in the Pi not managing to boot at all. After some wiggling of the PCIe slot, the raspberry Pi booted, but no devices were shown when running lspci (<em>lspci can be installed via apt-get</em>). The third attempt, however, after some <em><strong>professional</strong> </em>wiggling of the PCIe slot, resulted in success! A booted Pi, with a PCIe switch!</p>

</pre>
<p>However, no devices were detected beyond the ASM1184e switch. Even a USB3 PCIe card using the same VL805 chip that I removed refused to detect. Running dmesg on the pi to get some driver details, I saw that whilst the PCIe link was active, and some busses were being assigned to the switch – it said that devices behind the bridge would not be usable due to bus IDs.</p>

</pre>
<p>The great thing about linux is that the source code is just there to dig into, and after finding where that “devices behind bridge are unusable” warning is printed I further discovered that the range of assignable busses can be limited by the Device Tree linux uses.</p>

<p><a href="https://elinux.org/Device_Tree_Reference">Device trees</a> are simply a description of the hardware which is passed to the Linux kernel on boot. It has all the devices listed; their driver compatabilities, memory mappings, and configuration. It is particularly useful for describing peripherals which may not be discoverable via conventional means. On the root directory of your Raspbian Raspberry Pi boot SD volume, you will find <strong>bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb</strong> – which is the Compiled Device Tree binary. This binary blob is not user readable, but thankfully we can use the <a href="https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/dtc/dtc.git/plain/Documentation/manual.txt?id=HEAD">Device Tree Compiler</a> to decompile it into a readable form. I did all of this within Windows Subsystem for Linux.</p>
<pre>dtc -I dtb -O dts -o bcm2711-rpi-4-b_edit.dts bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb
</pre>
<p>That command will decompile into <strong>bcm2711-rpi-4-b_edit.dts</strong>. Searching this file for “pci” we find an entry for the PCIe – and it has a definition for bus-range which limits the bus IDs from 0 to 1. I change the entry from “&lt;0x0 0x1&gt;” to “&lt;0x0 0xff&gt;” and recompile to the binary form, and place that on the Raspbian SD card overwriting the default.</p>

<p>And then I plugged some VL805-based USB3 cards in (one with a chained Network Interface). The setup looks as follows:</p>
<p><a href="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock.jpg"><img src="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock.jpg" alt="" width="1521" height="1140" srcset="http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock.jpg 1521w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock-300x225.jpg 300w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock-768x576.jpg 768w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock-1024x767.jpg 1024w, http://labs.domipheus.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/usb_lapdock-400x300.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 1521px) 100vw, 1521px"></a></p>
<p>I have my Motorola LapDock USB hub connected to the Pi via the PCIe USB controller. The keyboard and trackpad work great!</p>

<p>I have a SATA controller based on a JMicron JMB363, which is detected correctly but there is no driver to load. This will require some linux driver/kernel fiddling to get a driver loaded correctly – but it’s very promising!</p>

<p>I’ll leave this here for now, whilst I read up on the Linux driver stack and how to build kernels for the raspberry pi 🙂</p>

<p>Thanks for reading! You can find me, as always, over on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/domipheus">@domipheus</a>. Additionally, thanks to <a href="http://mloduchowski.com/">Tomasz Mloduchowski</a> for his previous blogs which spurred my interest! I don’t fully understand why Tomasz had kernel panics using a VL805 board, but maybe it’s something to do with the Device Tree, and the fact I also had a PCIe switch.</p>

<p><span><a href="https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>CrowdSec</span></a></span><span> is a behavior &amp; reputation-based security engine, designed to protect any exposed resource on the Internet, servers, containers, VMs, IoT objects, etc.<br>
</span><span>Installation is quick and wizard-assisted. The software is currently in a production-grade state, and runs in many places, including hosting companies. </span></p>
<p><span>The agent</span><span>&nbsp;parses logs from various data sources and applies heuristic scenarii to <strong>identify</strong> aggressive <strong>behavior</strong> and protect you against most attack classes. Cyber threats like credential stuffing, web or port scans, credentials brute-force (ssh / FTP / remote desktop / telnet), and many others are easy to defeat with CrowdSec. Written in Golang, the Agent uses an advanced grammar to allows complex or subtle treatments. The choice of Golang will allow us to port it to other platforms like Windows or MacOS.</span></p>

<p><span>The real endgame is to harness the <strong>power of the Crowd</strong> to have each other’s back.</span></p>
<p>While your agent is blocking aggressive IP, it can also share them with the global network. The community then gets fed with your spottings and you also benefit from the community ones in return. The goal is to create the most accurate and complete IP reputation database. Together we create a real-time IP reputation system that benefits all of our community members. So far, it gathers and maintains a fresh (less than 72 hours) list of 100 000 malevolent IPs addresses.</p>
<p><span>The consensus database (which stores aggressive IPs) includes a native anti-false-positive and anti-poisoning system. API oriented from day 1, our goal is to make it usable anywhere (infra, code, app, framework, libs, etc.). L</span><span>ast but not least, it has also been designed to be GD</span><span>PR compliant and privacy respectful.</span></p>
<h2>Born in the Cloud, thought for the Cloud</h2>
<p><span>To adapt to modern architectures, CrowdSec uses a decoupled approach “<strong>detect here, remedy there</strong>”. For example, if it detects an attack directed toward your database, it could remediate it on your firewall. To date, Netfilter (with an Ipset), Cloudflare, Nginx &amp; WordPress are supported. We work on new ones like Captcha, MFA, throttling,&nbsp; limiting access to some folders or features, etc. </span></p>
<p><span>If you decide to write Datasource connectors, log parsers, scenarios, you can share them on the </span><span><a href="http://hub.crowdsec.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>community hub</span></a></span><span>. The scenario grammar (YAML) is very versatile and allows for a lot of creativity. ie: If someone is hammering a webpage that takes a lot of CPU to generate, you can throttle. If an IP is port scanning, web scanning, and brute-forcing, you could consider it’s a targeted attack and not an opportunistic one and apply different remediation.</span></p>
<h2>Fully Open-Source&amp; Free</h2>
<p><span>CrowdSec, the behavior &amp; reputation-based security engine, is based on an <strong>MIT license</strong> and is open to contributions.<br>
Don’t hesitate to reach out to us through our </span><span><a href="https://crowdsec.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Website</span></a></span><span>, </span><span><a href="https://github.com/crowdsecurity/crowdsec" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>GitHub</span></a></span><span>, or interact directly with the team on our </span><span><a href="https://gitter.im/crowdsec-project/community#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span>Gitter</span></a></span>, we’ll be glad to help.</p>

<p><span>Blog post 11 September 2020, by Tom Tervoort, Senior Security Specialist and Ralph Moonen, Technical Director at Secura</span></p>
<p><span><span><em></em></span></span><span><strong><span>Last month, Microsoft patched a very interesting vulnerability that would allow an attacker with a foothold on your internal network to essentially become Domain Admin with one click. All that is required is for a connection to the Domain Controller to be possible from the attacker’s viewpoint. </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Secura's security expert Tom Tervoort previously discovered <strong><span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.secura.com/blog-cve-2019-1424" rel="noopener noreferrer">a less severe Netlogon vulnerability last year that allowed workstations to be taken over</a></span></strong>, but the attacker required a Person-in-the-Middle (PitM) position for that to work. Now, he discovered this second, much more severe (CVSS score: 10.0) vulnerability in the protocol. By forging an authentication token for specific Netlogon functionality, he was able to call a function to set the computer password of the Domain Controller to a known value. After that, the attacker can use this new password to take control over the domain controller and steal credentials of a domain admin. </span></p>
<p><span>The vulnerability stems from a flaw in a cryptographic authentication scheme used by the Netlogon Remote Protocol, which among other things can be used to update computer passwords. This flaw allows attackers to impersonate any computer, including the domain controller itself, and execute remote procedure calls on their behalf. </span></p>
<p><span>Secura urges everybody to install the patch on all their domain controllers as fast as possible. Please refer to Microsoft’s advisory. <strong>We published a test tool on Github</strong>, which you can download here:&nbsp;<strong><span><a href="https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472">https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472</a></span></strong> that can tell you whether a domain controller is vulnerable or not.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
            <p>I learned to write computer programs before JavaScript was created. The languages used in schools back then were mainly C and Pascal. They taught me that each variable has a specific type, such as integer or string, and that this type determines the operations that can be performed on a variable.</p><p>JavaScript is a bit different.</p><p>JavaScript also has types. Variables can refer to numbers, strings, Boolean values, objects, symbols, and special values such as <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code>.</p><h2 id="dynamic-typing">Dynamic typing</h2><p>Unlike C and Pascal, JavaScript variables can hold values of different types throughout their lifetime. A variable can be a number in one execution scenario and a string in another one. This makes it difficult to analyze how the program works just by reading its source code.</p><h2 id="weak-typing">Weak typing</h2><p>Operators work on values. For example, the <code>+</code> operator adds two numbers together or concatenates two strings. In C and Pascal, you cannot add a number to a string. This operation is undefined, and you need to convert one of the variables to a different type.</p><p>JavaScript will do its best to convert the operands implicitly, often in surprising ways.</p><h2 id="comparing-objects-of-different-types">Comparing objects of different types</h2><p>JavaScript has two comparison operators:</p><ul><li><strong>Strict comparison </strong>(<code>===</code>) compares both the value and the type. If the compared values have different types, it will return <code>false</code>. This is what we would intuitively expect from a comparison operator.</li><li><strong>Loose comparison</strong> (<code>==</code>) tries to automatically convert the operands to a common type to make the comparison possible. The rules of the conversions are complex and can be confusing for newcomers. Who would expect that the special value <code>null</code> can be equal to another special value <code>undefined</code>?</li></ul><p>Both dynamic and weak typing allow JavaScript programs to be very flexible and succinct, but they may also lead to security problems.</p><p>The dynamic nature of JavaScript makes it possible to implement algorithms that work on different types of data, including objects with different properties.</p><p>Let’s try to implement an HTTP endpoint that allows searching for objects in an array based on an arbitrary field and value and see how the type system can help us make the code as generic as possible. This will help us reuse it for different types of objects, and different types of search fields.</p><p>Our sample will use the <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express framework</a> to deal with details of handling HTTP requests but you don’t need to know Express in-depth to understand the code.</p><h2 id="search-example">Search example</h2><p>In our example, we will search the array of objects representing users. The search parameters will be passed as query string parameters. The callers will pass an object property name in the <code>field</code> parameter, and the search value in the <code>value</code> parameter. This way one endpoint can support multiple different search criteria.</p><p>The sample HTTP request and response could look like this:</p><pre><code>GET /profile?field=email&amp;value=joe%40wiredbraincoffee.com HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Connection: keep-alive
Accept: */*</code></pre><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 120
Connection: keep-alive

[{"email":"joe@wiredbraincoffee.com","password":"coldbrew","address":"1235 Wired Brain Blvd\r\nAwesome City, MM 55555"}]</code></pre><h2 id="handler">Handler</h2><p>The HTTP handler code is quite generic:</p><pre><code>const users = require('./users');

function readProfile(req, res) {
    // Get search params
    const [field, value] = getParams(req.query, ['field', 'value']);
    // Find user(s)
    const results = filter(users, field, value);
    res.json(results);
}</code></pre><p>First, we import the <code>users</code> array from a separate module. The <code>readProfile</code> function implements the search algorithm and conforms to Express conventions of taking the HTTP request and response objects as parameters.</p><p>Here is where the fun begins: we grab the values of <code>field</code> and <code>value</code> query string parameters and use those values to search the <code>users</code> array to find objects that have the property stored in the <code>field</code> variable with the value equal to the <code>value</code> variable .</p><h2 id="utility-functions">Utility functions</h2><p>The <code>readProfile</code> implementation looks simple, but the bulk of the work happens in the <code>filter</code> function:</p><pre><code>// Return items where a field has specific value
function filter(items, field, value) {
    const results = [];
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; items.length; ++i) {
        if (items[i][field] == value) {
            results.push(items[i]);
        }
    }
    return results;
}</code></pre><p>The <code>filter</code> function iterates over each element of the array and uses the bracket notation to retrieve the object property by name. The algorithm uses the loose comparison operator to compare object property value to the search criteria provided by the user.</p><pre><code>// Retrieve array of parameters from the query string
function getParams(qs, params) {
    const results = [];
    for (let i = 0; i &lt; params.length; ++i) {
        const value = qs.hasOwnProperty(params[i])
            ? qs[params[i]]
            : null;
        results.push(value);
    }
    return results;
}</code></pre><p>The <code>getParams</code> function streamlines retrieval of search parameters from the query string. It takes an array of parameter names as an argument and iterates over it. For each parameter, it checks if it is present in the query string and adds it to the results array. If the requested parameter is not in the query string, it adds <code>null</code> instead. <code>null</code> is a special JavaScript value used to denote missing data.</p><p>The resulting code is short and can easily be reused to implement search over other data sets, and based on criteria provided by the caller at runtime.</p><p>It also has a security flaw.</p><p>One of the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Equality_comparisons_and_sameness#:~:text=Loose%20equality%20using%20%3D%3D,exactly%20as%20%3D%3D%3D%20performs%20it.">surprising rules</a> that the loose comparison operator uses to compare values of different types is the one that says that <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code> are equal, while the strict comparison algorithm treats those two values as different.</p><p>Let’s take one more look at the comparison in the <code>filter</code> function:</p><pre><code>if (items[i][field] == value) {</code></pre><p>If we were able to force one operand to be always <code>null</code>, and the other to always be <code>undefined</code>, the comparison would always return true. Our HTTP endpoint would return the entire content of the <code>users</code> array, disclosing sensitive information about all the users of our application.</p><p>How can we do that?</p><h2 id="attack-payload">Attack payload</h2><p>The right-hand side of the comparison is a value returned by the <code>getParams</code> function. We can for this value to be <code>null</code> by… omitting it from the query string altogether.</p><p>Now we need a way to get the left-hand side to always return <code>undefined</code>. <code>undefined</code> is a special value that JavaScript uses for variables and object properties that have not been written to. If the field variable referred to a property that does not exist, the entire left-hand side of the comparison would always return undefined.</p><p>We do not always know what properties exist on objects. With a little bit of trial and error, it should not be difficult to find a value that is very unlikely to be a real property name.</p><p>A successful attack could look like this:</p><pre><code>GET /profile?field=doesnotexist HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:3000
Connection: keep-alive
Accept: */*</code></pre><pre><code>HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
Content-Length: 364
Connection: keep-alive

[{"email":"janet@wiredbraincoffee.com","password":"coldbrew","address":"1234 Wired Brain Blvd\r\nAwesome City, MM 55555"},{"email":"joe@wiredbraincoffee.com","password":"coldbrew","address":"1235 Wired Brain Blvd\r\nAwesome City, MM 55555"},{"email":"michael@wiredbraincoffee.com","password":"coldbrew","address":"1236 Wired Brain Blvd\r\nAwesome City, MM 55555"}]</code></pre><p>The root cause of the vulnerability is not difficult to fix. The <code>===</code> operator will treat <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> as different values. The comparison will always return <code>false</code> and the endpoint will not return any data from the <code>users</code> array, as expected.</p><p>This simple change fixed the vulnerability but there is more than we can do.</p><h2 id="a-more-robust-fix">A more robust fix</h2><p>The vulnerability was exploitable because of the loose comparison and the fact that the attacker could omit the <code>value</code> parameter. Instead of returning an error, the <code>readProfile</code> function was executed with corrupt input data.</p><p>A more complete fix uses the <code>===</code> operator but also adds more strict input validation. Our endpoint should return HTTP 400 response code when query string parameters are:</p><ul><li><strong>Missing</strong>. Omitting a parameter can lead to unexpected code behavior. The dynamic and weak typing make our program work without errors, even if it does something we did not expect it to do.</li><li><strong>Invalid</strong>. We also need to validate if the values are within the expected range. In our example, we should do it for the <code>field</code> parameter: we know what properties objects from the <code>users</code> array have, and there is no reason to allow other values.</li></ul><p>We will leave adding this input validation logic as an exercise for… you, dear reader. Have fun!</p><p>The next post in this series will explain how using certain unsafe functions can allow attackers to execute their code within our applications.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-1058"><div><p>I spend a lot of time working remotely, and while I have a decently sized laptop, I often miss having a second monitor. I looked at USB monitors, but then I remembered my old 2014 Galaxy Tab. Could I use it as a second monitor? The answer is: yes!</p><p>This setup works via virtual output devices and VNC. It essentially creates a remote desktop session on your laptop, which you can view and even interact with from your tablet. It’ll technically work with any network-ready computing device for that matter, whether it’s a tablet, a phone, a Raspberry Pi, or even another laptop.</p><p>These instructions are for Linux. Any Linux distribution should work, but you <em>must</em> be using X.org, not Wayland. You’ll also need to install the <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb">Android Debug Bridge</a> (adb) and <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/">x11vnc</a>.</p><p>You can <a href="https://gist.github.com/8bitbuddhist/7ab180286d6eb7fdc68d374063814175">download the full script from GitHub</a>. This post explains how the script works and provides setup instructions.</p><h2>Step 1: Create a Virtual Output Device</h2><p>First, we need to create a virtual output device by configuring Xorg. Create a file named <code>/usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/20-virtual.conf</code> and add the following contents:<br> <code>Section "Device"<br> </code><code>&nbsp;Identifier "intelgpu0"<br> Driver "intel"<br> Option "VirtualHeads" "1"<br> EndSection</code></p><p>The Identifier and Driver options will be different if your GPU is AMD or Nvidia. You can add more virtual outputs by changing the <code>VirtualHeads</code> option, but for now let’s keep it at one. Save the file, then log out and log back in to apply the changes. To confirm, run the <code>xrandr</code> command. You should see a line starting with <code>VIRTUAL1 disconnected</code>.</p><h2>Step 2: Configuring and Enabling the Virtual Display</h2><p>Now, we need to configure the virtual display by setting its resolution and placement relative to the primary display (i.e. the laptop screen).</p><p>Open the <a href="https://gist.github.com/8bitbuddhist/7ab180286d6eb7fdc68d374063814175"><code>create-android-display.sh</code></a> file in a text editor and change the following lines to match your specific setup:</p><ul><li><code>W=1920</code> and <code>H=1080</code> set the width and height of the virtual display. Set this to your tablet screen’s resolution.</li><li><code>VIRTUAL1</code> should match the name of the virtual display as reported by xrandr.</li><li><code>eDP1</code> should match the name of your primary display. You can use xrandr to confirm this as well.</li></ul><p>The line starting with <code>PW</code> uses xrandr to get the width of the primary display. We’ll use this later on when creating the VNC session.</p><p>The lines starting with <code>gtf</code> configure the display and set its position relative to the primary display. In the third line, you can change where the display is located by changing <code>--right-of</code> to <code>--left-of</code>, <code>--above</code>, or <code>--below</code>.&nbsp;These instructions assume you’re using <code>--right-of</code>, so if you decide to change the placement, note that you’ll need to change the crop options when running x11vnc.</p><h2>Step 3: Create a VNC Session</h2><p>For VNC, we’ll use <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/">x11vnc</a> because it can expose an existing Xorg session without requiring root permissions. We’ll use the <code>-clip</code> option to restrict the visible area to the virtual monitor.&nbsp;We’ll also use <code>-localhost</code> to prevent x11vnc from exposing the session over the network for better security.</p><p><code>x11vnc -localhost -clip ${W}x${H}+${PW}+0</code></p><p>Some 3D applications and compositing window managers don’t work well over VNC, so if your screen isn’t updating, try adding <a href="http://www.karlrunge.com/x11vnc/faq.html#faq-beryl"><code>-noxdamage</code></a>&nbsp;to the command.</p><h2>Step 4: Create an ADB Session</h2><p>VNC software uses port 5900 by default. However, since we ran x11vnc with <code>-localhost</code>, only software running on the laptop itself can access the VNC session. Fortunately, we can use adb to forward port 5900 on our laptop to port 5900 on our tablet. With port forwarding enabled, our tablet can access x11vnc as if it was coming from localhost.</p><p>We’ll forward the port with the command:</p><p><code>adb reverse tcp:5900 tcp:5900</code></p><h2>Step 5: Connect From Your Tablet</h2><p>The final step is to use a VNC viewer app on your tablet to open the x11vnc session. I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.iiordanov.freebVNC&amp;hl=en_US">bVNC</a>, but any viewer app will work.</p><p>From the app, enter <code>localhost</code> as the target and click connect. In a moment, you should see your virtual monitor appear on screen. Move your cursor around, drag windows, and watch them appear on your tablet! Once you disconnect, the script automatically turns off the virtual display on your laptop so you don’t have “invisible windows” floating off-screen.</p><figure id="attachment_1062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-1062"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=656%2C875&amp;ssl=1" alt="Using an Android tablet as a second monitor" width="656" height="875" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w" sizes="(max-width: 656px) 100vw, 656px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=768%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w, https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?w=936&amp;ssl=1 936w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/blog.8bitbuddhism.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/tablet-second-monitor.jpg?resize=656%2C875&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-1062">Kate and Konsole on an Android tablet via VNC.</figcaption></figure><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>VNC isn’t a perfect protocol, and it can be slow even over USB. It’s alright for web browsing and Slack/Discord, but I wouldn’t use it to watch movies. You <em>can</em> use VNC over the network, but this comes with some severe security implications. Make sure you enable encryption and password protection before exposing your desktop to <em>any</em> network.</p><p>One problem I couldn’t completely resolve was black bars appearing on my tablet when the tablet resolution was different from the laptop resolution. The bars completely covered the desktop and any windows I had on the screen. My only solution was to use the same resolution for both the laptop and the tablet, but this was workable for me.</p><p>Have any issues, thoughts, or suggestions? Leave a comment!</p></div></article></div>]]>

								<h2>Continuously tested <br>on the CTF battlefield</h2>
								<p>We believe that Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are an excellent testing ground for&nbsp;binary data analysis tools like Veles. The challenges met during the competitions are&nbsp;an&nbsp;endless source of unusual inputs and surprising edge cases. Our team uses Veles in&nbsp;all&nbsp;CTFs and we'd be glad to see other teams benefitting from this valuable tool.</p>

However, because my site is public, I have to be able to do this from any computer.</p><p>While I have been thinking about this problem for quite a while, it wasn't until I finished taking a cryptography class at college that I learned the tools to do this job.

                <center><em><p>Investigating number-theoretic patterns in large grids of trees</p>
</em></center>
                <h4>Tuesday, September 10, 2019 · 3 min read</h4>
<p>The last time I spent a long time on I-5, I started thinking about
<a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/envelope.html">envelopes</a>. This time, I started thinking about orchards. As
you drive along the central valley highway, you can see thousands and thousands
of perfect rows of trees. You can actually see them from the top on Google’s
<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/@36.6590095,-120.643549,2656a,35y,236.91h/data=!3m1!1e3">satellite
imagery</a>;
try zooming in slowly on that point, it’s really quite beautiful.</p>
<p>When you drive by them, you see the side view rather than the top view. In
fact, you see the side view <em>in motion</em> – the trees look like they’re dancing
an elaborate dance, continuously lining up into different formations to form
different rows in different angles. Really, of course, it is you who is moving;
the trees are still but by viewing them from different angles you can see
different “alignments” of the grid.</p>
<p>The effect is most pronounced with freshly-planted trees (or perhaps those are
markers?), where there is no foliage blocking the horizon.</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/orchard.png" alt="orchard"></p>
<p>I didn’t think to make a video at the time, but you can imagine that as the car
moves forwards a little bit, the pattern re-aligns in an incredibly satisfying
way.</p>
<p>I’m intrigued by the multiple “vanishing points” you can see in that picture.
The trees are regularly spaced in a square grid, but somehow there are multiple
(!) irregularly-spaced (!!) points along the horizon to which rows of trees
appear to converge. What’s going on here — is there a pattern to the
patterns? You could either stop reading here to have food for thought on your
next road trip, or you could keep reading for my ideas.</p>
<hr>
<p>The I-5 trees are a variation on a well-known theme: a theme called <em>Euclid’s
orchard</em> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid%27s_orchard">Wikipedia</a>,
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/EuclidsOrchard.html">MathWorld</a>). You stand at
the origin of the plane, and at every integer point there is a line segment
(“tree”) extending one unit upwards perpendicular to the plane. What you see
from your vantage point is Euclid’s orchard. Try to imagine what it looks like;
then, play with a JavaScript simulation of it
<a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/euclids-orchard/5282060266635264">here</a>.</p>
<p>The main idea of Euclid’s orchard is that trees at integer points (x, y)
occlude trees at any integer multiples of that point (nx, ny), so you don’t see
anything behind them. Also, nearby trees appear taller than farther-away trees
because that’s how perspective works. So there is a “horizon” where in each
direction you either see (1) a tree if the direction’s slope is rational, and
the tree is shorter if its denominator is larger; (2) nothing if the
direction’s slope is irrational. All sorts of fun can be had with this: see for
example a <a href="https://mathlesstraveled.com/2017/07/22/a-few-words-about-pww-20/">nice connection to the Fibonacci
numbers</a>.</p>
<p>The I-5 orchard in the picture is similar, but now we look upon it from some
height. Imagine mapping each point on the horizon to the direction in which I
would have to point my camera to look directly at that point. The “vanishing
points” have lots of trees along those directions, giving the illusion of
“rows.” What does this mean? It means that if you walked along that ray in
Euclid’s orchard, you would run into trees more frequently than other rays. In
other words, those rays represent directions whose slopes are rational with
small denominators.</p>
<p>Hmm… rational with small denominators… where have I blogged about that
before…? Right — around four years ago, when we
<a href="https://hardmath123.github.io/a-balance-of-powers.html">showed</a> that 2^12864326 begins with the digits
“10000000…” (and other number-theoretic shenanigans).  I wasn’t kidding,
rational approximation really is one of my favorite topics!</p>
<p>At the time I showed you this picture with little explanation.</p>

<p>Here is a little more explanation of its significance: as you start filling in
circles to some level, you generate a sequence of fractions called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farey_sequence">“Farey
sequence”</a> by listing the points
of tangency of the circle and the X axis. The Farey sequence is the list of
completely reduced fractions whose denominators are smaller than some bound.
Putting those two facts together: the points of tangency of the circles
represent points that are “rational with small denominators” — exactly what
we thought our I-9 orchard’s “vanishing points” were!</p>
<p>Looking back at the image, this is somewhat believable. We see a couple of
“strong” vanishing points, and then “weaker” vanishing points in between the
strong ones, and then <em>even</em> “weaker” vanishing points between the strong and
the weak vanishing points, and so on.</p>
<p>There are a number of cool implications of this. For example, the “least
patterned” regions of the horizon would correspond to regions that are “hard to
rationally approximate”; so, you’d expect them at plus-or-minus the golden
ratio’s slope from your line of sight.</p>

  <p><label>Posted on <strong>09 September 2020</strong></label></p><p>Colab source code can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/Mr4k/1f1b7ecaf30de073a50cbedd0da4dc82">here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem</strong><br>
Let's say we want to reduce the number of colors in an image. For example consider the image of fruit below:
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit.jpg" width="50%"> 
</p> <p>
If we run a count of how many colors are in the above image we get a whopping 157376 (for a 900 x 450 pixel image). Are all those colors really necessary?
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-16-final.png" width="50%"> 
</p> <p>
The image above has 16 colors and the one below only has 8.
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-8-final.png" width="50%"> 
</p> <p>
The problem of color palette reduction has been studied extensively and the typical approach works roughly as follows:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Build a reduced color palette of size N by dividing the color space up into N distinct regions where each region is represented by one color. This is usually accomplished by one of serveral <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_quantization">popular approaches</a>.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dither">Dither</a> the image. The process of dithering eliminates color banding and creates the illusion of more colors through a stippling like effect. If you are not familar with dithering we will explore it in more detail later. Given a fixed color palette there are specialized algorithms for dithering such as <a href="https://research.cs.wisc.edu/graphics/Courses/559-s2004/docs/floyd-steinberg.pdf">Floyd Stienberg</a>.  </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Instead of the usual approach, we are going to solve both of these problems at the same time using gradient descent.  </p>
<p>First of all let's define a palette of N colors. For this article the colors will be 3 component vectors in rgb space. A quick warning to graphics nerds, for portability and simplicity we do not take <a href="http://xahlee.info/img/what_is_gamma_correction.html">gamma correction</a> into account.</p>
<p>Now how do we assign a discrete set of colors to pixels in a differentiable way? I decided to do this using probability distributions. Each pixel is represented by a vector containing the probabilities of each palette color being chosen for that pixel. When actually generating an image we just sample each pixel's color from it's distribution.  </p>
<p>The above formulation is pretty general. Importantly both the colors in the palette and the mapping of image pixels to palette colors are variables which we can optimize over simultaneously. Now all we need to do is attach any one of a number of loss functions.   </p>
<p>The loss function I chose to use at first was just the squared difference between the original image and the expected value of the output image:  </p>
<p><span>\(loss(output, target)=\sum_{i\in pixels}(target_i\)</span> <span>\(-\)</span> <span>\(E[output_i])^2\)</span> (equation 1)  </p>
<p>So what's the idea here? Basically the expected output allows our image to pretend it has more colors than it really does.   </p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/dither-grey.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>For example let's pretend our palette has only two colors, black and white. Also suppose our target image is a 50% gray square. Consider the following three possible representations of the image. One is an all black image, one is all white and the third has 50% black and 50% white pixels randomly distributed across the image. If we look from far away the third image will look better. This is because the black and white pixels will blur together and appear gray. This effect is called dithering.   </p>
<p>By the above reasoning we want to make sure that the dithered pixel assignment (each pixel has a 50% chance of being black or white) should appear more desirable than the other two candidates to our loss function. Taking the squared error between the target image and the expected color of each pixel does exactly this.   </p>
<p>You might be asking, why not take the expected value of the whole squared error? This would look like:</p>
<p><span>\(loss(output, target) = E[\sum_{i\in pixels}(target_i\)</span> <span>\(-\)</span> <span>\(output_i)^2]\)</span>    </p>
<p>This actually does not work. To see why, let's look at the same setup as above and consider the expectation of an individual pixel (for math sticklers we can do this because expectation is linear). The loss function for a pixel denoted by the random variable <span>\(X\)</span> that always chooses black is: </p>
<p><span>\(E[(0.5 - X)^2] = (0.5 - 0)^2 = 0.25\)</span>   </p>
<p>And the loss function for a pixel denoted by the random <span>\(X\)</span> which is 50% black and 50% white is:</p>
<p><span>\(E[(0.5-X)^2] = (0.5-0)^2 * 0.5\)</span> <span>\(+\)</span> <span>\((0.5-1)^2 * 0.5 = 0.25\)</span>  </p>
<p>Unfortunately the values here are the same in both cases which rules out this loss function.  </p>
<p>Let's try using the loss from equation 1 with a palette of two colors:</p>
<p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-2-final.png" width="50%"> 
</p>

<p>Hey! Not too bad! As we can see, different shades are captured by different densities of darker pixels. For a starker example let's try this image of a vertical black and white gradient:</p>
<p><img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/bw-grad.png" width="25%"> 
        <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/bw-grad-2.png" width="25%">
    </p> 


<p>Now let's try 16 colors:
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-16-noisy.png" width="50%"> 
</p> <p>
The above image highlights one weakness of our current loss function. It's very noisy, even when it doesn't have to be.   </p>
<p>To give an extreme example, consider an image with three colors red, blue and purple (a mix of 50% red and 50% blue). Let's say we have room for 3 colors in our palette. In the eyes of equation 1 both of the following solutions would have the same loss:  </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The red pixels are red, the blue pixels are blue and the purple pixels are purple. We are using all three colors in our palette to the best of our ability and the image is reproduced perfectly.  </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Each red pixel is red, each blue pixel is blue, each purple pixel has a <span>\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> chance of being red and a <span>\(\frac{1}{2}\)</span> chance of being blue. Notice here we only use two out of three possible colors and the final image is clearly lower quality.   </p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To control for this weakness, I added an additional term to the loss function which penalizes the sum of the pixel variances. Right now I just hand tune the coefficient of the variance penalty. A good rule of thumb seems to be larger palettes should weigh variance more heavily. Applying this penalty (variance coefficient = 0.25) gives us the 16 color image from the top of this post:
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-16-final.png" width="50%"> 
</p>   
<p>The tradeoff is that too little variance removes noise which, due to the absence of dithering, makes the final image appear to contain fewer colors and also creates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colour_banding">banding effects</a>. The image below has 16 colors and variance coefficient = 1.0. It demonstrates both of these problems:<br>
</p><p>
    <img src="https://www.peterstefek.me/images/differentiable-dithering/fruit-16-saturated.png" width="50%"> 
</p>   
<p>Note there are many valid choices of loss function here and I'm not claiming mine is perfect at all. For example <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2017/12/23/c-differentiable-programming-searching-for-an-optimal-dither-pattern/">this article</a> on creating optimal dither patterns blurs both images and takes the difference between those. We could try to use this idea or search for something else to replace our simple squared error. It would also be interesting to try to use a real image quality metric like <a href="https://www.cns.nyu.edu/~lcv/ssim/">SSIM</a> to measure image quality instead of using variance as a proxy.   </p>
<p>Another place for improvement is that our approach is sloooow (up to several minutes). It also does not scale well memory wise to large palettes (when I try using more than 200 colors for the 900x450 pixel fruit image my colab notebook runs out of ram). This is because in that case there are more than 200x950x450 variables to optimize over. We could potentially tackle these problems in two ways. To address speed we could try to break the image up into mini batches. To address memory usage we could try to use a neural network to output probabilities at each pixel location instead of storing them all explicitly.   </p>
<p><strong>Why do I think this approach is interesting?</strong><br>
Although this approach is not state of the art by any means in either speed or quality I think it's interesting that we can optimize both the palette selection and dithering at the same time.  </p>
<p>As far as I know dithering and palette selection aren't really part of state of the art lossy compression today. However it would be neat if these same concepts could be applied to something like the color space transform, discrete cosine transform and weight quantization steps of <a href="http://pi.math.cornell.edu/~web6140/TopTenAlgorithms/JPEG.html">jpeg compression</a>.  </p>
<p>A pipedream would be an entirely differentiable image compression pipeline where all the steps can be fine tuned together to optimize a particular image with respect to any differentiable loss function.</p>

If so much has already been said about this, what’s the point of this post? This post aims to add artificial intelligence (AI) to the conversation.
To understand this point, we have to step back a bit and examine the history and business models of key players and technologies. I aim to keep the conversation accessible to someone unacquainted with technology and hence the length.</p>

<h2 id="background-history-and-business-of-ai-and-computers">Background: History and Business of AI and Computers</h2>

<p>It’s important to understand the history of AI research in detail before we appreciate the reasons for the rise of Nvidia.
We, then, also have to dig deep into the history of computers themselves.
We’ll then continue with ARM and the reason why ARM is up for sale.</p>

<h3 id="artificial-intelligence-ai">Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h3>

<p>There’s no denying the pervasiveness of AI in the modern world. AI is everywhere:</p>

<ul>
  <li>In your pocket. Ever used Uber? <a href="https://eng.uber.com/uber-ai-blog-2019/">Uber uses AI</a> to match you to drivers. Google assistant and Siri are obviously AI.</li>
  <li>In your living room. It was only in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZXugicgn6U">science fiction</a>, until recently, <a href="https://www.amazon.in/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=GNQ59GMNBGBU3U8L">that you can say aloud</a> <em>Alexa, play Pink Floyd</em> and <em>Comfortably Numb</em> plays in the background.</li>
  <li>In your office. When you wrote a mail in Gmail, have you received suggestions for your next sentence or phrase - as if <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/74533-new-ai-powered-gmail-feature-can-write-emails.html">Google knows</a> what you’re about to type?</li>
  <li>In your hospital. If you end up having a stroke, your brain <a href="https://info.vrad.com/hubfs/CaseStudy_AI_GreaterRegional_1119%20(002).pdf?__hstc=&amp;__hssc=&amp;hsCtaTracking=e9be34c0-46d3-45e1-90d8-b8153c20804e%7C7abcaae7-6366-4ff0-ad77-834471104fe7">might be saved</a> by AI’s brain (!) without you ever knowing. AI is enabling faster treatment for strokes and better management of <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.05509">diseases</a> and <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/04/23/1000410/ai-triage-covid-19-patients-health-care/">even pandemics</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>These advances are a result of hard work of some of the brightest minds of the world. Alan Turing, the patron saint for computers, wrote a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing_Machinery_and_Intelligence">seminal paper</a> on AI in 1950 even before transistor based computers were a thing. Many preeminent computer scientists worked on AI as evidenced by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Award">Turing Awards</a> for them. More recently, three researchers, two Canadian and a French, led the deep learning revolution which enabled all the above innovations.</p>

<p>These advances in computer science were not gradual - <a href="https://chsasank.github.io/(https://www.lri.fr/~mbl/Stanford/CS477/papers/Kuhn-SSR-2ndEd.pdf)">science doesn’t work that way</a>. Science instead works in cycles of revolutions and setbacks<span id="hype"></span>.
<span>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hype_cycle">Hype cycle</a> is another term for this
</span> There were many years since 1950 when there was no significant progress in AI. AI scientists call these times <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_winter">AI Winters</a>.</p>

<p>Latest deep learning revolution of AI was caused by the availability of</p>

<ol>
  <li>Huge amount of data</li>
  <li>Huge amount of compute to deal with that data</li>
  <li>Highly open research and open source code</li>
</ol>

<p>As computers pervaded our world starting 90s, huge amounts of data were collected. All of us have heard the maxim <a href="https://www.wired.com/insights/2014/07/data-new-oil-digital-economy/"><em>Data is the new oil</em></a>. 
In 2009, researchers from Stanford released <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet">ImageNet</a>, a database of 14 million images each with a description of what’s in the image. This large dataset allowed AI to learn <em>how to see</em> by example. Concurrently large datasets were created for translation, speech recognition and other cognitive areas. Imagenet and other datasets were available to the most researchers around the world and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ImageNet#History_of_the_ImageNet_challenge">competitions</a> were held between them to test out their methods.</p>

<p>GPUs were critical to handle this data as CPUs failed to provide the amount of compute required. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law">Moore’s law</a>, which propounds exponential increase in compute power, stopped working for CPUs in 2010s. GPUs, originally designed for gaming, provided an alternative to continue Moore’s law. They fit an amount of computing power that was possible only with an ultra-expensive supercomputer. GPUs essentially democratized the super computers which were previously accessible only to a select few.</p>

<p>Finally, the openness of the latest AI revolution has allowed researchers around the world to work together and generate an explosive amount of research. AI researchers have <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/stats/2018_by_area">rejected</a> traditional journals which guard the research behind paywalls <span id="opensciene"></span>.<span>This is a topic for long form discussion in itself. Highly recommend <a href="https://journals.uic.edu/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1265">this paper from 2005</a>. Lot more cool stuff happened since publication of this paper</span>
They also open source the code (i.e. methods) reproducing their research so that others can build upon them. This is a dream come true for any researcher - computer science or not.</p>

<h3 id="gpus-and-nvidia">GPUs and Nvidia</h3>

<p>Now that we understood the importance of GPUs for AI, it’s time for us to examine the rise of Nvidia. Nvidia was and is the leading manufacturer of GPUs, even before the rise of AI. Not only in terms of hardware, it has been a key partner in the AI revolution for software too.</p>

<p>Although GPUs store a lot of computing power, they were especially hard to program. Gaming industry recognized this and converged on a common library of tools called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL">OpenGL</a>. However, none of these tools were useful to AI researchers because they’re all about graphics while AI is about math. This is where Nvidia excelled - they provided this software library called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA">CUDA</a> which made coding up math on Nvidia GPUs easy.</p>

<p>In 2012, a grad student from University of Toronto, Alex Krizhevsky (of <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4824-imagenet-classification-with-deep-convolutional-neural-networks.pdf">AlexNet Fame</a>) used CUDA to create the first real Deep Learning model on the ImageNet dataset. Although deep learning ideas weren’t exactly new then, they never really caught on because of the lack of computation power required for them to work. CUDA allowed Alex to tap into the computation prowess which was originally designed for gaming. This paper turned out to be a game changer for AI and started the current revolution.</p>

<p>With GPUs and its CUDA software, NVIDIA then became a key contributor to the latest AI revolution. It soon became very apparent that there is quite a big business opportunity in AI for these companies.
This, of course, did not go unnoticed by the market. Nvidia’s stock price skyrocketed starting 2015. Since 2012, Nvidia’s stock price has grown 3500% (!) compared to 380% of NASDAQ composite.</p>

<p>GPU hardware is not exclusive to Nvidia though - gaming existed long before there was any AI. AMD, who acquired <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radeon">ATI</a> and a key leader in CPU market, is also a key competitor in GPU hardware. Latest and greatest gaming consoles - both Microsoft’s Xbox and Sony’s PlayStation - use AMD’s GPUs.</p>

<p>However, GPU AI software (CUDA) works only on Nvidia GPUs. This means AI is <em>exclusive</em> to Nvidia GPUs. CUDA became a strong moat for Nvidia’s commercial traction. Basically there’s no competition for hardware for AI.
This monopoly of AI GPU hardware is quite apparent in the server market<span id="tps"></span>.<span>
Google has developed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_processing_unit">TPUs</a> as an alternative to GPUs. They’re <a href="https://cloud.google.com/tpu">available</a> on Google cloud but they’re quite expensive. You can’t really get <em>hands</em> on them.
<br>
Most AI researchers, like myself, use consumer grade Nvidia GPUs for research. These are cheaper thanks to the competition from AMD in Gaming market.
</span>
Cloud providers like AWS, who power most of our web, offer no alternative to Nvidia for GPUs. Nvidia is able to charge significant markup for server-grade GPUs because of lack of competition. All of this is a great news for shareholders for Nvidia but not so great for AI researchers and engineers.</p>

<p>Nvidia’s commercial interests mean that CUDA will never work on their competitor’s GPUs. This is also the reason why Nvidia resisted integration of GPUs to Open Source Linux operating system.  In 2012, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds">Linus Torvalds</a>, the maintainer of Linux<span id="linus"></span><span>
and the patron saint of open source movement
</span> famously called Nvidia the <a href="https://www.wired.com/2012/06/torvalds-nvidia-linux/">single worst company</a> Linux community dealt with and publicly said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYWzMvlj2RQ"><em>Nvidia, F**k you</em></a>.</p>

<p>Nvidia’s consolidation of AI is nowhere at the end. It’s aggressively pushing into embedded devices<span id="jetson"></span><span>
with its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia_Jetson">Jetson line of products</a>
</span> and phones. This is the reason why it would want to acquire ARM. Now it’s the time to look into what ARM does and how it fits into the equation.</p>

<h3 id="computers-and-their-architecture">Computers and their Architecture</h3>

<p>So far, we have discussed GPUs and AI. We have to digress a bit and discuss the history of computers themselves and computer architecture - how compute is organized <em>inside</em> the chips.</p>

<p>A key moment in the history of computers was the discovery of transistors in 1947 at Bell Labs. Transistors are these little circuits made out of semi-conductors<span id="semi-conductors"></span><span>Semi conductors are chemical materials whose electrical properties fall between metals (think electrical wire) and insulators (think plastic around the wire).
</span> like silicon that allowed simulation of logic. Electrical circuits available until then<span id="vaccum tubes"></span><span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum_tube">Vaccum tubes</a> existed but they were too bulky.
</span> were what mathematicians would call linear and didn’t allow for logical computation.
New kind of circuits with transistors started to be called <em>Electronics</em>.
Now you should have got why the computer industry is also called electronics or semi-conductor business and the reason behind the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon_Valley">silicon valley</a>.</p>

<p>Second type of transistors called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOSFET">MOSFETs</a> were soon discovered in 1959, also at Bell Labs. Many of these transistors could be fit on one piece of silicon die - called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_circuit">integrated circuits</a> or <em>chips</em>. Intel (stood <strong>Int</strong>egrated <strong>El</strong>ectronics) was founded in 1968 to manufacture silicon chips.
It became obvious soon after that these chips could handle the logic we expected of computers - i.e chips are micro-processors aka CPUs! You use what are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instruction_set_architecture">instruction sets</a><span></span><span>Example instruction is to add two numbers A and B: <code>ADD A, B</code>
</span> to program these chips.</p>

<p>First true microprocessor, Intel 4004 was released in 1971. Computer architecture - organization of the transistors on the chips and instruction sets that are used to program them - evolved quickly. In 1978, Intel introduced landmark 8086 chip and followed up with 80186, 80286 etc chips over the years. These family of chips shared a similar architecture called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x86 architecture</a>. This …</p></section></div>

<h4><em>Learn all about the 118 combinations of protons, neutrons, and electrons that make up our world.</em></h4>

<p>Whether hung on classroom walls, put up in dorm rooms or screen-printed on T-shirts, the periodic table of elements screams, “Science!” like no other image. And why not? At 118 members and counting, the table lists every known chemical element, the (mostly) immutable building blocks of all materials in the universe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But it’s not just a random list of elements. The organization of the periodic table reveals an element’s behaviors and characteristics: from atomic size, density and abundance, to how it would likely interact with others.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Elements 101</h2>
<p>Everything is made up of atoms, and atoms are made up of their own tiny particles: Electrons flit semi-randomly around a central nucleus, which is made up of neutrons and protons. (Neutrons and protons are themselves made up of other particles: quarks.) The number of protons, also called the atomic number, defines an element — alter that, and you’ve changed the element itself.</p>

<h2>How to Read the Table</h2>
<p>Many periodic tables include the&nbsp;<strong>atomic number</strong>&nbsp;(number of protons) and&nbsp;<strong>atomic weight</strong>&nbsp;(which depends on protons and neutrons). Sometimes they list the full name of each element, but often only include their one- or two-letter symbol, nicknames that make complicated chemical formulas more compact. If the symbol doesn’t match the name (as in Au for gold and Na for sodium), it’s likely based on the element’s original Latin name (aurum and natrium).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Elements in the same column often share similarities, so chemists call these&nbsp;<strong>groups</strong>. Roughly speaking, the farther to the right a group is, the more electrons it has ready to interact with other elements. The first group, known as the alkali metals, has just one such electron, easy to lose when reacting with an element that has more electrons, such as one from the 17th group, the halogens. The noble gases, in the last column, are so named because they’re holding about all the electrons they can, so they don’t react easily with other elements — just as the noble houses of old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rows in the periodic table are called&nbsp;<strong>periods</strong>, and we currently have seven. They list the elements in order of atomic number before cutting off and continuing again in a new row, repeating established patterns of chemical properties. The tricky part in constructing the table is knowing when they cut off — or, equivalently, how many columns (groups) to include in each row.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<strong>lanthanide and actinide</strong>&nbsp;series — those two rows floating by themselves, named after their first members, lanthanum and actinium — are isolated like that as a concession to limited space. They truly belong wedged in among the other elements, but the full uninterrupted table would be too unwieldy and take up too much room.</p>

<p>The general shape of the periodic table might look uneven, but it reflects the crazy way electrons orbit around atomic nuclei. They don’t go around in nice, neat circles, like planets around the sun; instead, electrons scatter into shapes called orbitals, which depend on how many other electrons are in the vicinity. For example, the first two columns include the sphere-shaped&nbsp;<em>s</em>&nbsp;orbitals, which can contain up to two electrons; the large block of columns from boron to neon groups elements with variations of dumbbell-shaped&nbsp;<em>p</em>&nbsp;orbitals.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The First Periodic Table</h2>
<p>Scientists had long created rudimentary tables of the known elements, but 150 years ago, a Russian chemist granted the modern table its power. In 1869, Dmitri Mendeleev established what we now call the periodic law: Specific trends, such as melting point and atomic radius, recur periodically among the elements when they’re listed in order of increasing atomic weight. End a row and start a new one when that pattern starts over, and you’ll get something quite similar to the current periodic table, where columns represent shared traits.</p>
<p>But, crucially, Mendeleev wasn’t a huge stickler for his own rules. He left gaps in his table where he felt undiscovered elements might lie, even predicting (correctly) some of their attributes. And he would sometimes fudge the arrangement to keep like elements together, even if they were technically out of order. As it turns out, chemists learned in the early 20th century that the true order of the elements is dictated not by atomic weight, but by the number of protons in an element’s nucleus — an insight that resulted in only minute changes to the table, thanks to Mendeleev’s fudges.&nbsp;</p>
<p>By now, scientists have filled in all those gaps in the table. The latest elements were discovered only 12 years ago, and we’re currently on the hunt for even more, hoping to start a whole new row.</p>

<h2>Who Picks the Names and Symbols of New Elements?&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The discoverers do — as long as the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) approves. The IUPAC usually suggests the name end in -ium for consistency, and past practice has been to honor places (americium and polonium), people (curium and einsteinium) and even planets (uranium and plutonium). Before an element is officially named, its placeholder name is based on the Latin names for its atomic number: oganesson, number 118, was known as ununoctium (one-one-eight-ium).&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Are There Other Tables?</h2>
<p>While the familiar rectangle is the most iconic and standard version of the periodic table, other organizational schemes exist, such as the ADOMAH table, which emphasizes electron shapes, and Otto Theodor Benfey’s spiral table, which is more compact and continuous.</p>

<p>Human memory is captivating. Take a moment to dive into your oldest recollections and evoke any memory related to the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first memory you can recall;</li>
<li>your first friend;</li>
<li>your first pet;</li>
<li>your childhood toys;</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/how-people-learn-the-brain-basics/">How People Learn — The Brain Basics</a>, memories are well established neural patterns that get activated simultaneously. These circuits encode our memories, abilities, behaviors, knowledge, literally everything.</p>
<p>Interestingly, though, there are different types of memory storage, and in this article, I’d like to describe what those are.</p>
<h2 id="from-high-resolution-short-lived-to-low-resolution-eternal-timespan-memory">From High-Resolution, Short-Lived To Low-Resolution, Eternal Timespan Memory</h2>
<p>Nature did a fascinating job in designing life (and us). We don’t even think about how we form memories, and, incidentally, we don’t yet fully understand this process. What we do know is that there are several stages the information from the outer world has to pass through until it becomes part of our long-lasting memories.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sensory Memory</li>
<li>Short-Term Memory</li>
<li>Working Memory</li>
<li>Long-Term Memory</li>
</ul>
<p>A note of caution before we proceed: human memory is an active area of research that still has many unknowns, and there are many models and theories about some aspects of it. As we do not yet fully understand the internal workings of the brain, scientists have to rely on some simplifications and approximation models to explain how we receive, process, and perceive information. If you have heard about a different model or disagree with the models presented here, I kindly invite you to discuss it in the comments!</p>
<h2 id="sensory-memory">Sensory Memory</h2>
<p>Sensory memory is the first place where sensory information gets deposited for further use. Data from <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/blog/how-people-learn-human-senses/">human senses</a> is stored here in a relatively unprocessed form for a brief period.</p>
<p>Sensory memory consists of distinct storage types for three of human senses:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Iconic Memory</em> is for the exclusive storage of visual information;</li>
<li><em>Echoic Memory</em> is for the exclusive storage of auditory information;</li>
<li><em>Haptic Memory</em> is for the exclusive storage of tactile stimuli;</li>
</ul>
<p>It is considered that Sensory memory is outside of cognitive control. It is the first step in the perception of the environment around us. As mentioned in how <a href="https://iuliangulea.com/micro/the-world-we-see-is-a-pixelated-version-of-the-real-world/">we see a pixelated version of the world</a>, information quality degrades as it moves from our senses to the central executive system. Sensory memory is the first frontier toward ingesting and making sense of data, and at this point, the information is of very high quality.</p>
<p>However, storing such detailed information comes at a price. It is incredibly volatile, as it fades away quickly. The availability differs between senses, though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Iconic memory’s availability is &lt;1 second.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> That’s why you don’t remember what time it is, even though you just looked at your watch!</li>
<li>Echoic memory’s availability is somewhere between 2–4 seconds.<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> That’s why, whenever you don’t pay attention when someone’s talking, and they ask you to repeat what they just said, you still can access those several seconds worth of information from your Echoic memory store.</li>
<li>Haptic memory’s availability is &lt;2 seconds.<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="short-term-memory-stm">Short-Term Memory (STM)</h2>
<p>STM is a very ambiguous term that supposedly originated at the beginning of the twentieth century. It is often used interchangeably with Working Memory, which I will also use here. Other usages relate to simply holding the information (in contrast to storing <em>and</em> processing it, as Working Memory does) over a short period. But as you will see below, one Working Memory model encompasses some components that fit the description of an STM store. Therefore, whenever you see in the literature STM, it most probably is the Working Memory, which is a more recent term that better fits the description of cognitive processes related to information processing and storage.</p>
<h2 id="working-memory-wm">Working Memory (WM)</h2>
<p>Once the information from the outer world reaches our senses and is stored in the sensory memory, some of it requires conscious processing and manipulation, and the Working Memory is the place where that happens. The nature of working memory is still under active debate, as many models have been proposed to explain its essence. However, only two of them are the most influential:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>The multicomponent model</em> by Baddeley and Hitch;</li>
<li><em>Working memory as part of long-term memory</em> by Ericsson and Kintsch;</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-multicomponent-model">The Multicomponent Model</h3>
<figure>
    <img src="https://iuliangulea.com/images/how-people-learn/memory/Baddeley_and_Hitch%27s_Working_Memory_Model.png" alt="Baddeley and Hitch multicomponent model"> <figcaption>
            <p>Source:
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Baddeley_and_Hitch%27s_Working_Memory_Model.png">Wikipedia</a></p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>According to Baddeley, the WM consists of several components. The <em>Central Executive</em> component coordinates attention and cognitive processes, suppresses irrelevant information and actions, and switches between various tasks. It also is responsible for coordinating the subordinate systems (Phonological Loop and Visuo-Spatial Scratchpad).</p>
<p>The <em>Phonological Loop (PL)</em> stores phonological information (sound and language). Interestingly, visually presented language (like the text you are reading here) can be transformed into phonological information by subvocalization. PL consists of an <em>Acoustic Store</em> (which partially represents the Sensory Memory for auditory information) and an <em>Articulatory Loop</em> that continuously refreshes data in the Acoustic Store in a rehearsal loop.</p>
<p>The <em>Visuo-Spatial Sketchpad (VSS)</em> is a similar structure to PL but for visual and spatial information. It connects with the visual sensory memory store but, at the same time, can be used to construct and manipulate images and represent mental maps. If I ask you to imagine an oak tree on a green field on a sunny day, you will engage the VSS to perform that action.</p>
<p>The original model was proposed in 1974 and consisted only of these three components, but in 2000, Baddeley extended the model by adding a fourth one, the <em>Episodic Buffer (EP).</em> Its addition was to address some concerns regarding the flexibility of the model. The EP is supposed to hold representations that integrate phonological, visual, and spatial information and information not covered by the subordinate systems (e.g., semantic, musical, categorical information). It is <em>episodic</em> because it is assumed to bind information into a unitary episodic representation.</p>
<p>This model does a good job portraying the inner processes of the Working Memory. However, it is not exhaustive. For example, it does not provide a representation for tactile sensory information.<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="working-memory-as-part-of-long-term-memory">Working memory as part of long-term memory</h3>
<figure>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Contrary to the multicomponent modal, Anders Ericsson and Walter Kintsch have introduced the notion of “long-term working memory,” which they define as a set of “retrieval structures” in long-term memory that enables seamless access to the information relevant for everyday tasks.<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup></p>
<p>According to this model, the Working Memory is not a separate system but rather a mechanism to activate and operate on parts of the long-term memory. The activated <em>long-term memory representations</em> can then be brought to our awareness through the <em>focus of attention.</em></p>
<p>In terms of capacity, since activated working memory representations rely on the existing long-term memory representations, there can be many of these. But the bottleneck is the focus of attention, which is very narrow and can hold up to four such activated representations at once. I will discuss this in more detail in a follow-up post.</p>
<h2 id="long-term-memory-ltm">Long-Term Memory (LTM)</h2>
<p>Finally, LTM is the memory storage that holds all our memories, old and new, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicit_memory">implicit</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explicit_memory">explicit</a>. The most common analogy is that the LTM is like a hard-disk: you write information to it, and it is stored there. It is the warehouse of all the things we have read, heard, saw, and experienced.</p>
<h2 id="the-whole-brain">The Whole Brain</h2>
<p>As mentioned earlier, there are still many unknowns, both at the level of each store type as well as at their joints. But the information we know already gives us a possibility to improve our productivity and the way we learn. In the next articles, I will dive deeper into some of these stores and show you what causes poor performance and what to do about it.</p>

<p><em>This is a guest post from Mia de Búrca. Enjoy.</em></p>



<p>Dear new developer,</p>



<p>You’re probably going to want to quit.</p>



<p>The very qualities that make writing software appealing can also make it frustrating beyond belief. You’re headed down this path because you like to be challenged, to learn and grow. However, facing new harder problems day in, day out can take its toll on your morale. And keeping up to date, familiarising yourself with the breadth and depth of topics in this domain – it can be overwhelming. But if you’re reading this it’s likely you’ve already felt the deep satisfaction of writing code to be proud of, so I hope that by sharing my experiences, from early in my career and from a few weeks ago, you will be motivated to push through and keep enjoying the journey.</p>



<p><strong>The Import</strong></p>



<p>One of the first times I nearly quit was a few weeks into my first role as a dev. I was fortunate enough to land a great job at a small startup, and I was pretty awe struck by the talented and motivated people on my team. So after a while of pairing, I picked up a piece of work to try on my own. After doing some copy-pasta from other files and then tweaking I was chuffed and attempted to view the web page that would now be perfect, right?</p>



<p>Much to my dismay I was met with a blank page and an obscure error message. Baffled, bit by bit I undid all my changes, at each step feeling less worthy of the job, until nothing was left except one measly import statement. I could feel myself go red in the face as I still couldn’t understand what was going on. I should be able to do this, but I’m not good enough. Eventually, I turned to my mentor to admit defeat, and my panic dissolved when he said “oh yeah, this one is definitely confusing” then casually pointed out a simple syntax error. I realised that unlike him, I was not yet equipped with the necessary debugging skills, I was not yet familiar enough with the language I was working in to decode the error message. It takes time.</p>



<p><strong>The Library</strong></p>



<p>It has been four years since the import statement that stumped me, but just a few weeks ago, when I volunteered to update a library which was many versions behind, this seemingly trivial task wound up with me ready to quit yet again. Between a broken development environment, failing tests (was it the tests… or the code?), and still this library integration that refused to obey, I was at a loss. I should be able to do this, I should be good enough by now surely? These thoughts drove me to stubbornly dig my heels in and devote hours to diving into the library source code, reading in circles, dipping in and out of StackOverflow, getting more and more frustrated. Much time wasted I was no better off, so I went and made myself a cup of tea and called up a colleague and good friend to lament my problem. Typically, within seconds of this accidental rubber ducking session the solution to my worries became apparent.</p>



<p><strong>The Lessons</strong></p>



<p>And I could probably list countless other occasions. There may be many different things that leave you feeling like quitting, for me it often boils down to not feeling good enough to tackle a problem. But when you come up against a roadblock, you shouldn’t see it as a reflection on your own ability. If like me you find yourself paralysed by feelings of inadequacy, recognise that the foundation of all programming is problem solving – if there were no annoying problems, you wouldn’t have a job – and as you progress through your career you will gain more tools to solve them. Step back and remember, when it comes to tech, there is a reason to be found – sometimes it takes time, distance, or some help to see it.</p>



<p>These are lessons you should try to internalise, or like me you’ll relearn them throughout your career. You can’t change the fact that deeply frustrating problems are coming your way. You can only change your perspective. Put your energy into solving the problem and don’t assume that you’re not good enough. “Good enough” is an arbitrary concept, an ever moving goalpost. Give up on the notion of “good enough” and instead give yourself some time.</p>



<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Money may not be your <em>only</em> concern for your next role, but getting paid more for doing a job you liked the look of anyway can’t hurt. <strong>This guide is going to help you to negotiate a better paycheck for your next JavaScript development role by showing you how to navigate a hiring process.</strong></p>

<p>We’ve got behind-the-scenes info on what happens during the hiring process. Who’s who, how to handle the external recruiter, the best way to answer the dreaded salary question during interview—it’s all here. Knowledge is power, and after learning what’s really going on during the hiring process, you’ll be well-equipped to hack it to your own advantage. On your marks, get set, <em>go get get paid more</em>!</p>

<p>Money makes the world go ‘round. Cash is king. A dollar makes you holler. A penny saved—well, you get the point. But here’s the kicker:</p>

<h2>Nobody cares about the number on your paycheque as much as you do.</h2>

<p>What’s an extra $10,000 worth? Let’s look at some cold, hard math.</p>

<p>To you, $10,000 more equals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An extra $6,000 after taxes, or $500 per month</li>
  <li>5-20% of your average technical salary</li>
  <li>Ramen that isn’t prepared in the microwave</li>
</ul>

<p>There are long-term effects, too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bigger bonuses, which are often expressed as a percentage of the current salary</li>
  <li>A better starting point when your next employer asks for your current salary</li>
  <li>A bank account that’s as full and delicious as a bowl of <em>edamame</em></li>
</ul>

<p>An extra $10,000 sounds great doesn’t it? No downsides for you—but what does it mean to the other people involved in the hiring process?</p>

<h3 id="the-external-recruiter">The External Recruiter</h3>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/1303d71d4384ec0334f4bc9f9071f554.png" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/external-recruiter.png"><figcaption>Me, profiting off your hard work</figcaption></figure>

<p>Let’s start with this guy/gal, who is coincidentally me. The External Recruiter doesn’t work for the hiring company directly, they work for a staffing agency / recruitment firm, and they work on commission. To an external recruiter, $10,000 more equals:</p>

<ul>
  <li>An extra $1,500 for the agency at a 15% commission</li>
  <li>A personal commission to the recruiter of $375 at 25%</li>
  <li>After-tax earnings of $225</li>
</ul>

<p>That after-tax $225 buys a decent amount of ramen for the recruiter, but if the client chooses another candidate because you were too expensive—POOF. That $225 vanishes in a cloud of soy-scented smoke and the recruiter <em>is not pleased</em> that you cost him a commission.</p>

<p>Let’s face it: whatever you and the recruiter intend to buy with your newfound wealth, you both want to see a nice number in that letter of offer. Mo’ money, mo’ joy, right? But not everyone is looking to pay you as much as possible… meet:</p>

<h3 id="the-internal-recruiterhr">The Internal Recruiter/HR</h3>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/001fd846fa88d16e574eb527cb55b6cc.jpg" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/internal-recruiter.jpg"><figcaption>No more free lunches</figcaption></figure>

<p>Candidates flow from the External Recruiter to the Internal Recruiter/HR who <em>does</em> work for the hiring company, and is meant as the company’s first line of defense.</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’ve got to hire someone within a set time-frame and budget range</li>
  <li>That LinkedIn post about <em>“If you Think a Professional is Expensive, Wait until you Hire an Amateur”</em> has them shook</li>
  <li>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=81Nl7VYFEaI">guy in the $3,000 suit</a> said they have to hire “a rock star who knows CSS to build out the backend widget accounting system”—whatever that means</li>
  <li>The recruiter takes them for nice lunches, but that doesn’t mean they’ll pick his candidate. Unless it’s their favourite bistro on the corner and then … the candidate’s in</li>
</ul>

<p>An extra $10,000 a year on your salary doesn’t matter to the internal recruiter/HR <em>at all</em> as long as it’s within the range they’ve been given. If it’s outside of that range, it means they’ll need to exchange some emails with someone else in the company to see if an exception can be made for you.</p>

<h3 id="the-hiring-manager">The Hiring Manager</h3>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/265e2ec80c5cd1590a36bc8b51bd23a2.png" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/hiring-manager.png"><figcaption>Hiring Manager, <i>ad astra</i></figcaption></figure>

<p>The Hiring Manager is likely to be your line-manager (or a level up from that) in the role. She is (or was) probably a programmer like you.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Often, they don’t control their own budget, which means they don’t <em>really</em> care how much you cost</li>
  <li><strong>BUT</strong> The Widget Automation project is six months behind, and they’ve got to hire someone now or it goes up in flames</li>
  <li>They can hire whomever they want if the salary falls within a certain range and can beg the boss for an increase if they meet a Widget Automation rock star</li>
  <li>Hiring makes them hungry. When’s lunch?</li>
</ul>

<p>An extra $10,000 a year on your salary mostly doesn’t matter to the Hiring Manager, as it’s not her money. But while the internal recruiter/HR will need to simply get someone to authorise going outside the normal salary range, the Hiring Manager will actually need to make the case for it. She’ll need to convince whomever does control the budget that you’re worth it … and that’s real, actual effort in a busy professional’s day.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-lose-a-job-offer">How To Lose A Job Offer</h2>

<p>Remember, knowledge is power. Once you understand what’s happening in the background, you will be light years ahead of your competition. Key to your success is one universal truth:</p>

<h2>Hiring people is HARD, so recruitment processes are inflexible</h2>

<p>External recruiters, internal recruiters/HR, and hiring managers follow rigid processes they’ve been given, because when they deviate from these well-trodden roads, trouble looms.</p>

<p>About the best way to experience this first hand is to decide on 4:45pm on the last day of the month that you’d like the job offer you said you were likely to accept at $90,000 to pay $90,500 instead.</p>

<h3 id="who-youve-annoyed-and-how">Who you’ve annoyed and how…</h3>

<h4 id="the-external-recruiter-1">The External Recruiter</h4>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/1303d71d4384ec0334f4bc9f9071f554.png" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/external-recruiter.png"></figure>

<p>The External Recruiter thought he had his commission in the bag for the quarter, but now:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Accounts Department are closing up the month in 15m</li>
  <li>… which means this month’s sales target go the way of the Death Star</li>
  <li>… even though he had a frank and detailed discussion with you about wage expectations at the start, you’ve decided to roll the dice at the eleventh hour</li>
</ul>

<p>Frantic phone calls will be made to…</p>



<h4 id="the-internal-recruiter--hr">The Internal Recruiter / HR</h4>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/001fd846fa88d16e574eb527cb55b6cc.jpg" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/internal-recruiter.jpg"></figure>

<p>The Internal Recruiter/HR had to fill out a lot of forms to get a job offer authorised:</p>

<ul>
  <li>He camped out in the CEO’s office for half of Tuesday to get authorization to offer $90,000.</li>
  <li>Can’t get in touch with the CEO because she is at a technology-free week-long “Management Realignment Camp” in Tahiti.</li>
  <li>Needs to jump back through all those hoops because now you want an extra $500.</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s time to check with the Hiring Manager how much she <em>really</em> cares about hiring you…</p>



<h3 id="the-hiring-manager-1">The Hiring Manager</h3>

<figure><img src="https://d1qmdf3vop2l07.cloudfront.net/polite-scissors.cloudvent.net/hash-store/265e2ec80c5cd1590a36bc8b51bd23a2.png" data-cms-original-src="/img/anatomy-img/hiring-manager.png"></figure>

<p>The Hiring Manager:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Was authorised to sign off on $90,000 because internal HR got it approved</li>
  <li>Can’t offer $90,500 without a formal review, three pieces of paper signed in triplicate, and the blood of an albino bat, because it’s just over an internal company threshold that means the hire needs referring to the Board</li>
  <li>Wants to make it home for dinner at least one night this week and has a candidate she likes almost as much as you who’s asking for $89,000…</li>
</ul>

<h2>Sorry, the other candidate got the job because you're not a good "cultural fit"</h2>

<p>If you know how the recruitment process works, you can get paid more by working <em>with it</em> rather than against it. Help them to help you! Let’s rewind and examine the four stages of recruitment to see what happened to lead to that missed opportunity:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Hiring Stage 1: Before the Job is Posted</li>
  <li>Hiring Stage 2: The Job is Posted</li>
  <li>Hiring Stage 3: Interview</li>
  <li>Hiring Stage 4: The Offer</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="hiring-stage-1-before-the-job-is-posted">Hiring Stage 1: Before the Job is Posted</h2>

<p>The hiring manager didn’t wake up thinking, “My day’s looking a little slow—let’s hire a new employee!” The hiring process starts when a business need has been identified, and if you can find out what that need is, you’ll have useful intel.</p>

<h3 id="why-are-they-hiring">Why are they hiring?</h3>

<p>If the business is replacing an existing person:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They’re likely looking for someone with similar experience</li>
  <li>They don’t want to pay a dramatically different salary</li>
  <li>They probably want to use the same job title</li>
</ul>

<p>In this situation, flexibility is usually low, but listen for an indication that the last person has “been there forever and needs replacing” or “wrote horrible legacy code and ran SQL ‘fixes’ against the live DB.” These can be indicative that the employer knows they need an upgrade in professionalism and skills, and this may be the cue to mention your <em>professionalism, experience, and ability to deliver more appropriate methods</em> for their business—at a price befitting those skills, of course.</p>

<p>If the business is hiring for a new project or team:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Somehow, somewhere, someone got a funding sign-off for this project</li>
  <li>They’re likely drawing from a pot of money for the project or team, so they have the potential to make a few expensive hires (because who doesn’t want at least one rockstar on their team?)</li>
  <li>There may be a leadership position that offers a big title and the big bucks to go with it</li>
</ul>

<p>A new project or team has the most flexibility in hiring. They’re starting from square one, and they might as well start with a gem, like you. In an interview, take this as a signal to tout your past success in leading or collaborating on new and exciting projects.</p>

<p>What if the role is something between a replacement and a new hire? Say the business is undergoing incremental growth: they need new people, but aren’t ready to rain dollar bills on any developer who comes through the door. What do you do?</p>

<h2>You ask questions!</h2>

<ul>
  <li>How many people are they hiring?</li>
  <li>Is this a new role? A new team?</li>
  <li>Are you joining a team of people with the same job title?</li>
</ul>

<p>At worst, asking questions makes you seem interested in their business. Not a bad way to make a great first impression.</p>

<p>Earlier we said “someone got a funding sign-off” for the project. This somebody sits somewhere in the hierarchy above where you ultimately will. This person controls their budget, and your salary is part of that budget. Their performance is often measured on the health of this budget.

This is an early version of the product, but we're releasing it now to bring you — our global community of users, creators and artists — on our journey with us as we build and improve Shorts. We’ll continue to add more features and expand to more countries in the coming months as we learn from you and listen to your feedback. Here are more details on what to expect.</p></div>

September 14, 2020 | https://goel.io/nothing-to-hide | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://goel.io/nothing-to-hide">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Within privacy circles, Glenn Greenwald’s <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/glenn_greenwald_why_privacy_matters">2014 TED talk</a> titled “Why privacy matters” is considered required reading. One quote jumps out to nearly everyone ― including the live audience ― has to do with how Greenwald responds to people who don’t worry about privacy because they have nothing to hide.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I always say the same thing to them. I get out a pen, I write down my email address. I say, “Here’s my email address. What I want you to do when you get home is email me the passwords to all of your email accounts…[snip]”</p>

  <p>Not a single person has taken me up on that offer.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He continues to explain why that is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And there’s a reason for that, which is that we as human beings, even those of us who in words disclaim the importance of our own privacy, instinctively understand the profound importance of it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ending that thinking with:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>People can very easily in words claim that they don’t value their privacy, but their actions negate the authenticity of that belief.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I used to agree and echo the same point, mostly in jest. Some version of “then hand me your passwords” is even a popular comeback <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/privacy/search?q=%22nothing%20to%20hide%22&amp;restrict_sr=1">on Reddit</a> to the the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nothing_to_hide_argument">nothing to hide</a>” argument.</p>

<p>Over time, I’ve come to realize that the response does very little to actually understand where people are coming from, and to really explain to them <a href="https://whyprivacymatters.org/">why privacy matters</a>. Of course no one would hand me keys to their bank account just to prove a point. I won’t dissect the matter too much ― people much more qualified than me have been <a href="https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C48&amp;q=nothing+to+hide+argument&amp;btnG=&amp;oq=%22nothing+to+hide%22">doing so for years</a>.</p>

<p>One understated aspect of the “nothing to hide” argument has to do with how humans think of themselves in crowds. Much like in a busy city, people tend to think they are invisible; they are one in many. Everyone feels a sense of anonymity in large crowds. Individuals are surrounded, but not watched. They are not “important”.</p>

<p>I believe the same concept intrinsically causes an average person to suspend the need for privacy in the digital realm. I have nothing to hide, because no one is watching <em>me</em>. I am not “important”.</p>

<p>Up until the 1980s spying was very labor intensive and hard to scale. You could only spy on one person at a time. With the advent of <del>big data</del> digital data processing, falling prices of surveillance equipment, as well as dirt-cheap storage and compute technologies, that is no longer true. Through economies of scale, it is cheaper to monitor and spy on a hundred thousand people than on hundred people.</p>

<p>With the choice of privacy, we have the freedom to choose to be who we want; we are allowed to create identities we choose. The promise of the Internet and technology was to expand that choice even more. Every day, I see that promise reneged.</p>

<p>Recently, many apps including TikTok and LinkedIn were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/tiktok-and-53-other-ios-apps-still-snoop-your-sensitive-clipboard-data/">caught snooping</a> on clipboards on iPhones (data you cut or copy but may not have pasted anywhere else). Weirdly, they all claimed to have had the same bug. Even with all the might of the US government or the Soviet spying apparatus, accidentally spying on tens of millions of people’s thoughts was impossible until recently. Now, all it takes is an over-worked software engineer.</p>

<p>We all are creeped out when we see a car following us. I do not believe that at this time privacy advocates are doing a good job of explaining to normal people why digital surveillance is cause for concern. I believe their arguments are scattered, hard to parse, and still considered an artifact of the cypherpunk era. We can do a better job of talking about how knowledge, privacy, and power are interconnected, and how that balance of power has tipped largely against the general public.</p>

<p>We can do a better job of explaining why the promise of a better life through technology has been a lie, and that the cost is too high.</p>

<p>Now, I don’t think we need to be extremists about our privacy. Giving up some privacy is good under some circumstances ― sharing personal details with loved ones creates a more intimate bond, sharing some details with government health departments helps in contact tracing during a pandemic.</p>

<p>The more I learn about the world, the less certain I become about it. There are so many conflicting views and information taken out of context that itâ€™s hard to discern fact from truth. Below are some notes I keep to help navigate the sea of information that is modern society.</p>
<p>TL;DR: Donâ€™t get fooled by facts if they have no context, donâ€™t discount an opinion because itâ€™s biased, and hear out crazy ideas.</p>

<p>There are facts available for virtually anything you need. No matter what argument you try to make, youâ€™ll be able to find a statistic that can back up your claims thanks to the glory of Google.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3030983/The-ultra-competitive-exercise-fad-ruin-health-called-planking-suddenly-sweeping-gyms-Pilates-classes.html">â€œDid you know that planking can ruin your health and result in months of pain?â€�</a></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.lifehack.org/292578/7-things-that-will-happen-when-you-do-planking-exercise-every-day">â€œNot true, planking works out multiple muscles in your body and can greatly improve your health if done dailyâ€�</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not exactly scientific sources, but I think this demonstrates my point. Furthermore, the level of mixed information increases exponentially as the topic gets more political.</p>
<p>Facts should never be enough to prove a point, and I tend to suspect people who rely too heavily on them. Facts should instead be used to tell a narrative; facts are not the truth, but they can light the way towards it.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ewarren/status/1090252713156403200">â€œThe top 0.1% â€¦ own about the same wealth as the bottom 90% of America.â€�</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>While deemed â€œMostly Trueâ€� by <a href="https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/jan/31/elizabeth-warren/warren-top-01-own-about-much-bottom-90/">Politifact.com</a>, this statement in isolation is less than useless; itâ€™s misleading. On itâ€™s own, this fact paints a picture of a grim society, where the bottom 90% are left to struggle for survival, with all resources being held for a greedy few. If you are in the bottom 90%, this prompts you to believe that life is unfair, and that this should be changed. Thatâ€™s why this statistic is so popular, it seems outrageous and gives Americans a sense of justified anger at the rich, an anger which many ex-presidential candidates used to garner support.</p>
<p>Letâ€™s break this idea down a bit. The greedy elite factoid on its own implies nothing about quality of life, standard of living, financial responsibility, or determination to work. Society could be a paradise where everyone has access to more than they could ever need, and the top 0.1% just has an absurd amount of money. Or society could be a system of addiction, where the bottom 90% are constantly spending money on things they donâ€™t need and the top 0.1% simply arenâ€™t addicted and save/invest wisely. The truth is, these numbers donâ€™t reveal anything about the truth, and arenâ€™t being used to do so.</p>
<p>Consider a narrative discussing the implications of this statistic from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wealth_inequality_in_the_United_States#Effect_on_democracy">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 2014 study by researchers at Princeton and Northwestern concludes that government policies reflect the desires of the wealthy, and that the vast majority of American citizens have â€œminuscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy â€¦ when a majority of citizens disagrees with economic elites and/or with organized interests, they generally lose.â€� When Fed chair Janet Yellen was questioned by Bernie Sanders about the study at a congressional hearing in May 2014, she responded â€œThereâ€™s no question that weâ€™ve had a trend toward growing inequalityâ€� and that this trend â€œcan shape [and] determine the ability of different groups to participate equally in a democracy and have grave effects on social stability over time.â€�</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Most people know about inequality, but not what it means for them. The wealth statistic means nothing in a vaccuum, only in context does it hold any value. If facts are used to invoke emotion instead of prove a point, be skeptical.</p>

<p>A girl in a class of mine had a laptop sticker that read â€œWhy be racist, sexist, or transphobic when you can just be quiet?â€�</p>
<p>I canâ€™t stand this type of thinking. Itâ€™s elitist, tells people with controversial views to not let their voice be heard, and contributes to the echo chamber of modern society. Furthermore, it accomplishes nothing except a pat on the back for people with her mindset. No racist is actually going to read that and go â€œOh, guess I just wonâ€™t speak my mind then.â€� In fact, they might be driven further into racism in spite. Nobody likes being talked down to.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s a lot of insight to be gained on both sides from listening to people with views you donâ€™t like. Itâ€™s easy to think white supremacists are evil and donâ€™t deserve to speak; its harder to realize they have a reason for their beliefs. If you want to make the world a better place, it doesnâ€™t come from silence, but from understanding. When fighting racism, wouldnâ€™t it make sense to understand where racists are coming from?</p>
<p>If you want to discuss tax law, you should hear out the rich guy that wants lower taxes just as much as the working class American who wants the same. If you want to discuss diversity, donâ€™t limit the white participants to those with an â€œanti-whiteâ€� mindset. These perspectives are essential to promoting an open dialogue, and leaving out those with biased opinions leads to toxic echo chambers and a mentality of â€œus versus themâ€�.</p>

<p>When I experimented with fasting, a few people I knew were opposed. The concept of not eating for days on end? Ridiculous! Your body needs food, your metabolism will slow to a halt if you donâ€™t eat!</p>
<p>These arguments didnâ€™t come from any sort of reading on the subject, but human intuition. The concept of not eating for a few days went against everything they knew; to them it was crazy.</p>
<p>Fasting isnâ€™t actually bad for you if done right, and can have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fasting#Health_effects">numerous health benefits</a>. A simple Google search into the subject could have cleared up these misconceptions. But that would imply that this ridiculous idea could have some merit worth looking for. Itâ€™s like looking up â€œDid the Holocaust happen?â€�</p>
<p>When it comes to most domains however, there is usually some fascinating logic behind crazy ideas. Bitcoin comes to mind; a currency without a government to back it seems completely absurd on the surface. The gut reaction is to call Bitcoin a fraud, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2018/01/09/jamie-dimon-says-he-regrets-calling-bitcoin-a-fraud.html">but when the best in the business take some time to think about it, they might have second thoughts</a>. The Bitcoin community is full of brilliant people that built the foundation of blockchain technology. Itâ€™s worth hearing them out; even if their ideas seem a bit crazy at first glance. They must have their reasons.</p>

<p>As the news cycle continues to speed up, itâ€™s hard to determine fact from fiction, whoâ€™s crazy and whoâ€™s biased, whatâ€™s conspiracy and whatâ€™s revolutionary. Itâ€™s impossible to listen to everyone, but you shouldnâ€™t only listen to those with a similar mindset. Itâ€™s impossible to get the full story for every topic of discussion, but donâ€™t fall for out-of-context information. Question everything, but keep an open mind.</p>

This is both it's greatest strength <em>and</em> weakness.</p><p>Over the years, I've tried many different ways to style my React apps. Each solution has its pros and cons.
This article will share my journey using CSS with React and how it's evolved to its current state. Then, I'll discuss pros/cons of
different approaches for styling.</p><h2 id="vanilla-css"><p>Vanilla CSS<a aria-label="anchor" href="#vanilla-css">#</a></p></h2><p>Like most, I started web development with vanilla CSS. All you need is a single HTML and CSS file. Pretty simple.</p><pre mb="8"><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>h1</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>header<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Welcome<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

  <span>font-size</span><span>:</span> <span>32</span><span>px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>

</code></pre><p>Sass helped me write more modular, reusable CSS – at least, for a while. Over time, I ran into new issues.</p><ul><li><strong>Naming.</strong>&nbsp;As your CSS grows, it's easy to have class names get out of hand.</li><li><strong>Browser support.</strong>&nbsp;Certain features aren't <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://caniuse.com/">supported across all browsers</a> and require <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Vendor_Prefix">vendor prefixes</a> like <code>-moz-</code> (Firefox), <code>-webkit-</code> (Safari), and <code>-ms-</code> (Internet Explorer and Edge).</li></ul><p>To solve naming, I started to adopt&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="http://getbem.com/introduction/">BEM</a>.
Block Element Modifier is a methodology that helps you to create reusable components
and organize CSS in a modular way, which keeps specificity low.</p><pre mb="8"><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>button<span>"</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span>Cancel<span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>

For browser support, it's possible to set up your Sass toolchain with a tool like&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://css-tricks.com/autoprefixer/">autoprefixer</a>&nbsp;to handle vendor prefixes.
However, around this time, I started using component-based frameworks like React. This led me to explore CSS-in-JS.</p><h2 id="css-in-js"><p>CSS-In-JS<a aria-label="anchor" href="#css-in-js">#</a></p></h2><p>My first adventure with CSS-in-JS: building a <a href="https://leerob.io/blog/ui-component-library-with-styled-components">component library with styled-components</a>. At first, CSS-in-JS solved all my problems.</p><ul><li><strong>Specificity</strong> is solved by auto-generated class names.</li><li><strong>Colocation</strong> is solved by putting CSS directly with the component, making it easy to delete code.</li><li><strong>Browser support</strong>&nbsp;is solved by having autoprefixer built-in.</li><li><strong>Variables</strong>&nbsp;are solved by creating a global theme.</li></ul><p>However, <strong>naming</strong> was still a huge pain.</p><p>As the component library grew, I began to explore <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://theme-ui.com/">Theme UI</a> and <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://styled-system.com/">styled-system</a>.
These were more structured approaches to scaling CSS-in-JS to help enforce a design system.
Plus, they helped solve&nbsp;naming. Trying to scale <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://styled-components.com/">styled-components</a> alone in a large application made me get <em>really</em> creative with names.
You can only have so many container, wrapper, layout things. For example:</p><pre mb="8"><code><span>const</span> <span>HomeContainerWrapper</span> <span>=</span> styled<span>.</span><span>div</span><span><span>`</span><span>
&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;padding</span><span>:</span> <span>8</span><span>px</span><span>;</span>

&nbsp; <span>&nbsp;background</span><span>:</span> blue<span>;</span>
</span><span>`</span></span><span>;</span>

<span>&lt;</span><span>HomeContainerWrapper</span><span>&gt;</span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello
<span>&lt;</span><span>/</span><span>HomeContainerWrapper</span><span>&gt;</span>


<span>&lt;</span><span>Box</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><span color="#CCCCCC">FIRSTLY, 
        AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: THE CULTURE DOESN'T REALLY EXIST. IT ONLY EXISTS 
        IN MY MIND AND THE MINDS OF THE PEOPLE WHO'VE READ ABOUT IT. </span></b></span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">That 
        having been made clear: </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">The 
        Culture is a group-civilisation formed from seven or eight humanoid species, 
        space-living elements of which established a loose federation approximately 
        nine thousand years ago. The ships and habitats which formed the original 
        alliance required each others' support to pursue and maintain their independence 
        from the political power structures - principally those of mature nation-states 
        and autonomous commercial concerns - they had evolved from. </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">The 
        galaxy (our galaxy) in the Culture stories is a place long lived-in, and 
        scattered with a variety of life-forms. In its vast and complicated history 
        it has seen waves of empires, federations, colonisations, die-backs, wars, 
        species-specific dark ages, renaissances, periods of mega-structure building 
        and destruction, and whole ages of benign indifference and malign neglect. 
        At the time of the Culture stories, there are perhaps a few dozen major 
        space-faring civilisations, hundreds of minor ones, tens of thousands 
        of species who might develop space-travel, and an uncountable number who 
        have been there, done that, and have either gone into locatable but insular 
        retreats to contemplate who-knows-what, or disappeared from the normal 
        universe altogether to cultivate lives even less comprehensible. </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">In 
        this era, the Culture is one of the more energetic civilisations, and 
        initially - after its formation, which was not without vicissitudes - 
        by a chance of timing found a relatively quiet galaxy around it, in which 
        there were various other fairly mature civilisations going about their 
        business, traces and relics of the elder cultures scattered about the 
        place, and - due to the fact nobody else had bothered to go wandering 
        on a grand scale for a comparatively long time - lots of interesting 'undiscovered' 
        star systems to explore... </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">The 
        Culture, in its history and its on-going form, is an expression of the 
        idea that the nature of space itself determines the type of civilisations 
        which will thrive there. </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">The 
        thought processes of a tribe, a clan, a country or a nation-state are 
        essentially two-dimensional, and the nature of their power depends on 
        the same flatness. Territory is all-important; resources, living-space, 
        lines of communication; all are determined by the nature of the plane 
        (that the plane is in fact a sphere is irrelevant here); that surface, 
        and the fact the species concerned are bound to it during their evolution, 
        determines the mind-set of a ground-living species. The mind-set of an 
        aquatic or avian species is, of course, rather different. </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">Essentially, 
        the contention is that our currently dominant power systems cannot long 
        survive in space; beyond a certain technological level a degree of anarchy 
        is arguably inevitable and anyway preferable. </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">To 
        survive in space, ships/habitats must be self-sufficient, or very nearly 
        so; the hold of the state (or the corporation) over them therefore becomes 
        tenuous if the desires of the inhabitants conflict significantly with 
        the requirements of the controlling body. On a planet, enclaves can be 
        surrounded, besieged, attacked; the superior forces of a state or corporation 
        - hereafter referred to as hegemonies - will tend to prevail. In space, 
        a break-away movement will be far more difficult to control, especially 
        if significant parts of it are based on ships or mobile habitats. The 
        hostile nature of the vacuum and the technological complexity of life 
        support mechanisms will make such systems vulnerable to outright attack, 
        but that, of course, would risk the total destruction of the ship/habitat, 
        so denying its future economic contribution to whatever entity was attempting 
        to control it. </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">Outright 
        destruction of rebellious ships or habitats - pour encouragez les autres 
        - of course remains an option for the controlling power, but all the usual 
        rules of uprising realpolitik still apply, especially that concerning 
        the peculiar dialectic of dissent which - simply stated - dictates that 
        in all but the most dedicatedly repressive hegemonies, if in a sizable 
        population there are one hundred rebels, all of whom are then rounded 
        up and killed, the number of rebels present at the end of the day is not 
        zero, and not even one hundred, but two hundred or three hundred or more; 
        an equation based on human nature which seems often to baffle the military 
        and political mind. Rebellion, then (once space-going and space-living 
        become commonplace), becomes easier than it might be on the surface of 
        a planet. </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">Even 
        so, this is certainly the most vulnerable point in the time-line of the 
        Culture's existence, the point at which it is easiest to argue for things 
        turning out quite differently, as the extent and sophistication of the 
        hegemony's control mechanisms - and its ability and will to repress - 
        battles against the ingenuity, skill, solidarity and bravery of the rebellious 
        ships and habitats, and indeed the assumption here is that this point 
        has been reached before and the hegemony has won... but it is also assumed 
        that - for the reasons given above - that point is bound to come round 
        again, and while the forces of repression need to win every time, the 
        progressive elements need only triumph once. </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">Concomitant 
        with this is the argument that the nature of life in space - that vulnerability, 
        as mentioned above - would mean that while ships and habitats might more 
        easily become independent from each other and from their legally progenitative 
        hegemonies, their crew - or inhabitants - would always be aware of their 
        reliance on each other, and on the technology which allowed them to live 
        in space. The theory here is that the property and social relations of 
        long-term space-dwelling (especially over generations) would be of a fundamentally 
        different type compared to the norm on a planet; the mutuality of dependence 
        involved in an environment which is inherently hostile would necessitate 
        an internal social coherence which would contrast with the external casualness 
        typifying the relations between such ships/habitats. Succinctly; socialism 
        within, anarchy without. This broad result is - in the long run - independent 
        of the initial social and economic conditions which give rise to it. </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">Let 
        me state here a personal conviction that appears, right now, to be profoundly 
        unfashionable; which is that a planned economy can be more productive 
        - and more morally desirable - than one left to market forces. </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">The 
        market is a good example of evolution in action; the try-everything-and-see-what- 
        -works approach. This might provide a perfectly morally satisfactory resource-management 
        system so long as there was absolutely no question of any sentient creature 
        ever being treated purely as one of those resources. The market, for all 
        its (profoundly inelegant) complexities, remains a crude and essentially 
        blind system, and is - without the sort of drastic amendments liable to 
        cripple the economic efficacy which is its greatest claimed asset - intrinsically 
        incapable of distinguishing between simple non-use of matter resulting 
        from processal superfluity and the acute, prolonged and wide-spread suffering 
        of conscious beings. </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">It 
        is, arguably, in the elevation of this profoundly mechanistic (and in 
        that sense perversely innocent) system to a position above all other moral, 
        philosophical and political values and considerations that humankind displays 
        most convincingly both its present intellectual [immaturity and] - through 
        grossly pursued selfishness rather than the applied hatred of others - 
        a kind of synthetic evil. </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">Intelligence, 
        which is capable of looking farther ahead than the next aggressive mutation, 
        can set up long-term aims and work towards them; the same amount of raw 
        invention that bursts in all directions from the market can be - to some 
        degree - channelled and directed, so that while the market merely shines 
        (and the feudal gutters), the planned lases, reaching out coherently and 
        efficiently towards agreed-on goals. What is vital for such a scheme, 
        however, and what was always missing in the planned economies of our world's 
        experience, is the continual, intimate and decisive participation of the 
        mass of the citizenry in determining these goals, and designing as well 
        as implementing the plans which should lead towards them. </span></p>
      <p><span face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#CCCCCC">Of 
        course, there is a place for serendipity and chance in any sensibly envisaged 
        plan, and the degree to which this would affect the higher functions of 
        a democratically designed economy would be one of the most important parameters 
        to be set... but just as the information we have stored in our libraries 
        and institutions has undeniably outgrown (if not outweighed) …</span></p></td></div></div>

<p>In light of feedback received during my ongoing search for my first <a href="https://swellandcut.com/ecpm">product management</a> role, I re-read Taylor Pearson’s article, <a href="https://taylorpearson.me/luck/">How to Get Lucky: Focus on the Fat Tails</a>. The following section stuck:</p>



<blockquote><p>“<strong>Almost everyone systematically under-allocates resources to the fat tails. </strong>We tend to spend most of our time and energy thinking about the middle, because we see the world through a bell curve lens, and most of the area in a bell curve is in the middle. But in reality, we live in an 80/20 world, where the top 1% of fat tails account for 50% of the results. The people who understand this seem to know how to attract luck, but really they’ve just adopted the 80/20 curve model.”</p></blockquote>



<p>In terms of job/work hunting, that means de-emphasising traditional methods (cover letters and CV submits) in favour of fat-tailed methods (asking people questions, attending meet-ups regularly, joining virtual conferences, working in public). Visually:</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="5737" data-permalink="https://swellandcut.com/here-not-here/" data-orig-file="https://swellandcut.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/here-not-here.png" data-orig-size="2224,1668" data-comments-opened="0" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="here-not-here" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://swellandcut.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/here-not-here.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://swellandcut.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/here-not-here.png?w=1024" src="https://swellandcut.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/here-not-here.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://swellandcut.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/here-not-here.png?w=1024 1024w, https://swellandcut.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/here-not-here.png?w=2048 2048w, https://swellandcut.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/here-not-here.png?w=150 150w, https://swellandcut.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/here-not-here.png?w=300 300w, https://swellandcut.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/here-not-here.png?w=768 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure></div>



<p>I’ve considered the “focus on fat tails” approach in another domain, too: stack entry.</p>



<p><strong>ASSAYING THE INTERNET</strong></p>



<p>For a long while technology has been an interest. But it’s never been more than that. It’s been like an invitation to dinner that I’ve never taken the host up on. Until now. Recently, I decided I wanted to <a href="https://swellandcut.com/cull-and-craft">build a simulation model </a>that would allow me to play with the mechanics of trust de- and re-generation. One problem: I don’t know how to code. The agents in <a href="https://hash.ai/">hash.ai’s</a> agent-based models are programmed in either Python or Javascript; I decided to start by learning Python. The above wasn’t as whimsical a decision as it sounds.</p>



<p>The internet is an integrated software-hardware stack. For example, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_protocol_suite">Internet protocol suite</a> is modelled with four layers: link layer, internet layer, transport layer and application layer. Visually:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c4/IP_stack_connections.svg/800px-IP_stack_connections.svg.png" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>I’ve spoke with people about learning to code before and my preference has always been to enter the stack at one of two points:<strong> the bleeding edge or the boring edge.</strong></p>



<p><strong>BLEEDING, BORING, LUMPY</strong></p>



<p>I recently listened to <a href="https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/">Dawn Song’s</a> appearance on the <a href="https://lexfridman.com/dawn-song/">Lex Fridman podcast</a>. Dawn Song does all sorts of interesting things and one of those things involves <a href="https://sunblaze-ucb.github.io/program-synthesis/index.html">neural program synthesis</a>—<em>building a program that can solve a problem by writing its own program.</em> That is <strong>bleeding edge.</strong></p>



<p>In the same episode Lex Fridman also mentioned that he was looking for an expert in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran">Fortran</a>. Fortran is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_generations">third-generation programming language</a> but one that is older and increasingly hard to find “experts” in. Below third-gen languages there are second-gen languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembly languages</a>) and first-gen languages (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_code">machine-level languages</a>). That is <strong>boring edge.</strong></p>



<p>In contrast to the bleeding and boring edges of the stack is what Taylor Pearson called the body of a bell curve: the <strong>lumpy middle</strong>. Entering the stack at the lumpy middle is, on most accounts, fine. It’s okay. Reasonable. The most sensible. After all, the lumpy middle is lumpy for a reason; the skills and knowledge contained there are both readily available and relatively valuable. But I think entering at the bleeding or boring edge is a better proposition, both in the short-term and the long-term.</p>



<p>Short-term: I suspect learning about the bleeding or boring edge is just more exciting. Long-term, I suspect it turns out to be much more valuable. Until expertise in the boring edge is needed and until the functionality of the bleeding edge is realised, both are undervalued, but when those times inevitably come a premium can be had. In other words, the fat tail of the technological stack is the bleeding edge and the boring edge.</p>



<p>Another reason not to begin in the lumpy middle: generally, I suspect it is easier to move from one of the B-edges to the lumpy middle (or even straight to the other side) than it is to do the reverse. I don’t have data (even anecdotal) to back this up; it’s just a hunch (feel free to inform me otherwise).</p>



<p>As to choosing between the two edges in the context of stack entry: I think it depends on one’s preference for abstraction. Bleeding edge competencies tend to revolve around system-level problems and solutions–the realm of high abstraction. Think Elon Musk’s dallying with rockets and brain chips or attempts to solve <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wicked_problem#Super_wicked_problems">super wicked problems</a> like climate change or wealth inequality. Boring edge competencies tend to revolve around component-level problems and solutions–the realm of minimal abstraction. Think circuit board design.</p>



<p>Personally–as I think my objective to toy with simulation models and the joy I find in writing stories demonstrates–I lean towards abstraction.</p>

    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>What rating system do you use?</h3>
        <p>I developed my own rating system for this site. It relies heavily on the <a href="http://www.glicko.net/glicko.html">Glicko</a> rating system, with these differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>Each player has an overall rating and a rating for each matchup. The overall rating is always the mean of the matchup ratings.</li>
<li>I don't use approximations for maximising the likelihood function. Instead, I use numerical optimisation algorithms directly.</li>
</ul>

<p>For the mathematically inclined, there is a very brief technical paper <a href="http://static.aligulac.com/method.pdf">here</a>. I put it together in an hour or so by request, and I'm aware that it's not exactly thorough or easily readable. (<strong>WARNING:</strong> This paper is outdated after we switched the underlying probability model from normal to logistic. The basic ideas are still valid, however.)</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>And in English?</h3>
        <p><img src="http://static.aligulac.com/cdf.png" alt="CDF"></p>

<p>To figure out the probability that a player beats another, take the difference of their relevant matchup ratings, and read out the result from the graph shown. (This is the logistic <em>cumulative distribution function</em> with mean zero and variance 1, scaled by a factor 1000).</p>

<p>Now let's say a player has played a bunch of games during a period and we want to find his new rating. First, we form a likelihood function, which describes how likely a set of outcomes is, given the player's rating. This likelihood function will be a product of such probabilities of the player beating opponent A, B, C... and so on. Now we want to find out which rating maximises this function. That is, <strong>which rating maximises the likelihood that the outcomes that happened actually would happen</strong>. We also calculate the certainty of the likelihood function at this point. This is a measure of how consistent the results of the given player were in the last period. A high consistency gives a high certainty, and vice versa.</p>

<p>Then, the new rating is adjusted somewhat in the direction of the maximal likelihood rating found above. How much it's adjusted depends on how certain the original rating was, and how certain the maximal likelihood rating is (how consistent the results were). The adjustment will be biased towards whichever of these two is most certain.</p>

<p>Finally, the certainty of the rating is updated. It will always be higher than it was before, reflecting the fact that we now have more information about the player. If the results during the preceding period were very consistent, we will be very certain about his or her rating.</p>

<p>There are some caveats to the above:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not allow the certainty of a player's rating to go above a certain limit. If it does, the system will fail to react to sudden changes in skill.</li>
<li>If a player only plays games against one race during a period, only the overall rating will change. (That is, the relative matchup ratings will not change). If there are games against two races, the relative matchup rating against the third race will not change.</li>
<li>If a player has zero losses or zero wins against one or more races, the likelihood function will be maximised only at plus or minus infinity rating, respectively. To avoid this, in these cases I add a fake win and a loss against a hypothetical opponent with the same strength. Thus, if a player goes 0-4 against Protoss, he is effectively treated as having gone 1-5.</li>
</ul>

      </div>
    </div>
  
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>How predictive is the system?</h3>
        <p><img src="http://static.aligulac.com/predict.png" alt="Predictions"></p>

<p>By my understanding, very.</p>

<p>This is a plot of more than 100k historical games (the whole database as of February 2013). On the horizontal axis you find predicted winrate for the <em>presumed stronger player</em>, using the ratings at the time the game was played. The games were grouped in reasonably small groups, i.e. 50%-53.3% and so on upwards. (Obviously no numbers below 50% since this is the predicted winrate for the stronger player.)</p>

<p>On the vertical axis is the actual winrate for each group.</p>

<p>As can be plainly seen, the actual winrate is close to the predicted winrate up to about 80%. The weighted linear fit (blue dashed line) is almost identical to the ideal curve (red dashed line) corresponding to the relationship that predicted winrate equals actual winrate.</p>

<p>Above 80% the winrates become a bit more erratic, and it seems like the system slightly overestimates the chances for the stronger player.</p>

<p>Thus, if the prediction system shows a winrate of</p>

<ul>
<li>80% or higher in a best of 1</li>
<li>90% or higher in a best of 3</li>
<li>94% or higher in a best of 5</li>
<li>96% or higher in a best of 7</li>
</ul>

<p>the numbers should be taken with a grain of salt.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>Why not update in real time?</h3>
        <p>If I were to update the ratings in real time, first I would have to make some changes to how the algorithm works. Recall that games versus different races are aggregated, and if a player has zero wins or losses, a couple of fake games are added. In real time, such fake games would almost always be required.</p>

<p>Secondly, the discrete nature of time is a way to keep ratings from being excessively volatile. To take the top spot, a player now has to perform well over two weeks, instead of (say) just a couple of days. On the other hand, if the period is too long, the list loses relevance in a quickly-changing pro scene. I ended up compromising with two week periods.</p>

<p>We do, however, update a <em>preview</em> of the next rating list every six hours, so you can see rating changes in something that is close to real time. The system itself is, however, essentially discrete.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>Do you weigh games differently?</h3>
        <p>No, I don't. Korean tournaments and players receive no special treatment. The GSL is difficult because good players play there; the players aren't good because they play in the GSL.</p>

<p>When fitting the model (deciding which parameters to use) I also don't weigh games differently, but this is something we're looking into. Since the database contains an overwhelming majority of non-Korean games, the system will tend to adapt to the non-Korean scene. We've noticed, however, that most people using the service are interested in the Koreans. We are still working on a useful solution to this problem.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>You can improve the rating by... </h3>
        <p>One of the most common forms of feedback we get are about how to improve the rating. These are not bad ideas, they're pretty good, but they might be more complicated than you think. Here are some common ones.</p>

<p>One thing to keep in mind is that a good mathematical model has <em>few parameters</em>. The current rating system has three. Those three parameters are sufficient to give Aligulac the predictive power it has. If you want to suggest complicating the model, the additional parameters must be chosen with care.</p>

<p><strong>Games in regular online tournaments shouldn't count as much as Code S.</strong> Well, first we have to realize that games <em>are</em> weighted, in a sense, by opponent skill. You get more points for beating a higher rated opponent than a lower, and you lose more points by losing to a lower rated opponent than a higher. In addition it is worth considering that simply weighing games higher will not automatically increase the rating of those playing. The winners will gain more points, true, but the losers will also lose more. The mean rating of the players playing will not change.</p>

<p>So aside from this, how should this weighing work?</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Even stronger weighing by opponent? The "weighing" is a result of a Bayesian inversion formula depending on the underlying probability model chosen. It's not something that can just be changed, that is, there's no parameter encoding this. It's a much deeper mathematical concept.</p></li>
<li><p>Weighing by mean rating of opponent in a round? Well, why should this be any better than weighing by the <em>actual opponents faced</em>, which is what we already do?</p></li>
<li><p>Weighing by prize pool? The theory goes that strong players are likely to "try harder" if the prize is higher. There is some merit to this idea, but there are also problems. Some tournaments offer prizes in equipment, and not money. Some offer qualification to a higher tier. For example, there is no monetary prize in the GSL Up and Down groups, but nobody would question the incentive to win there. In addition, there are internal team incentives which are not generally public knowledge. And, additionally, if a player knowingly plays weaker in some games, should that not be reflected in the ratings?</p></li>
<li><p>Weighing by tournament? These arguments usually involve some classification of events into tiers of importance with coefficients associated with each level. This approach runs into the complexity problem. With five levels (say), the model becomes far more complicated for what is not shown (yet, anyway) to be reasonable benefit.</p></li>
<li><p>Weighing by online and offline? Yes, this is a legitimate idea and probably the one closest to being implemented. We have working experimental code with this feature already.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Rating gap cap.</strong> The idea here is to prevent players from "farming" much lower rated players. It <em>is</em> possible to artificially inflate a player's rating if he never plays other players close to himself in skill. The ideas usually consist of ignoring matches where players are farther away in rating than a given threshold. However, this can be seen as unfair to the lower rated players, who will have their wins against good players discarded. Capping the gap to a given value will make the problem worse. Say a 1700-rated player plays a 1000-rated player, but the cap is 500, so for the purposes of updating the stronger player's rating the lower rated player is assumed to be rated 1200. Then it will be easier for the 1700-rated player to overperform than it was previously.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
  
    <div>
      <div>
        <h3>How do you decide which games to add?</h3>
        <p>This question doesn't have an easy answer. We mostly decide this on a case-by-case basis. Generally we will add a round from a tournament if that round contains a …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main" role="main"> <article role="article">  <p>I am an angel investor. I have been investing personally in early-stage companies, Pre-Seed through Series B, since 2015. I do it not for money but for love of the game; the greatest pleasure to me is to learn from entrepreneurs smarter than me, and help them succeed.</p> <p>Over the last five years, as I look at my wins and misses, one thing seems clear: at the earliest stages, business models do not matter at all. This is a deeply unpopular position, in part because philosopher-king VCs love to talk about business abstractions and ask about moats, network effects, returns to scale, value chains, innovator’s dilemmas and so forth.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup> But at the seed stage, very little of this matters.</p> <p>Startups rarely stick to the original business plan. There’s always a pivot: sometimes in the product, sometimes in go-to-market, sometimes in the whole thing. In addition, exogenous shocks (COVID-19 being a great example) perturb the best laid plans of mice and men, and every startup eventually finds itself in deep and unfamiliar waters. These are the moments that dictate success or failure, and what matters then? Cash in the bank, and the nimbleness and thoughtfulness of the team. Those are the only things.</p> <p>I’ve had a lot of run-ins with this pattern over the last eight months due to COVID. The businesses that were most vulnerable to COVID (and, inversely, least able to take advantage of COVID) were the ones that were most exposed to their own business plans, that had the least nimble founders, and left the least optionality for pivots.</p> <p>On the other hand, great teams always have a leg up.<sup id="fnref:2" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup></p> <p>So, my position is that the business model at the pre-seed/seed stage doesn’t matter. It’s barely worth diligencing. This gets me a lot of flak from other investors, presumably because they feel smart when they write their multi-page memos, and here I am saying that the emperor has no clothes.</p> <p>A similar, and somewhat more popular position, is that startup financials don’t matter. If you barely have revenue, your future forecasts are worthless. Reality will always differ greatly, and anyone with a pulse knows this. However, looking at a startup’s forecasts is still valuable, because it tells you whether the startup is financially sophisticated and can put together a good financial model, which is a good general indicator of their maturity.</p> <p>My position goes one step further: it’s not just the forecasts that never survive first contact with reality, it’s the entire business model. Some parts will be harder, others will be easier, and some will change altogether. Add random macro-scale perturbations like COVID, recessions, regulatory shifts, and you can assume that <em>any</em> early-stage business model is subject to great change, so much so that you might discard it altogether. However, evaluating it still has significant value in that it tells you about the thoughtfulness of the founders, which is critical.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup></p> <p>So I don’t invest in business models. I invest in great founders who are gritty, resourceful, and can assemble great teams. I treat finances and business models like brain-teasers in interviews; performative exercises that are fun to debate and tell me a lot about the maturity of the underlying entrepreneur, but I almost completely discard their content.</p> <p>Finally, don’t believe me? Let’s take a look at these giants and tell me whether you would have “invested in the business model” when they were founded.</p> <ul> <li>A 2009 2D Browser MMO. Just another video game in an endless sea of competitors. This eventually became <strong>Slack</strong>.</li> <li>A 2012 video conferencing platform, when there were hundreds of competitors and the market was locked down by Microsoft and Google. This moatless company became <strong>Zoom</strong>.</li> <li>A 2005 video-based online dating service. <strong>YouTube</strong>.</li> <li>A 1994 online bookshop. <strong>Amazon</strong>.</li> <li>A 2006 online snowboard equipment shop. <strong>Shopify</strong>.</li> </ul> <p>Too much business risk? You love the tech but there’s no moat? You want a network effect? Try betting on the founder instead.</p>  <hr>  <br> </article> </div></div>]]>

                                Friday September 11, 2020 by <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/author/santtu-ahonen">Santtu Ahonen</a> | <a href="#commento">Comments</a>

The most significant changes affecting development hosts and targets include how Qt integrates to the graphics system (<a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/2019/08/07/technical-vision-qt-6" rel=" noopener">Blog: Technical vision for Qt 6</a>), the C++ minimum version update from C++ 11 to C++ 17, and the <a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/versionless-cmake-targets-qt-5.15" rel=" noopener">transition from QMake to CMake</a>. We have also taken the opportunity to clean up and reorganize quite a few OS-specific bits (<a href="https://www.qt.io/blog/qt-6.0-feature-freeze-milestone-reached" rel=" noopener">Blog: Qt 6.0 feature freeze</a>).</p>
<!--more-->
<h3>Host operating systems in Qt 6.0</h3>
<p>Qt 6.0 will be supported on development hosts familiar for Qt 5 releases; Windows, Linux, and macOS. For RedHat Linux users, the biggest change is the move of RedHat to CentOS in CI. For developers using Windows, only 64bit Windows 10 is now supported as a host. Additionally, there are minor updates with the latest host operating system versions (with new versions being added and older versions being dropped.)</p>
<p>A list of the planned Qt 6.0 development hosts in our CI and testing can be found here:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Windows 10 2004</strong> (64bit Intel; msvc2019 or mingw81/gcc8.1)</li>
<li><strong>macOS 10.15</strong> (64bit Intel; XCode 11)</li>
<li>Linux:<br>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ubuntu 20.04</strong> (64bit Intel; gcc9)</li>
<li><strong>CentOS 8.1</strong> (64bit Intel; gcc9)</li>
<li><strong>SLES 15</strong> (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, 64bit Intel; gcc10)</li>
<li><strong>Open SUSE 15.1</strong> (64bit; gcc9)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Other operating systems and versions may well work, but those listed above are part of our CI and verification activities. For Technical Support to accept issue tickets, the issues need to be reproducible on one of the supported hosts, or there needs to be a corresponding, customer-specific, additional service to cover the issue.</p>
<h3>Development targets supported in Qt 6.0</h3>
<p>In order to ensure that we can focus on the essential key features, we have limited the number of development targets, and cross functionality for what hosts can be used for those targets, in Qt 6.0. This means that there will be a gradual addition of targets through Qt 6.0, 6.1, and finally 6.2 (where the plan is to ensure Qt 6.2 is on par to be compliant with the wide range of supported&nbsp;target platforms in Qt 5.15 LTS.)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg?width=474&amp;name=imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg" alt="Qt 6 Targets" width="474" srcset="https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg?width=237&amp;name=imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg 237w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg?width=474&amp;name=imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg 474w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg?width=711&amp;name=imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg 711w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg?width=948&amp;name=imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg 948w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg?width=1185&amp;name=imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg 1185w, https://www.qt.io/hs-fs/hubfs/imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg?width=1422&amp;name=imgpsh_mobile_save-4.jpg 1422w" sizes="(max-width: 474px) 100vw, 474px">Naturally,<strong> all development hosts listed above can act as targets</strong>. Additionally, <strong>Windows 10 1809 64bit</strong> and <strong>macOS 10.14 and 11 </strong>(formerly a.k.a. 10.16), when available, can be targeted.</p>
<p>Embedded Linux meta-qt6 layer is created for <strong>Yocto 3.1 Dunfell</strong> (and gcc9.3). Qt 6.0 comes with four ready-made Boot-2-Qt images for ARM-v8A 64bit (iMX8) and ARM-v7A 32bit (iMX6) based devices. One should be able to bake Qt6 support on a wide range of hardware with the new meta-Qt6, and if needed Qt Professional Services can always jump in and help. There will be more details on the new meta-Qt6 in a later blog post.</p>
<p>Qt 6.0 will support development for mobile targets on <strong>iOS (13 and 14)</strong> and <strong>Android (28 build-time, 21 runtime)</strong>.</p>
<h3>Development hosts and targets in Qt 5.15 that are not planned in Qt 6</h3>
<p>In addition to documenting what will be changing, it is also important to communicate what will be discontinued or will no longer part of our CI and verification efforts.</p>
<p>Both <strong>Windows 7 or 8.x</strong> version support will not be available for Qt 6. Microsoft discontinued the support for both Windows versions some time ago, and as a vendor, we can no longer maintain support for these windows versions in Qt 6. Windows 7 (both 32bit and 64bit) was supported as a target in Qt 5.15 LTS and Windows 8.1 (both 32bit and 64bit) as a target in Qt 5.12 LTS. This means that we will not have 32bit Windows support available. Additionally, it will no longer be possible to create <strong>UWP</strong> applications on Windows 10.</p>
<p>Apple watchOS and tvOS are both also dropped from CI due to low interest and the need to free up resources. We would like to hear if you have projects depending on these targets.</p>
<p>The Qt community may very well maintain support for these and other environments. As usual, there is also a commercial opportunity for customers to purchase additional, extended support for dedicated hosts and targets.</p>
<h3>Development hosts and targets planned for later 6.x releases</h3>
<p><span>Windows on ARM</span> based PCs instead of traditional Intel based PCs is under work (<a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-85820" rel=" noopener">QTBUG-85820</a>). The ability to support it as a full-blown host and target may take time, but the initial focus is to enable Windows on ARM as a target for desktop applications.</p>
<p>The support for <span>macOS on ARM</span>&nbsp;(instead of Intel-only) based HW is being worked on (<a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-85279" rel=" noopener">QTBUG-85279</a>) and planned for Qt 6.1. This will also cover macOS as a development host. The DIY folks may find significant parts of the work already covered in Qt 6.0.</p>
<p>Adding <strong>macOS as development host for embedded Linux</strong> based targets requires changes to how we create and maintain cross compilation toolchains. We plan to include containers for the cross compilation tooling host.&nbsp; This work is currently roadmapped into Qt 6.2 (<a href="https://bugreports.qt.io/browse/QTBUG-81947" rel=" noopener">QTBUG-81947</a>). This same work will also impact how embedded developments target support is implemented on all hosts.</p>

Qt 5.15meta-qt5 is with Yocto 3.0 Zeus, Qt 6.0 meta-qt6 layer is with Yocto 3.1 Dunfell, and it looks like Qt 6.1 will move to Yocto 3.2 Gatesgarth. Correspondingly, Qt 6.2 most likely will be with Yocto 3.3 (depending on how the roadmaps align). The Yocto community introduced the 3.1 Dunfell as an LTS release, so we may still revisit this plan whilst moving along with the latest and greatest release. The plan for this area for Qt 6.1 and 6.2 is still open to alteration.</p>
<p>Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) support for Blackberry <strong>QNX </strong>and GreenHills <strong>INTEGRITY</strong> is mostly pending on vendor compiler support for C++17. The current plan is Technology Preview (TP) level support in Qt 6.1, and full support in Qt 6.2. Windriver <strong>VxWorks </strong>schedules are open as of writing this blog. RTOS support is a special breed for support; Qt comes with a reference implementation on a specific HW+RTOS combination, but most customers have something custom as the platform. Therefore, it is always recommended to work with Qt Professional Services for full support in this area.</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>inally, <strong>WebAssembly</strong> (a.k.a. WASM) will be back in Qt 6.1.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I watch a lot of playoff basketball.
I watch the pregame. I watch the postgame. I follow along on Twitter. I watch the highlights. I read the discussions. I laugh at memes. I look longingly at the Inside the NBA studio here in Atlanta on my morning commute. I say “Rings, Chuck” whenever someone questions anything I do. The whole 9 yards. </p>
<p>Through all of that, there’s really only one thing that bothers me. It’s when Chris Weber/Doris/Stan/etc. (no one is innocent) chimes in with a fact from the math nerds saying (and I’m paraphrasing)</p>
<p><em><strong>"This is a huge game for them tonight. Historically, the team that wins game Y wins the series X% of the time."</strong></em>
</p>
<p>Every. Time.</p>
<p>I can’t help but think, “No way! The team that wins a game in a playoff series has a high chance of winning the series?” 😐</p>
<p>So I had to crunch the numbers to answer the eternal question…</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-probability-of-winning-the-series-if-you-win-game-x"><a href="#what-is-the-probability-of-winning-the-series-if-you-win-game-x" aria-label="what is the probability of winning the series if you win game x permalink"></a>What is the probability of winning the series if you win game X?</h2>
<p>Here are the results.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>Won game 1? 78.032% chance to win series
Won game 2? 70.684% chance to win series
Won game 3? 63.758% chance to win series
Won game 4? 63.912% chance to win series
Won game 5? 75.571% chance to win series
Won game 6? 70.588% chance to win series
Won game 7? 100.000% chance to win series</code></pre></div>

<p>There you go. Confirmed. The team that wins any game in the series has a very high probability to win the series.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/samford100/nba-prob-of-winning/blob/master/Chanceofwinningnbaseries.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Here’s the code</a>. It was big time ugly, but I cleaned it up and it’s not so awful. Normalize just hacking around. It’s OK.</p>
<h3 id="ps"><a href="#ps" aria-label="ps permalink"></a>PS</h3>
<p>So while I did spend the whole post claiming (tongue in cheek) that this is the least surprising and least interesting fact that gets regurgitated every broadcast, there are a few interesting bits here… as much as it pains me to say it.</p>
<p>The first is the dip at game 6. What explains that? Are teams on the brink of losing in game 6 fighting with everything they’ve got while the team leading 3-2 is comfortable to coast?</p>
<p>No. It’s much less interesting. </p>
<p>What’s really happening is some playoff series used to be only best of 3, so 5 games total. That meant the team that won game 5 was the winner of the series. This 100% win rate brings up the chance in game 5. </p>
<p>And that’s all I can glean. When you distill data down like this you lose a lot of fidelity.</p>
<p>But what I can say, only now that I have crunched all the numbers, is that the Celtics won game 7 against the Raptors, so statistically, they should have a 100% chance of winning the series.</p></div></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Finding an Alternative to iOS]]>

September 14, 2020 | https://bitcannon.net/post/finding-an-alternative-to-ios/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://bitcannon.net/post/finding-an-alternative-to-ios/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>I've used iPhones since 2008, adding thousands of dollars to Apple's giant pile
of cash. Much like <a href="https://bitcannon.net/post/finding-an-alternative-to-mac-os-x/">my move from macOS to
Linux</a> more than 3 years ago,
Apple's recent behaviour has prompted me to consider iPhone/iOS alternatives.
Join me on this journey into the world of Android and the lack of real choice
that smartphones present in 2020.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>For about 12 years I've owned iPhones, most bought outright, totalling thousands
of dollars. I've held on to my most recent iPhone, an iPhone X longer than all
others. Contrary to claims of planned obsolescence it still works well. I like
technology though, and was planning to replace it this year and pass it on to my
father.</p>
<p>Apple have recently ramped up their hostility towards the developers that make
iOS the desirable platform it is. App Store horror stories are nothing new, but
lately Apple seems to have really ramped up their desire to extract money from
every developer's business, despite being one of the richest companies in the
world. They seemingly do so without regard for whether the end-user experience is
actually better for it.</p>
<p>Recent events, perhaps starting with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298552/apple-hey-email-app-approval-rules-basecamp-launch">Hey saga</a> and continuing with
the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/8/13/21367923/fortnite-apple-app-store-epic-games-need-to-know">ongoing battle with Epic</a> have not reflected well. Apple
appears to see developers as owing them for the privilege of being in their store and
using their APIs. This is despite app development requiring a yearly membership
fee of AU$149, and purchase of Mac hardware for development.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We understand that Basecamp has developed a number of apps and many
subsequent versions for the App Store for many years, and that the App Store
has distributed millions of these apps to iOS users. These apps do not offer
in-app purchase — and, consequently, have not contributed any revenue to the
App Store over the last eight years. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>— <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/18/21296180/apple-hey-email-app-basecamp-rejection-response-controversy-antitrust-regulation">Apple App Review Board</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Epic decided that it would like to reap the benefits of the App Store without
paying anything for them.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Apple legal submission, via <a href="https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/1303462987924221952?s=20">Marco Arment</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apple: Epic only looking for a free ride</p>
<p>Epic, according to Apple, has given Apple $257,000,000 in commission fees in
two years over in-app purchases that Apple has no hand, act, part in, doesn't
host on their servers, just for the privilege of existing on their OS. ‘Free
ride’.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1303465156551282689?s=20">Steve Troughton-Smith</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>To take just one example, Epic has for years used Apple's groudbreaking
graphics technology, Metal. [..] Apple doesn't charge anything beyond its
standard commission for the use of Metal or any of the other tools that Epic
has used to develop great games on iOS.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>— Philip Schiller, via <a href="https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1297027872549474306?s=20">Steve Troughton-Smith</a></p>
<p>The only alternative to Metal is OpenGL and <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/12894/apple-deprecates-opengl-across-all-oses">Apple have deprecated
that</a>!</p>
<p>Anyway, whether you agree with Apple or not this whole thing has me (a developer
by trade, and a <a href="https://binarytrance.com/apps/symbolmate.html">past contributor to the App Store</a>) feeling offside.
Additionally, since I now use Linux full-time there are other sources of friction:</p>
<ul>
<li>iPhones work best when paired with a Mac (or even a PC running Windows).</li>
<li>Apple only support building apps on Macs, so if I want to cobble together an
app for my phone it's no longer possible.</li>
</ul>
<p>My only real recourse as a consumer is voting with my wallet and perhaps
sharing my reasoning on this blog, so here we are. If enough people do this
maybe they will take notice, maybe they won't, but I feel I at least need to
try. Just like last time, when <a href="https://bitcannon.net/post/finding-an-alternative-to-mac-os-x/">I sought a replacement for Mac OS X and
switched to Linux</a> I have been
evaluating alternatives to iOS.</p>
<p>It's worth noting at this point that I <em>really</em> dislike
Google. I distanced myself from all of their services about 8 years ago. The
only Google service I use regularly is YouTube. I use <a href="https://www.fastmail.com/">Fastmail</a> for email,
<a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">DuckDuckGo</a> for search, Apple + <a href="https://www.flickr.com/">Flickr</a> for photos, <a href="https://mattermost.com/">Mattermost</a>, iMessage,
<a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>, and <a href="https://telegram.org/">Telegram</a> for chat.</p>
<h2 id="evaluating-alternatives">Evaluating Alternatives</h2>
<p>Initial research turned up the following candidates. Almost all were
immediately written-off due to lacking apps or being too immature:</p>
<ul>
<li>Android as shipped on a mainstream phone
<ul>
<li>Full of apps and services dependant on Google.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://lineage.microg.org/">LineageOS for microG</a>
<ul>
<li>LineageOS with microG compatibility library to allow running apps that rely
on Google APIs, without using Google services.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="http://postmarketos.org/">postmarketOS</a>
<ul>
<li>Good in theory: An <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a> based OS for your phone. However, it notes,
"Beta version. Calls don't work on most phones yet", on the home page.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://puri.sm/products/librem-5/">Librem 5 + PureOS</a>
<ul>
<li>By all accounts the expensive hardware is still not great quality and the
software is still being built.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://www.webos-ports.org/wiki/Main_Page">LuneOS (WebOS)</a>
<ul>
<li>Very small ecosystem.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://sailfishos.org/">Sailfish OS</a>
<ul>
<li>Bills itself as, "the mobile OS solution for corporations and governments",
right on the front page. I am neither of these things.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Give up on a smartphone
<ul>
<li>Get a basic phone for calls and texts and do everything else on a real
computer, possibly an ultra compact like the <a href="https://au.banggood.com/Original-Box-GPD-Pocket-2-Intel-Celeron-3965Y-Dual-Core-8GB-RAM-256GB-ROM-7-Inch-Windows-10-OS-Tablet-PC-p-1430504.html?rmmds=mywishlist&amp;cur_warehouse=CN">GPD Pocket 2</a>.</li>
<li>A friend who has never owned a smartphone talked me out of this. It's
possible but very inconvenient. Especially due to some things only being
possible with a smartphone like ride sharing.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Turns out duopolies suck: you can choose some modicum of respect for privacy
with developer hostile Apple, or get a bit more freedom with surveillance
capitalist Google. The candidates that seem most viable for me are LineageOS,
and LineageOS for microG.  To test out this theory I purchased the cheapest
phone supported by LineageOS that I could get new: a <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/onclite/">Redmi 7</a> by Xiaomi for
AU$175.</p>
<p>For the price I was honestly expecting this phone to be hot garbage. It is in
fact much better that I expected. However, this was just a platform for testing
the software ecosystem, I won't be reviewing the hardware or letting it colour
my impressions of Android. If this experiment goes well my plan would be to by
a higher quality iPhone replacement phone.</p>
<h3 id="stock-miui-rom">Stock MIUI ROM</h3>
<p>I spent a small amount of time with the stock ROM<sup><a href="#1">1</a></sup> (<a href="https://en.miui.com/">MIUI</a>) that the Redmi comes
with to get a bit of a baseline. It worked well enough and was fairly
aesthetically pleasing, but the ads and tracking were truly horrifying. Just
take a look at <a href="https://gadgetstouse.com/blog/2020/05/11/miui-how-to-stop-data-collection-remove-ads-on-xiaomi-phones/">this post describing the steps required to disable data
collection and ads</a> — and this is just what you can turn off. Who
knows what else it's doing behind the scenes.</p>
<h3 id="lineageos-open-gapps">LineageOS + Open GApps</h3>
<p>I quickly nuked MIUI and installed LineageOS + Open GApps (nano). <a href="https://opengapps.org/">Open GApps</a>
gives you access to some of Google's closed-source apps and libraries,
crucially the Google Play Store. The "Open" part of the name refers to the
open-source scripts the project publishes for the generation of up-to-date
Google Apps packages.</p>
<p>This ROM provides a decent balance between open-source Android and access to the
breadth of the Google Play Store. In hindsight The nano version of Open GApps
includes more Google than I actually want. I think the ideal for me is the pico
package, which is just what's needed to run the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>With this install I attempted to replace the apps that I use most on iOS. For
the following apps I just used the Android version:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Authy</li>
  <li>Catch.com.au</li>
  <li>Deliveroo</li>
  <li>Discord</li>
  <li>Element (Matrix)</li>
  <li>Fastmail</li>
  <li>Firefox</li>
  <li>Firefox Focus</li>
  <li>Instagram</li>
  <li>Mattermost</li>
  <li>Reddit</li>
  <li>Slack</li>
  <li>Telegram</li>
  <li>Up</li>
  <li>YouTube</li>
</ul>
<p>For these apps I found a replacement that I was mostly happy with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Podcasts: <a href="https://overcast.fm/">Overcast</a> → <a href="https://www.pocketcasts.com/">Pocket Casts</a></li>
<li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitterrific.com/ios/">Twitterrific</a> → <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.arthurivanets.owly&amp;hl=en_US">Owly</a></li>

<li>Password Manager: <a href="https://github.com/mssun/passforios">Pass for iOS</a> → <a href="https://github.com/android-password-store/Android-Password-Store">Password Store</a> + <a href="https://www.openkeychain.org/">OpenKeychain</a></li>
<li>Local Terminal: (null) → <a href="https://termux.com/">Termux</a></li>
<li>Fediverse: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/toot/id1229021451">Toot!</a> → <a href="https://fedilab.app/">Fedilab</a></li>
<li>Email: Mail.app → Email (default Email app on LineageOS)</li>
</ul>
<p>For these apps I wasn't able to/have not yet found a replacement that I was
happy with (please <em>don't</em> send me recommendations):</p>
<ul>
<li>Weather (with <a href="http://www.bom.gov.au/">Australian Bureau of Meteorology</a> data): <a href="https://weatherperfect.app/">Perfect</a> → ?</li>
<li>Weight tracker:  <a href="https://happyscale.com/">Happy Scale</a> → ?</li>
<li>Hacker News: <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/minihack/id631108846">MiniHack</a> → ?</li>
<li>Fitness tracking: Apple Watch/Activities app → ?</li>

<li>Parcel tracking: <a href="https://parcelapp.net/">Parcel</a> → ?</li>
<li>ApplePay → ?</li>
<li>Netflix
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LineageOS/comments/bb1xiw/cant_find_netflix_on_the_app_store/">Not available on LineageOS</a>
because it is not, "Play Protect" certified.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In general I don't find Android apps to be as nice, or as polished as iOS apps.
John and Ben recently discussed this on <a href="https://dithering.fm/">the 9 September episode of
Dithering</a>, which matched my experience. I also really dislike the
visual style and slow animations of the <a href="https://material.io/">Material design language</a>.
Especially the circular animation on tap. The apps I like the most are the ones
that shun the Material style for their own.</p>
<p>Something I learnt from my move to Linux though, was to embrace the platform's
conventions as opposed to trying to reproduce the system you're moving from as
much as possible. So I will put my dislike of Material aside.</p>

Emoji font for emoji on Android. On Linux my system emoji font is <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/ttf-joypixels/">JoyPixels</a> and
I go to certain lengths to <a href="https://www.wezm.net/v2/posts/2020/github-emoji-linux/">avoid seeing Noto Color Emoji</a>. Almost
any other widely available emoji font would be preferable to me. I did try
side-loading a JoyPixels package when flashing the ROM but couldn't get it to
stick. Apparently something changed in Android 10.</p>
<p>I could "root" the phone and swap out the font file but in the same way
I've never jail-broken an iPhone this is not a path I want to go down right now.
If worst comes to worst I could actually <a href="https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/onclite/build">build LineageOS from source</a> and swap
out Noto Color Emoji — what a concept!</p>
<h3 id="lineageos-for-microg">LineageOS for microG</h3>
<p>microG is a library that implements various APIs provided by Google
closed-source libraries in order to be able to run more apps — those that
depend on Google's mapping APIs for example. The microG versions of the APIs
don't rely on Google servers. Critically going down this path you lose access
to Google's push notification servers. Some apps like Telegram work around this
but for the most part you lose notifications.</p>
<p>LineageOS for microG gives a familiar LineageOS experience initially. Instead
of the Google Play Store though, it uses <a href="https://f-droid.org/">F-Droid</a>, a repository of strictly
free and open-source software. As expected there are far fewer apps available
on F-Droid. Most of the big names are missing.</p>
<p>I think if you were especially principled, were happy to use web apps for
many things (like Twitter), and didn't …</p></div></div>

<p><span>Blog post 11 September 2020, by Tom Tervoort, Senior Security Specialist and Ralph Moonen, Technical Director at Secura</span></p>
<p><span><span><em></em></span></span><span><strong><span>Last month, Microsoft patched a very interesting vulnerability that would allow an attacker with a foothold on your internal network to essentially become Domain Admin with one click. All that is required is for a connection to the Domain Controller to be possible from the attacker’s viewpoint. </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Secura's security expert Tom Tervoort previously discovered <strong><span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.secura.com/blog-cve-2019-1424" rel="noopener noreferrer">a less severe Netlogon vulnerability last year that allowed workstations to be taken over</a></span></strong>, but the attacker required a Person-in-the-Middle (PitM) position for that to work. Now, he discovered this second, much more severe (CVSS score: 10.0) vulnerability in the protocol. By forging an authentication token for specific Netlogon functionality, he was able to call a function to set the computer password of the Domain Controller to a known value. After that, the attacker can use this new password to take control over the domain controller and steal credentials of a domain admin. </span></p>
<p><span>The vulnerability stems from a flaw in a cryptographic authentication scheme used by the Netlogon Remote Protocol, which among other things can be used to update computer passwords. This flaw allows attackers to impersonate any computer, including the domain controller itself, and execute remote procedure calls on their behalf. </span></p>
<p><span>Secura urges everybody to install the patch on all their domain controllers as fast as possible. Please refer to Microsoft’s advisory. <strong>We published a test tool on Github</strong>, which you can download here:&nbsp;<strong><span><a href="https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472">https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472</a></span></strong> that can tell you whether a domain controller is vulnerable or not.&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
    <p>If you, like me, live in the Bay Area, you may have woken up to something like this last week:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-outside.jpg" alt="Outdoor Air Quality"></p>

<p>This is my back yard, but things looked just as dire in the house:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-inside.jpg" alt="Indoor Air Quality"></p>

<p>If you checked a website, like <a href="https://www.purpleair.com/map?opt=1/mAQI/a10/cC0#8/38.138/-121.702">PurpleAir</a> or <a href="https://fire.airnow.gov/?lat=37.86988000000008&amp;lng=-122.27053999999998&amp;zoom=12">AirNow</a>, you would see scary numbers and dire warnings about staying indoors and avoiding the air outside.
However, how <em>is</em> the air inside your house?
Are you actually much safer?</p>

<p>Thankfully, answering this question has gotten cheaper and easier in recent years.
Low-cost air quality sensors have been built into reasonably inexpensive hardware.
The <a href="https://www2.purpleair.com/products/purpleair-pa-i-indoor">PurpleAir indoor sensor</a>, for instance, is only $200.</p>

<p>The heart of that device is a plantower laser dust sensor which can be <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32639894148.html">had on AliExpress for about $12</a>.
With PurpleAir, you’re paying for more than just the sensor.
That device includes a <a href="https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-bme280-humidity-barometric-pressure-temperature-sensor-breakout">BME280</a> temperature/pressure/humidity sensor, a microcontroller that can access a WiFi network, GPS that helps localize the device on a map, all  conveniently packed into a nice-looking device.
You pay for integration of all that hardware, firmware to make it work together, and software that integrates the data on the back-end and gives you a nice map to view it on.
You’re also paying for hosting to allow PurpleAir to store your data and display it to others.
So, by buying one, you’re not only becoming better-informed, but you’re also helping folks in your neighborhood be better-informed too – a <em>positive</em> externality, for once!</p>

<p>However, if you’re brave enough, there are advantages to building the hardware yourself.
Getting several sensors inside and outside your house can help you understand more about the air you’re breathing.
It can help quantify interventions, like installing an air purifier or running <a href="https://www.texairfilters.com/how-a-merv-13-air-filter-and-a-box-fan-can-help-fight-covid-19/">a box fan</a>.
If you have a large house, you can see how quality differs throughout the house.</p>

<p>Also – while for most readers of this blog, $200 is probably not a lot of money, it <em>is</em> a lot of money for <em>most</em> people.
The folks who are most regularly affected by poor air quality are exactly those who cannot just blow $200 to satisfy their curiosity.
Making air quality monitoring much, much cheaper can potentially make life much better for those people.</p>

<p>This post will help you build a minimum viable sensor that works with your laptop.
By using a pre-existing computer, you can avoid having to pay for additional hardware like a microcontroller with WiFi.
Your computer is probably already on WiFi, so configuration is also minimized.</p>

<p>You can also avoid sending data to a cloud.
This is a double-edged sword.
On the one hand, cloud hosting costs are eliminated.
On the other hand, you lose the positive benefits of open data.
Also, if you want visualizations, you have to make them yourself.</p>

<p>Anyway, on to the construction!</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>The bill of materials for this project includes two things:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Plantower PMS7003 – maybe <a href="https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32784279004.html">this one</a></li>
  <li>A USB-to-TTL cable like <a href="https://amzn.to/2GYAYAD">this one</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This should run you about $20 all-told.
I also needed the following tools and supplies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>soldering iron and solder</li>
  <li>heat shrink tubing and a lighter</li>
  <li>wire clippers/strippers</li>
</ul>

<p>The PMS7003 sensors I had did not come with the little breakout board, and this device has <em>very</em> small pins.
To connect to it, I used some 30AWG wire-wrap wire and a wire-wrapping tool.
If you get a PMS7003 with a breakout and cable, you won’t need this.</p>

<p>My first task was connecting to the PMS7003.
Here’s the pinout, from the <a href="https://download.kamami.com/p564008-p564008-PMS7003%20series%20data%20manua_English_V2.5.pdf">data sheet</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-pms7003-pinout.gif" alt="PMS7003 pinout"></p>

<p>You’ll only need 4 wires – for power, ground, serial Tx, and Rx.
I stripped the tiniest bit of insulation on my wire wrap wire, tinned both the wire and the pin, and touched them together with the soldering iron (very carefully, to avoid bridging the pins).</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-wires.jpg" alt="soldering wires"></p>

<p>Here’s a (blurry) photo with all 4 wires connected:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-all-wires.jpg" alt="soldering wires"></p>

<p>Next, I stripped my USB TTL cable and tinned the exposed multi-strand wires.
Tinning just means touching the soldering iron to the wire and allowing some solder to flow onto the wire.
This makes the wire stiff, so I can wire-wrap onto it using my wire-wrap tool.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-usb-ttl-tinned.jpg" alt="USB TTL"></p>

<p>Next, I wire-wrapped the exposed, tinned wires.
Black and Red are for ground and power, and get connected together.
On my TTL cables, <code>green</code> is for <code>Tx</code> (transmit) and <code>white</code> is for <code>Rx</code> (receive).
You need to connect the <code>Tx</code> of the PMS7003 to the <code>Rx</code> of the TTL cable, and vice versa.
I made it easier for myself by making my <code>white</code> wire on the PMS7003 be the <code>Tx</code> pin (Pin9), so I could just do white-to-white:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-wired-up.jpg" alt="Completed Wiring"></p>

<p>After wire-wrapping, I soldered the wires together (belt <em>and</em> suspenders!)
Finally, I put some heat-shrink tubing over the wires and shrunk it using a lighter.
I then taped the device right to the USB plug with electrical tape.
Be sure to avoid covering up the air intake and expel ports on the PMS7003.
Also, be mindful of USB polarity.
The orientation that I have in the photo is probably the way your USB port is aligned on your computer, so the PMS7003 ends up on top of the USB plug.</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-complete.jpg" alt="Completeled device"></p>

<p>Here it is, plugged into my computer and ready for software integration:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-in-computer.jpg" alt="Plugged into computer"></p>

<h2 id="software">Software</h2>

<p>Next, you’ll need some software to integrate with this hardware.
The cables that I got use the Prolific Technology PL2303 chipset.
This is already supported on linux; if you plug it in and run <code>dmesg | tail</code> you’ll see something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[1457958.125315] usb 1-2: new full-speed USB device number 38 using xhci_hcd
[1457958.281810] usb 1-2: New USB device found, idVendor=067b, idProduct=2303, bcdDevice= 4.00
[1457958.281816] usb 1-2: New USB device strings: Mfr=1, Product=2, SerialNumber=0
[1457958.281820] usb 1-2: Product: USB-Serial Controller
[1457958.281823] usb 1-2: Manufacturer: Prolific Technology Inc.
[1457958.283810] pl2303 1-2:1.0: pl2303 converter detected
[1457958.285306] usb 1-2: pl2303 converter now attached to ttyUSB0
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Looks like it got recognized correctly, and is available at <code>/dev/ttyUSB0</code>.
On OSX, you will probably have to <a href="http://www.prolific.com.tw/US/ShowProduct.aspx?p_id=229&amp;pcid=41">install a driver</a>, but you can ignore the warning about restarting your computer.
On these machines, the device will probably show up at <code>/dev/tty.usbserial</code>.</p>

<p>While it has power, the PMS7003 will be outputting a continuous stream of binary data containing the particulate readings onto that TTY device.
The <a href="https://download.kamami.com/p564008-p564008-PMS7003%20series%20data%20manua_English_V2.5.pdf">data sheet</a> specifies the protocol:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-pms7003-protocol.png" alt="PMS7003 protocol"></p>

<p>I recommend using my <a href="https://github.com/igor47/mini-aqm">mini-aqi repo</a>, which includes a Python implementation of this protocol.
You will need a recent python (I tested with <code>3.8.3</code>; anything above <code>3.6</code> should probably work).
Run these commands to grab the repo, install the code, and begin reading data:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>git clone https://github.com/igor47/mini-aqm.git
cd mini-aqm/
pip install poetry
poetry install
poetry run ./main.py
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And you should see the output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>beginning to read data from /dev/ttyUSB0...
PM 1.0: 32  PM 2.5: 54  PM 10: 73  AQI: Unhealthy for Certain Groups
PM 1.0: 31  PM 2.5: 54  PM 10: 73  AQI: Unhealthy for Certain Groups
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here’s a screenshot:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-screenshot.png" alt="Runtime Screenshot"></p>

<p><code>mini-aqm</code> tries to print informative error messages.
If <code>main.py</code> exits immediately without printing any air quality measurements, read the error message and try to resolve it.
If you suspect a hardware issue, use a multi-meter to check for a short between pins.</p>

<h2 id="visualizations">Visualizations</h2>

<p>I am running <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/time-series-platform/telegraf/">telegraf</a> on my laptop.
I’ve configured telegraf to read data from the device and store it in <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/products/influxdb-overview/">influxdb</a>, for graphing with <a href="https://grafana.com/">grafana</a>.
Using this stack, here’s a visualization of the past few months of PM data in my workshop:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-last-3-months.png" alt="Last Few Months in Particulates"></p>

<p>Using this setup, it’s convenient to perform experiments and look at results.
For instance, here is what happened with indoor air quality when we turned on our central fan system, which pushes air through two MERV13 filters:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-central-fan.png" alt="Central Air"></p>

<p>Here’s where we take a box fan with a MERV13 filter and run it near the sensor:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-box-fan.png" alt="Box Fan"></p>

<p>Here’s what happens when we just point a normal fan at the device, with no filter:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-normal-fan.png" alt="Normal Fan"></p>

<p>I noticed that the air quality in my bedroom was not great.
The basement door is right outside my bedroom door, and is pretty leaky, so I started keeping my bedroom door closed.
I also taped over my old, leaky windows with masking tape:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-tape-on-windows.jpg?cache=no" alt="Taped-over windows"></p>

<p>These interventions had a real effect!</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-window-tape-effect.png" alt="Normal Fan"></p>

<p>Finally, it <em>is</em> possible to have <em>good</em> air quality.
I’m currently sitting in my taped-up room, with doors closed, right next to a box-fan-with-filter:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-getting-to-good.jpg" alt="Good Setup"></p>

<p>The results, with other rooms in the house and outside the house on my Grafana dashboard:</p>

<p><img src="https://igor.moomers.org/static/images/minimal-aq-all-together.png" alt="Normal Fan"></p>

<p>Setting up <code>telegraf</code>, <code>influxdb</code>, and <code>grafana</code> is beyond the scope of this post.
If you do go this route, however, the <code>mini-aqm</code> code is already writing a log of collected data into a <code>measurements.log</code> file.
You can run the collector while you’re working on the visualization setup, and then import the “historical” data you’ve collected when you’re done.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>I’d like to help you breathe better air.
Reach out if you need help building these devices, or have any questions at all.
Also, if you’re in the Bay Area, I have a few spare PMS7003 devices.
If you’d like one without waiting for them to be shipped from China, please reach out, and I can leave one on my porch for you to come grab.</p>

              <h2>
                My journey from Django to RedwoodJS
              </h2>

              <p>September 2020</p>

              <p>
                Don't get fooled by the title. I have nothing but an immense admiration for Django and its community. I've been using it since 2013, and it became that invisible superpower behind my LinkedIn and career aspirations.
              </p>

              <p>
                From a background in C and Pascal while in University, I quickly moved to Delphi, then ASP and PHP as I started programming commercially in the early 2000s.
              </p>

              <p>
                After years of employment and consultancy clients, I was ready to start creating my own products and playing the startup game. And as a classic startup rookie, instead of talking to potential customers, I spent months deciding and setting up my new tech environment. I was simply having too much fun with Python and Django.
              </p>

              <p>
                And that's when it became invisible. Everything I tried to do with it just happened so smoothly. As an old school SQL enthusiast, building performing queries was probably the biggest challenge until I got used to Django's ORM. At the same time, it was always my favourite part of the day: Hunting down and improving the slowest queries.
              </p>

              <p>
                Still, I was aware Django was one of the weakest choices on several performance benchmarks, especially when stressed against hot new approaches and frameworks released every few months. It was tempting to jump ship because of that, but then again, I had already graduated in the startup journey to be thinking first on what customers need.
              </p>

              <p>
                It all worked well for me with Django. My experience with it helped me qualify for a "Highly Skilled Professional" visa to migrate from Brazil to Australia, where, later on, I co-founded my most successful business to date. A wine subscription service powered by machine-learning recommendations. I've been facing challenges as we scale the Django app to more and more customers, but it still does the job.
              </p>

              <p>
                The same year I started using Django, I started frequently hearing about React and Express. Since then, as an old school developer still using jQuery when I needed something extra in the front-end, I have to say I wasn't very excited about the upcoming Javascript storm. I kind of rooted against it and just decided to wait.
              </p>

              <p>
                But then, by late 2018, it came crashing into my doors. On my wine startup, we had adopted React and GraphQL as we engaged in a substantive re-writing of our Django monolithic to be able to support our nascent mobile app and give better support to our modern front-end developers joining the company.
              </p>

              <p>
                GraphQL was a risky investment that paid off. Our team got more productive, and my favourite part was seeing how fast and independently the front-end developers could demonstrate and validate ideas, alongside the designers and product managers. And with it, I found myself constantly playing with React.
              </p>

              <p>
                Meanwhile, I never stopped building and testing smaller side-projects. But using my go-to Django + AWS&nbsp;set up became a tedious and tiresome task. It was a painful first-step for such tiny ideas. It would slow me down, or sometimes even block my motivation before I committed to building.
              </p>

              <p>
                Would I need a mobile app if this side-project succeeded? If so, would it be irresponsible to start building it with Django Templates? What about my AWS Server setup on a Multi-container Docker? And would I really need to go through all that configuration again with S3, CloudFront, ECS, ECR, Route 53...?
              </p>

              <p>
                Then one day I woke up to this:
              </p>

              <p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22537944">
                <img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/bd3a917f220e144bbeda4f49e0e80699589244c6/b2e0c/assets/img/blog/hacker-news-redwoodjs-post.jpg" alt="Hacker News Post on RedwoodJS">
              </a></p><p>
                First, seeing one of the creators of GitHub and Jekyll fully invested in a full-stack JS framework was intriguing. That first comment comparing it to Rails productivity got me excited enough. I was late to the discussion, but I read every single comment on Hacker News and Twitter. Before I knew it, I was devouring the step-by-step tutorial to get started.
              </p>

              <p>
                I was sold. <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/">RedwoodJS</a> was (my) future.
              </p>

              <p>
                I probably got too excited too quickly. I joined the community and started asking around what everyone thought about going to production with a project before Redwood's 1.0.
              </p>

              <p>
                Six months later and I have written and launched <a href="https://www.duoflag.com/">Duoflag</a> from scratch with RedwoodJS.
              </p>

              <p>
                I have never had such a simple yet powerful, deployment workflow. I have never felt so good with the framework onboarding and overall experience.
              </p>

              <p>
                It's important to remember that at the time of this post, Redwood is still on version <strong>0.18.0</strong> with an exciting roadmap to get to <strong>1.0</strong> by the end of 2020 hopefully.
              </p>

              <p>
                So, what's the reason for so much positivity about Redwood? Did I just fall in love with Javascript and got tired of Python? Not really. Javascript is just one of the elements for an ultimately simple and productive integrated solution.
              </p>

              <p>
                It's all about integration. Redwood is starting by making opinionated decisions from the whirlwind of options for modern Javascript and API pathways. Especially for people like me, coming from traditional MVC + VM patterns and being overwhelmed with so many different approaches just to get started with a modern web app. And most importantly, it's a framework built to scale your app with very little effort.
              </p>

              <p>
                So even now, before Redwood's 1.0, I can't see a better alternative at least for my use-case - quickly shipping and validating side-projects in such a clean, productive and scalable way.

              </p>

              <p>
                Here's a summary of my experience with going to production with RedwoodJS in September 2020:
              </p>

              <h3>
                Pros
              </h3>

              <ul>
                  <li>
                    All code in a single <strong>monorepo</strong>. I'm much more productive having a folder for my "api" and another for "web" right next to it in the same project. And knowing I will have "mobile" in the future right in the same mix.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I thought I would miss Django Admin. But redwood has started on the right foot with its <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cli-commands#generate-alias-g">generators</a>, including a scaffold one for working CRUD modules.
                    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    No more laziness on my side when trying to display an element with database information quickly. With Django and templates, it was a little bit of a mess, especially when I wanted a jQuery request and a loading icon. For the job, one of my favourite parts - Redwood <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/docs/cells">Cells</a>:
                    
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I integrated <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/docs/authentication">authentication</a> in a few minutes - while I had a sandwich. It was that fast.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    As I said before, writing efficient queries is a big one for me. Props to <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Prisma</a> to be evolving so fast and elegantly.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    I was already exploring <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>, so its default integration with Redwood made life so much easier. With a "git push", my website is in CDNs and serverless functions distributed everywhere.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Lastly, but so importantly, Redwood's <a href="https://community.redwoodjs.com/">Community</a> is welcoming and inspiring. It's growing fast too. Everyone is welcome to <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/docs/introduction#contributors">contribute</a>, even if like me, you can only start with tiny bug-fixes and documentation.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              

              <h3>
                Cons
              </h3>

              <ul>
                  <li>
                    <strong>Bundle sizes</strong> can do much better. That's a known issue, and general performance is still pending in Redwood's roadmap pre <strong>1.0</strong>.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The <strong>router</strong> isn't mature enough yet. Apart from performance issues, important things are missing, such as an option for automatically handling a trailing slash.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Prisma's <strong>DB Migrations</strong> are still experimental. There's a risk with each new release you can break your current migrations in production and have to fix them manually. Seamless integration with data migrations is also missing. That's probably the part that I felt least safe coming from Django's stability.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    To keep a simple <strong>deployment</strong>, like in my case using Netlify, you have to give up the ability to group your web and database servers in the same VPC.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              

              <h3>
                Wishlist
              </h3>

              <ul>
                  <li>
                    A default pattern for pagination/filtering/sorting could be built for the SDL and service generators.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    With Netlify handling your CDNs and Lambdas, only the database is missing an auto-scaling solution. This is something a lot of people in the space are trying to solve (e.g. FaunaDB).
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Better support for JetBrains IDEs.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Better logging.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              

              <p>
                But in general, a happy user here. With the current evolution pace, I can easily see my bigger projects migrated to Redwood in a year or two.
              </p>

We discuss some of the challenges with using Apache Kafka over our implemented solution that uses PostgreSQL.</p><h2><strong>RudderStack is a Queue</strong></h2><p>At its core, RudderStack is a queuing system. It gets events from multiple sources, persists them, and then sends them to different destinations. Persisting the events is crucial because RudderStack needs to be able to handle different kinds of failures.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s consider an example here – a destination could be down for any length of time due to some reason. In such a scenario, RudderStack should ideally retain the events and then retry sending the events when that destination is functional once again.</p><div><figure><img src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.1-1024x312.png" alt="RudderStack - An Event Queue" srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.1-980x298.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.1-480x146.png 480w" sizes="((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" data-old-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.1-1024x312.png" data-srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.1-980x298.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.1-480x146.png 480w"><figcaption>RudderStack – An Event Queue</figcaption></figure></div><p>Naturally, a popular choice of tool for building such a queuing solution would be Apache Kafka. Kafka provides features such as persistence, ordering, de-duping, extreme performance, horizontal scalability, etc. that any queuing system would need.&nbsp;</p><p>A simple Kafka-based system looks something like this:</p><div><figure><img src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.2-1024x269.png" alt="A Simple Kafka-Based System" srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.2-980x257.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.2-480x126.png 480w" sizes="((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" data-old-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.2-1024x269.png" data-srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.2-980x257.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.2-480x126.png 480w"><figcaption>A Simple Kafka-Based System</figcaption></figure></div><p>In our queueing system, we would need to create a separate topic per destination. Events from the sources can be queued into destination-specific topics, while one consumer consumes events from the destination topics. The consumer itself might be spreading the work of sending events across multiple threads for parallelization.&nbsp;</p><p>A separate topic per destination is ideal because if a specific destination is unavailable (e.g., downtime), we do not want to block the events for other destinations. However, as we will see in the next section, failures can be of other types too, leading to complications with this setup.</p><p>While this architecture looks simple enough, Apache Kafka comes with its own set of challenges, which we will focus on in the following sections.</p><h2><strong>Management Challenges</strong></h2><p>Apache Kafka is not the easiest product to deploy and distribute. Moreover, its dependency on Apache Zookeeper – a distributed configuration and synchronization service – makes it quite a <a href="https://medium.com/@anuradha.neo/kafka-is-not-the-best-anymore-meet-pulsar-9eb435c9fc0b">management challenge</a>.</p><p>We did not want to ship and support a product in which we were not experts ourselves.</p><h2><strong>Licensing Issues</strong></h2><p>Licensing was another issue with Apache Kafka. We wanted to release the entire code under an open-source license (AGPLv3). However, the core of Apache Kafka managed by the Apache Foundation is released under the <a href="https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache-2 license</a>. In addition, the version actively managed by Confluent is only available under a non-OSI license (Confluent Community License).&nbsp;</p><p>Some specific Kafka features like kSQL (which is very useful for debugging jobs) are not available under the Apache License.</p><p>One of the key features for the queueing system we built was the ability to peek into the pending events, and update their state, i.e. set their failure state to retry. Implementing this was not possible with an OSS license.</p><h2><strong>Handling Multiple Customers</strong></h2><p>In our hosted, multi-tenant offering, we have multiple customers on the same RudderStack instance. While they can use the same architecture as above with a topic per destination, it can lead to a situation where a large flurry of events from one customer blocks events coming from another customer, as shown in the diagram below:&nbsp;</p><div><figure><img src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.3-1024x247.png" alt="Events From Multiple Customers" srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.3-980x236.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.3-480x116.png 480w" sizes="((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" data-old-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.3-1024x247.png" data-srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.3-980x236.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.3-480x116.png 480w"><figcaption>Events From Multiple Customers</figcaption></figure></div><p>Ideally, we would want to keep the customers separate so that we can provide the per-customer QoS guarantees.</p><p>The way to do this is to create a separate Kafka topic per destination/customer combination. Unfortunately, Kafka doesn’t scale well with the number of topics. This would eventually become a hindrance our customer-base grows. Our friends at Segment faced a similar issue and wrote a <a href="https://segment.com/blog/introducing-centrifuge/">blog about it</a>.</p><h2><strong>Error Handling</strong></h2><p>Error handling becomes complex with the data in Kafka. If an event fails to deliver, we wanted to adopt the following workflow:</p><ul><li>Record some metadata like the error code, the number of times it has failed, etc.</li><li>Put it back on top of the queue for subsequent retrying.</li><li>Block further events from that user to preserve the order till the event is successfully delivered (or it is aborted).<br></li></ul><p>The following diagram shows an example of a ‘logical’ state of the system at any point:</p><div><figure><img src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.4-1024x247.png" alt="A Logical State of the System" srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.4-980x236.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.4-480x116.png 480w" sizes="((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw" data-old-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.4-1024x247.png" data-srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.4-980x236.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.4-480x116.png 480w"><figcaption>A Logical State of the System</figcaption></figure></div><p>Event #1 has failed and must be retried. Along with the event, we also want to keep track of the number of times it was retried, the failure error code, etc. Event #3 is from the same end-user, so it cannot be sent until Event #1 succeeds or aborts. However, Event #2 is unrelated and should be processed and succeeded.</p><p>As seen in the figure above, the queue is processing the events and marking them as succeeded (S), failed (F), or waiting (W). A separate process (or a sweep of the main process) can start from the top. The queue is always in a consistent state, so if there is a crash, we can always start from the top.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is not trivial to implement the above logical semantics using Apache Kafka. Kafka does not allow the events to be updated, so we cannot mark the top event as failed, or associate any metadata with it.&nbsp;</p><p>Removing the event and queueing it back (at the end) doesn’t work either, as this will break the ordering constraints – event #3 will end up before event #1, as seen in the example above.&nbsp;</p><h3>Use of Two Queues</h3><p>Another solution is to use two queues – the main queue and a failed queue. The failed jobs and the skipped jobs (from the same user ID) from the main queue can be put in the failed queue. This is demonstrated in the following diagram:</p><div><figure><img src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.5-1024x471.png" alt="Use of Two Queues" width="580" height="266" srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.5-980x451.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.5-480x221.png 480w" sizes="((min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px)) 480px, ((min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px)) 980px, 100vw" data-old-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif" data-src="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.5-1024x471.png" data-srcset="https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.5-980x451.png 980w, https://3od2tt2mz35tibwwgb36eab1-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/apacheblog.rs_.5-480x221.png 480w"><figcaption>Use of Two Queues</figcaption></figure></div><p>The issue with this approach is that this only works for the first failure. How do we handle the failures occurring in the Fail Queue? We still have to update the metadata and re-queue the event, so we will need a second fail queue to store failed events from the 1st fail queue.&nbsp;</p><p>We want to retry events a few dozen times before expiring the event, so this is not a great solution as well.</p><h2><strong>Debuggability</strong></h2><p>Being able to query the events as they wait in the queue and/or update the metadata (around failures) to force immediate retrying is a great debugging feature that we were building at RudderStack. Having a SQL-like query interface to the persisted event helped a lot with that.</p><p>While Kafka’s kSQL provides the query interface, it does not allow for updates. Furthermore, there are licensing issues with kSQL, as we noted earlier.</p><h2><strong>In Conclusion</strong></h2><p>In this post, we looked at some of the reasons why we decided to build our own queuing library, instead of adopting a Kafka-based solution. We will write a blog about the implementation but if you are curious, you can explore the implementation on <a href="https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-server">GitHub</a></p><p>With our queueing system powered by PostgreSQL, we could easily change the logic for ordering the events as well as debugging them. In addition, we had complete visibility over all the events coming from a source, user or a destination just by running a SQL query – something that was not possible with Apache Kafka.</p><p>To know more about RudderStack and its features, check out our <a href="https://rudderstack.com/">website</a>.

  <p>“Coffee operates like a subscription… there is almost no other subscription that you have that costs that much money.” - Samir, <a href="https://youtu.be/7j9Hhy9UYTE?t=807">The Colin and Samir Podcast</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Colin and Samir have been making a lot of videos recently around the ways creators can make money. Most creators make money through advertisements (brand partnerships and Adsense), referral links to sites like Amazon, paid content through Patreon, and direct to consumer products (typically <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvYbhJ6pryA">merch</a>). They made a whole video dedicated to Emma Chamberlain’s coffee company, but just briefly touched on what I believe is the most important part this company.</p>

<p>When a creator releases merch, they make a large sum of money in a short period of time. The collection quickly sells out or sales die down. Even the biggest fans will likely not buy the same piece of merch twice, which limits the potential amount of revenue for the creator. Consumable items allow creators to get recurring revenue. If someone buys some Chamberlain Coffee Bags and enjoys them, they are likely to continue buying them whenever they run out.</p>

<p><img src="https://stayingqold.github.io/assets/images/posts/a-new-way-to-monetize-an-audience/tiktok-people.png" alt=""></p>

<p>There are a few creators other than Emma Chamberlain who are already following this model. Jocko Willink has his own line of <a href="https://originmaine.com/nutrition/jocko-fuel/discipline/jocko-discipline-go-drink-tropic-thunder-pack-of-4/">energy drinks</a> which you can have shipped to your door weekly, every 2 weeks, or monthly, and two Tik Tok creators have created their own brand of <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDMksF4hde_/?utm_source=ig_embed">energy drinks</a>, which recently became available for <a href="https://ani.energy/">pre-order</a>.</p>

<p>This method of recurring revenue is an excellent way for creators to capitalize on their <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1,000 true fans</a>. Instead of constantly plugging merch to your audience, relying on brands to sponsor your posts, creating separate content for Patrons, or making videos just to funnel your audience into Amazon referral links, you can create a product that a core group of fans enjoy so much that they buy it regularly. The creators who are already doing this are partnering with existing brands which, I’m assuming, do pretty much all the work except advertising for the creator. Though I don’t have numbers to back this up, this seems like this is the best way to create a source of recurring revenue for creators.</p>

<p>States are telling unemployed people that an extra $300 a week unemployment payment that they have been receiving under a federally-funded program is coming to a close after six weeks, with the benefit extending only through the period ending Sept. 5.</p><p><a href="https://labor.mo.gov/news/press-releases/missouri-issues-over-230-million-lost-wages-assistance-unemployed-workers" target="_blank">Missouri</a>, Louisiana, <a href="https://www.uc.pa.gov/unemployment-benefits/file/Pages/LWA.aspx" target="_blank">Pennsylvania</a> and <a href="https://www.twc.texas.gov/news/fema-ends-lost-wages-assistance-program-state-unemployment-benefits-continue" target="_blank">Texas</a> are among the states that have notified residents that the extra benefit, paid on top of standard state unemployment benefits, is ending. The&nbsp;states say that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has told them that the money that was made available for the payments is running out.</p><p>“Some tough news for some,” Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said on Friday.</p><p>The governor said Louisiana’s workforce commission on Friday received funding to pay the benefit through the week ending Aug. 29 and would process payments for that week immediately and that those funds should start showing up in people's accounts on Monday. He also said the state has requested funding for the week ending Sept. 5.</p><p>“We don't yet have it,” he said. “We will be getting that funding we have been assured and as soon as we get it, we will be getting those payments out as well.”</p><p>Regardless of where a state is in the process to receive and distribute the additional unemployment insurance funding—available under what’s been dubbed the lost wages assistance program—FEMA will provide funding for six weeks of the supplemental benefit to every state that applied for it by Sept. 10, an agency spokesperson said on Friday. FEMA has been part of this program because it was funded with $44 billion of disaster relief money.</p><p><a href="https://www.fema.gov/fact-sheet/lost-wages-assistance-approved-states" target="_blank">Every state</a> except South Dakota applied for the program and some states have been able to get the money out to unemployed people who are eligible faster than others. As of Thursday, CNBC <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/09/10/-19-states-start-paying-the-extra-300-weekly-unemployment-benefit.html" target="_blank">estimated that 20 states</a> had begun sending out payments. FEMA said on Friday that, to date,&nbsp;over $30 billion has been distributed to the 48 states.</p><p>The coronavirus pandemic brought on millions of job losses. Jobs figures have improved in recent weeks, but the nation’s <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/UNRATE" target="_blank">unemployment rate</a> was still around 8.4% in August and over 884,000 people filed new claims for state unemployment benefits for the week ending Sept. 5, according to seasonally adjusted Labor Department data released on Thursday. Nearly 30 million people claimed&nbsp;some form of unemployment benefits for the week ending Aug.&nbsp;22, the department said.&nbsp;</p><p>To help people weather the sharp downturn the virus caused across a wide range of industries, Congress in March approved legislation that provided an additional <a href="https://www.route-fifty.com/finance/2020/07/how-end-federal-unemployment-boost-will-hurt-economy/166969/">$600 a week</a> unemployment benefit to out-of-work Americans. But that benefit expired at the end of July.</p><p>Since then, Democrats and Republicans have been unable to reach agreement on a new coronavirus relief bill that might extend bolstered unemployment benefits. In the meantime, President Trump signed a <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-authorizing-needs-assistance-program-major-disaster-declarations-related-coronavirus-disease-2019/" target="_blank">directive</a> in August <a href="https://www.route-fifty.com/finance/2020/08/new-unemployment-benefits-could-take-weeks-distribute/168016/">to provide the $300 a week payment</a>.</p><p>Unemployment benefit levels vary by state. In April 2020, average standard weekly unemployment benefits were&nbsp;about $333 nationwide, but ranged from a low of $101 in Oklahoma to $531 in Massachusetts, <a href="https://www.cbpp.org/research/economy/policy-basics-unemployment-insurance" target="_blank">according to</a> the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.<svg>

September 14, 2020 | https://belkadan.com/blog/2020/09/Swift-Runtime-Type-Metadata/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://belkadan.com/blog/2020/09/Swift-Runtime-Type-Metadata/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Welcome to the third in a series of posts on the <a href="https://belkadan.com/blog/tags/swift-runtime">Swift runtime</a>. The goal is to go over the functions of the Swift runtime, using what I learned in my <a href="https://belkadan.com/blog/2020/05/ROSE-8-on-Mac-OS-9/">Swift on Mac OSÂ&nbsp;9 project</a> as a reference. This time weâ€™re going to be talking about <em>type metadata,</em> the representation of types at run time.<!--more--></p>

<p>As mentioned previously, I implemented my stripped-down runtime in Swift as much as possible, though I had to use a few undocumented Swift features to do so. Iâ€™ll be showing excerpts of my runtime code throughout these posts, and you can check out the full thing <a href="https://belkadan.com/source/ppc-swift-project/tree/refs/heads/dev:/stdlib/_Runtime">in the ppc-swift repository</a>.</p>

<h3 id="background">Background</h3>

<p>In some languages, types are purely a compile-time concept. They provide a communication channel between the developer and the compiler that allows for catching mistakes (â€œthatâ€™s a floating-point number, not a pointerâ€�), abstracting operations (â€œread from the third fieldâ€� rather than â€œread the two-byte value at offset 8â€�), and optimization (â€œthis unsigned integer will never be less than 0â€�). But many other languagesâ€”probably <em>most</em> languages these daysâ€”have at least some run-time uses of types as well, such as validating types (â€œcast this to a table viewâ€�), doing different things based on type (â€œoverride this methodâ€�), and inspecting information about a type and its instances (â€œdump the contents of this structâ€�). And some languages <em>only</em> use types in run-time ways, foregoing any compile-time use.</p>

<p>Swift is one of the in-between languages that uses types both for compile-time and run-time purposes. The most obvious run-time use of a type is when you explicitly write <code>Array&lt;Int&gt;.self</code>, but they also come up when using a generic type or function, converting a concrete value to a protocol type, or calling an overridable method on a class. Therefore, there must be information present at run time to represent a type.</p>

<h3 id="representing-types-at-run-time">Representing types at run time</h3>

<p>In Swift, types are represented by unique pointers to structured data, which can be statically or dynamically allocated. This data has a different representation based on <em>what</em> kind of type weâ€™re talking about, so if weâ€™re not sure what kind of type we have, there are only two fields we can access safely: a <strong>kind</strong> field at offset 0, and a <strong>value witness table</strong> pointer just <em>before</em> the start of the type metadata.<sup id="fnref:vwt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:vwt">1</a></sup> To get at any other information, we have to check the kind first and then cast to the appropriate type.</p>

<p>In this post, weâ€™re going to focus on struct metadata, which actually shares its layout with enum metadata. Struct metadata adds one more required field: a pointer to the <strong>type context descriptor</strong>. Whatâ€™s that? If type metadata represents a fully concrete type like <code>Array&lt;Int&gt;</code>, a type descriptor represents a type declaration like <code>Array</code>. It turns out <em>this</em> is where most of the interesting reflection information is for a type, such as its name, a description of its fields or cases, and the constraints on its generic parameters, if any. Thereâ€™s no reason to have a separate copy of this for every concrete instantiation of a generic type, so Swift stores it separately. (The type descriptor is also the key used to look up whether a type conforms to a protocol, since that has to work regardless of what generic arguments are currently being used.)</p>

<p>What <code>Array&lt;Int&gt;</code> <em>does</em> need to store is, well, <code>Int</code>â€”that is, any generic arguments, plus conformances that satisfy constraints on those generic arguments. These get stored immediately following the main struct metadata, which means the total allocation size for generic struct metatata is going to be â€œ2 pointers + 1 pointer-sized kind field + some amount of extra dataâ€�. The runtime doesnâ€™t actually have to touch these much; it just copies them in and lets individual methods of the type access them as necessary.</p>

<p>So letâ€™s start building our generic struct metadata allocation function:</p>

<pre><code>@_cdecl("swift_allocateGenericValueMetadata")
func swift_allocateGenericValueMetadata(
  _ rawDescription: TypeErasedPointer&lt;TypeContextDescriptor&gt;,
  _ arguments: UnsafePointer&lt;UnsafeRawPointer&gt;,
  _ pattern: TypeErasedPointer&lt;GenericValueMetadataPattern&gt;,
  _ extraDataSize: UInt
) -&gt; TypeErasedPointer&lt;ValueMetadata&gt; {
  let description = rawDescription.assumingMemoryBound(to: TypeContextDescriptor.self)

  let headerSize = MemoryLayout&lt;UnsafePointer&lt;ValueWitnessTable&gt;&gt;.size
  let totalSize = headerSize + MemoryLayout&lt;ValueMetadata&gt;.size + Int(extraDataSize)
  let bytes = UnsafeMutableRawPointer(NewPtr(totalSize)!)

  let rawMetadata = (bytes + headerSize)
  // Simplified for this post;
  // really we have to check whether it's a struct or an enum.
  _ = rawMetadata.bindMemory(to: StructMetadata.self, capacity: 1)

  // Hand-waving part 1 (will be explained below)
  initializeValueMetadata(
    rawMetadata.assumingMemoryBound(to: ValueMetadata.self),

  // Hand-waving part 2 (will be explained below, also applies to classes)
  installGenericArguments(
    in: rawMetadata.assumingMemoryBound(to: TypeMetadata.self),
    at: MemoryLayout&lt;ValueMetadata&gt;.size,
    description: description,
    from: arguments)

  return UnsafeRawPointer(rawMetadata)
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>swift_allocate­Generic­ValueMetadata</code> is handed a type descriptor and some generic arguments, but itâ€™s also given a <em>pattern</em> and an â€œextra data sizeâ€� value. What are those for? Well, the â€œextra data sizeâ€� represents that extra space thatâ€™s needed for generic argumentsâ€¦and for anything else thatâ€™s associated with the type. (Remember those â€œfield offsetsâ€� from the previous post?) The patternâ€™s going to be used in <code>initializeValueMetadata</code> to, well, set up the metadata, and then <code>installGenericArguments</code> copies in the generic arguments just after the fixed-size metadata. Pretty straightforward, huh?</p>

<h3 id="filling-in-the-fields">Filling in the fields</h3>

<p>Letâ€™s â€œzoom inâ€� on those helper functions, starting with <code>initializeValueMetadata</code>. This is going to have to set the kind and value witness table pointer, and I guess copy in the description pointer too.</p>

<pre><code>private func initializeValueMetadata(
  _ metadata: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;ValueMetadata&gt;,
  description: UnsafePointer&lt;TypeContextDescriptor&gt;,
  from pattern: UnsafePointer&lt;GenericValueMetadataPattern&gt;
) {
  UnsafeMutableRawPointer(metadata).storeBytes(
    of: pattern.valueWitnesses,
    toByteOffset: -MemoryLayout&lt;UnsafeRawPointer&gt;.stride,
    as: UnsafePointer&lt;ValueWitnessTable&gt;.self)
  metadata[]._.base.rawKind = pattern[]._.base._.flags.value_metadataKind
  metadata[]._.description = description

  if pattern[]._.base._.flags.hasExtraDataPattern {
    let extraData = UnsafeMutableRawPointer(metadata + 1)
    extraData.initialize(from: pattern.extraDataPattern)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Iâ€™m not going to show the full layouts of these structs this time, but you can see how ValueMetadata has a <code>base</code> field that represents the TypeMetadata part, and GenericValueMetadataPattern has a <code>base</code> field that represents a general GenericMetadataPattern, which makes this a sort of subclassing. The value witness pointer comes from the pattern rather than the type descriptor, which allows the type descriptor data to be stored in true-constant memory (by not referencing anything from other libraries). Curiously, the kind comes from the pattern as well; I would have expected it to be derived from the type descriptorâ€™s kind. (Itâ€™s not going to be exactly the same, though, because optionals are so important that they get their own metadata kind, despite being a kind of enum.)</p>

<p>The other thing this function does is copy in an â€œextra data patternâ€�, doing so just after the ValueMetadataâ€™s required fields in memory. (Thatâ€™s what the <code>UnsafeMutableRawPointer(<wbr>metadata + 1)</code> means.) This isnâ€™t going to be the generic arguments yet, since they were passed separately, but it can include literal values, or just zeroing out a bunch of that extra data for use later.</p>

<pre><code>extension UnsafeMutableRawPointer {
  func initialize(from pattern: UnsafePointer&lt;GenericMetadataPartialPattern&gt;) {
    let offsetInBytes = Int(pattern[]._.offsetInWords) &amp;* MemoryLayout&lt;UInt&gt;.size
    memset(self, 0, offsetInBytes)
    (self + offsetInBytes).copyMemory(
      from: pattern.data,
      byteCount: Int(pattern[]._.sizeInWords) &amp;* MemoryLayout&lt;UInt&gt;.size)
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This mix of C and Swift low-level memory operations is an attempt to adhere to Swiftâ€™s <a href="https://twitter.com/AirspeedSwift/status/1276565629609230336">pointer type rules</a>. Swiftâ€™s pointers donâ€™t give us a great way to zero out memory <em>without</em> giving it a type, or to copy memory thatâ€™s known to contain only values of unknown but trivial type <em>and</em> preserve those types. (<code>copyMemory</code> preserves the current type instead of overwriting it.)</p>

<p>At this point, all thatâ€™s left to do is copy in the generic arguments. This is essentially trivial:</p>

<pre><code>private func installGenericArguments(
  in metadata: UnsafeMutablePointer&lt;TypeMetadata&gt;,
  at offset: Int,
  description: UnsafePointer&lt;TypeContextDescriptor&gt;,
  from arguments: UnsafePointer&lt;UnsafeRawPointer&gt;
{
  let generics = description.fullGenericContextHeader!
  let argumentStart = UnsafeMutableRawPointer(metadata) + byteOffset
  argumentStart.initializeMemory(
    as: UnsafeRawPointer.self,
    from: arguments,
    count: generics[]._.base.totalArgumentCount)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Are you getting the hang of reading those pointer-to-structs-with-tuple-layout expressions? Then you might notice thereâ€™s one here that doesnâ€™t quite fit: <code>description</code> is a pointer, but weâ€™re accessing <code>fullGenericContextHeader</code> directly on it. What does that mean? Turns out, not too much: itâ€™s just trying to access data stored at the end of the type descriptor, and to do that it needs to compute a new pointer.</p>

<pre><code>extension UnsafePointer where Pointee == TypeContextDescriptor {
  var fullGenericContextHeader: UnsafePointer&lt;TypeGenericContextDescriptorHeader&gt; {
    let trailingObjectPtr: UnsafeRawPointer
    switch self[]._.base._.flags.kind {
    case .struct:
      trailingObjectPtr = …</code></pre></div></div>

This document provides step-by-step instructions for generating valid
PDF/A from LaTeX sources.

<nobr>(Written 2014/08/17. Revised 2016/11/13).</nobr>

</p><p>

This page is still a draft. The files and instructions below are still
subject to change, even in ways that aren't backward compatible.  If
you follow these instructions and find any mistakes, or run into
problems you cannot solve, please feel free to email me at
to <a href="mailto:selinger@mathstat.dal.ca">selinger@mathstat.dal.ca</a>.
I will do my best to improve this document and add troubleshooting
hints where necessary.

</p><div><tbody><tr><td></td><td>

Here are my step-by-step instructions for converting an existing LaTeX
document to PDF/A. These steps should work for most LaTeX documents.

<p>

To illustrate the steps, I will use my Ph.D. thesis as a running
example. I wrote my thesis in 1997, long before I had ever heard of
PDF, let alone PDF/A.

</p><center>
Initial version:
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis.tex">thesis.tex</a>,
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis.pdf">thesis.pdf</a>
<p>

</p></center>
<ol>

<a name="step1"></a><li><a name="step1"></a> <b>Prerequisites:</b> you must
  have <tt>pdflatex</tt> installed, as well as the <tt>hyperref</tt>
  and <tt>xmpincl</tt> packages. Most modern TeX distributions have
  these things preinstalled.

  <p>

  <i>Option 1:</i> If you want to generate PDF/A compliant documents
  "out of the box", you need at least pdfTeX 1.40.15, and preferably
  pdfTeX 1.40.16. As of this writing in August 2014, this version is
  not yet included in current software distributions such as Ubuntu,
  but it is available for installation from
  <a href="https://www.tug.org/texlive/acquire.html">Tex Live</a>.
  You can type <tt>pdflatex --version</tt> to determine your version.

  </p><p>

  <i>Option 2:</i> Even if you have an older version of pdfTeX (such
  as 1.40.14, which I am currently using), you can still generate
  PDF/A compliant documents if you also have access to Acrobat
  Pro. This requires two steps: first use <tt>pdflatex</tt> to
  generate an almost PDF/A compliant document, and then use Acrobat
  Pro to repair the few remaining errors.

</p></li><li> <b>Find your main source file.</b> I will
  assume, for the sake of argument, that your main LaTeX file is
  called <tt>thesis.tex</tt>. If it has a different name, adjust the
  following instructions accordingly.

</li><li> <b>Activate hyperref.</b>
  Add <tt>\usepackage{hyperref}</tt> to the preamble of your LaTeX
  source. The preamble is the part of the file
  between <tt>\documentclass</tt> and <tt>\begin{document}</tt>.  Do
  not specify any options to the hyperref package.  Then try compiling
  it with
  <pre>  pdflatex thesis.tex</pre>

  You may get some errors the first time around, but it should compile
  correctly the second time. If everything goes well, look at the
  resulting PDF file in Acrobat Reader.  (You may have to select
  "File" → "Reload" if the file was already open before). You
  should notice a few changes: cross-references (theorems, equations,
  citations, page numbers, etc.) now show up as hyperlinks, and there
  should be a sidebar of PDF bookmarks. There are also other subtle
  changes; for example, Acrobat Reader now correctly understands that
  "page 17" is actually the 30th page of my thesis.

<center>
With hyperref:
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step3.tex">thesis-step3.tex</a>,
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step3.pdf">thesis-step3.pdf</a>
<p>
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step3.png"><img src="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step3-detail.png"></a>
</p></center>
<p>

  If anything goes wrong during this step, I can't offer much help.
  Try the documentation of the hyperref package, or try googling the
  error message.

</p></li><li> <b>Set up PDF/A files.</b> Make sure that you
have at least version 1.5.8 of the pdfx package. This is probably
preinstalled if your TeX distribution is from 2016 or newer. Please
note that older versions of the pdfx package are buggy and do not
work. If you don't have at least version 1.5.8, get it from CTAN:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://www.ctan.org/pkg/pdfx">The pdfx package at CTAN</a>.
  </li></ul>
<p>  

  Copy the following file to the directory where your LaTeX sources
  are (your "source directory"). It may be helpful to right-click on
  the link and select "Save Link As".
  </p><ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/sample.xmpdata">sample.xmpdata</a>
  </li></ul>

</li><li> <b>Rename sample.xmpdata.</b> Rename
  the <tt>sample.xmpdata</tt> file as <tt>thesis.xmpdata</tt>, of
  course using the actual base name of your LaTeX source file instead
  of <tt>thesis</tt>.

</li><li> <b>Activate pdfx.</b>
  Add <tt>\usepackage[a-1b]{pdfx}</tt> to the preamble of your LaTeX
  source. Note that you must put this <i>before</i>
  the <tt>\usepackage{hyperref}</tt>.Then try compiling it with
  <pre>  pdflatex thesis.tex</pre>

<p>

  In this step, I received one error, because my document defined the
  macro <tt>\B</tt>, which was internally used by the pdfx package. I
  changed <tt>\newcommand{\B}{B}</tt> to <tt>\renewcommand{\B}{B}</tt>
  and this fixed the problem.
  
</p><p>
  
  Assuming there are no further errors, open the resulting PDF file in
  Acrobat Reader. (You may have to select "File" → "Reload" if
  the file was already open before). Acrobat Reader should now show a
  blue header announcing that "You are viewing this document in PDF/A
  mode." This does not yet mean that your file has been validated to
  be valid PDF/A. It only means that the file claims to be PDF/A.

</p><center>
With pdfx:
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step6.tex">thesis-step6.tex</a>,
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step6.xmpdata">thesis-step6.xmpdata</a>,
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step6.pdf">thesis-step6.pdf</a>
<p>
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step6.png"><img src="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step6-detail.png"></a>
</p></center>
</li><li> <b>Check for Unicode mapping.</b>  At this
  point, you should be able to copy and paste some text from your
  PDF/A file and get reasonable output. Try copying and pasting some
  math formulas, text containing ligatures, etc. Of course, one cannot
  expect every complex math formula to be converted to sensible
  Unicode; however, you should see a marked improvement in simple
  mathematical symbols, Greek letters, and so on.

  <p>

  For example, copying and pasting the beginning of the Proof of
  Proposition 2.22 from page 27

</p><center><p>
<img src="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step7-detail.png">
</p></center>
<p>


  gives the following result:

  </p><center><div>
<pre>
   Proof. 1. ⇒ 3.: Let A be weakly extensional and A |= A = B. Assume FV (A,B) ⊆ ¯x.
   By weak extensionality, A |= λ∗¯x.A = λ∗¯x.B. This is a closed equation, hence
   A |=abs λ∗¯x.A = λ∗¯x.B, and finally A |=abs A = B by Lemma 2.15.
</pre>

  </div></center>
  </li><li> <b>Check for metadata.</b> In Acrobat Reader,
  go to "File" → "Properties". You should see a sample title,
  sample author, sample subject, and sample keywords.

<center>
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step8.png"><img src="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step8-detail.png"></a>
</center>
<p>

  If you have Acrobat Pro, you can also click on "Additional
  Metadata", and you should also see a sample copyright notice.

</p><center><p>
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step8b.png"><img src="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step8b-detail.png"></a>
</p></center>
</li><li> <b>Edit the metadata.</b> Now you should edit
  the file <tt>thesis.xmpdata</tt> to create the metadata that is
  appropriate for your document. You can delete any entry (such
  as <tt>\Keywords</tt> or <tt>\Subject</tt>) that you do not need,
  and edit the remaining ones to suit your purpose. You can use UTF-8
  encoded Unicode in this file, in case you would like to include any
  foreign letters, math formulas, etc. See <a href="#5"><nobr>Section
  5,</nobr></a> "Metadata format", for more details on what you can
  put here.

  <p>

  Then recompile your document, reopen the file in Acrobat, and check
  that your metadata shows up correctly. (Don't forget "File" →
  "Reload" in case the file is still open from before).

</p><center>
With metadata:
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step9.tex">thesis-step9.tex</a>,
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step9.xmpdata">thesis-step9.xmpdata</a>,
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step9.pdf">thesis-step9.pdf</a>
<p>
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step9.png"><img src="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step9-detail.png"></a>
</p></center>
</li><li> <b>Fix the PDF bookmarks.</b> When you open
  your document in Acrobat Reader or Acrobat Pro, you should see a
  bookmarks sidebar. It should roughly correspond to the table of
  contents of your document. Check all of the entries. If any of the
  entries contain math formulas, they will probably look
  messed-up. For example, my thesis contains a section called "<i>A
  class of finite models to distinguish the terms </i>Ω<i><sub>n</sub></i>",
  but it may show up in the PDF bookmarks as "<i>A class of finite models
  to distinguish the terms n</i>". Also, instead of
  "<i>D<sub>∞</sub>-models</i>" we may see "<i>D-models</i>".

<center><p>
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step10.png"><img src="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step10-detail.png"></a>
</p></center>
<p>

  More complicated math formulas, particularly those
  involving <tt>\boldmath</tt> or similar commands, can lead to
  even-stranger-looking garbage characters in the bookmarks.  There
  are two options for fixing this:

  </p><h4>Option 1: Using plain ASCII.</h4>

  We will specify an alternate plain ASCII version of each math
  formula in a section title, using the
  command <tt>\texorpdfstring</tt>. For example, replace

  <pre>  \section{A class of finite models to distinguish the terms $\Omega_n$}</pre>

  by

  <pre>  \section{A class of finite models to distinguish the terms \texorpdfstring{$\Omega_n$}{Omega\_n}}</pre>

  The <tt>\texorpdfstring</tt> command is very simple. It takes two
  arguments. The first one is what will be typeset in the document,
  and the second one is the ASCII equivalent that will go into the
  bookmarks section. Note that the ASCII you can use here is very
  basic: for example, you can't specify superscripts or subscripts,
  and if you want to use an underscore "<tt>_</tt>", you have to
  escape it as "<tt>\_</tt>". Some other symbols, such as
  "<tt>^</tt>", can't be used at all.

  <p>

  Note that you have to run <tt>pdflatex</tt> at least twice for any
  changes to take effect. Here is what the output looks like:

</p><center>
ASCII bookmarks:
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step10a.tex">thesis-step10a.tex</a>,
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step10a.xmpdata">thesis-step10a.xmpdata</a>,
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step10a.pdf">thesis-step10a.pdf</a>
<p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step10a.png"><img src="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step10a-detail.png"></a>
</p></p></center>
<h4>Option 2: Using Unicode.</h4>

  To use Unicode characters in the PDF bookmarks, place the following
  four commands in your LaTeX preamble:
  <pre>  \usepackage{inputenc}
  \hypersetup{pdfencoding=unicode}
  \inputencoding{utf8}
  \makeatother</pre>
  Note that this will change the input encoding of your LaTeX source
  to UTF-8. It will also allow you to use Unicode characters in
  the second argument of <tt>\texorpdfstring</tt>. For example:
  <pre>  \section{A class of finite models to distinguish the terms \texorpdfstring{$\Omega_n$}{Ωₙ}}</pre>

  The result looks rather nice:

<center>
Unicode bookmarks:
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step10b.tex">thesis-step10b.tex</a>,
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step10b.xmpdata">thesis-step10b.xmpdata</a>,
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step10b.pdf">thesis-step10b.pdf</a>
<p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step10b.png"><img src="https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/pdfa/thesis-step10b-detail.png"></a>
</p></p></center>
<p>

  Of course, here I have presupposed that you know how to enter
  Unicode characters in the editor that you use to write your LaTeX
  file. I usually do this by copying and pasting the character from
  some website. For example, if you google
  <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=unicode+subscript+n">"Unicode
  subscript n"</a>, you'll find a
  <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2099/browsertest.htm">browser
  test page</a> for that character, from which you can then copy and
  paste.

  </p><p>

  If you don't want to enter actual Unicode characters in your LaTeX
  file, TeX also offers a way to escape them. This requires you to
  look up the UTF-8 encoding of each character, which you can
  <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2099/index.htm">also
  find via Google</a> (scroll down to "UTF-8 (hex)"). For example, the
  UTF-8 encoding of "Omega" is <tt>0xCE 0xA9</tt>, and the UTF-8
  encoding of "subscript n" is <tt>0xE2 0x82 0x99</tt>. You can then
  enter the characters in your LaTeX file like this:

  </p><pre>  \section{A class of finite models to distinguish the terms \texorpdfstring{$\Omega_n$}{^^ce^^a9^^e2^^82^^99}}</pre>

PineBook Pro and Levinboot again</h2>

<p>Crystalgamma released Levinboot 0.7.2&nbsp;yesterday so I&nbsp;decided to update, and
try to make my Pinbook Pro boot times even faster. With his help I&nbsp;found that
I&nbsp;accidentally disabled optimizations in my build and that was the reason for
4s decompression times for my kernel/initrd payload, and some stack overflows in
levinboot's&nbsp;decompression&nbsp;code.</p>

<p>Unoptimized code turns out to be really slow. What a surprise.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;switched to lz4, enabled -O3, and now levinboot decompression and load
times changed from 4s to 600ms. Significantly better!&nbsp;:)</p>

<p>With the latest levinboot my Pinebook Pro Arch Linux setup lets me to enter
LUKS password in 4s since I&nbsp;start pressing the power button:</p>

Putting 13&nbsp;PinePhone distributions on a 8GiB uSD&nbsp;card</h2>

<p>This is a summary of how I&nbsp;was able to make a <a href="https://xnux.eu/p-boot-demo">5&nbsp;GiB
multi-boot 13-distro image</a>, that easily fits on a 8GiB SD card, and can be
used to test-drive most of the OSes that are available for Pinephone&nbsp;today.</p>

<p><img src="https://xnux.eu/log/images/menu2.webp"></p>

<h3 id="toc-starting-with-a-32gib-image-and-an-old-school-approach">Starting
with a 32GiB image and an old-school approach</h3>

<p>At first I&nbsp;did the obvious, and started with traditional partitioning.
I&nbsp;created 10&nbsp;partitions on a 32GiB SD card, and was barely able to fit
9&nbsp;Linux distributions into that image. Each paritition needed its own
filesystem and some free space to allow for proper operation of the OS. It was
also hard to mange. Each time I&nbsp;needed to change anything, I&nbsp;had to figure out
which partition held which OS, mount it, fix things and unmount&nbsp;again.</p>

<p>It was not good.</p>

<h3 id="toc-swithching-filesystems-and-sharing-free-space">Swithching
filesystems and sharing free space</h3>

<p>The breakthroug came with a realization that I&nbsp;can mount subvolume in btrfs
as if it was a filesystem in its own right. This allowed me to have just a
single partition with a btrfs filesystem on the SD card, and have each
distribution contained in its own subvolume. This way, all distributions could
share from the same pool of free space for the data. There was no longer any
need to plan partition sizes for each distro. This was the first major&nbsp;win.</p>

<p>Subvolumes are also much easier to manage than partitions. Need a new
subvolume? Just create one and copy some files to it. Don't need the subvolume
anymore? Just delete&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Subvolumes appear as normal directories in the filesystem when the root
subvolume is mounted, so one mount operation is all that's&nbsp;needed to have
access to files of all included Linux distributions.</p>

<p>I&nbsp;also used another feature of subvolumes to debug startup issues in some
distributions. Snapshotting. It's&nbsp;possible to create a snapshot of a current
state of any of the distributions indivudally, and restore it in the future.
Ubuntu Touch gave me a headscratch, when it didn't boot during the first boot,
but it did on the second one. So I&nbsp;made a snapshot of the initial state of the
filesystem, and kept comming back to it and tweaking it until I&nbsp;found the
reason. (One of the boot scripts checked for the presence of a file named
<code>userdata/.writable_image</code> and if it was missing it tried to reboot
the system and failed, crashing the lightdm process.)</p>

<p>In fact, the latest multi-boot image keeps the initial state of all included
distributions in a snapshot, so it's&nbsp;possible to selectively restore state of
any of the distributions to the original.</p>

<h3 id="toc-compression">Compression</h3>

<p>Looking at btrfs, I&nbsp;found that it supports transparent compression for the
stored files. Enabling zstd compression and decompressing rootfs tarballs of
9&nbsp;distributions resulted in a filesystem that used 5.8&nbsp;GiB of space with a
compression ratio of 50%. This was exciting, because it looked like having a
8&nbsp;GiB SD card image will be possible.</p>

<p>Using compression is also good for antoher reason. SD card access in
Pinephone is limited to 24MiB/s&nbsp;max. At this speed, 4&nbsp;core Cortex-A53 CPU can
easily keep up, and this makes the loading of data from the SD card faster.</p>

<h3 id="toc-some-interesting-features-of-cow-filesystems">Some interesting
features of COW filesystems</h3>

<p>So far the optimization steps were fairly trivial. Just enabling features of
existing filesystem and using them in a smart&nbsp;way.</p>

<p>Getting from 5.8GiB image with 9&nbsp;Linux distributions to a 5&nbsp;GiB image with
13&nbsp;Linux distributions was harder. It was likely that those distributions have
a lot of files in common. I&nbsp;made a simple test, and found that there's&nbsp;a space
for further savings in the range of 12–13% if I&nbsp;could make the filesystem
share data for duplicate files among the distributions.</p>

<p>COW filesystems, like btrfs, can sometimes allow to share file data among
multiple files without resorting to hardlinking. In fact, there's&nbsp;now a generic
<a href="https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/ioctl_ficlonerange.2.html">VFS-level
Linux API</a> to make a filesystem share file data between files if it supports
this feature.</p>

<p>Side note: Hardlinking would not be a great solution for reducing file data
duplication in the image anyway, because it would have meant that if user
changed a file in Ubuntu Touch, the change might be visible in other distros
that may share that&nbsp;file.</p>

<p>The next hurdle was figuring out how to effectively use this API in my
specific scenario. There are tools that allow scanning the existing filesystem,
search for duplicities and use this API to remove them. Then it would be
possible to scrub the filesystem, discard empty space, and compress the
resulting block device image for easy re-distribution. I&nbsp;checked a bunch of
those tools, and they seemed exceedingly complicated, or buggy when used on
btrfs subvolumes.</p>

<p>Instead I&nbsp;decided to write a <a href="https://megous.com/git/pinephone-multi-boot/tree/tools/main.c">extraction
tool</a> using libarchive that takes multiple tarballs on the input (one per
Linux distribution) and decompresses them while keeping track of content of
already extracted files and using the above mentioned FICLONE API to share data
whenver it finds file that was already extracted before. It does deduplication
on the fly, so there's&nbsp;no need to apply any further cleanup steps to the
filesystem afterwards. This approach to deduplication is also very fast and
efficient, because there's&nbsp;no extra IO necessary.</p>

<p>At this point I&nbsp;tried to add 4&nbsp;more Linux distributions to the image.
I&nbsp;did this just to stress test the new extraction tool. In particular, I&nbsp;added
several variants of postmarket OS, which were bound to have a lot of the files
in common.</p>

<p>The resulting image had the same size as the previously made 9&nbsp;distribution
variant.</p>

<h3 id="toc-final-space-savings">Final space savings</h3>

<p>The final opportunity for size optimization was a cheap one. Remove files
that are not used/needed. I&nbsp;didn't want to tweak the distributions too much, so
that they are as close to their official state as possible. I&nbsp;had to make one
change, though. I&nbsp;was not able to use distributions' own official kernels,
because neither had a driver for btrfs built in. I&nbsp;also was not very fond of
supporting outdated EOLed kernels many of the distributions use, or re-building
them. So I&nbsp;used my own kernel and made all the distributions share&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>Due to this I&nbsp;was able to remove the modules, firmware, and kernels that
distributions package themselves. With 13&nbsp;distributions this led to another
0.8GiB of saved&nbsp;space.</p>

<p>The result is a <a href="https://xnux.eu/p-boot-demo/">5&nbsp;GiB 13-distro
image</a>, that easily fits on a 8GiB SD card, and can be used to test-drive
most of the OSes <a href="https://wiki.pine64.org/index.php?title=PinePhone_Software_Releases">that
are available for Pinephone</a>&nbsp;today.</p>

<p>The image also serves as a demo of the <a href="https://xnux.eu/p-boot/">GUI
bootloader</a> I&nbsp;wrote for Pinephone.</p>

<h2 id="toc-2020-09-11-adding-postmarket-os-to-multi-distro-image">2020–09–11:
Adding postmarket OS to multi-distro image</h2>

<p>So I&nbsp;finally tried the <code>pmbootstrap</code> tool to create a bunch of
rootfs tarballs for several postmarket OS UI variants: GNOME, Phosh, Plasma
Mobile, fbkeyboard.</p>

<p>I've added them all to my multi-distro image without any increase in size
since the previous public build of the image. So now it's&nbsp;a 13&nbsp;distro
multi-boot image with pretty much every major and a bunch of minor PinePhone
supporting distributions, and it still fits on a 8GiB SD&nbsp;card!</p>

<h2 id="toc-2020-09-11-ways-to-help-improve-pinephone-kernel">2020–09–11:
Ways to help improve Pinephone kernel</h2>

<p>There are a bunch of open questions about Pinephone's&nbsp;HW. When answered,
these could help improve the kernel behavior. Here's&nbsp;one of&nbsp;them.</p>

<h3 id="toc-minimal-display-brightness-is-too-bright">Minimal display brightness
is too bright</h3>

<p>This gets asked quite a bit, but just maybe 2&nbsp;people helped do anything
about it, so here's&nbsp;a more detailed guide on how to&nbsp;help.</p>

<p>Sadly fixing this issue requires gathering a lot more samples than 2,
regardless of whether your Pinephone has the problem or doesn't. Trouble is that
if only people who have this issue do the following test, the results will be
useless. Even people who's&nbsp;backlight seems to work correctly need to take part.
So it's&nbsp;a hard problem to solve.&nbsp;:)</p>

<p>If enough people report at what brightness level the backlight turns on on
their Pinephone, we could improve the default minimum brighness level, so that
most users can reduce their Pinephone screen brightness to lower levels.</p>

<p>There's&nbsp;an open question on how to set the backlight brightness values on
post 1.0&nbsp;revision phones, since lower PWM duty cycles lead to backlight being
basically off. It would be nice if more people can test the various backlight
levels on 1.1&nbsp;and 1.2&nbsp;revision with this change in dts in the
backlight&nbsp;node:</p>

<pre><span>/</span><span>backlight</span> <span>{</span>
        brightness-levels <span>= &lt;</span><span>0 1000</span><span>&gt;;</span>
        num-interpolated-steps <span>= &lt;</span><span>1000</span><span>&gt;;</span>
<span>};</span>
</pre>

<p>The above change can be made by <code>fdtput</code>, which is part of
<code>dtc</code> package:</p>

<pre>fdtput <span>-t</span> u your.dtb <span>/</span>backlight brightness<span>-levels</span> <span>0 1000</span>
fdtput <span>-t</span> u your.dtb <span>/</span>backlight num<span>-interpolated-steps</span> <span>1000</span></pre></article></div>

The first, is exceptionally beautiful. The GTO is 60’s car design at it’s very best. However, the second thing is, it’s expensive. The cars are so rare and have so much value, that in 2018, it broke the record for the most expensive car ever sold; when David MacNeil paid $70,000,000 for a 1963 car. With only 39 250 GTOs left in existence, it is understandable why they are of so much value. But soon, we could see a flurry of replica 250’s and kit cars hitting the market. So what’s changed now?</p>
<h5><u>Court Battle</u></h5>
<p>Ferrari had the design of the iconic 250 trademarked, so that no one could produce anything that could, potentially, devalue such an iconic car. However, a bespoke car manufacturer, also based in Modena, called Ares Design, took<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ferrari/" title="Ferrari"> Ferrari</a> to the Cancellation division of the EU’s Intellectual Property Office. They put forward the argument that<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ferrari/" title="Ferrari"> Ferrari</a> had not put the contested trademark to genuine use for a period of 5 years straight. They argued that the trademark, filed in 2008, was filed in bad faith, and as a defensive mark to block kit cars of the GTO hitting the market; similar to what we see with the AC Cobra and the many modern versions of the Lotus Seven.</p>

<p>In Article 58(1)(a) EUTMR, an EU trademark can be revoked if not used genuinely within a period of 5 years.<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ferrari/" title="Ferrari"> Ferrari</a> had not used it, and considering that they had filed a trademark in 2007 for a design that hadn’t been used in over 50 years, it didn’t appear<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ferrari/" title="Ferrari"> Ferrari</a> would use it.<br>
<u><br>
The Outcome</u></p>
<p>In short,<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ares-design/" title="Ares Design"> Ares Design</a> won. The trademark has been revoked in the context of proper cars.<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ferrari/" title="Ferrari"> Ferrari</a> still hold a trademark for scale models of the GTO. The EU ruling is certainly an interesting one, given that 2 years ago, there was a similar lawsuit between the same two companies. It was heard by a court in Bologna, which declared the GTO a work of art that could not be imitated or reproduced.</p>

<p>This leaves us in an interesting place. Whilst the GTO is a timeless classic, perhaps the ultimate classic car, I hate the idea of shoddy replicas being made that don’t do the real car justice. However, companies such as<a href="https://enzari.com/category/manufacturers/ares-design/" title="Ares Design"> Ares Design</a> clearly would make quality replicas, based off the stunning work that they do already. While many may disagree, I do think that there’s a place for high quality 1:1 replicas, especially in motorsport. These days, barely any 250s are seen on track, as they’re too valuable. A replica would look and sound the same, but not have as much value. This would give us an insight into the incredible GTO in its natural habitat, that we just don’t get to see in the modern day.</p>

<![CDATA[Importance of School Zone on Property Values]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
<p>I remember shopping for my first house with my wife and ignoring the school zones and their ratings.  We were solely concentrating on price, square footage, location and appearance.  </p>



<p>While these are all important considerations to take when buying a house, the quality of the schools should have been a big part of it as well.  We didn’t really realize this until it was a bit too late and we had already made a purchase in a bad school district. </p>



<h2>Why would you even ignore school districts?</h2>



<p>Those of you that are new to real estate may wonder why we would ignore it at all.  The reason is simple, price!  It is not uncommon in my city to see a 20% price difference in identical houses in the same general area <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.realtor.com/advice/buy/the-right-school-district-how-much-do-schools-affect-real-estate-prices/" target="_blank">based on the school district</a>.</p>



<p>The school district a house is in can be the difference between the house costing $400,000 and $500,000.  It is easy to say “I am not paying $100,000 extra for the same house in a different school district”.</p>



<p>This seems like the reasonable thing to do but it is a false economy.  Your house will become one of your most valuable <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/2020/05/22/assets-explained/">assets</a> so you owe it to yourself to do a bit more research.  </p>



<h2>How Much Does That Savings Really Cost Me?</h2>



<p>I never asked myself this question until my oldest child was getting close to school age.  Then I sat down and did the math.</p>



<h4>Private School Tuition</h4>



<p>If you plan on having children then I would suggest calling a few of the local private schools and inquiring about their tuition.  In my case private school tuition was around $15,000 per year for each kid!  To make matters worse tuition was rising at rates over 5% a year.</p>



<p>I did some <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/time-value-of-money/">time value of money</a> calculations on the tuition costs for my two children and 13 years of K-12 private school education for each.  Not accounting for the inflation of prices, each child was going to cost me $195,000 apiece in tuition.  With 5% growth the actual number was <em>over $265,000 for each child</em> through high school!</p>



<p><em>That $100,000 savings on the purchase price of the house was going to cost me over half a million dollars over 13 years.</em></p>



<p>This money would be far better utilized by <a href="https://www.dollartrak.com/college-529-savings-goal/">investing in a 529 plan</a> and using it to pay for a great college education.</p>



<h4>Education is always in demand</h4>



<p>We decided that the poor schools in my area were a cost we were not willing to bear.  We decided to change houses.  </p>



<p>Of course this comes with the huge expense of selling a house where you can lose up to 10% of your house value in fees, expenses, commissions, and closing costs.  This cost around $40,000 in our case.  </p>



<p>On top of that, we found out the hard way that houses in poor school districts are harder to sell while good school district homes can be somewhat recession proof.  In a cool market it took us longer and cost more discounts to unload our old house than expected.  At the same time we had to get into bidding wars on houses in top school districts.</p>



<h4>You can’t sell a diploma but you can sell a house</h4>



<p>When your kids graduate from high school you can always sell the house to get your money back.  Many people want to downsize by this point in their life anyhow.  Since education will still be in demand, you can always sell the house to recoup the extra money you spent.</p>



<p>As the population in our area grew but the number of quality schools stayed the same there was evidence that appreciation of home values were actually higher in good school district areas.  This is likely very local market oriented so you will need to do your own research here.</p>



<h4>What if I don’t and won’t have kids</h4>



<p>I would still consider it even if you don’t plan on needing schools.  Demand was more stable and appreciation rates higher in my area which made it a good financial decision for me even without the private school tuition savings.  </p>



<p>It has been my experience that when people buy into an area based on the quality of schools, parks, etc, they tend to be very motivated to maintain and improve the community.  This just means a better place to hang your hat.</p>



<h4>What if we want to do private school anyhow</h4>



<p>Many people will want to send their kids to private school regardless of the quality of public schools in their area.  What I found was that quality public schools in the area help control the price of private schools in the area.</p>



<p>In a community with bad public schools, private schools can charge whatever they want and people will pay it.  In a community with good public options, private schools have some limitations over what they can get away with.  </p>



<p>It is probably a good idea to do some basic research and check the tuition rates of some private school options.  For my situation they were significantly cheaper in the area with great public schools.</p>



<h4>What about risks to my investment</h4>



<p>Buying in a great school district is not totally risk free.  The schools could devolve in your district and change from an asset to a liability.  I personally don’t see this as a major risk though, as I mentioned earlier the people that buy there are invested in maintaining the community and schools.  If anything, I think the risk of the community falling apart while you live there is lower.</p>



<p>The other way you can be impacted is if you are re-zoned into a different district.  This can be a real risk if you have areas with poor schools adjacent to areas with good schools.  You can get rezoned into a poor school district.  Research how often the schools in the area redistrict.  Moving very close to the school itself can help reduce the risk you are rezoned.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>I wish I had known then what I know now.  I could have saved myself a lot of hassle and tens of thousands of dollars.  While it may seem like a steep price to pay to get into a good school district, it is often worth it.  </p>



<p>If you don’t ever end up having kids you should at least break even on the purchase difference.  </p>



<p>If you do have kids it will probably save you hundreds of thousands of dollars over the course of their education as well as give you better and easier sales options when you decide to move on. </p>

<p><span>I became fascinated with guilds when I moved to Germany. Being an avid reader of all medieval history I could get my hands on, I was well aware of the <em>Hansa</em> (slang for Hanseatic) League’s rise in the 1100s in northern Europe – mainly Germany. The word&nbsp;<em>Hansa</em> is Low German for “convoy” – thus, this league of towns and merchant houses was a consolidated group of merchants and businessmen who strove to create their own answer to feudal Europe. The members of the League had their own legal system, their own armies, and had direct allegiance to the Holy Roman Emperor. Landed Barons and Earls did not stand a chance.</span></p>
<p><span>The rise of these independent towns and merchants also gave rise to the guild system. Where the Hansa League was a merchant’s guild, craft guilds began in a like manner around the same time period. The craft guilds were a system to protect knowledge that heretofore had been handed down by father to son, or nephew, or random laborer. Prior to the rise of larger towns and cities, just after the Dark Ages, it was difficult to form a “convoy” of skilled craftsmen because there was no system or codification of work. As towns grew, and more independent towns grew, the need for a steady flow of crafts began. Thus, craft guilds provided the goods and merchants fed the need: the beginning of real capitalism.</span></p>
<p><span>Both types of guilds, Merchants and Craftsmen provided a variety of important functions, very similar: “They established a monopoly of trade in their locality or within <img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="3938" data-permalink="https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2018/01/10/apprentice-journeyman-and-master-the-medieval-guild/guilds1/" data-orig-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg" data-orig-size="962,1500" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;NX530\/NX635\/BX535\/SX535&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;1&quot;}" data-image-title="guilds1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=192" data-large-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=639" src="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=271&amp;h=422" alt="guilds1" width="271" height="422" srcset="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=271&amp;h=422 271w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=542&amp;h=844 542w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=96&amp;h=150 96w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds1.jpg?w=192&amp;h=300 192w" sizes="(max-width: 271px) 100vw, 271px">a particular branch of industry or commerce; they set and maintained standards for the quality of goods and the&nbsp;<a id="___id15" href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/integrity">integrity</a>&nbsp;of trading practices in that industry; they worked to maintain stable prices for their goods and commodities; and they sought to control town or city governments in order to further the interests of the guild members and achieve their economic objectives.” <em>(Encyclopedia Britannica)&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>The craft guilds are of interest to Freemasons and those interested in Freemasonry because they have like terms. The use of the terms of Apprentice, Journeyman, and Master is well known, with slight variation, to Freemasons as well as to any member of a guild in the middle ages in Europe. These were the common terms to designate the proficiency of a laborer.&nbsp;Guilds in Medieval Europe employed the apprenticeship system of hierarchy, which has its origins in the Roman Empire and possibly Mesopotamia.&nbsp; From young ages, boys (and in some cases women, depending on the profession) were brought in to learn the craft, ensuring that an adequate number of skilled craftsmen were able to supply the growing towns with goods and services of equal and competitive quality. Standardization and quality were the driving force behind a steady stream of apprentices bonded to masters, and journeymen sent out to learn their craft.</span></p>
<p><span>The Apprentice was one who “apprehends” or takes hold of learning. One might also say it is one who is taken hold of, as he is bound to a Master to learn his trade. The term Apprentice does come from the Latin root of “apprehend,” and it does indicate in the <img data-attachment-id="3935" data-permalink="https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2018/01/10/apprentice-journeyman-and-master-the-medieval-guild/guilds4/" data-orig-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg" data-orig-size="307,321" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="guilds4" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=287" data-large-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=307" src="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=639" alt="guilds4" srcset="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg 307w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=143 143w, https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds4-e1515625355297.jpg?w=287 287w" sizes="(max-width: 307px) 100vw, 307px">most basic terms “someone learning.” An Apprentice was one who learned for a specified amount of time, learning specific skills and techniques of both hand and mind. He was, however, not allowed to be an official member of the guild until he had satisfied the requirements set out by the guild and even more importantly, by his Master.</span></p>
<p><span>The word Journeyman has a more interesting etymology. A Journeyman is someone who does work for “another.” That is, he is an Apprentice who has been sent out into the world to work, generally for other Masters or shops. An original meaning of the word “journey” was “a day” and a Journeyman was someone who performed work for a day and then moved on, as it were. The Journeyman was no longer bonded to a single Master and could choose the work they wished to do. The Journeyman’s former Master, however, still guaranteed the Journeyman’s character and abilities. Shame on the Journeyman meant shame to the Master, and to the guild in which the Journeyman had become a member. Perfection in work and bearing meant the same perfection to the associated Master and Guild.</span></p>
<p><span>Master is an even more interesting term as used in the same time period (mid-16th Century) as these other two definitions. At this time, the term Master meant “one who controls or has authority.” It also meant “one who subjugates.” This means that a Master has perfected and honed his skills to the point of being competent in all areas of his craft, under all variety of conditions, with a variety of materials. A guild member might go their whole life being a Journeyman; Master’s were few and far between. A Master, then, is partially self-determined and partially a bestowed title.&nbsp;“A journeyman who could provide proof of his technical competence (the “masterpiece”) might rise in the guild to the status of a master, whereupon he could set up his own workshop and hire and train apprentices. The masters in any particular craft guild tended to be a select inner circle<em><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="3936" data-permalink="https://blog.philosophicalsociety.org/2018/01/10/apprentice-journeyman-and-master-the-medieval-guild/guilds3/" data-orig-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds3.gif" data-orig-size="447,434" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="guilds3" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds3.gif?w=300" data-large-file="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds3.gif?w=447" src="https://philosophicalsocietyblog.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/guilds3.gif?w=221&amp;h=214" alt="guilds3" width="221" height="214"></em> who possessed not only technical competence but also proof of their wealth and social position.”&nbsp;<em>(Encyclopedia Britannica)&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span>The interesting thing is that the main function of the guild was not to produce goods or fix techniques ‘per se’ – those were supporting roles to the main function of the guild. The guild existed to serve a singular purpose:&nbsp;to train Apprentices. Bringing in and bonding Apprentices ensured a continuity of quality workmanship, consistent goods being produced, and traditions being maintained. Thus, the role of the Guild was not to form rules, mores, regulations, and laws with respect to their crafts; their role was to introduce a system of art or craft to a new individual, to instill in them the idea of standards, quality, consistency, and perfection. Their goal was to expand their horizons and technical knowledge in a specific area so they might provide for their towns as well as their families. Guilds and guild members served the community as much as they served themselves.</span></p>

                    <h2 id="what-is-it">What is it?</h2>
<p>A wealth tax is slightly different from other taxes we are used to. We’re familiar with income taxes and sales taxes - the government takes a part of the transaction value, whether that’s your income or the cost of a sale. Value added taxes are slightly more complicated, but are still well understood generally.</p>
<p>A wealth tax works this way. A person pays a part of their wealth every year to the government. Take an example of a person worth $110 million being assessed by <a href="https://elizabethwarren.com/plans/ultra-millionaire-tax">Senator Elizabeth Warren’s wealth tax</a>, which would take 2% of all wealth above $50 million. Such a person would pay 2% of ($110m - $50m). That’s a $120k. Not that much, some might say. In fact, that’s exactly what Senator Warren says. She claims it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onWi_DsbR_0">“just two cents!"</a> on every dollar.</p>
<p>But the wealth tax is assessed every year, so this effect compounds. Our hypothetical millionaire is now worth a mere $108.8m, assuming that she used all the return from her investments to live a comfortable lifestyle. Next year she’ll pay 2% of $58.8m - $117.2k. And on and on. Supposing she lives 60 years more, spending all the growth of her investments, her $110m would become $68.2m. After 100 years, it would be $57.9m. No matter how long she lives, her wealth will never drop below $50 million due to this wealth tax, a drop of 54%.

<h2 id="paul-grahams-argument">Paul Graham’s argument</h2>
<p>I can understand why the super rich would want to fight the wealth tax, there’s nothing surprising about it. What’s interesting to see is <em>how</em> they do so.</p>
<p>Paul Graham is a venture capitalist with considerable success in his past. He is a partner at VC firm Ycombinator, which has funded several early stage startups that went on to great heights. It’s <a href="https://www.ycombinator.com/topcompanies/">top alumni</a> include Airbnb, Dropbox and Stripe - a list that speaks for itself. He is certainly successful enough that the wealth tax would have a considerable effect on his net worth.</p>
<p>Paul is also a prolific writer. Some of his posts are some of the most insightful, interesting and eye-opening on the subject. Period. My two favourites are probably these two articles on <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/submarine.html">public relations</a> and <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/talk.html">writing techniques</a>.</p>
<p>If there’s anyone who can argue well against a wealth tax, it’s Paul Graham. And that’s what he attempted here - <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/wtax.html">Modelling a Wealth Tax</a>. He starts his explanation of the wealth tax with:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>If the wealth tax applies to all your assets</strong>, it’s easy to calculate its effect. A wealth tax of 1% means you get to keep 99% of your stock each year.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is absurd. No one is proposing a tax that would apply to all your assets. This assumption actually muddies the waters, making people believe that they could lose a massive portion of their wealth, regardless of how wealthy they are. If you told the average Joe that they could potentially lose 2/3rds of their total wealth to taxation, they’d be terrified.</p>
<p>Later, he explains with an example - a “successful” startup founder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Suppose your stock is initially worth $2 million, and the company’s trajectory is as follows: the value of your stock grows 3x for 2 years, then 2x for 2 years, then 50% for 2 years, after which you just get a typical public company growth rate, which we’ll call 8%.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Within the space of 6 years, this founder has turned stock worth $2 million into $162 million, continuing to grow at 8% annually. Remarkable. PG implies this is a typical founder’s trajectory. He also doesn’t mention the $162 million number, preferring to say only that the founder started with $2 million (like an average Joe).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A 2% wealth tax with a $50 million threshold takes about two thirds of a successful founder’s stock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Did you notice the sleight of hand? PG talks about taking the founder’s <em>stock</em> rather than <em>wealth</em>. He does that because it allows him to make that specific claim - that 2/3rds of the <em>stock</em> goes to the government. But let’s measure wealth instead, because the value of that stock appreciates with time. He himself mentions growth of 8% - let’s plot wealth according to his starting conditions and assumptions.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.nindalf.com/images/wealth-noexpenses.svg" alt="Wealth increase over 60 years with no expenses"></p>
<p>Whether or not there is a wealth tax, <em>the founder still ends up with billions of dollars in wealth either way.</em> Certainly she might pay hundreds of millions in wealth tax, but it’s still a fantastic outcome.</p>
<p>Let’s make just one assumption - inflation for the next 60 years will be 3%. That allows us to calculate the value in today’s dollars.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>Wealth after 60 years</th>
<th>Wealth after 60 years (in 2020 dollars)</th>

<tbody>

<td>$5.04B</td>
<td>$881M</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Without 2% wealth tax</td>
<td>$15.18B</td>
<td>$2.65B</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>We can also account for living expenses. Assuming that the founder spends $5 million every year on living expenses, they’re still going to be doing really well.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.nindalf.com/images/wealth-withexpenses.svg" alt="Wealth increase over 60 years with expenses"></p>

<p>You can play with all of the data in this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1T3W4ezFWEAzy1QdMwVdVt8dm4FGbbmZsU0aJRaWu4BM/edit#gid=0">Google Sheet</a>. Blue cells encode initial assumptions. Feel free to modify them and see how the chart changes.</p>
<p>PG’s attempted sleight of hand avoids mentioning</p>
<ol>
<li>How much the founder started with. He merely says “successful” when he means $162M.</li>
<li>How many founders end up crossing the $50M barrier, although that’s most pertitent.</li>
<li>Why that 8% growth isn’t accounted for. He inexplicably chooses “number of shares” instead of dollars as a metric for wealth.</li>
<li>How much that founder still has in their pocket after 60 years - hundreds of millions at the least.</li>
<li>Why that time horizon is so long. How many people make $162M by the time they are 30 and then live to 90?</li>
</ol>
<p>He would prefer you focus on the table which shows a lot of the stock (not wealth) evaporating. This is deliberately misleading. To me, this feels like scaremongering against a possible wealth tax. He wants to elicit sympathy from us for a person who <em>starts</em> with $162M, spends lavishly ($5M per year) and <em>still</em> ends up wealthier than they are today.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="why-a-wealth-tax-might-not-work">Why a wealth tax might not work</h2>
<p>That does not mean a wealth tax is simple to execute.</p>
<p>Proponents appear sure - it will greatly increase the government’s revenues, while also reducing the wealth and influence of the richest people. Here are a few problems with implementing such a tax.</p>
<ul>
<li>They assume that the superrich can’t just leave. This is not true, except for America which is highly effective at taxing it’s citizens who live abroad. Proponents therefore assume the superrich will pay hundreds of millions of dollars in tax over the course of decades for the privilege of remaining American citizens.</li>
<li>They assume that it’s easy to institute such a tax. In most countries, it would require passing a bill in Parliament with a simple majority - easy. In America, it would <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/warrens-wealth-tax-isnt-the-slam-dunk-progressives-want-it-to-be/">likely require a Constitutional change</a>, making it difficult. The only country that can effectively collect the tax would find it difficult to pass the law.</li>
<li>A good accountant only costs a fraction of what some of these folks could lose every year. There’s a myriad of ways the money could be structured or hidden to avoid most of the tax. The government’s take might be small change and it might spend more trying to enforce this tax than what it gains.</li>
</ul>
<p>And there are second order effects that we cannot predict. We could model it, but I think any model would merely reflect the biases of the model’s author.</p>
<ul>
<li>The wealth tax might reduce the incentive for people to quit comfortable jobs and take a risk with a startup. It’s possible startup founders and small business owners think that $50m or less isn’t worth the risk of starting up, that $100m is absolute minimum, and that losing any of it to a wealth tax would make starting up a new business not worth it. Or maybe a wealth tax is the regulatory straw that breaks their back. If they think either of these things, we would see fewer startups and small businesses, leaving the economy with worse outcomes.</li>
<li>Wealthy people who are angel investors might become wary of investing. Right now there’s no possible way for them to lose their money. They will almost certainly be richer next year than they were this year, unless they do something reckless. They can afford to fund a few moonshots. However, if they’re losing 2% of their wealth every year, they might choose to play it safe, leading to angel funding drying up. Again, fewer startups and small businesses.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>I’m up front with my own ignorance about this. I don’t know what the potential revenue will be, or what the future will hold, or how people will react to the new incentives. I just wish that folks on both sides of this debate would speak with a little more honesty.</p>
<p>Also, I’m deliberately not writing about the implications of wealth accumulation and inequality on society. It’s impossible to do it justice in a short post. In case you’d like to learn more would recommend reading the introduction to <em>Capital in the 21st Century</em> by Thomas Piketty. I found his explanation concise and coherent.</p>

<p><strong>E-learning</strong> has become a very important topic with <a href="https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Covid-19</a>. Educational activities in many countries stopped, hundreds or even thousands of companies started working remotely. This situation made education impossible with classical methods. Besides, Pandemic has shown us the inadequate use of technology in education. In this blog post, you will learn about <strong>e-learning</strong>, its benefits and how Ant Media can help you to build your own <strong>e-learning platform</strong>.</p>
<p>Let’s start!</p>
<h2>What Is E-learning?</h2>
<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-e-learning.png" alt="what is e-learning" width="1080" height="720" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-e-learning.png 1080w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-e-learning-300x200.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-e-learning-1024x683.png 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-e-learning-768x512.png 768w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-e-learning-360x240.png 360w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/what-is-e-learning-600x400.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1080px) 100vw, 1080px" title="What Is E-learning? 12 Advantages of E-learning 1"></p>
<p>E-learning, also called <strong>online learning, electronic learning </strong>or <strong>distance education</strong>, is a learning model that uses technological infrastructure such as computers and the internet to carry out learning-teaching activities. It is a system that includes concepts such as <strong>technology-based learning, computer-based learning, internet-based learning </strong>and <strong>mobile learning.</strong></p>
<h2>Advantages of E-learning</h2>
<p>• Having fun</p>
<p>• There is no time and space limitation</p>
<p>• Results can be measured</p>
<p>• Effective</p>
<p>• Supports traditional education</p>
<p>• Efficient and saves money</p>
<h2>Continuing Education With E-learning</h2>
<p>E-learning makes life easier for institutions. It facilitates the training and education processes of institutions and supports the dynamic corporate culture.</p>
<p>• Education or training can be accessed from anywhere, only need an internet connection, and do not require a physical environment.</p>
<p>• Training or education are not obliged to be held in a certain period of time.</p>
<p>• It eliminates the obligation of educators and participants to be in the same environment at the same time.</p>
<p>• The participants provide an alternative training/lecture in which they can organize their time and place according to their own.</p>
<p>• Participants can access the course/education/subject contents over and over again at any time.</p>
<p>• Provides a platform where participants can communicate with each other or with trainers and experts.</p>
<h2>Who should use E-learning?</h2>
<p>E-learning is an excellent way for institutions and organizations that want to teach/learn new things without the need for a physical space.</p>
<p>Universities and schools can use it to support classical learning and in some cases instead of classical learning.</p>
<p>It is also a practical solution for companies to train their employees. It allows organizations to organize online training for team members and provide them the information quickly and practically. <span>Whether companies can use it to keep employees up to date on company policies or to help customers better understand products. There are many uses.</span></p>
<h2>How can Ant Media Server Help You With E-learning?</h2>

<p><img src="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How-can-Ant-Media-Server-Help-You-With-E-learning.png" alt="How-can-Ant-Media-Server-Help-You-With-E-learning" width="1936" height="1062" data-wp-editing="1" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How-can-Ant-Media-Server-Help-You-With-E-learning.png 1936w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How-can-Ant-Media-Server-Help-You-With-E-learning-300x165.png 300w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How-can-Ant-Media-Server-Help-You-With-E-learning-1024x562.png 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How-can-Ant-Media-Server-Help-You-With-E-learning-768x421.png 768w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How-can-Ant-Media-Server-Help-You-With-E-learning-1536x843.png 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/antmedia.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/How-can-Ant-Media-Server-Help-You-With-E-learning-600x329.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 1936px) 100vw, 1936px" title="What Is E-learning? 12 Advantages of E-learning 2"></p>
<p>As we mentioned above, e-learning has many benefits. But it is a process that everyone should interact with. Therefore, <strong>ultra-low latency</strong> should be included in this process.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><figure><p>If you’re here, you’ve likely been tasked with building SAML-based SSO as a requirement for an enterprise deal. If you’re just diving into the problem space of SSO / SAML, we’d first suggest checking out <a href="https://workos.com/blog/the-developers-guide-to-sso">The Developer’s Guide to SSO</a>. Otherwise, buckle up for a brief but titillating foray into why XML-based authentication is... challenging.</p><h2>Why is SAML SSO so vulnerability-prone</h2><p>The attack surface for SAML authentication is extensive, mostly due to the fact that SAML is XML-based. <a href="https://everypageispageone.com/2016/01/28/why-does-xml-suck/">XML is a semantic-free meta-language</a> - it’s hard to form, hard to read, and hard to parse. Combined with the high complexity of the <a href="http://docs.oasis-open.org/security/saml/Post2.0/sstc-saml-tech-overview-2.0.pdf">SAML specification</a> and the number of parties involved in establishing authentication, we get what often feels like a <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html">big ball of mud</a> and all the accompanying implications. Be prepared to tackle a steep learning curve, lots of bugs, high maintenance costs, attack vectors galore, and an absurd spread of edge cases.</p><p>Most SAML SSO security vulnerabilities are introduced by Service Providers (SPs) improperly validating and processing SAML responses received from Identity Providers (IdPs). This happens because SAML SSO is typically not a core-value feature for an application, nor is the implementation common knowledge for most developers. Unknowns become even more unlikely to be identified and addressed when the pressure is on to just deliver <em>something </em>to unblock a high-value contract - as is oftentimes the case. However, to build SAML SSO safely and securely in-house requires significant buy-in and <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2019/07/11/single-sign-on-sso-stack-overflow-okta-integration/">investment by teams</a> - on the scale of months, representing hundreds of thousands of dollars in developer time.<strong>‍</strong></p><p><strong>If not done right, you expose your application and your customers to potentially huge security risks. </strong>To drive that home, here are just a few recently published SAML-related vulnerabilities:</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15585">January 27, 2020</a> - “... GitLab SAML integration had a validation issue that permitted an attacker to takeover another user's account.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-4427">May 7, 2020</a> - “... an attacker could exploit this [SAML] vulnerability to bypass the authentication process and gain full administrative access to the system [IBM Data Risk Manager].”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-21263">June 19, 2020</a> - “An attacker could authenticate to a different user's [Mattermost] account via a crafted SAML response.”</li><li><a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-2021">June 29, 2020</a> - “... improper verification of signatures in PAN-OS SAML authentication enables an unauthenticated network-based attacker to access protected resources.”</li></ul><p>It should be evident by now that oversights in SAML implementations are ubiquitous and problematic, even among experienced engineering teams.</p><p>So let’s dive into some of the more common security pitfalls developers building SAML-based SSO should be aware of, as well as cover a few suggested countermeasures. Just to be clear, <strong>this guide is by no means comprehensive</strong> and is meant to provide a starting point for SAML security considerations as well as some follow-on resources.</p><h2>Brief anatomy of a SAML response</h2><p>Let's say we're integrating our application with Okta via SAML. Below is an example of an XML document we might get when attempting to authenticate a user, containing a simplified but valid SAML response:</p><p>Like we mentioned earlier, the SAML spec is complex and responses can get lengthy, so this example is comparatively quite terse. Keeping things to what you should know before we go into SAML vulnerabilities, let’s walk through what the response (<strong><em>&lt;saml2p:Response&gt;</em></strong>) is communicating:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Line 2 begins the SAML response, which has the unique ID <strong><em>id72697176167120131651975993</em></strong> and is intended for consumption by the <strong><em>workos-test</em></strong> service provider’s Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL, i.e. the endpoint <strong><em>https://api.workos-test.com/auth/okta/callback</em></strong>.</li><li>Line 3 specifies the issuer (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Issuer&gt;</em></strong>) and contains the unique URI (also referred to as EntityID) of the IdP that issued the response, in this case <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357.</em></strong></li><li>Line 7 begins the assertion (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Assertion&gt;</em></strong>) with the unique ID <strong><em>id7269717616793800631152500</em></strong>. An assertion is a package of information asserting the identity of a user, often containing additional user attributes like first / last name, email, ID, etc.</li><li>Line 8 specifies the issuer of the assertion itself, in this case also <strong><em>http://www.okta.com/exk1klancwHzz1SNi357</em></strong>.</li><li>Lines 9 - 30 contains the digital signature (<strong><em>&lt;ds:Signature&gt;</em></strong>) over the assertion, which should be validated to determine the authenticity of the assertion.</li><li>Lines 31 - 36 specify the subject (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Subject&gt;</em></strong>) of the assertion, i.e. the authenticated principal / user corresponding to the unique identifier found in <strong><em>&lt;saml2:NameID&gt;</em></strong>, who in this case is <strong><em><a href="https://workos.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="2044454d4f60574f524b4f530d4f4b54410e434f4d">[email&nbsp;protected]</a></em></strong>.</li><li>Line 37 (<strong><em>&lt;saml2:Conditions&gt;</em></strong>) defines the window of time for which the assertion should considered valid, i.e. from <strong><em>NotBefore</em></strong> (inclusive) to <strong><em>NotOnOrAfter</em></strong> (exclusive).</li></ul><p>For the purposes of readability, the SAML 2.0 XML snippets in the remainder of this blog will be simplified, use shorthand, and be stripped of nodes that would otherwise be required in reality but are not relevant to what’s being illustrated. We’ll use a mythical IssueTracker, ContractManager, and PayrollService as hypothetical SPs that have implemented SAML authentication, which you should think of as placeholders for your application or other SAML SSO-enabled apps.</p><h2>Disable DTD processing</h2><p>The first step in processing a SAML response is parsing the payload. Parsing and loading an XML document into memory is an inherently expensive set of operations, but can be unexpectedly costly due to a feature of XML that allows references to external or remote documents, i.e. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document_type_definition">Document Type Definitions</a> (DTDs).</p><p>When a DTD is encountered, parsers will try to fetch and load the referenced document as well. If the referenced document is large enough or results in infinitely looping references, your server can be slowed or even brought down trying to complete the process. The same holds true if the payload itself is very large, DTDs or not.</p><p>Two low-hanging mitigations you should implement to prevent buffer overflows are:<br></p><ol role="list"><li>Limiting SAML payload size to &lt; 1MB. 1MB is a generous upper limit and should be tuned down based on average received payload size.</li><li>Configuring your XML parser to never fetch remote files or try to load and parse DTDs. Some XML parsers do so by default, for example, Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/xml.etree.elementtree.html"><strong><em>xml.etree.ElementTree</em></strong></a> module.</li></ol><p>XML processing, and thus by extension SAML response processing, is vulnerable to buffer overflow attacks from other scenarios described later on in this post. And unfortunately, protecting your application from a service outage is among the most mild of outcomes compared to the <a href="https://www.vsecurity.com//download/papers/XMLDTDEntityAttacks.pdf">possibilities exploiting XML DTD</a> allows - it is a dark and anxiety-inducing rabbit hole.</p><p>So, if you’re not writing your own XML parser (generally not suggested), it’s important to <strong>vet the XML parser(s) your application and its dependencies use</strong> - ensure they handle other exploits like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack">Billion Laughs</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip_bomb">Zip Bombs</a>.</p><h2>Validate the SAML response schema first<br></h2><p>The primary security mechanism in the SAML handshake is the cryptographic validation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML_Signature">XML Signatures</a> (XML-DSig) - which establishes the trust chain between IdPs and SPs. XML-DSig validation should always be done prior to executing business logic; however, the separation between signature verification and operating on the rest of a SAML payload opens up SAML authentication to vulnerabilities exposed by what are called XML Signature Wrapping (XSW) attacks. &nbsp;These attacks have numerous permutations which can result in outcomes such as (but not limited to):<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Denial-of-service by inserting arbitrary elements that lead to buffer overflows.</li><li>Escalating permissions by injecting assertions that allow an adversary to impersonate and be authenticated as another user, like an account admin.</li></ul><p>The exploit here consists of modifying the payload without invalidating any signatures - think <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection">SQL Injection</a> or <a href="https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/xss/">Cross Site Scripting,</a> but for for XML.</p><p>Original response (pre-XSW):</p><p>Modified response (post-XSW):</p><p>The broadest countermeasure to XSW attacks is <strong>validating the schema</strong> of the SAML XML document. Payloads for SAML responses of any given IdP should have a deterministic standard schema that can be used as a reference in a schema compliance validation module, which should be executed prior to XML-DSig verification. Here are <a href="https://github.com/onelogin/python3-saml/tree/master/src/onelogin/saml2/schemas">example schemas</a> used by OneLogin’s <strong><em>python3-saml</em></strong> package to perform <a href="https://pythonhosted.org/python-saml/library/saml2.html#saml2.utils.OneLogin_Saml2_Utils.validate_xml">XML schema validation</a>. <strong>Schemas should be vetted local copies</strong> as opposed to being fetched from 3rd party remote locations at runtime or on server start.</p><p>All of that being said, <a href="https://www.nds.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/media/nds/veroeffentlichungen/2013/03/25/paper.pdf">schema validation isn’t foolproof</a>; there is room for error in the validation module logic itself, as well as in the syntactic rigor of the reference schema. A second low-hanging countermeasure to XSW attacks that should be employed for the sake of redundancy is to <strong>always use absolute XPath expressions</strong> to select elements in processes post-schema validation. Explicit absolute XPath expressions set an unambiguous expectation for the location of elements.</p><p>Here’s an example of a valid response that’s been modified in an XSW attack (specifically a signature exclusion attack, more on that later):</p><p>This modification also exploits the common, incorrect, but not unreasonable assumption that a well-formed SAML response will only ever have a single assertion. So while XML-DSig verification would succeed for the signature returned by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Signature”)[0]</em></strong>, the assertion returned and processed by <strong><em>doc.getElementsByTagName(“Assertion”)[0]</em></strong> would be the injected <strong><em>snek</em></strong> assertion. This attack would have been more likely to fail if the XPath expression&nbsp;<strong><em>“/Response/Assertion[0]/Signature”</em></strong> was used in the assertion signature validation logic.</p><h2>Check that you’re the intended recipient</h2><p>This sounds obvious, but make sure to check that a SAML response is intended for your app. This is low-hanging fruit that can prevent attacks exploiting IdPs that use a shared private signing key for all integrated SPs of a given tenant, as opposed to issuing unique keys per application. The most common attack entails the …</p></figure></div></div></div>

<p>Want to contribute to Racket? Don’t know where to start? Each RN issue I choose an easy issue to fix to get you started contributing to Racket. Come, give it a go.</p>

<p>Unfortunately nobody has fixed <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/1400">issue #1400</a>. However, the <code>good first issue</code> was removed as it was apparently harder to fix than initially expected. Lets try a different one: <a href="https://github.com/racket/racket/issues/2314">issue 2314</a>. Racket BC when compiled with <code>--enable-ubsan</code> and ran through tests <code>tests/racket/test</code> generates some runtime errors due to undefined behaviour. Can you fix those generating warnings:</p>

<pre><code>../../../bc/gc2/../src/numarith.c:1248:7: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 303003010297263104 * -189795840214982656 cannot be represented in type 'long int'
../../../bc/gc2/../src/numarith.c:1246:7: runtime error: signed integer overflow: -8203282719894814976 + -2082170704078970368 cannot be represented in type 'long int'
../../../bc/gc2/../src/numarith.c:1247:7: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 8022013976092023808 - -1740668310524263936 cannot be represented in type 'long int'</code></pre>

<p>and close the bug? Good luck!</p>





<p>This week’s project in the spotlight is <a href="https://pkgs.racket-lang.org/package/quickscript">quickscript</a> by Laurent Orseau.</p>

<p>From the website:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>Quickscript’s makes it easy to extend DrRacket with small Racket scripts to automate some actions in the editor, while avoiding the need to restart DrRacket.</p>
 <p>Creating a new script is as easy as a click on <code>Scripts | New script...</code>. Each script is automatically added as an item to the Scripts menu, without needing to restart DrRacket. A keyboard shortcut can be assigned to a script (via the menu item). By default, a script takes as input the currently selected text, and outputs the replacement text. There is also direct access to some elements of DrRacket GUI for advanced scripting, like DrRacket’s frame and the definition or interaction editor.</p></blockquote>





<p>This issue’s featured paper is <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1sLhAbr5BgWEGP98Mpy63Wb6a0VlEeMbl/view?usp=sharing">Hygienic Macro Technology</a>, by William Clinger and Mitchell Wand.</p>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote>
 <p>The fully parenthesized Cambridge Polish syntax of Lisp, originally regarded as a temporary expedient to be replaced by more conventional syntax, possesses a peculiar virtue: A read procedure can parse it without knowing the syntax of any expressions, statements, definitions, or declarations it may represent. The result of that parsing is a list structure that establishes a standard representation for uninterpreted abstract syntax trees. This representation provides a convenient basis for macro processing, which allows the programmer to specify that some simple piece of abstract syntax should be replaced by some other, more complex piece of abstract syntax. As is well-known, this yields an abstraction mechanism that does things that procedural abstraction cannot, such as introducing new binding structures. The existence of that standard representation for uninterpreted abstract syntax trees soon led Lisp to a greater reliance upon macros than was common in other high-level languages. The importance of those features is suggested by the ten pages devoted to macros in an earlier ACM HOPL paper, “The Evolution of Lisp.” However, naïve macro expansion was a leaky abstraction, because the movement of a piece of syntax from one place to another might lead to the accidental rebinding of a program’s identifiers. Although this problem was recognized in the 1960s, it was 20 years before a reliable solution was discovered, and another 10 before a solution was discovered that was reliable, flexible, and efficient. In this paper, we summarize that early history with greater focus on hygienic macros, and continue the story by describing the further development, adoption, and influence of hygienic and partially hygienic macro technology in Scheme. The interplay between the desire for standardization and the development of new algorithms is a major theme of that story.  We then survey the ways in which hygienic macro technology has been adapted into recent non-parenthetical languages. Finally, we provide a short history of attempts to provide a formal account of macro processing.</p></blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    <p>Recently, I’ve been writing code for a work project that involves a
<a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a> front end, written in a mix of JavaScript
and TypeScript, along with a backend API that’s completely TypeScript.
My <a href="http://git.genehack.net/genehack/emacs">emacs config</a> gave me
great tooling when I was working on the API, but support for the front
end code felt really lacking in comparison. Yesterday, thanks to a
lucky discovery,
<a href="https://twitter.com/genehack/status/1299845298294988800">I solved this</a>.
I’m really happy about it!</p>
<p>(If you just want the config change TL;DR bit without all the
narrative, it’s at the bottom of the post.)</p>
<p>The lucky discovery came when I contemplated switching over to
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code</a> for working on the front end
code. When I opened one of the Vue single file components in VS Code
for the first time, it prompted me to install an extension called
<a href="https://vuejs.github.io/vetur/">Vetur</a>. That’s how I learned that
Vetur is an extension that provides a Vue-specific
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol">LSP</a> server
called <a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vetur/tree/master/server"><code>vls</code></a>,
which provides all the tooling support for working with Vue files in
VS Code. (If you’re not familiar with LSP, or Language Server
Protocol, there’s a good overview
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol">on Wikipedia</a>.)</p>
<p>In my Emacs config, I use
<a href="https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot"><code>eglot</code></a> for LSP integration.
It’s great and doesn’t require much setup. The way <code>eglot</code> decides
which LSP engine to use for a particular file depends on the major
mode of that file and a variable called <code>eglot-server-programs</code>, which
provides a mapping between major modes and engines. Since I use
<a href="http://web-mode.org/"><code>web-mode</code></a> to edit Vue code, my initial
attempt looked like this:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>(</span><span>add-to-list</span> <span>'eglot-server-programs</span> <span>'(</span><span>web-mode</span> <span>"vls"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span><br><span></span></code></pre>
<p>After I installed <code>vls</code> (by running <code>npm install -g vls</code>), I opened up
a Vue file and ran <code>M-x eglot</code>, which starts up the configured server
in the background and starts using it manage stuff in the buffer. It
worked! This was great!</p>
<p>Since I didn’t want to have to remember to manually start up Eglot
every time I started editing a Vue file, I next added this bit of
configuration:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>(</span><span>add-hook</span> web-mode-hook <span>#'eglot-ensure</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>This makes sure that whenever a file using <code>web-mode</code> is opened,
there’s an Eglot process either already running. If not, one gets
started up. (Eglot uses one server instance per project to cut down on
resource usage.)</p>
<p>So I added that bit of config, restarted Emacs, opened a Vue file, and
everything worked! Awesome! But then I tried doing something else with
a normal HTML file in <code>web-mode</code>, and …dear readers, things got
unpleasant. The Eglot server started up, it expected a Vue file, found
an HTML one, and then it threw all the errors and warnings.</p>
<p>I was so bummed at this point! It felt like I was <em>sooooo</em> close to
solving this problem, only to get derailed at the last instant because
I use <code>web-mode</code> for more than just Vue files. I started thinking
about how I could have a major mode, like <code>web-mode</code>, but dedicated
just to Vue …and then I remembered
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Derived-Modes.html"><code>define-derived-mode</code></a>!</p>
<p>If you haven’t run across it before, <code>define-derived-mode</code> lets you
make a new major mode that’s basically a copy of an existing one. All
the configuration — variables, hooks, etc — that are associated
with the existing mode apply to the new one, and you can add
additional configuration that’s specific to the new mode too. (In OOP
terms, the new mode is essentially a child of the parent mode.)</p>
<p>I added some code to make a new mode, called <code>genehack-vue-mode</code>. Then
I configured things so that Vue files open in that mode and that mode
is associted with the <code>vls</code> server on the Eglot level. Finally, I
added the <code>eglot-ensure</code> call to <code>genehack-vue-mode-hook</code>. After
<strong>that</strong>, problem solved!</p>
<h2>tl;dr</h2>
<p>If you just want something to copy and paste, here you go:</p>
<pre><code><span><span>(</span><span>require</span> <span>'eglot</span><span>)</span></span><br><span><span>(</span><span>require</span> <span>'web-mode</span><span>)</span></span><br><span><span>(</span><span>define-derived-mode</span> genehack-vue-mode web-mode <span>"ghVue"</span></span><br><span>  <span>"<span>A</span> major mode derived from web-mode, for editing .vue files with <span>LSP</span> support."</span><span>)</span></span><br><span><span>(</span><span>add-to-list</span> <span>'auto-mode-alist</span> <span>'(</span><span>"\\.vue\\'"</span> <span>.</span> genehack-vue-mode<span>)</span><span>)</span></span><br><span><span>(</span><span>add-hook</span> <span>'genehack-vue-mode-hook</span> <span>#'eglot-ensure</span><span>)</span></span><br><span><span>(</span><span>add-to-list</span> <span>'eglot-server-programs</span> <span>'(</span><span>genehack-vue-mode</span> <span>"vls"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Make sure you’ve got <code>eglot</code> and <code>web-mode</code> installed, naturally
…and don’t forget to run install the <code>vls</code> command via NPM. Make
sure the location it is installed to is in <code>exec-path</code> so Emacs can
find it, or use the full path when adding it to the
<code>eglot-server-programs</code> alist.</p>
<p>Hopefully, writing this up saves somebody else the time of figuring
out how to do it…</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div class="page">









<div id="pagebody">

<div id="content" role="main">
<p>This post describes how to start "Intelligent Provisioning" or the "HP Smart
Storage Administrator (ACU / SSA)" on a Gen8 server with a broken NAND, so
that you can change the boot disk order. It has been successfully tested on
the HPE MicroServer Gen8 as well as on a ProLiant ML310e Gen8, using either a
USB drive or a µSD / SD card with at least 1GB of capacity.</p>

<p><img src="https://op-co.de/blog/posts/microserver_gen8_fix_boot_order/hp-ssa-ilo-error.png" alt="iLO self-test error and SSA not working" id="iloself-testerrorandssanotworking"></p>

<h2 id="changingthebootdisk">Changing the Boot Disk</h2>

<p>HP Gen8 servers in AHCI mode will always try to boot from the first disk in
the (non-)hot-swap drive bay, and completely ignore the other disks you have
attached.</p>

<p>The absolutely non-obvious way to change the boot device, as outlined in a 
<a href="https://community.hpe.com/t5/proliant-servers-ml-dl-sl/hp-ml10-v2-set-the-correct-boot-order-for-hdd/m-p/6931907/highlight/true#M156137">well-hidden comment on the HP forum</a>,
is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Change the SATA mode from "AHCI" to "RAID" in BIOS
<ul>
<li>Ignore the nasty red and orange warning about losing all your data</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Boot into HP "Smart" Storage Administrator</li>
<li>Create a single logical disk of type RAID0</li>
<li>Add the desired boot device (and only it!) to the RAID0</li>
<li>Profit!</li>
</ul>

<p>The disks in the drive bay will become invisible as boot devices / to your
GRUB, but they will keep working as before under your operating system, and
there seems to be no negative impact on the boot device either.</p>

<p>This is great advice, provided that you are actually able to boot into SSA (by
pressing <code>F5</code> at the right moment during your bootup process).</p>

<h2 id="theerrormessage">The Error Message</h2>

<p>However, for some time now, my HP MicroServer Gen8 has been showing one of
those nasty NAND / Flash / SD-Card / whatever error messages:</p>

<ul>
<li>iLO Self-Test reports a problem with: Embedded Flash/SD-CARD. View details on Diagnostics page.</li>
<li>Controller firmware revision 2.10.00 Partition Table Read Error: Could not partition embedded media device</li>
<li>Embedded Flash/SD-CARD: Embedded media initialization failed due to media write-verify test failure.</li>
<li>Embedded Flash/SD-CARD: Failed restart..</li>
</ul>

<p>..or a variation thereof. I have ignored it because I thought it referred to
the SD card and it didn't impact the server in noticeable ways.</p>

<p>At least not until I wanted to make the shiny new SSD that I bought the
default boot device for the server, which is when I realized that neither the
<code>F5</code> key to run HP's "Smart" Storage Administrator tool, nor the <code>F10</code> key
for the "Intelligent" Provisioning tool (do you notice a theme on their
naming?) had any effect on the boot process.</p>

<h2 id="theofficialsolution">The "Official" Solution</h2>

<p>The general advice from the Internet to "fix" this error is to repeat the
following steps in random order, multiple times:</p>

<ul>
<li>Disconnect mains power for some minutes</li>
<li>"Format Embedded Flash and reset iLO" from the iLO web interface</li>
<li>"Reset iLO" from the iLO web interface</li>
<li>Reset the CMOS settings from the F9 menu</li>
<li>Reset the iLO settings via mainboard jumpers</li>
<li>Downgrade iLO to 2.54</li>
<li>Upgrade iLO to the latest version</li>
<li>Send <a href="https://blog.cynexia.com/hp-gen8-microserver-error-embedded-media-manager-failed-initialization-how-to-get-hpqlocfg/">a custom XML via HPQLOCFG.exe</a></li>
</ul>

<p>And once the error is fixed, to boot the

to <a href="https://heriharyanto.wordpress.com/2018/08/25/install-reinstall-intelligent-provisioning-ip-if-it-does-not-launch/">put back the right data onto the NAND</a>.</p>

<p>I've tried the various suggestions (except for the iLO downgrade, because the
HTML5 console introduced in 2.70 is the only one not requiring arcane legacy
browsers), but the error remained.</p>

<p>So I tried to install the provisioning recovery media nevertheless, but it
failed with the anticipated "Error flashing the NVRAM":</p>

<p><img src="https://op-co.de/blog/posts/microserver_gen8_fix_boot_order/hp-ip-flash-nvram-error.png" alt="Intelligent Provisioning screenshot: Error flashing the NVRAM" id="intelligentprovisioningscreenshot:errorflashingthenvram"></p>

<p>(it will not boot the ISO if you just <code>dd</code> it to an USB flash drive, but you
can put it on a DVD or use the "Virtual Media" gimmick on a licensed iLO)</p>

<p>If none of the above "fixes" work, then your NAND chip is probably faulty
indeed and thus the final advice given is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contact HPE for a replacement motherboard</li>
</ul>

<p>However, my MicroServer is out of warranty and I'm not keen on waiting for
weeks or months for replacement and shelling out real money on top.</p>

<h2 id="bootingdirectlyintossaip">Booting directly into SSA / IP</h2>

<p>But that fancy <code>HPIP171.2019_0220.23.iso</code> we downloaded to repair the
NAND surely contains what we need, in some heavily obfuscated form?</p>

<p>Let's mount it as a loopback device and find out!</p>

</pre></div>

<p>The <code>ip</code> directory contains the largest payload of that ISO, and all three
<code>.img.gz</code> files look like disk images, with exactly 256MB (<code>vid</code>), 512MB
(<code>bigvid</code>) and 1024MB (<code>gaius</code>) extracted sizes.</p>

<p>Following the "bigger is better" slogan, let's write the biggest one,
<code>gaius.img.gz</code> to an USB flash drive and see what happens!</p>

<div><pre><span># # replace /dev/sdc below with your flash drive device!</span>
<span># zcat gaius.img.gz |dd of=/dev/sdc bs=1M status=progress</span>
... <span>wait</span> a <span>while</span> ...
<span># reboot</span>
</pre></div>

<p>Then, on boot-up, select the "USB DriveKey" option:</p>



<p>And you will be greeted by a friendly black &amp; white GRUB loader, offering you
"Intelligent" Provisioning and "Smart" Storage Administrator, which you can
promptly and successfully boot:</p>

<p><img src="https://op-co.de/blog/posts/microserver_gen8_fix_boot_order/hp-ssa-welcome.png" alt="HP IP / SSA Welcome Screen" id="hpipssawelcomescreen"></p>

<p>From here, you can create a single logical volume of type RAID0, add just your
boot disk into it, restart and be happy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Repl.it is already the best place to build your apps. But there was a missing piece: where do you store your data?</p>
<p>We’re introducing Repl.it Database: a fast, free, and easy key-value store that’s built into every repl.</p>
<p>All you have to do is import one of our packages for <a href="https://pypi.org/project/replit/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@replit/database">Node.js</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/replit/database-go">Go</a>, and you can instantly start setting keys in your database.</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database1.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<p>Because Database is built-in, there is no setup, provisioning, or configuration. It's the fastest and easiest way to store data on Repl.it.</p>
<p>To get off the ground, fork our <a href="https://repl.it/@util/Database-Flask-comments-example">example Python and Flask emoji app</a> so that you can quickly get to hacking!</p>


<h2 id="key-value">Key-value</h2>
<p>Key-value databases are conceptually simple: they’re a flat map of keys to their values. There are no schemas, tables, or columns. There are only a few operations that you need to perform: set a key to a value, get a key’s value, delete a key, and search for keys.</p>
<p>Those simple operations are enough to support all kinds of applications, from blogs with posts and comments, to game backends with leaderboards, to <a href="https://repl.email/">email platforms</a>.</p>
<h2 id="multi-language">Multi-language</h2>
<p>We provide Database clients for <a href="https://pypi.org/project/replit/">Python</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@replit/database">Node.js</a>, or <a href="https://github.com/replit/database-go">Go</a>. But you can talk to Database from any language over HTTP. Take a look at <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">the documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In Python, our client serializes and deserializes dictionaries and lists so that you can use them to store more complex data:</p>
<p><img src="https://blog.repl.it/images/database/database2.gif" alt="Database"></p>
<h2 id="get-started">Get started</h2>
<p>Repl.it is the best place to start building your app. And Database is the easiest way to just jump in, get coding, and store your data without having to set anything up.</p>
<p>For more details on Database, click on the Database icon in your repl’s sidebar or <a href="https://docs.repl.it/misc/database">check out the documentation</a>.</p>
<p>With Database, you can build a fully-featured app entirely on Repl.it. We can’t wait to see what you create!</p>

<div><p>Welcome to the streaming wars where companies compete for your couch surfing dollahs.&nbsp; </p></div>
<div><p>What a competitive space it’s become, especially now that we mostly have little choice for entertainment but to glue our backsides to the couch.</p></div>
<p><strong>How competitive?<br></strong>Well, the undisputed gorilla in the ring is Netflix with <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/09/10/business/netflix-ceo-hastings-harlow/index.html">183 million subscribers</a>.&nbsp; Ah, Reed Hastings has taken the Hollywood studios down with his binge watching, algorithmic programming ways.&nbsp; But Disney Plus, the new kid on the block (wt_?) is catching up quick.&nbsp; They’ve been around less than a year and already have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/08/04/disney-grows-to-more-than-60-5m-subscribers/">60.5 million subscribers</a>.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>

                        <em><a href="https://winteriscoming.net/2020/09/09/streaming-wars-august-2020-disney-gains-quibi-drops-netflix-reigns/">Source</a></em>
                    </small></p><hr>

<div><p>And their recent decision to release its new flick ‘Mulan’ for no additional charge to subscribers after 3 months was bold.&nbsp; Basically, they are foregoing theatrical distribution and only keeping the early access video on demand window open for $29.99 for 3 months.&nbsp; That’s a pretty short window for a shot at recouping let alone profiting after the reported $200 million budget for the film.</p></div>
<p><strong>Quibi pivots…in the wrong direction<br></strong>On the other end of the battlefield is new entrant Quibi.&nbsp; They are limping along but still fighting the good fight.&nbsp; Probably praying for a Rocky 2 comeback, but they’re looking like they’re at the end of the first Rocky movie.&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>
<div><p>In case you forgot, Rocky takes a beating from Apollo Creed in that one.&nbsp; We would say spoiler alert, but, uh that movie is like from the 1970s.</p></div>
<p><strong>Poor Quibi<br></strong>Quibi is the wallflower at the dance.&nbsp; It debuted as a mobile only platform for short length content.&nbsp; The big idea was that people could catch the content in off moments.&nbsp; Unfortunately, that model assumed we would all not be home most of the time.<strong></strong></p>
<div><p>They have started a feature that allows for streaming their content on your TV.&nbsp; And they tried out a drive-in movie format for their original series <em>The Stranger.</em>&nbsp; Good for short term buzz, but kind of goes against their core business model.&nbsp; The cool kids are pointing their fingers and laughing.</p></div>
<p><strong>Is there another Plus in the works?<br></strong>CBS All Access has got an ace in the sleeve, Star Trek.&nbsp; The nerds are rejoicing, and in case you’ve been in a hole for a decade, the nerds won.&nbsp; They are a sought after audience :).<strong></strong></p>
<div><p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks </em>just came out to positive reviews.&nbsp; CBS All Access is <a href="https://winteriscoming.net/2020/09/09/streaming-wars-august-2020-disney-gains-quibi-drops-netflix-reigns/">reportedly considering</a> changing its name to Paramount Plus.&nbsp; Hey, if you wanna compete, you have to have the attitude <em>and&nbsp; </em>the goods.&nbsp; Very baller, CBS. </p></div>
<p>Dr. Anthony Fauci has told us to hunker down for the fall and winter.&nbsp; What better way to do it than cozying up on the couch with your favorite streaming channel.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <div>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p>So over the last few weeks and months, I have made the not-so-easy decision to shut down NavHere. It was a product both birthed and killed by a change to GoDaddy's domain forwarding service.</p>
<p>GoDaddy, for all it's faults had a really decent domain/link forwarding and masking product, and best of all it was FREE. This all changed in 2018 with a series of changes that eventually broke domain forwarding. If you forwarded your domain, you would lose your path, if you had link forwarding enabled, you couldn't forward the domain, and if you had domain masking, you would again, lose the path.</p>
<p>I had multiple domains utilizing this, and my buddy's Austin's domain stopped forwarding to his university professor page.</p>
<p>When we realized what happened, we built NavHere, a "highly available" (failover-able with floating IP, but not balanced), vanity domain and link forwarding service. </p>
<p>I built out the infrastructure on Digital Ocean </p>
<ul>
<li>1 web application server (for the domain administration)</li>
<li>2 forwarding servers (1 primary - 1 failover with floating IP - and it was imaged so spinning up a new one took 30 seconds)</li>
<li>a 3-node cluster of database servers. </li>
</ul>
<p>All together it only cost about $55/mo to host, so figuring I only need 10 signups a month to cover the cost, I went off to the GoDaddy support forums where everyone was complaining to start letting people know... and got banned ALMOST immediately. A handful of people did see those posts, though and were the first to sign up. A couple of them even PAID! I just KNEW I was on my way to a million dollars in ARR. Then silence.</p>
<p>A couple of weeks after launching, I decided to reach out to a former manager and sell them on it. I knew they were paying around $15k per month for a similar service, and secured an "SMS of Intent" from my former manager stating they would switch over to us providing we gave them an API to manage their domains and links. </p>
<p><strong>Yes! Profitability here we come!</strong></p>
<p>In the couple of weeks from that initial enthusiasm to when I finally secured and exposed the internal API, my former manager left the company. There had been a series layoffs, budget freezes, and an emphases on outsourcing. So even though NavHere would have saved them $162k/year, there was no one there who would/could approve it. Again back to square one. With only a few paying customers, and still losing around $40/mo (a tiny rounding error, no doubt, but still, a loss).</p>
<p>By the end of  2018, we had hundreds of free-trial users, and were serving 100s of thousands of forwarding requests each day. But we had only converted a few paying customers (it was in the low 10s of paying customers), and most of those sales were VERY hands on. I was having to explain DNS to small business owners who all they know is their GoDaddy stopped working. It would some times take over a week from when they first contacted to when they had finally set up their DNS records, and another week before they would set up their DNS records <strong>correctly</strong>, and all of that for only $9/year. It wasn't sustainable. </p>
<p><strong>It wasn't fun.</strong></p>
<p>And then, <strong>as quickly as they broke it</strong>, in mid 2019, GoDaddy decided they were tired of people complaining and fixed/reverted/whatever the breaking changes they made, and since then, we have not had a single new paying customer sign up (rightly so, I feel). And now, all but a couple of paying customers have left - I hope back to GoDaddy's free domain forwarding.</p>
<p>So with that, I have decided to shut down NavHere effective 2020-10-31. </p>
<p>I know I said it wasn't fun, but <strong>that is a lie</strong>. Anytime you build something that is useful to someone, it <strong>IS</strong> fun. What becomes less fun is the after-building part of running the business.</p>
<p>It <strong>was</strong> fun; it <strong>was</strong> exciting; but NavHere is <strong>no longer needed</strong>. And that <strong>is</strong> sad.</p>

</header><p>
I was mystified when I first came across the <a href="http://www.ioccc.org/2018/bellard/hint.html">“Most Inflationary”</a> winning
<a href="http://www.ioccc.org/2018/bellard/">entry</a> in the 2018 <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/">IOCCC</a>.  Written by the <a href="https://bellard.org/">incredibly prolific</a> Fabrice
Bellard, this tiny program with just 4KB of source code emitted a
128×128 resolution version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna#Criticism">(in)famous</a> Lena test image.  Voodoo!
The IOCCC judges wrote “We could understand some of the arithmetic but none
of the magic.”  I was determined to figure out the magic and inspired by
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/">Fabien Sanglard</a> to try to write up how it works.
</p>

<p>
Using the program is straightforward enough, and both the source and the
details of running it can be found on its IOCCC page.  I used GCC to
compile it and piped the output directly to ImageMagick to view it:
</p>

<div>
<pre>gcc -O3 -o prog prog.c
./prog | display -                        # Show embedded image
./prog d &lt; vintage_cars.bin | display -   # Show an external image
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Running it with no arguments like the first case will decompress the
embedded data and produce the following image (zoomed for detail):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/image.png" alt="image.png">

</figure>

<p>
Admittedly, this has a fair number of compression artifacts, but it’s still
pretty darned impressive for 2439 bytes of image data and 1544 bytes of
source code for the decompressor.
</p>

<p>
So let’s see how it works.  This will be a deep dive and by far my longest
post yet (I’ve erred on the side of too much detail), so make
yourself comfortable!  From here on in, I’m going to show the pieces of the
original program juxtaposed with the corresponding pieces from my
deobfuscated version.  When I mention line numbers, I’ll be referring to
the later unless noted otherwise.  I’ll typically use italicized numbers in
parenthesis to denote these.
</p>

<p>
For my version I have expanded the lone macro (used to compact <code>for</code>
loops), reformated the source, and renamed the variables.  The only
structural changes that I have made are from updating to modern style
function headers and pushing declarations down to be as local in scope as
possible (C99 style).  In one case, I gave a variable different names when
pushing it down into two blocks where it had been reused in different ways.

We’ll start at the end of the program with the <code>main()</code> function and then
work our way backwards to the beginning; we’ll essentially go from top to
bottom in terms of control flow.  Here’s the <code>main()</code> function:

<span>250: </span>}
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The image is basically encoded in two distinct layers.  The lower level
uses a lossless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_encoding">entropy encoding</a> scheme that stores only single bits and
unsigned integers.  We’ll see this in detail later.  For now, it’s enough
to know that the first line (<i>230</i>) checks for an argument to determine
whether to expect the image on standard input or to decompress the image
from an internal string.  The data is stored slightly differently in the
two modes and the related value here doubles as a flag.  The second line
(<i>231</i>) then primes the pump for the decoding this bitstream.  (However,
this turns out to be superfluous as it would have been called later
anyway.)
</p>

<p>
At the higher level, the first thing to be decoded (<i>232–236</i>) is a small
header comprised of four integers.  The first of these stores the image
width as a power of two.  Due to a fixed-size array used to store the
decompressed image, the width is limited to 1024.  The second integer
stores how many lines shorter the image height is compared to the width.
This will be zero for square images but means that only square or landscape
oriented images are possible.  The next two lines decode a pair of
parameters related to the image quality.  Higher numbers here give greater
compression at the expense of image quality.  The lowest legal values for
each are 1 and should produce near lossless results.  For the built-in Lena
image, the four values in this header are 7, 0, 41, and 82, respectively.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org4f12528">
<h2 id="org4f12528">PPM Output</h2>
<div id="text-org4f12528">
<p>
The decoded image is written to standard output in the form of a PPM file.
This is a <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html">wonderfully simple format</a> for writing that consist of a small
header indicating the image type, resolution, and maximum color value.  A
single <code>printf()</code> suffices for this (<i>238</i>).  Following this, the image
data itself is simply a series of unsigned bytes in interleaved RGB order
for each pixel and the pixels in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order
(<i>245–247</i>).  Because of the lossy format, the decompressed RGB values may
fall outside the 0 to 255 range, so a small helper function is used to
clamp and then write them:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>109: </span><span>K</span>(b){
<span>110: </span>putchar(b&lt;0?0:b&gt;255?255:b);
<span>111: </span>}
</pre>
</div>
<div>
<pre><span>223: </span><span>int</span> <span>write_byte_clamped</span>( <span>int</span> <span>byte</span> )
<span>224: </span>{
<span>225: </span>    putchar( byte &lt; 0 ? 0 : byte &gt; 255 ? 255 : byte );
<span>226: </span>}
</pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>


<div id="outline-container-orgf3b7761">
<h2 id="orgf3b7761">YCgCo Color Space</h2>
<div id="text-orgf3b7761">
<p>
The compressed image data is not actually encoded using the usual RGB color
space, though of course it outputs this at the end.  Instead, it uses the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCgCo">YCgCo</a> color space.  This is easily transformed back to RGB (<i>244–247</i>) but
has some nice properties where image compression is concerned.  Notably,
it decorrelates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_(video)">luma</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrominance">chroma</a> data.
</p>

<p>
To see this, lets look at the just the Y (luma) color channel of the
built-in image.  We can do this by zeroing out the Cg (green–magenta) and
Co (orange–blue) chroma channels before transforming back to RGB:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/y.png" alt="y.png">

</figure>

<p>
Note how the result is simply the image in greyscale.
</p>

<p>
We can also look at the Cg channel in isolation by setting the Y values in
all pixels to 128 and the Co values in all pixels to zero.  This will show
us how the Cg data looks added to a neutral grey image:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/cg.png" alt="cg.png">

</figure>

<p>
And we can do likewise to view the Co channel in isolation by setting the Y
values to 128 and the Cg values to zero:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/co.png" alt="co.png">

</figure>

<p>
Hopefully it is clear now why this transform is useful: the majority of the
actual image detail is contained in the Y channel with only a little bit in
the Cg and Co channels.  Moreover, the human eye is more sensitive to
luminance than chrominance so by separating these out the encoder can
compress them with different degrees of lossiness.  This is why there are
not one but two image quality factors (<i>235–236</i>).
</p>

<p>
Many lossy image and video codecs, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Downsampling">JPEG</a>, offer an option called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling">chroma subsampling</a>.  When used, the luminance channel is typically stored
at full resolution while the chrominance channels are downscaled and stored
as a lower resolution image by the encoder, then upscaled by the decoder.
The tiny image decoder doesn’t bother with this.  Instead, the encoded
images just crank up the lossiness factor for the chrominance channels
(which JPEG images usually do too).
</p>

<p>
It’s also worth noting (<i>241–243</i>) that the decoder decompresses
the Y, Cg, and Co channels to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_(computer_graphics)">planar format</a> in memory before writing the
transformed RGB values in the PPM-required <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packed_pixel">interleaved</a> form.

<h2 id="orgdf2665b">Quadtree Traversal</h2>
<div id="text-orgdf2665b">
<p>
The actual extraction of the image to these planes in memory occurs
completely within the function called at line 237.  This is the main
routine for the higher level decoding of the image and is by far the
largest function in the program:

Kornmesser/L. Calçada/NASA/JPL/Caltech)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Lead author Jane Greaves, a professor of astronomy at Cardiff University in the U.K., decided to look closer to home in an effort to detect phosphine, initially using the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope in Hawaii to look in the clouds of Venus. She made the detection, which was a bit of a surprise, and then followed it up with observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observatory in Chile, which confirmed the findings.</p>  <p>But they could not account for the amount of phosphine they found.</p>  <p>"We were able to do calculations for lots of things, like volcanoes … things like meteors dumping new rocks into the atmosphere, even lightning, all these things that could be an energy boost," Greaves said. "And we found that you were like 10,000 times short of the phosphine you'd need if you made any new reasonable assumptions for these sources."</p>  <p>That eliminated everything, except the possibility of biological processes in the clouds of Venus, though the authors noted that&nbsp;there could be unknown photochemical or chemical processes.</p>  <h2>Some skepticism</h2>  <p>Venus is often referred to as our sister planet. Roughly the same size as Earth, Venus is believed to have had oceans for two to three billion years after its formation. However, roughly 700 million years ago, it underwent a dramatic change that produced a type of runaway greenhouse effect. Now, the cloud-covered planet is the hottest in our solar system, with temperatures high enough to melt lead and a crushing carbon dioxide environment that is extremely inhospitable for any life to exist on its surface.</p>  <p>However, it's been long hypothesized that life could exist in a region of the thick, cloudy atmosphere, between 48 and 60 kilometres above the surface, the location where phosphine was detected.</p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>The detection of phosphine in the clouds of Venus could point to extra-terrestrial “aerial” life in its atmosphere.<!-- --> <!-- -->1:41</span></span></span></p>  <p>The clouds themselves are composed of sulfur dioxide,&nbsp;which makes the environment highly acidic and, theoretically, inhospitable. However, over the past few decades, scientists have discovered life on Earth that can live in harsh conditions, called extremophiles.&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We've found that there are indeed, what we call&nbsp; acidophilic organisms, organisms that love to live in strong acid," said David Grinspoon, a senior scientist at the Planetary Science Institute, who was not involved in the study. "And we don't even know the limit of how acidic an environment life can thrive in."</p>    <p>Grinspoon has long been a proponent of the possibility of life existing in the clouds of Venus. Yet, like the paper's authors, he's cautious about declaring that life has been found.</p>  <p>"It's a wonderful finding," he said. "Of course, one needs to exercise the right amount of skepticism."</p>  <p>But, he said, the findings suggest there's something replenishing the phosphine that can't be accounted for.</p>  <p>"It's not enough to say, 'Oh, there could have been a source millions of years ago, and then it's hanging around.' No, it doesn't hang around," Grinspon said. "So there has to be a continuous source. It's like, you walk into a house and the bathtub has water in it, but the drain is open. So either the faucet is on or the faucet was just on."&nbsp;</p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>An international team of astronomers today announced the discovery of a rare molecule — phosphine — in the clouds of Venus.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:37</span></span></span></p>  <p>Life existing in clouds isn't without precedent. On Earth, there are bacteria that get swept up into our atmosphere and can even be carried across continents. But eventually, the bacteria settles back down to the surface. On Venus, however, the hypothesis is that the microbes might have quick reproductive rates, where there would be constant replenishment in the permanent cloud deck.</p>  <p>"It doesn't really matter if some of them are falling out to their deaths, because they are sort of restocking themselves," Grinspoon said. "Think of it as a pond where people were fishing out of it: If the fish are reproducing fast enough, or it's being restocked or whatever, then it doesn't mean you don't say, 'Oh, well, they're gonna run out of fish because it's being fished.' No, there's a steady state population. And that's the picture that we potentially have of life in the clouds of Venus."</p>  <p><strong><em>WATCH |</em></strong><em>&nbsp;<strong>MIT astronomers discuss p</strong><strong>ossible signs of life on Venus</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dCXF8FUux74" frameborder="no" title="YouTube content" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></span></span></p>  <p>But that doesn't mean an alternate explanation doesn't exist.</p>  <p>"We already know that there are weird things going on in Venus's atmosphere," said Nick Cowan, professor in the departments of Physics and Earth &amp; Planetary Sciences at McGill University, who was also not involved in the study. "And so the most likely scenario is that this is just weird chemistry happening in Venus's atmosphere rather than a whole new branch of life in its clouds.</p>  <p>"Every year we discover all sorts of new, exciting atmospheric science, atmospheric physics, atmospheric chemistry happening in the solar system and in planets orbiting other stars. And so absolutely, they did their due diligence and they ruled out everything that we currently know of."</p>  <p><em><strong>Interactive | Looking at Venus in 3D</strong></em></p>    <p>Even if it is some new process that we don't yet understand, Cowan said that the findings are exciting for astronomers like himself who are studying the atmospheres of other planets.&nbsp;</p>  <p>It's something Greaves echoes.</p>  <p>"I am really hoping for life," she said. "I will be really excited if people tell me this is just some other really exotic chemistry going on in the atmosphere, but I'll be mostly excited if it's life."</p>    <p>Now, the researchers are hoping to gather more follow-up observations. Only a mission to Venus with instruments that could detect the possible microbes would provide an answer as to how the phosphine is being produced.</p>  <p>If the findings support the presence of microbes, it opens up a whole new world in the search for life in the universe.</p>  <p>"We've always wanted to know, are we alone in the universe? Now to most of us, that means we're hoping there are intelligent beings out there, but we have to start somewhere," Seager said. "And if there is a second genesis of life, somewhere that we can find like in our solar system, it means that life should be very common.</p>  <p>"It really gives us hope that life is prevalent not only in our corner of the galaxy, but throughout the galaxy and the universe."</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

With iOS 14, a lot of the rough edges have been smoothed out — is SwiftUI finally ready for production?</p><h2 id="fruta-sample-app">Fruta Sample App</h2><p>Let’s look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/fruta_building_a_feature-rich_app_with_swiftui">Apple’s Fruta example</a>, a cross-platform feature-rich app that’s built completely in SwiftUI. It’s great that Apple is finally releasing a more complex application for this year’s cycle.</p><p>I took a look when Big Sur beta 1 came out, and it was pretty unpolished:</p><div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Been clicking around for a minute with Apple's new Fruta SwiftUI sample. </p><p>Things jump around wildly, fav' doesn't work, and it crashes once you open a second window. I understand it's b1, but looking at how SwiftUI went last year I doubt this will all be fixed. <a href="https://t.co/zGRRYswRde">pic.twitter.com/zGRRYswRde</a></p></div>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1277623561604214784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote></div><p>Since then, there have been many betas, and we’re nearing the end of the cycle, with the GM expected in October. So it’s time to look at Fruta again. And indeed, the SwiftUI team did a great job fixing the various issues: The toolbar is pretty reliable, the sidebar no longer jumps out, multiple windows works… however, <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305054121523916806?s=21">views are still sometimes misaligned</a>, and it’s still fairly easy to make it crash on both <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305051342596177921?s=21">macOS (FB8682269)</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305052083989684224?s=21">iOS 14b8 (FB8682290)</a>.</p><h2 id="swiftui-attributegraph-crashes">SwiftUI AttributeGraph Crashes</h2><p>Most SwiftUI crashes are a result of either a diffing issue in AttributeGraph, or a bug with one of the bindings to the platform controls (AppKit or UIKit). Whenever you see <code>AG::Graph</code> in the stack trace, that’s SwiftUI’s AttributeGraph (written in C++), which takes over representing the view hierarchy and diffing. Crashes there are usually in this form:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre> Fruta[3607:1466511] [error] precondition failure: invalid size for indirect attribute: 25 vs 24
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Googling for this error reveals that there are <a href="https://github.com/fermoya/SwiftUIPager/issues/60">a</a> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/129171">lot</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58304009/how-to-debug-precondition-failure-in-xcode">of</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftUI/comments/fosrbf/precondition_failure_invalid_input_index/">similar</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1258762457805455361">problems</a>. People sometimes do find workarounds via wrapping views into other views or changing the hierarchy. But mostly, we’re powerless, and this is something Apple needs to fix in its framework. Since SwiftUI ships as part of the OS, end users need to update their devices to get these fixes.</p><h2 id="platform-binding-crashes">Platform-Binding Crashes</h2><p>SwiftUI uses many components from AppKit and UIKit, which is a much better strategy than reinventing the wheel. These components are stateful and are synced with custom manager classes that perform the state diffing. These wrappers can cause issues, and as they’re written in Swift, there aren’t many possibilities to fix issues from the outside (unlike with swizzling in the earlier days).</p><p>Example: Removing a favorited item while it’s selected crashes in the AppKit binding that syncs the SwiftUI state with <code>NSTableView</code> (FB8684522).</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Removing a favorite crashes the app immediately. <a href="https://t.co/i5wiMJr4XX">pic.twitter.com/i5wiMJr4XX</a></p>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305075451711369216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2020</a></blockquote><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

<p>This past week 10 people were killed by police in Colombia as demonstrators have taken to the streets to protest police violence following the killing of a 46-year-old father by police in Bogotá.</p>



<p>A video of the incident shared on social media shows Javier Ordonez pleading officers to stop tasering him. He would later die while in the hospital.</p>



<p>In a country that is less than a year removed from <a href="https://latinamericareports.com/in-photos-bogota-students-protest-against-police-violence/3463/">massive protests</a> against police violence, the killing has sent protestors back out into the streets. In addition to those killed, nearly 250 people were injured during the demonstrations in Colombia’s capital. </p>



<p>Though the widespread protests of police brutality in the United States this year have caught the world’s attention, Latin America is no stranger to deadly and unjustified actions by its police forces.</p>



<p>In Rio de Janeiro police killed more than 600 people in the first four months of this year alone. Despite crime and violence dropping during COVID-19 lockdowns, police violence grew, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/06/03/brazil-suffers-its-own-scourge-police-brutality">according to Human Rights Watch</a>. As in the United States, a disproportionate amount of those being killed by police are black men.</p>



<p>“While Covid-19 will affect favela residents for a long time, effective public health policies can help bring it under control. But as long as officers responsible for reckless shootings and cold-blooded executions are not held accountable, we’ll keep losing innocent young people in Rio de Janeiro, with no end in sight,” wrote Human Rights Watch researcher César Muñoz.</p>



<p>Last year, protests erupted in Chile concerning social inequality in the country, which were marred by more than 800 cases of police using excessive force. A local human rights institute in Chile reported at least six killings by police.</p>



<p>And in Mexico, a video went viral showing the violent police arrest of a 30-year-old man in Jalisco for not wearing a face mask. That man later died in police custody, marking a clear parallel to the recent incident in Colombia.</p>



<p>That incident, coupled with a string of abuses by police, led to massive protests in June in cities throughout the country.</p>



<p>“Mexico’s police forces are infamous for their corruption, their use of torture and violence, and their ties to organized crime,” said&nbsp;José Miguel Vivanco, the Americas regional director of Human Rights Watch in a release. “These protests, which echo the global wave of outrage sparked by the police&nbsp;killing of George Floyd&nbsp;in the US, also express the profound and longstanding mistrust and frustration that many Mexicans feel toward their abusive police forces.”</p>



<p>Protests in Bolivia and Ecuador last year, on top of the aforementioned ones in Chile and Colombia, <a href="https://latinamericareports.com/excessive-police-violence-protests-deaths-injuries/3917/">led to at least 50 deaths</a> due to conflict between government security forces and protestors.</p>



<p>Colombia’s current protests show a continued, unsettling trend of police violence that keeps galvanizing young people to take to the streets. And with high rates of police impunity across the region, no justice is in sight.</p>

<p>Rustler is a fantastic project built to make writing Rust NIFs a simple process;
and the upcoming v0.22 release will provide a much cleaner syntax to do so. The
library handles encoding and decoding Rust values into Erlang terms, catches
Rust panics before they unwind to C and <em>should</em> make it impossible to crash the
BEAM from a Rust NIF.</p>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-rustler">Getting started with Rustler</h2>
<p>One of my first forays into Rust-implemented NIFs was while building a
micro-library providing Base64 encoding and decoding, creatively named
<a href="https://github.com/niklaslong/base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">base64</a>. It's utterly pointless as that
functionality comes built-in to Elixir but I wanted to start with something
simple. On the plus side, this meant I could easily compare the performance of
the NIF version to the Elixir implementation which can be found in the
<a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Base.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>Base</code> module</a>.</p>
<p>The library consists of two functions: <code>encode/2</code> and <code>decode/2</code> and it's using
<a href="https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rust-base64</a> to do the heavy
lifting in the NIFs. Let's walk through how this all works.</p>
<p>To get started, we need a new mix project with rustler installed as a
dependency.</p>
<pre><code>mix new base64

mix deps.get
mix rustler.new
</code></pre><p>Let's explore the project's resulting structure (I've left out the usual Elixir
files and directories and focused on <code>lib</code> and <code>native</code>):</p>
<pre><code>.
â”œâ”€â”€ lib
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ base64.ex
â””â”€â”€ native
    â””â”€â”€ base64_nif
        â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.lock
        â”œâ”€â”€ Cargo.toml
        â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
        â””â”€â”€ src
            â””â”€â”€ lib.rs</code></pre><ul>
<li><code>lib</code> will contain Elixir code (like any standard mix project).</li>
<li><code>base64.ex</code> will contain the stubs to our NIFs. This is the Elixir module the
NIF module will be registered to.</li>
<li><code>native</code> will be home to the Rust code. In fact, a cargo package has been
created within this directory (in this case named <code>base64_nif</code>).</li>
<li><code>lib.rs</code> will contain the NIFs.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Rust NIFs are compiled and linked into a shared library loaded by Erlang
code at runtime. Elixir (or Erlang) implementations of the functions are also
necessary. These are usually minimal stubs defining the name and arity of the
NIFs and serve as fallback implementations if the NIFs aren't loaded. Let's
start with the Elixir stubs.</p>
<pre><code>

<span><span>defmodule</span> <span>Base64</span></span> <span>do</span>
  <span>use</span> Rustler, <span>otp_app:</span> <span>:base64</span>, <span>crate:</span> <span>"base64_nif"</span>

  <span>@spec</span> decode(binary, atom) :: binary
  <span><span>def</span> <span>decode</span></span>(_b64, _opt \\ <span>:standard</span>), <span>do:</span> error()

  <span>@spec</span> encode(binary, atom) :: binary
  <span><span>def</span> <span>encode</span></span>(_s, _opt \\ <span>:standard</span>), <span>do:</span> error()

  <span><span>defp</span> <span>error</span></span>(), <span>do:</span> <span>:erlang</span>.nif_error(<span>:nif_not_loaded</span>)
<span>end</span></code></pre><p>The first line is configuration and lets Rustler know what Rust crate to compile
for the Elixir module.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, <code>decode/2</code> and <code>encode/2</code> don't actually implement any
decoding or encoding; they simply call <code>error/0</code> if the NIFs can't be found.
However, the names and the arguments must match in both the Rust and Elixir
implementations. Both functions take in a <code>binary</code> to be encoded or decoded and
an <code>atom</code> for configuration as different character sets that can be used
(url-safe, without padding, etc...). The default is fittingly set to
<code>:standard</code>. The Rust NIFs are implemented as follows.</p>
<pre><code>

<span>use</span> base64;
<span>use</span> rustler::Atom;

<span>mod</span> atoms {
    rustler::atoms! {
      crypt,
      imap_map7,
      standard,
      standard_no_pad,
      url_safe,
      url_safe_no_pad,
    }
}

<span>#[rustler::nif]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>decode</span></span>(b64: <span>String</span>, opt: Atom) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    <span>let</span> config: base64::Config = match_config(opt);
    <span>let</span> bytes = base64::decode_config(b64, config).expect(<span>"decode failed: invalid b64"</span>);

    <span>String</span>::from_utf8(bytes).unwrap()
}

<span>#[rustler::nif]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span><span>fn</span> <span>encode</span></span>(s: <span>String</span>, opt: Atom) -&gt; <span>String</span> {
    <span>let</span> config: base64::Config = match_config(opt);
    base64::encode_config(s.as_bytes(), config)
}

<span><span>fn</span> <span>match_config</span></span>(option: Atom) -&gt; base64::Config {
    
}

rustler::init!(<span>"Elixir.Base64"</span>, [decode, encode]);</code></pre><p>The last line is interesting: <code>rustler::init</code> is a procedural macro that allows
the use of <code>#[rustler::nif]</code> to annotate functions to be wrapped as NIFs. It
takes in the name of the Elixir module in which the stubs are defined (in this
case <code>"Elixir.Base64"</code>) and an array containing the names of the functions
annotated as NIFs (in this case <code>[decode, encode]</code>). In short, this links
everything together.</p>
<p>The use statements at the top of the file are importing the
<a href="https://github.com/marshallpierce/rust-base64" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rust-base64 crate</a> (<code>base64</code>)
mentioned earlier, which we'll use for encoding and decoding, and the
<code>rustler::Atom</code> type which allows us to represent an Elixir/Erlang <code>atom</code> in
Rust. Both the <code>rustler</code> and <code>base64</code> crates have been added to the <code>Cargo.toml</code>
dependencies.</p>
<p>The <code>rustler::atoms</code> macro defines Rust functions that return Erlang atoms; in
this case, the possible options for the <code>encode/2</code> and <code>decode/2</code> functions.</p>
<p>Finally, we come to the NIF definitions. The functions take in a <code>String</code> and a
<code>rustler::Atom</code>, and return a <code>String</code>. This is consistent with the Elixir
stubs, as are the names. In this case, the conversions between Rust values and
Elixir terms are conveniently handled by Rustler. However, for more complex
types, this may need to be implemented manually.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-compare-to-the-elixir-implementation">How does it compare to the Elixir implementation?</h2>
<p>Rust is fast. Really fast. This was my set-up (using
<a href="https://github.com/bencheeorg/benchee" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchee</a>):</p>
<pre><code>Operating System: macOS
CPU Information: Intel(R) Core(TM) i5-4258U CPU @ 2.40GHz
Number of Available Cores: 4
Available memory: 16 GB
Elixir 1.10.2
Erlang 22.3.2</code></pre><p>I used <em>hello world</em> as the short string and Sarah Kayâ€™s poem
<em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0snNB1yS3IE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">B (If I Should Have a Daughter)</a></em>
as the longer string.</p>
<p>Decoding:</p>
<pre><code>##### With input Bigger #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif decode           175.74 K
Elixir/Erlang decode        4.35 K - 40.37x slower +224.03 Î¼s

##### With input Small #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif decode           953.17 K
Elixir/Erlang decode      555.63 K - 1.72x slower +0.75 Î¼s</code></pre><p>Encoding:</p>
<pre><code>##### With input Bigger #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif encode           203.14 K
Elixir/Erlang encode        6.95 K - 29.23x slower +138.98 Î¼s

##### With input Small #####
Comparison:                    ips
Rust Nif encode           941.14 K
Elixir/Erlang encode      615.62 K - 1.53x slower +0.56 Î¼s</code></pre><p>As the data to encode or decode becomes larger, the overhead of creating the
NIFs becomes smaller and the gains in speed are impressive. These results were
obtained with fairly small data and so the potential performance gains possible
by leveraging Rust NIFs when dealing with CPU-intensive tasks are exciting.</p>
<p>I left out the memory usage comparisons but the Elixir/Erlang implementations
used 3-5x more memory than the NIFs.</p>
<h2 id="tldr-rustler-makes-it-easy-to-implement-nifs">TL;DR: Rustler makes it easy to implement NIFs</h2>
<p>Other than the <code>#[rustler::nif]</code> function annotations and the <code>rustler::init</code>
call, nothing more is required to implement Rust NIFs with Rustler. The
boilerplate and the complexities of translating Rust values to Erlang terms
being handled by the library, there's little resistance to leveraging the power
of Rust in Elixir/Erlang.</p>

    <h4>Show driving radius Google Maps</h4>
<p>In this tutorial, we’re going to show you how to draw a driving radius on an embedded Google Map on a website. To achieve this we will use data from Google Maps and the TravelTime APIs.</p>
<!--more--><p>The word ‘radius’ suggests that we will be showing a circular shape on a map, however, this type of driving radius may exist only in a perfectly flat world with no twisty roads or terrain to go around. Only then could we have a circular ‘as the crow flies’ travel time shape.</p>
<p>We will be drawing a shape that resembles the real world and it will show which locations can be reached from a point in a given time frame. This shape is called an isochrone and it shows points of an equal value joined together.&nbsp;</p>
<h5>How to build if you don’t use code</h5>
<p>This tutorial is intended for developers interested in implementing a radius travel time on their projects. If you’re not a developer but still want to create a travel time map, use our ready to go tool by clicking below.</p>

<p>This tool is a demonstration of the basic capabilities of TravelTime API, in a few clicks you can create a travel time map using five different transportation modes.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Travel time map Google edition</h4>
<p>Google does not own an API that can create polygons so we use<a href="https://docs.traveltime.com/api/overview/getting-keys" rel=" noopener"> TravelTime</a>&nbsp;to show you how to draw a driving radius on Google Maps. The very first thing we need to get started is a Google Maps API key. If you don’t have one yet, you will need to go to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/console/google/maps-apis/overview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Google Cloud Platform Console</a> and set one up. If you are not sure how to get an API key, Google has a <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guide you can follow</a>. The name of the API that you need is “Maps JavaScript API”</p>
<p>After setting up the new API key, make sure you have enabled the key – otherwise your map will not work. If you're facing this problem, there's a guide you can try on <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/gmp-get-started#enable-api-sdk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">how to enable an API key</a>.</p>

<h5><span>Cost effective Google Maps alternative</span></h5>

</div>
<h4>Setting up the Google Maps driving distance calculator</h4>
<p>In this example, we will be setting up our map to display London Waterloo Train Station and put a marker on it. So let’s begin to create our Google Maps drive time polygon.</p>
<p>To have a full sized map on a page, we need to add some styles to the code, in this case an .html file.</p>
First, we add a few elements to the body:<br>
<ul>
<li>a div tag with id of ‘map’;</li>
<li>a script for Google Maps API, this is where you’ll insert your API key;</li>
<li>a script to handle initMap() function which will be used to initialise the map on the screen. In the mapOpts variable we set the centre position of the map, the zoom level that will be shown by default.</li>
</ul>
With these elements added, we will create our map and have a marker positioned at our specified coordinates.<br>

<h4>Drawing the driving radius in Google Maps</h4>
<p>Now that we have done the initial setup, let’s add TravelTime data and draw a Google map isochrone by drive time.</p>
<p>First, you will need a TravelTime API key, you can <a href="https://docs.traveltime.com/api/overview/getting-keys" rel="noopener" target="_blank">get a key here</a>, if you don’t have one. Once you setup we should add some more code to handle the creation of the travel time shape and communication with TravelTime API.</p>
<p>We need to add a couple of items to the initMap() function. First we need a polygon handling method for getting the bounds of the isochrone, this will allow you to zoom to the drawn polygon shape when it’s received after search. Then we need to add sendGeocodingRequest function which will try TravelTime data and if everything is alright, a polygon will be drawn.</p>

<p>Then in the second script, we need to have setting variables inserted:</p>
<ul>
<li>startingLocation - a string that will be geocoded as the starting point;</li>
<li>departureTime - this variable adds function to use the current date, but it can be changed;</li>
<li>travelTime - travel time in seconds;</li>
<li>APPLICATION_ID - <span>application won't work without correct authorisation</span>;</li>
<li>API_KEY - <span>application won't work without correct authorisation.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>After we have the variables defined, we add functions for communicating with the TravelTime API and managing the polygon data that we will receive.</p>
<p>sendGeocodingRequest function will send a query to the free TravelTime Geocoder, this will get coordinates of the location written in the ‘location’ variable. If the function does its job, it will call the sendTimeMapRequest function.</p>

<p>sendTimeMapFunction function will bundle up parameters into JSON format and send a POST request to the TravelTime /time-map endpoint. In this function, we use the latitude and longitude that was geocoded in the previous step. The parameters of the driving radius needed are also defined here, for example, you can change the “public_transport” type to “driving” and other transportation types supported by the API.</p>

<p>The final function in the script is drawTimeMap, this function handles drawing of the polygons received from TravelTime API. In the polygon variable of this function you can make changes to the colours, opacity, border width of the drive time radius shape.</p>
<p>The full example of the code explained in this blog post can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/MockusT/75b315aa6ac3545114d4203b2fe67cca" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>We have an additional tutorial explaining how to <a href="https://traveltime.com/blog/how-far-you-can-travel-isochrone-map-api-travel-time-map" rel="noopener" target="_blank">draw a driving radius using Leaflet JavaScript library</a> if you wish to use another map provider. TravelTime supports more map tile providers if you don’t want to use Google Maps as in this tutorial.</p>

<h4>Travel time radius map Google ideas</h4>
<p>Creating a single drive time radius on a map is only the beginning of what you can do with the TravelTime API time map endpoint. Here are three ideas of what else you can do with doing slight modifications to the base code that we already went through:</p>
<h5>Create a heat map using various travel times</h5>
<p>Just by sending additional requests to the API from the same starting point you can create visualisations representing incremental increases in your travel time radius. <span>Full code example for creating this visualisation is available </span><a href="https://gist.github.com/MockusT/db537d1f4f7e72ca5c81d4ad0bc9a7e2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>The example compares where's reachable within 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes, 40 minutes using public transport. The layering of the shapes gives the appearance of a travel time heat map.</span></p>
<p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/2805509/heatmap.png" alt="travel time map google" width="1332"></p>
<p><span>Map data ©2019 Google</span></p>
<h5>Create an intersection</h5>
<p>You may want to find common areas between a few drive time radiuses. Overlap multiple polygons and highlight the overlapping area on a Google map.</p>
<p>Example shows an intersection of two shapes. One shape shows 30 minutes of reachable area from London Waterloo Station and the other shape shows 30 minutes of reachable area from Canary Wharf, both using public transport. The purple shows where both shapes overlap.</p>
<p><img src="https://f.hubspotusercontent00.net/hubfs/2805509/Intersection.png" alt="show driving radius google maps" width="1398"></p>
<p><span>Map data ©2019 Google</span></p>
<p>Full code can be found <a href="https://gist.github.com/MockusT/db537d1f4f7e72ca5c81d4ad0bc9a7e2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h5>Create unions of all shapes</h5>
<p>If you want to make a large visualisation or analyse a hypothesis over large areas, you may be interested in making unions of many travel time shapes. After receiving large amounts of polygon data you can process it to make one large shape, group them together in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>The New York Times analysed the whole of the USA to see which parts of America have limited access to emergency rooms during the COVID-19 pandemic. The visualisation below was created by sending thousands of requests to TravelTime API and later processed to create a large scale map. The orange pinpoints all locations more than 30 minutes away from an emergency room.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Get your TravelTime API key and start creating your own driving radius map.&nbsp;</p>

	<div>
        		<h3>MD and mdadm<a title="back to content" href="#Content-bal-title"> ^</a></h3>
<p>MD is the Linux kernel driver that is used for running software RAID arrays. <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> is the software that you run to manage MD devices. They are both part of the same project.</p>
<h3>First, about the Bad Blocks List<a title="back to content" href="#Content-bal-title"> ^</a></h3>
<p>Since about 2010, MD has had a bad blocks log (BBL) feature. When it fails to read from an underlying device it will (sometimes?) mark that block as bad and read the correct data from a different device, and then forever more redirect reads away from those bad blocks. <strong>This feature defaults to being on</strong>.</p>
<p>One problem with this feature is that read errors can occur for many reasons besides permanent failure of part of a storage device. For example, it could be a failure of the backplane or controller that causes many read errors on multiple devices, or the devices could be reached over a network of some sort and temporary network problems could propagate errors.</p>
<p>Even if the particular part of the device is unreadable, the operating system is supposed to try to write the correct data over the top. This write will either clear the problem or else be redirected to a spare sector on the drive by the drive’s firmware. The operating system is not supposed to be taking on this role, the drives are, and when the drives fail to do so then the redundancy of the array is supposed to save the day.</p>
<p>Even worse, there are apparently bugs somewhere in the BBL code that cause a device’s BBL to be copied onto a new device when the array is rebuilt or a device replaced. Clearly it does not make sense for a new device to get a copy of another device’s BBL because they are inherently a per-device thing. So far there has been no successful intentional reproduction of this, only people unwittingly hitting it at the worst possible moments.</p>
<p><strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> doesn’t even try particularly hard to warn you if a new bad block is found. Unlike when a device fails, it doesn’t send you an email. The MD driver writes in the syslog about the bad block(s). There’s also no change to <strong>/proc/mdstat</strong>. You have to examine some files in sysfs.</p>
<p>As a result the current situation is that:</p>
<ul>
<li>there’s <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg65522.html">some people who want the feature removed</a> as a bad idea that makes no sense in the modern era;</li>
<li>there’s <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg65524.html">others</a> <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg51381.html">who</a> want it defaulted to off;</li>
<li>there’s the RAID wiki which says that <a href="https://raid.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/The_Badblocks_controversy">the feature has merit but it also has bugs which must be fixed</a>;</li>
<li>there’s probably a very large number of mdadm users who have no opinion because they have no idea about this situation.</li>
</ul>
<p>No one seems to have made any progress on fixing any of this in 10 years.</p>
<h3>Doing something about it<a title="back to content" href="#Content-bal-title"> ^</a></h3>
<p>I’ll say right now that this story doesn’t (yet?) have a satisfying ending.</p>
<p>I’ve been aware of the “Bad Blocks Controversy” for about 5 years but I haven’t ever personally experienced any problems and it was always at the bottom of my list to look at. <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg65522.html">Roy’s recent thread</a> spurred me into deciding that in future no MD array I created would have a BBL.</p>
<p>I also took the opportunity to deploy Sarah Newman’s <a href="https://github.com/prgmrcom/ansible-role-mdadm-bad-blocks">Ansible role which checks all array components have an empty BBL</a>. None of <a href="https://bitfolk.com/">BitFolk</a>‘s array components currently have any entries in their BBLs – phew!</p>
<h4>Removing an existing BBL<a title="back to content" href="#Content-bal-title"> ^</a></h4>
<p>Currently the only way to remove a BBL from an array component is to stop the array and then assemble it with an argument like this:</p>

<div><div><pre># mdadm --assemble /dev/mdX --update=no-bbl</pre></div></div>

<p>(<a href="http://strugglers.net/~andy/blog/2020/09/13/debian-installer-mdadm-configuration-and-the-bad-blocks-controversy/comment-page-1/#comment-1017218">This won’t work if a BBL currently has any entries</a>)</p>
<p>The big problem with this is that stopping the array obviously causes downtime for whatever is using it. If your root filesystem is on an MD array (and why wouldn’t it be, if you use MD?) then that means the entire server, and you’re having to do this from sort of rescue environment.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg65835.html">I have suggested that a config option be added</a> to remove a BBL on assembly, so that this will happen the next time the machine is rebooted. This does not appear to have provoked any interest.</p>
<p>Without that sort of assistance I don’t think I will be removing the BBL from any of my existing arrays — downtime is really painful and I can’t justify spending the extra time to boot into a rescue environment and manually assemble all arrays.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24479235">Over on Hacker News Jakub Wilk said</a> that it could be done without downtime by faulting out an array member and adding it again, like this:</p>

<div><div><pre># mdadm /dev/md127 --fail /dev/sda --remove /dev/sda --re-add /dev/sda --update=no-bbl</pre></div></div>

<p>Unfortunately that didn’t work for me, neither on Ubuntu 18.04 nor Debian buster:</p>

<div><div><pre>$ sudo mdadm --fail /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1 --remove /dev/sdb1 --re-add /dev/sdb1 --update=no-bbl                                        
mdadm: set /dev/sdb1 faulty in /dev/md0   
mdadm: hot removed /dev/sdb1 from /dev/md0
mdadm: --re-add for /dev/sdb1 to /dev/md0 is not possible
$ sudo mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1 --update=no-bbl
mdadm: --update in Manage mode only allowed with --re-add.
$ sudo mdadm --add /dev/md0 /dev/sdb1
$ sudo mdadm --examine-badblocks /dev/sdb1
Bad-blocks list is empty in /dev/sdb1</pre></div></div>

<p>so I’m still looking in to that one.</p>
<h4>Avoiding the BBL at creation time<a title="back to content" href="#Content-bal-title"> ^</a></h4>
<p>So if the BBL cannot be easily removed, at least it can be prevented from ever existing, right? When Neil Brown, the previous MD maintainer, was asked in 2016 if the feature could be defaulted to off, <a href="https://www.spinics.net/lists/raid/msg51383.html">Neil said that putting this in the config file was as good as that</a>:</p>



<p>The thing is, it’s not as good as disabling it by default when you consider what many users’ experience is of running the <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> command: they don’t run <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong>, something else runs it for them. I’d go as far as to say that the majority of uses of <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> are done by helper scripts and installers, not by human beings.</p>
<p>If it’s a program that is running <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> for you then you are going to have to find out how to set that <strong>mdadm.conf</strong> before it reads it.</p>
<p>Take for example my own process of installing <a href="https://debian.org/">Debian</a>. I do it by booting the <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller">Debian Installer</a> <a href="https://www.debian.org/releases/stable/amd64/ch04s05">by PXE</a>. I have some pre-seeding done to answer a lot of the installer questions, but actually I do still do the disk partitioning stage in the installer’s text interface.</p>
<p>So there I was thinking this is actually going to be quite simple, because the Debian Installer is really lovely about letting you execute a shell and poke around. Surely all I am going to need to do is open a shell once and edit <strong>/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf</strong> and then go back into the mdcfg menu and carry on, right? Oh dear me no.</p>
<p><a href="https://lists.debian.org/debian-boot/2020/09/msg00074.html">You can read the details of my wild ride</a> that involved me uploading a binary of <strong><code>strace</code></strong> into the d-i to run <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> under to work out what was going on, but just the relevant discoveries are in this article for those who’d rather not.</p>
<h5><strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> in d-i uses a config file at <strong>/tmp/mdadm.conf</strong></h5>
<p>After quite a bit of confusion over why even arrays I created manually with the <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> command in the d-i shell still had a BBL, I discovered that <a href="https://sources.debian.org/src/mdadm/4.1-6/debian/rules/?hl=37#L37">the <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> binary in d-i is compiled to have its config at <strong>/tmp/mdadm.conf</strong></a>. I don’t know why, but probably there is a good reason.</p>
<p>(At this point a number of people responded, “that’s because everything else will be set read-only.” That’s not the case with debian-installer which runs entirely off of a tmpfs. It’s all writeable.)</p>
<h5>So just make the edit to <strong>/tmp/mdadm.conf</strong> then?</h5>
<p>Oh ho ho no. <a href="https://salsa.debian.org/installer-team/mdcfg/-/blob/master/mdcfg.sh#L443">Every time you go into the MD configuration section (mdcfg) it clobbers its own <strong>/tmp/mdadm.conf</strong></a>, and you can’t get to the “execute a shell” option without returning to the MD configuration section.</p>
<p>If you’re on something with multiple virtual consoles (like if you’re sitting in front of a conventional PC) then you could switch to one of those after you’ve entered the MD configuration part and modify <strong>/tmp/mdadm.conf</strong> then. I don’t have that option because I’m on a serial console.</p>
<p>There is an earlier option to load an installer component that enables one to continue the installation process over SSH. If you select that then you can SSH in to the running installer system so if you do that after you’ve entered the MD configuration bit in your main console then I guess you can then edit the config file and continue.</p>
<p>At this point though it’s all becoming a bit complicated. I was trying to avoid it but <strong>realistically I recommend just creating your MD arrays manually from the d-i shell</strong>. It’s less weirdness to remember.</p>
<p>If it’s a simple case where you’ve just got an <strong>sda</strong> and an <strong>sdb</strong> disk identically partitioned and you want to make a bunch of arrays on them, it can be a fairly legible shell session like:</p>

<div><div><pre>~ # mkdir -vp /etc/mdadm &amp;&amp; echo "CREATE bbl=no" &gt; /etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf
~ # for part in 1 2 3 5; do \
      mdadm --create \
            -v \
            --config=/etc/mdadm/mdadm.conf \
            /dev/md${part} \
            --level=1 \
            --raid-devices=2 \
            /dev/sd[ab]${part}; \
    done</pre></div></div>

<p>Do not try this until you understand exactly what it is doing.</p>
<p>It iterates the list 1, 2, 3, 5 (I use the 4th partition for something else) and makes arrays called <strong>mdX</strong> out of <strong>sdaX</strong> and <strong>sdbX</strong>. The <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> binary is forced to use our config file that disables creation of a BBL.</p>
<p>You can verify that a BBL does not exist on any of the array components like this:</p>

<div><div><pre>~ # mdadm --examine-badblocks /dev/sda1
No bad-blocks list configured on /dev/sda1</pre></div></div>

<p>You should get identical output for every component. If a component <em>did</em> have a BBL it would output something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre>~ # mdadm --examine-badblocks /dev/sda1
Bad-blocks list is empty in /dev/sda1</pre></div></div>

<p>You can then exit the d-i shell and go back to the disk partitioning section. You won’t need the MD configuration part now but even if you do go into it, it should detect all your manually-created arrays.</p>
<h4>How to make progress?<a title="back to content" href="#Content-bal-title"> ^</a></h4>
<p>All of this isn’t great but at least it’s fairly easy to pause the Debian installer and take some manual action. I suspect users of other Linux distributions may not be so lucky, and so I too think it would be a good idea if this buggy feature was disabled by default, or at least if there were a way to tell <strong><code>mdadm</code></strong> to remove the BBL on assembly.</p>
<p>In fact I would very much like to be able to tell it to remove the BBL on assembly so that I can disable the BBL feature on …</p></div></article></div>

                <div>
                    <p>This post shows how I upgraded the power delivery to my home server room, as well as installing the infrastructure to replace 5 UPS's around my house with just one large UPS.</p><p><strong>Why Upgrade the power?</strong></p><p>The electrical in my home when I moved in was terrible, it was also Aluminum and has been incorrectly terminated by some house flipper, here is a great example of what I have come up against. Do you really want to use this outlet? Probably not.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-05-17_12.40.16.jpg"></figure><p>The 15a circuit that powers the server room was also shared with the <em>refrigerator </em>for some reason. I have a pretty large fridge which pulls quite a lot of power when the compressor kicks on, this means my inbox is spammed with emails from my UPS complaining about the spikes in power when the compressor turns on and off</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-11-10_30_31-Inbox---sean@bondhou.com---Outlook.png"></figure><p>I finally reached the end when I charged some Milwaukee batteries in the server closet and it tripped the breaker, I decided to go all out and get a ton of power in the room.</p><p><strong>Why the multi room UPS setup? </strong></p><p>There are many reasons this makes sense, this addresses all of the issues I had with my old setup of having UPS's scattered around the house.</p><p><strong>Batteries</strong></p><p>No longer will I have to keep track of batteries in 5 different UPS's all with different expiration dates. It will also save me money as the total number of batteries is much less in one large UPS.</p><p><strong>Noise</strong></p><p>This seems crazy, but some UPS's like the APC SMT line make a slight hum all the time, its very quiet but in a silent room you can hear it, this is super annoying. With this setup the UPS can be as loud as it wants, its in my server rack in its own room</p><p><strong>Space</strong></p><p>Do I really want 2 UPS's sitting under my desk? No. It also lets me cable manage much better</p><p><strong>Load</strong></p><p>When me and my wife are playing PC games, the load can get to the upper limit of a single UPS, meaning I'd have to buy a second one, and then both UPS's would be only half loaded. By having one large UPS, I can size it properly for all the loads</p><p>There could be some drawbacks though, here is all I could come up with</p><p><strong>Single Point of failure</strong></p><p>By having one large UPS, if the UPS fails, everything goes down. I decided this was okay, as my entire network lives in the closet and is only powered by a single UPS anyway, so if the network goes down, everything else is essentially down anyway. So I felt like there really wasn't any increased risk here. Also, UPS's in general are pretty bulletproof, especially enterprise grade units.</p><p><strong>Code compliance</strong></p><p>There are several points here that probably don't comply with code. The fact that an extension cord has been brought into a permanent circuit is probably one of them. I decided this wasn't a real risk as that SOOW cord is 1000x tougher than romex. I would argue that romex in the wall is of greater risk of getting damaged from someone running a screw or a nail to hang a picture frame</p><p>9/14/2020 Update - I believe this is actually to code - <a href="https://www.electricallicenserenewal.com/Electrical-Continuing-Education-Courses/NEC-Content.php?sectionID=111.0">https://www.electricallicenserenewal.com/Electrical-Continuing-Education-Courses/NEC-Content.php?sectionID=111.0</a></p><p>The other one is that the outlets are now not AFCI protected. I am unsure if the UPS protects against this, but I don't think it does. This could possibly be resolved by running the UPS from an AFCI breaker, but I am unsure. Either way I don't really care about this part, the chance of that kind of failure is low, especially when I did a good job installing everything. Its also still a 1000000x safety improvement over the old wiring in the room</p><p>There also could be something said for the fact that if you shut the breaker off, the power keeps flowing from the UPS. This however is only a risk to people who don't know about the setup, and since its my house, everyone does. If I were to sell the house, I could simply remove the inlets.</p><p><strong>The Install</strong></p><p>First I had to figure out how exactly I was going to get UPS power from my server closet, to somewhere else. I found you can get pretty cheap Power Inlets which are often used for block heaters on cars, and for RV power inputs. I got one of these and drilled a hole in a blank metal wall plate, and made a pretty good inlet</p><p>You can buy this kind of thing pre-made for flush TV mounting, but they seem lower quality and are way more expensive.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-05-19-19.51.58.JPG"></figure><p>I got the highest quality extension cord ends I could find so this would be fine plugged in 24/7. These are in there SUPER tight.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-05-19-19.52.14.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.06.46.JPG"></figure><p>I then got myself a reel of 12/3 SOOW cable. This stuff is SUPER thick and SUPER tough. Its overkill for this in every way, but given that these will be hanging on the floor in the server room, I figured the tougher the better. As it turns out, buying good quality USA made extension cords is pretty much impossible, so you have to make your own</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-05-30-10.46.44.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.02.14.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.02.04.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.02.09.JPG"></figure><p>The downside with these super heavy duty cord ends is that they don't fit well in compact locations, like when I was testing with this SMT1500 UPS. As you can see, you can't use the outlets above and below</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-06-02-11.07.19.JPG"></figure><p>Next I had to find a way to mount all of these in the wall, plus the regular power oulets I wanted to run. Since they rely on the single metal plates, I can't use a 4 gang box that attaches to the stud. In the end I decided to use a piece of 3/4" inch plywood paired with some old work boxes that just clip into the hole. The ply wood will span the studs and get screwed in</p><p>I measured everything out, cut some holes with a holesaw and then finished up with my jigsaw</p><p>I decided I wanted the 4 inlets, a single gang for the 30a power I will supply, and two double boxes for the 20a circuits</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-14.54.45.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-14.54.13.JPG"></figure><p>Then I cut out the drywall in the server room, plus another hole on the other side to make thing easier. The hole on the other side was more to scout the correct position in the server room, and you could probably skip it</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-16.36.08.JPG"></figure><p>With that done, I simply screwed it in with 4 screws and inserted the old work boxes. As you can see, I also spray painted the wood white to somewhat match the wall</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-16.52.27.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-16.52.24.JPG"></figure><p>Its not the neatest thing in the world, but honestly it doesn't have to be.</p><p>I brought the cables down through the top of the wall through a few 1/2 holes. I used 12/2 Romex for all of the inlets and the 20a power circuits, and 10/2 for the 30a</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-10-11.29.20.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-20.04.14.JPG"></figure><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-08-20.03.10.JPG"></figure><p>Here it is with everything installed and labeled up</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-10-16.26.22.JPG"></figure><p>I went with the 30a in the middle for a large UPS, and then decided to pull 2 x 20a circuits. One for the server rack in general (Currently I don't have the 30a UPS) and then also an extra one for general use. This lets me plug whatever I want in, without affecting the power to the rack</p><p>Some may ask why the outlets are installed upside-down, its common in commercial settings to do this as it means if the cord sags down, only the ground prong will be exposed. Things can also get lodged between the two hot prongs if the outlet is the normal way up, like this from an image I stole from reddit</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/image.png"></figure><p>Here is the first test of the UPS power</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-10-16.25.03.JPG"></figure><p>And then all the way on the other side of the house, the dedicated outlet under the desk lights up</p><figure><img src="https://blog.networkprofile.org/content/images/2020/09/2020-09-10-16.24.40.JPG"></figure><p>Overall I am super pleased with how this has turned out. </p><p>If anyone has any comments or suggestions, feel free to email me from the contact page</p>

        <p><strong>We’d like an easy way to judge open-source programs. It can be done. But easily? That’s another matter. When it comes to open source, you can’t rely on star power.</strong></p>
<p>The “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140708-when-crowd-wisdom-goes-wrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wisdom of the crowd</a>” has inspired all sorts of online services wherein people share their opinions and guide others in making choices. The Internet community has created many ways to do this, such as Amazon reviews, <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Glassdoor</a> (where you can rate employers), and <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TripAdvisor</a> and <a href="https://yelp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yelp</a> (for hotels, restaurants, and other service providers). You can rate or recommend commercial software, too, such as on mobile app stores or through sites like <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">product hunt</a>. But if you want advice to help you choose open-source applications, the results are disappointing.</p>
<p>It isn’t for lack of trying. Plenty of people have created systems to collect, judge, and evaluate open-source projects, including information about a project’s popularity, reliability, and activity. But each of those review sites – and their methodologies – have flaws.</p>
<p>Take that most archaic of programming metrics: Lines of code (LoC). Yes, it’s easy to measure. But <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-myth-of-100-code-coverage/">it’s also profoundly misleading</a>. As programming genius Edsger Dijkstra observed in 1988, LoC gives people “<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD10xx/EWD1036.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the reassuring illusion that programs are just devices like any others</a>, the only difference admitted being that their manufacture might require a new type of craftsmen, viz. programmers. From there it is only a small step to measuring ‘programmer productivity’ in terms of ‘number of lines of code produced per month.’ This is a very costly measuring unit because it encourages the writing of insipid code.”</p>
<p>We’ve gotten better since then, haven’t we? Perhaps not.</p>
<h3>First attempts</h3>
<p>In 1997, well-known developer Patrick Lenz founded the first listing and announcement site for free and open-source software, freshmeat.net. It was meant to be <em>the</em> guide to open-source programs. But freshmeat never lived up to its promise.</p>
<p>Due to changes in direction and ownership, <a href="https://jeffcovey.net/2014/06/19/freshmeat-net-1997-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freshmeat sputtered into failure</a>. In the end, no one really had a clear idea of how to monetize the site.</p>
<p>Freshmeat was quickly followed by <a href="http://freshmeat.sourceforge.net/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Freecode</a>. This site’s mission was to maintain the “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20111031160805/http:/freecode.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Web’s largest index of Linux, Unix, and cross-platform software</a> and mobile applications.” It explained, “Each entry provides a description of the software, links to download it and to obtain more information, and a history of the project’s releases, so readers can keep up-to-date on the latest developments.” You could think of Freecode as an open-source software-specific version of Yahoo’s first iteration as a guide to the web.</p>
<p>Like its predecessor, the site slowly came to a stop – and then halted entirely. Its owners declared, “The Freecode site has been moved to a static state effective June 18, 2014, due to low traffic levels and so that folks will focus on more useful endeavors than site upkeep.”</p>
<p>Open-source co-creator <a href="http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=5948" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eric S. Raymond tried to revive Freecode.</a> Raymond believed no other site was “quite so good for getting a cross-sectional view of what the open-source world is doing.” From his perspective, Freecode had numerous but fixable, problems. Among them: cutting down on human moderation, focusing exclusively on open-source software, and paring it down to essential features. Alas, his efforts came to little. The site remains a static antique.</p>
<h3>Case in point: GitHub</h3>
<p>Today, <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/saving-repositories-with-stars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Stars</a> is presented as a quick, easy way to evaluate the virtues of an open-source program. <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, the biggest open-source Git repository, describes its star system as just a way to keep track of projects people find interesting. However, many developers use the stars as a way of boosting their reputations.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the more stars, the better the software. Or is it?</p>
<p>Solomon Hykes, Docker’s co-founder, strongly disagrees. “<a href="https://twitter.com/solomonstre/status/1294189350419181575?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1294189350419181575%7Ctwgr%5E&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2Fi9rtbb%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dfalse" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub stars are a scam.</a> This bullshit metric is so pervasive, and GitHub’s chokehold on the open-source community so complete, that maintainers have to distort their workflows to fit the ‘GitHub model’ or risk being publicly shamed by industry analysts. What a disgrace.”</p>
<p>Hykes isn’t the only one who views GitHub stars as a misleading flop. Fintan Ryan, a Gartner senior director, thinks <a href="https://twitter.com/fintanr/status/1294173608558952448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stars are just a game</a> that confuses marketing and the code that’s actually on GitHub. And Microsoft project manager for open-source development on Azure, Ralph Squillace, tweeted, “In my opinion and for Microsoft project [engineering] and management <a href="https://twitter.com/ralph_squillace/status/1294196384237785088" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they are worthless</a>. [But] There are always people who seize on them anyway.”</p>
<p>And that’s the problem. People love easy metrics. They want a quick, one-glance <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/how-personality-traits-affect-the-open-source-development-process/">answer to their coding (and other) problems</a>. Spoiler alert: There is no such thing.</p>
<h3>Opening the code: Open Hub</h3>
<p>Still, some sites and services provide valuable insights into a project’s overall health. Many of those websites, such as <a href="https://github.com/features/insights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub Insights</a>, a commercial standalone application for <a href="https://github.com/enterprise#github-one" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub One</a> customers, are restricted to project’s development managers rather than outsiders looking in on a project.</p>
<p>One service that does give everyone a look into open-source projects is <a href="https://www.synopsys.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Synopsys</a>‘s <a href="https://www.openhub.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Black Duck Open Hub</a>, formerly Ohloh. By searching on the site, anyone can dive deep into major projects to see who’s doing what in a given open-source application’s version control system.</p>
<p>While Open Hub doesn’t give you simple answers about a project, it does share such important information as security vulnerabilities per the last ten versions; the number of commits per month; and the number of recently active developers. You can determine a project’s most active developers, too. Armed with this data, you can come to <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/from-the-qa-trenches-6-signs-of-project-success-or-failure/">your own conclusions about a particular project’s worthiness</a>.</p>
<h3>Simple tools for complex answers: Google Trends</h3>
<p>Let’s say you want to know which open-source program is the most popular for a given need. Thanks to <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/">Google Trends</a>, comparing projects is easier to determine than you might think.</p>
<p>For instance, one eternal open-source debate is whether <a href="https://www.openoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenOffice</a> or <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LibreOffice</a> is the better open-source office suite. Its relative quality may remain open to question, but by comparing searches for both programs, you can see in a jiffy that LibreOffice shows up in searches on average more than twice as often as OpenOffice.</p>
<p>That only scratches the surface. You can also use the service’s time range option to find that <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=LibreOffice,OpenOffice" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LibreOffice has been more popular than OpenOffice since late 2016</a>. (Which, as it happens, is a few months after I declared LibreOffice the victor between the two.)</p>
<p>Or, to pick a more enterprise-oriented search, when it comes to container orchestration, we all know <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/kubernetes-jumps-in-popularity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes is the winner</a>. But, when did it become clear that it was going to beat <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docker Swarm Mode</a> and <a href="https://d2iq.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mesosphere, now D2IQ</a>? One Google Trend search later, and you see that by the spring of 2016, <a href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=today%205-y&amp;geo=US&amp;q=Kubernetes,Docker%20Swarm,Mesosphere" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes had already grabbed a large lead</a> in container orchestration mindshare.</p>
<p>Finally, Google Trends is also good when you want to look at what hasn’t happened yet. For example, “breakouts” are sudden rises of traffic on a specific search term. By doing a general search on “technology,” I found the top breakout term was one I’d never even heard of—although I make my living from tracking what’s hot in tech: Transportation as a Service (TaaS). Keep an eye on it; interest is high.</p>
<h3>Moving to a new model of judging open-source software</h3>
<p>It would be great if there were a genuinely useful rating system that would help people discover excellent but less-visible open-source projects. But an easy way to work out which of the tens of thousands of projects are the vital, important ones – a software Yelp, if you will – doesn’t exist. It may never come to be.</p>
<p>Hope springs eternal. Brian Profitt, <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Red Hat</a>‘s Open Source Program Office (OSPO) manager, is working with others on a new project to make it easy to evaluate open-source projects: <a href="https://chaoss.community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Project CHAOSS</a>. This Linux Foundation project is devoted to creating analytics and metrics that help define open-source community health.</p>
<p>“Since I started working at Red Hat, figuring out a way to quantifiably measure community health has been a priority for my team,” Profitt explains. “At first, we took a mega-dashboard approach, using the tools provided by the Spanish vendor <a href="https://bitergia.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bitergia</a>. They use open-source projects like <a href="https://chaoss.github.io/grimoirelab/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grimoirelabs</a> to put together amazing dashboards that give daily updated reports on how our stewarded projects were doing.”</p>
<p>However, like the other efforts we’ve been discussing, this approach ran into trouble. This time it’s too much information. “Most of our community managers did not have the time to analyze this firehose of data and make meaningful decisions based on this,” Profitt says.</p>
<p>So Red Hat also began working on Project CHAOSS. This pulled together Grimoirelab and similar programs, such as <a href="http://www.augurlabs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Augur</a> and Red Hat’s own <a href="https://github.com/chaoss/prospector" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prospector</a>. CHAOSS has two sides: People working on software applications, and “others working on what things could be defined as part of a community’s health,” Profitt says. “In the past, the argument was always, ‘Well, my community is different because of X, so you can’t judge us by the same standards as Y.’”</p>
<p>Profitt and CHAOSS disagree with such an argument. “Look at a small hamlet in rural China. Look at a mega-city in Europe. Both communities, but vastly different, right? Except they both have to have ways to deal with water, food, sanitation. They both have to have ways of getting around. Yes, in the hamlet it could be bicycles on a dirt road, and in the big city, it will be streets, highways, trams, subways. But at a fundamental level, the health of the community only depends on if the appropriate level of transportation is available, not what kind.”</p>
<p>While the focus is on community,<a href="https://chaoss.community/metrics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> CHAOSS’s metrics</a> can be used by project managers and maintainers as well. Its metrics include <a href="https://chaoss.community/metric-types-of-contributions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">what kinds of contributions are being made</a>; <a href="https://chaoss.community/metrics/#user-content-focus-area---when" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when the contributions are made</a>; and <a href="https://chaoss.community/metrics/#user-content-focus-area---who" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">who’s making the contributions</a>. All of which are vital to understanding the overall health of a project.</p>

    <article>
  
  <p>Sep 13, 2020</p>
  <p>This post describes my own pet theory of programming languages popularity.
My understanding is that no one knows why some languages are popular and others aren’t, so there’s no harm done if I add my own thoughts to the overall confusion.
Obviously, this is all wild speculation and a just-so story without any kind of data backed research.</p>
<p>The central thesis is that the actual programming language (syntax, semantics, paradigm) doesn’t really matter.
What matters is characteristics of the runtime — roughly, what does memory of the running process look like?</p>
<p>To start, an observation.
A lot of software is written in vimscript and emacs lisp (<a href="https://magit.vc/">magit</a> being one example I can’t live without).
And these languages are objectively bad.
This happens even with less esoteric technologies, notable examples being PHP and JavaScript.
While JavaScript is great in some aspects (it’s the first mainstream language with lambdas!), it surely isn’t hard to imagine a trivially better version of it (for example, without two different <code>null</code>s).</p>
<p>This is a general rule — as soon as you have a language which is Turing-complete, and has some capabilities for building abstractions, people will just get the things done with it.
Surely, some languages are more productive, some are less productive, but, overall, FP vs OOP vs static types vs dynamic types doesn’t seem super relevant.
It’s always possible to overcome the language by spending some more time writing a program.</p>
<p>In contrast, overcoming language runtime is not really possible.
If you want to extend vim, you kinda have to use vimscript.
If you want your code to run in the browser, JavaScript is still the best bet.
Need to embed your code anywhere? GC is probably not an option for you.</p>
<p>This two observations lead to the following hypothesis:</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<i title="Note"></i>
</td>
<td>
Languages generally become popular when they bring innovative runtime, or when they have runtime exclusivity.
The quality of the language itself is secondary.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Let’s see some examples which can be “explained” by this theory.</p>
<div>
<dl>
<dt>C</dt>
<dd>
<p>C has a pretty spartan runtime, which is notable for two reasons.
First, it was the first fast enough runtime for a high-level language.
It was possible to write the OS kernel in C, which had been typically done in assembly before that for performance.
Second, C is the language of Unix.
(And yes, I would put C into the “easily improved upon” category of languages. Null-terminated strings are just a bad design).</p>
</dd>
<dt>JavaScript</dt>
<dd>
<p>This language has been exclusive in the browsers for quite some time.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Java</dt>
<dd>
<p>This case I think is the most interesting for the theory.
A common explanation for Java’s popularity is “marketing by Sun”, and subsequent introduction of Java into University’s curricula.
This doesn’t seem convincing to me.
Let’s look at the 90’s popular languages (I am not sure about percentage and relative ranking here, but the composition seems broadly correct to me):</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://matklad.github.io/assets/lang-pop.png" alt="lang pop">
</p>

</div>
<p>On this list, Java is the only non-dynamic cross-platform memory safe language.
That is, Java is both memory safe (no manual error-prone memory management) and can be implemented reasonably efficiently (field access is a load and not a dictionary lookup).
This seems like a pretty compelling reason to choose Java, irrespective of what the language itself actually looks like.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Go</dt>
<dd>
<p>One can argue whether focus on simplicity at the expense of everything else is good or bad, but statically linked zero dependency binaries definitely were a reason for Go popularity in the devops sphere.
In a sense, Go is an upgrade over “memory safe &amp; reasonably fast” Java runtime, when you no longer need to install JVM separately.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<p>Naturally, there are also some things which are not explained by my hypothesis.
One is scripting languages.
A highly dynamic runtime with <code>eval</code> and ability to easily link C extensions indeed would be a differentiator, so we would expect a popular scripting language.
However, it’s unclear why they are Python and PHP, and not Ruby and Perl.</p>
<p>Another one is language evolutions: C++ and TypeScript don’t innovate runtime-wise, yet they are still major languages.</p>
<p>Finally, let’s make some bold predictions using the theory.</p>
<p><em>First</em>, I expect Rust to become a major language, naturally :)
This needs some explanation — on the first, blush, Rust is runtime-equivalent to C and C++, so the theory should predict just the opposite.
But I would argue that memory safety is a runtime property, despite the fact that it is, uniquely to Rust, achieved exclusively via language machinery.</p>
<p><em>Second</em>, I predict Julia to become more popular.
It’s pretty unique, runtime-wise, with its stark rejection of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ousterhout's_dichotomy">Ousterhout’s Dichotomy</a> and insisting that, yeah, we’ll just JIT highly dynamic language to suuuper fast numeric code at runtime.</p>
<p><em>Third</em>, I wouldn’t be surprised if Dart grows.
On the one hand, it’s roughly in the same boat as Go and Java, with memory safe runtime with fixed layout of objects and pervasive dynamic dispatch.
But the quality of implementation of the runtimes is staggering: it has first-class JIT, AOT and JS compilers.
Moreover, it has top-notch hot-reload support.
Nothing here is a breakthrough, but the combination is impressive.</p>
<p><em>Fourth</em>, I predict that Nim, Crystal and Zig (which is very interesting, language design wise) would not become popular.</p>
<p><em>Fifth</em>, I predict that Swift will be pretty popular on Apple hardware due to platform exclusivity, but won’t grow much outside of it, <em>despite</em> being very innovative in language design (generics in Swift are the opposite of the generics in Go).</p>

<hr>



<p>In 2018, GitHub announced a new CI/CD platform to automate workflows and cut down on development cycles called <a href="https://github.blog/2018-10-17-action-demos/">GitHub Actions</a>. Since then, the <a href="https://github.com/marketplace?type=actions">GitHub Marketplace UI</a> has gained an incredible amount of popularity, with over 4,000 Actions to help developers.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, I participated in building the ⭐️ <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/treosh/lighthouse-ci-action" target="_blank">Lighthouse CI Action</a>. With GitHub Actions gaining more popularity, I wanted to know how well it was performing, along with many other Actions including the one for <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/codecov/codecov-action" target="_blank">Codecov</a>. Unfortunately, I couldn’t find any information about the popularity and usage of different actions.</p>



<p>I decided to build a custom script that crawls all categories and use Github Search (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/search?q=%22uses+peaceiris+actions-gh-pages%22+extension%3Ayml+path%3A.github%2Fworkflows&amp;type=Code" target="_blank">example query</a>) to estimate usage in open-source projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>The script crawled over 4,000 projects, and here are the highlights:</strong></p>



<ul><li>9/10 most used actions are built by Github</li><li>A good action is small, focused, and composable. Learn from Github – their actions are terrific</li><li>Github Pages is a very popular use-case. I bet it could be a leading JAMstack platform if Github put a small, dedicated team to it</li><li>AWS, GCloud, Azure, and others already have official actions. Github Actions is the CI/CD platform.</li></ul>



<p>Along with these findings, I have detailed top lists by usage, popularity, and a combination of both. GitHub-specific actions are denoted by the 😺 emoji, while Lighthouse CI actions are marked with a ⭐️, and the Codecov action is marked with a ☂️. The analysis script was run on September 9th, 2020.</p>



<p><strong>GitHub Actions ranking by usage</strong></p>



<p>The ranking is based on usage in open-source projects.&nbsp;It uses GitHub Search that queries appearance in .github/workflows folder (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/search?q=%22uses+peaceiris+actions-gh-pages%22+extension%3Ayml+path%3A.github%2Fworkflows&amp;type=Code" target="_blank">example query</a>).</p>

<p>Some of the most solid engineers, ones with track records of consistently delivering business value, have no public display of their work. Most companies don’t directly open source their primary code bases, leaving the work to be done behind closed doors. After working on these code bases, engineers don’t always have the time and inclination to work on public projects.</p>

<h2 id="weve-talked-about-this-before">We’ve talked about this before</h2>

<p>This is a topic people have been writing about for a while. Since it made its rounds again recently, I want to compile some of the literature and summarize why you shouldn’t require Open Source Software (OSS) contributions from your candidates.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community"><em>The Ethics of Unpaid Labor and the OSS Community</em></a>, Ashe Dryden covers the ways OSS contributions are not distributed evenly among the entire population. Caretakers, often women and even more so Women of Color, don’t have extra time to work on OSS projects. These same groups often face harassment that discourages public contributions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/"><em>Why GitHub is not your CV</em></a>, James Coglan addresses the fact that GitHub isn’t even a curated collection of your work. That has certainly changed in the recent years, with profile READMEs and pinned repositories. Still, people use GitHub for collaboration and backups, and not necessarily in ways that can be evaluated in an interview.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In <a href="https://www.benfrederickson.com/github-wont-help-with-hiring/"><em>Why GitHub Won’t Help You With Hiring</em></a>, Ben Frederickson breaks down how the social aspects of GitHub—followers, stars, contributions on their platform—are not indicative of programming skill. So even if you <em>wanted</em> to use GitHub as an evaluation criteria, you’d fail to find a good signal.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="can-you-use-github-at-all">Can you use GitHub at all?</h2>

<p>One suggestion I’ve seen brought up is to have candidates bring in work samples to talk through during the interview. Maybe a candidate wants to bring in their OSS code as a sample. Or, when answering a conceptual question (“what is a hard problem you worked on in the past?”), they want to use their OSS contributions as an answer. That seems fair. As long the OSS contribution isn’t a <em>requirement</em>, just an <em>option</em>.</p>

<p>I’ve used people’s GitHub profiles to see if there’s anything they’ve highlighted on their profile. That can be a nice icebreaker to get the candidate to talk about themselves. But that’s it. The GitHub profile is not part of the evaluation, just a way to get the candidate to feel comfortable. In particular, if the candidate doesn’t list their GitHub profile on their resume, or the GitHub profile is not well curated, I find another way to connect with the candidate.</p>

<p>Going back to the idea of <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/02/10/false-positives-and-false-negatives.html">looking for strengths</a>, an active, well-curated GitHub profile can be a strength. But the lack of one should not be a weakness.</p>

<h2 id="should-i-have-a-public-github-profile">Should I have a public GitHub profile?</h2>

<p>Personally, I don’t think it’s necessary. You’ll hear many stories of interviewers never actually looking at the GitHub profile. But, if for reasons other than interviewing, you have a GitHub profile, consider curating it. You never know if it leads to inbound opportunities!</p>

<hr>

<p>Requiring Open Source Software contributions from candidates locks out people who lack the time, or the inclination, to software development outside work hours. This disproportionately affects minorities in tech, including women and older developers. If you do incorporate GitHub profiles into your hiring process, only do so as a way for candidates to show their strength. Make public contributions an option, not a requirement.</p>

Sometimes it can be a simulated experience to show people how it’s done and how it’s easy to do. </p><p>Make sure you show users how to quickly &amp; easily perform the desired actions. This is a crucial part of the entire onboarding process, because lots of people think that onboarding ends when user setups his/her profile or you show they around.</p><p>A great onboarding experience is when user has completed the desired actions once.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="31" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600013120274_5551"><div>

This results in people leaving the app. </p><p>And when they leave, they don’t necessarily come back because there is a <strong>cognitive dissonance (a mental discomfort) </strong>in their mind. It happens because they don’t know what to do next and that prevents them from doing it.&nbsp;</p><p>If you happen to read the “getting things done” literature, they all recommend you putting the easiest task first on your list and gradually increase the velocity. </p><p>For example, you shouldn't put “Write a book” as your first task in the list. Start with something small like opening a writing app and completing the first couple of sentences. This will help you avoid cognitive dissonance, because <strong>when there is a cognitive dissonance we don’t want to come back to the task.</strong></p><p>Ideally, your product should train people how to do the desired actions and walk them through the activity loop to develop a muscle memory. The next time, people will already know that they should click here and there. </p><p>If you think about it for a second, when you play a game, a game never gives you a big manual on how to play a game. It either simulates the experience for you or walks you through a series of actions to learn on how to operate the system.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="31" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1600013120274_91791"><div>

September 14, 2020 | https://devandgear.com/posts/18-free-hosting-providers-for-your-static-website-in-2020/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://devandgear.com/posts/18-free-hosting-providers-for-your-static-website-in-2020/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>Let’s assume you made a static website made in <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/">Gatsby</a>, or <a href="https://hexo.io/">Hexo</a> for instance. Or maybe you made a JavaScript application in one of the popular frameworks <a href="https://reactjs.org/">ReactJS</a>, <a href="https://angular.io/">Angular</a>, <a href="https://vuejs.org/">Vue.js</a>, <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a>… etc. It may be a simple side-project or just an app for learning, but it always
comes to the problem where to host it, which provider to use, and which
provider offers most features for free so you can show to everybody your work.</p>
<p>Well, it’s 2020 and it has never been easier to host your static website for
free. Each one differs in some way but essentially they all offer the same
service, so we created a list of 18 free hosting providers that you might
consider for your current or next project.</p>
<p>Are you using some of these providers? Let us know in the comments on your
experience with them.</p>
<h2 id="1-aws-s3httpsawsamazoncoms3">1. <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">AWS S3</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon AWS</a> is probably one of the most known hosting providers on the internet,
even if you don’t choose AWS, chances are you’ll end up on AWS since many of
the providers below are built on top of them. So instead you may consider
hosting your website directly on AWS.</p>
<p>AWS is completely free for the first year of use, after that, you get charged
for what you use.</p>
<h3 id="free-plan-includes">Free plan includes:</h3>
<p>Upon sign-up, new AWS customers receive 5GB of Amazon S3 storage in the S3
Standard storage class; 20,000 GET Requests; 2,000 PUT, COPY, POST, or LIST
Requests; and 15GB of Data Transfer Out each month for one year.</p>
<h2 id="2-netlifyhttpswwwnetlifycom">2. <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a></h2>

<p>Org 9.4 is out.  <a href="https://orgmode.org/Changes.html" title="Enjoy">Enjoy</a>!</p>

<p>Most of the time, when you hear that a free software project is
struggling, it is too late.  E.g. both <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/ip17pu/looking_for_a_maintainer_for_pdftoolstablist/" title="pdf-tools">pdf-tools</a> and <a href="https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm/issues/2386" title="helm">helm</a> don't have a
maintainer since a few days: did you see this coming?</p>

<p>Org is doing quite well, but I feel we are at a turning point: either
we attract more contributors and we can afford to fix more bugs and
deliver new releases, or we might get overwhelmed by user requests and
lose both our energy and our motivation to continue.</p>

<p>Of course, part of this problem is my limited free time over the past
few years: don't worry, I am no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life" title="BDFL">BDFL</a> and I will soon step down as the
maintainer.  Also, other core contributors have been more active than
I was able to be, so I guess my feeling is still valid, even for when
I won't be contributing anymore.</p>

<p>I think it boils down to this: we are not very good at <strong>helping you
help us</strong>.  So, here is my modest attempt at getting better at this:</p>

<ul>
<li>If <strong>you are a power user</strong> but no Elisp hacker, can you <a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode" title="subscribe to</li>
  the mailing list">subscribe to</a></li><a href="https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-orgmode" title="subscribe to</li>
  the mailing list">
  the mailing list</a> and help answering questions and reproducing bug
  reports?  I cannot insist enough on this: it really helps <em>a lot</em>.
</ul>

<p>Of course, you are also welcome to <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-web-social.html" title="help people on Stackoverflow and
  on Reddit">help people on Stackoverflow and
  on Reddit</a>, but <em>upstream help</em> on the mailing list is decisive to let
  code contributors focus on their contributions.</p>

<li>If <strong>you are an Elisp hacker</strong>, can you help us fix bugs?  Here is a</li>
  list of <a href="https://updates.orgmode.org/#bugs" title="confirmed bugs">confirmed bugs</a> that you can <a href="https://updates.orgmode.org/feed/bugs" title="subscribe to (as RSS)">subscribe to (as RSS)</a>.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>If you have <strong>better ideas</strong> on how to let anyone contribute more, can</li>
  you send a patch against <a href="https://orgmode.org/worg/org-contribute.html" title="the org-contribute page">the org-contribute page</a>?  See <a href="https://code.orgmode.org/bzg/worg/" title="worg.git">worg.git</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I recently read <a href="https://www.empirical.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/the_losers_game.pdf">this essay</a> which discusses changes in investment strategy in the 1970’s. In it, Charles Ellis talks about the difference between a <strong>winner’s game</strong> and a <strong>loser’s game</strong><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p><blockquote><p>Expert tennis is what I call a Winner’s Game because the ultimate outcome is determined by the actions of the winner. Victory is due to winning more points than the opponent wins – not, as we shall see in a moment, simply to getting a higher score than the opponent, but getting that higher score by winning points.</p><p>Amateur tennis, Ramo found, is almost entirely different. Brilliant shots, long and exciting rallies and seemingly miraculous recoveries are few and far between. On the other hand, the ball is fairly often hit into the net or out of bounds, and double faults at service are not uncommon. The amateur duffer seldom beats his opponent, but he beats himself all the time. The victor in this game of tennis gets a higher score than the opponent, but he gets that higher score because his opponent is losing even more points.</p><p>…</p><p>In other words, professional tennis is a <strong>Winner’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the winner – and amateur tennis is a <strong>Loser’s Game</strong> – the final outcome is determined by the activities of the loser.</p></blockquote><p>What does it mean to talk about winning or losing in programming? What does success look like? I think that is a hard question, which could probably fill several blog posts, but I think a good working definition for us is “producing high quality code<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>, either by oneself or as part of a team, that helps to solve some problem for an end user”. Based on this definition, it seems to me that professional programming is somewhat of a losers game, at least for most of us.</p><p>I will concede that perhaps in fast moving startups, or for those involved in bleeding-edge research, there is an element of succeeding by “winning points”. Developing a faster algorithm, or determining some incredibly innovative way to implement a feature may help you succeed. However, I believe for a lot of professional programmers, succeeding comes from focusing on not “losing points” - causing bugs or producing unfathomable code, for example<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</p><p>When we consider programming with this in mind, it highlights the importance of some of the less glamorous elements of our field as a viable strategy for success. As you approach your next project, ask yourself, how can you avoid losing?</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Which itself was taken from the work of Simon Ramo in his book <em>Extraordinary Tennis for the Ordinary Tennis Player</em>. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:2" role="doc-endnote"><p>By “high quality code” I mean code that is clean, understandable and that produces few bugs in normal operation. <a href="#fnref:2" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li><li id="fn:3" role="doc-endnote"><p>There has been some discussion on this piece on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/iqctuy/programming_is_losers_game">lobste.rs</a> and it has highlighted a point that I need to clarify. I am not trying to claim that programming <em>is</em> a game, but rather it represents a scenario where we are working towards a goal, and perhaps one of the best strategies for achieving that goal is to avoid actions that frustrate your attempts to reach it. In tennis, that goal would be to win the match and a strategy you can pursue is to avoid hitting the net, rather than focussing on trying to outsmart your opponent with a clever backhand. For programmers, that goal may be to produce high quality software, and a strategy to pursue is to be extra careful to avoid bugs, rather than implement some very complex algorithm. <a href="#fnref:3" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></section></div>]]>

<hr><p><strong><a name="whyturbo"></a>Why turbo?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone has had a bad customer support experience at some point in their life.<br>
In today’s world, the “service-oriented” companies don’t see customer<br>
service as the “service” they provide. It can be difficult to get<br>
help for problems that seem simple and straightforward.</p>
<h3>Why does customer service suck?</h3>
<p>To understand why you need to know how to turbo, you should know why it’s even<br>
necessary in the first place. A key part of the process is understanding how<br>
the typical customer support system is organized.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article, I will describe telephone-based customer<br>
service. It’s usually easier to deal with face-to-face issues, as it’s easier<br>
to find a manager. However, some of the principles will apply to face-to-face<br>
customer service problems as well.</p>
<p>Also, I will approach the problem from the standpoint of computer-related technical<br>
support, as that’s where most of my experience lies. Still, the concepts are<br>
applicable to almost any telephone-based customer service or support organization.</p>
<p>Most phone support systems are organized with multiple “tiers” of<br>
support personnel. Almost every sizable organization has at least first- and<br>
second-level support. In more and more cases, there are additional tiers, which<br>
begin to blend into the non-support arms of the company at some point. Many<br>
companies now consider the senior management to be the topmost tier of support.</p>
<h4>First-level support: the deflectors</h4>
<p>When you call a company’s support line, you get connected to first-level support.<br>
The job of the first-level customer support representative (CSR) is triage:<br>
answer the easy questions, weed out the wackos, and pass the hard questions<br>
up to second-level support.</p>
<p>There are many skilled, knowledgeable first-level support people, but there<br>
are even more barely adequate first-level support people. (Why? Because the<br>
skilled ones usually get promoted to second-level support, or management.) It’s<br>
not unusual for first-level computer support personnel to have only basic computer<br>
technical expertise combined with a manual of rote responses to common questions.<br>
If your question isn’t one of the ones for which a ready-made answer is at hand,<br>
you’ll need to have your problem escalated. Unfortunately, there’s a lot of<br>
pressure on first-level support in many companies; sometimes it’s better for<br>
the CSR’s career to give you a wild-ass guess and mark the incident “closed”<br>
in their database, than to escalate the call.</p>
<p>In an astonishingly large number of cases, companies are farming their first-level<br>
support out to contract companies that may provide support for dozens of companies.<br>
These people are not part of the company that sells the product, and therefore<br>
have far less pride in the product. They also may have little to no specific<br>
training.</p>
<p>Depending on the company’s policies, the first-level people may take your information<br>
and act as a go-between with the second level folks, or hand you off to a second-level<br>
staffer directly. If you don’t have a simple problem that has a well-known,<br>
canned answer, you want to talk to a second-level staffer directly. If you use<br>
the first-level support as a go-between, something will probably get lost in<br>
the translation.</p>
<p>If you find that your first-level staffer can’t help you, ask to speak with<br>
someone that is more familiar with the problem. Be polite, but firm. If the<br>
person refuses, ask (politely) to speak with their supervisor. Often, policy<br>
requires that the supervisor approve “escalating” a customer to second-level<br>
support. Explain the problem to the supervisor and explain that the person(s)<br>
that you’ve been working with haven’t been able to help you.</p>
<p>If the supervisor gives you the brush-off, refusing to escalate the call or<br>
take any other meaningful action, it’s time to turbo.</p>
<h4>Second-level support: the experts</h4>
<p>In most companies, the second-level CSRs are the ones who have deep knowledge<br>
of the product and good creative and analytical thinking capabilities. They’re<br>
placed at the higher tier to conserve their time—the less capable CSRs can<br>
perform the initial triage and handle the easy calls.</p>
<p>When I worked at Xerox, as a second-level printer support representative, the<br>
second-level group had about 12 CSRs for all of North America. The group had<br>
access to testing facilities and engineering groups. We could replicate a user’s<br>
environment in our lab, and see if we could get the same problems to occur.<br>
We knew the phone numbers for the people that created the product, and we could<br>
call them if we found something inexplicable.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that second-level support are experts, but not necessarily<br>
geniuses. They may not have an instant answer for your problem, even though<br>
they see more unique problems than the first-level support folks. However, they<br>
do generally have the skills and the resources to actually <em>work</em> on<br>
your problem, rather than looking it up in a book. Therefore, you should have<br>
more patience with second-level support. They may have to call you back; let<br>
them do so, and give them a reasonable amount of time. If they don’t call you<br>
back, call them.</p>
<p>If second-level support can’t help you, try to analyze the reason why they<br>
can’t help you.</p>
<ul>
<li>If it seems that they can’t help you because your problem is new and/or<br>
unique, and they’re having problems determining the cause, you probably don’t<br>
need to turbo the problem. Chances are, they’ve already escalated the problem,<br>
or they’re working on it themselves.</li>
<li>If, on the other hand, you feel that they are unable to help you due to<br>
a corporate policy, management edict, or just plain personal stubbornness,<br>
it’s time to escalate the call or turbo it.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can ask to speak to a second-level CSR’s manager; this may get you some<br>
additional help, but generally won’t be nearly as effective as speaking to the<br>
first-level manager. The second-level CSRs usually have much greater “empowerment”<br>
to solve customer problems, and their manager may not have much more clout.</p>
<p>You stand little chance of being put directly in contact with the next-higher<br>
tier. If second-level support is unable to resolve your problem, and you feel<br>
that they are not doing a reasonable amount of work to resolve it, it’s time<br>
to turbo.</p>
<h4>Third-level support: the creators</h4>
<p>Generally, the third level of support is the creators of the product or service.<br>
For a physical product like a camera or a printer, the third level of support<br>
may be the product engineering team that designed the product. In some cases,<br>
it may be a “tiger team” of very senior technical staff and field<br>
service personnel who are intimately familiar with the product and the way it<br>
works in the real world. (In many companies, “tiger teams” are responsible<br>
for finding and fixing flaws that occur in the field which the product design<br>
team cannot replicate or does not wish to fix.)</p>
<p>You stand a greater chance of being put in touch with a tiger team, if it exists,<br>
than the product engineers. If you are a large customer, your chances of having<br>
the tiger team work with you are greater still.</p>
<p>For a service, such as Internet service or phone service, the third-level staff<br>
will usually be the behind-the-scenes technical staff, such as the system administrators<br>
or telephone switch technicians. These people have much deeper experience than<br>
any of the CSRs, and also have access to vendor support systems that can help<br>
them resolve problems with the equipment they use.</p>
<p>In either case, it’s most likely that the second-level CSR will take your information<br>
and forward it to the third-level support staff. The second-level CSR may continue<br>
to act as a go-between. The third-level staff’s time is precious, and they need<br>
to be shielded from the customers in all but the most extreme cases to retain<br>
their usefulness.</p>
<p>However, if you hit a dead end with second-level support, you can increase<br>
your chances of getting third-level or better support by turboing the problem.</p>
<h3>The right time to turbo</h3>
<p>To summarize: The right time to turbo is when you’ve exhausted the normal technical<br>
support process. You should turbo only when you’ve hit the dead end. If you<br>
turbo indiscriminately, you may end up with worse support than you would have<br>
otherwise… and you’ll be unable to turbo again if it is ever truly needed.</p>
<hr>
<h2><a name="how-to-turbo"></a>How to turbo</h2>
<p>The trick to successful turboing is to turn the normal bottom-up technical<br>
support pyramid on its head. You want to complain properly to the most senior<br>
person possible. This is easier than ever if you have an Internet connection.<br>
If you don’t have Internet access, you will need to do some research at a library.</p>
<h3><a name="s1-right-place"></a>1. Find the right place to complain.</h3>
<p>Before you can do anything else, <strong>you need to find the right place to complain</strong>.<br>
Are you familiar with the phrase “the buck stops here?” Well, you<br>
need to find out whose desk has that sign in the troublesome organization. Usually,<br>
that’s the Chief Executive Officer—the CEO.</p>
<p>You’ll need two pieces of information to turbo successfully:</p>
<ol>
<li>The CEO’s name</li>
<li>The company’s main switchboard telephone number</li>
</ol>
<p>Most publicly-held companies have their annual financial report available on<br>
their corporate web site somewhere. Do a little digging and find the latest<br>
report. This report is the mother lode for turboing; you can often find everything<br>
you need right there.</p>
<p>There is an …</p></div></div>

<p>Day 1 of a new project. You have the team. You have the basic requirements. You’re ready to <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">plan the sprint</a>. What’s the first <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/07/scrums-sprint-goal-vs-mishmash-sprints/">sprint goal</a>? How do you decide where to start? </p>



<p>One of my many takeaways from reading <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup"><em>Shape Up</em></a> is that <strong>we should  “start in the middle.” </strong></p>



<p>The book says that there are 3 criteria for what to build first on a new project (or “cycle” in Shape Up lingo):</p>



<ol><li><strong>Core</strong>: it should be so central that without it, the other work wouldn’t mean anything.</li><li><strong>Small: </strong>you should be able to complete it within a few days to start building momentum.</li><li><strong>Novel: </strong>build something you’ve never built before so that you can start learning.</li></ol>



<p>Say you’re building a big marketing site for a bank. You start by creating a “Page” content type, right? Because it feels cozy to be able to add and edit page content after the first sprint? Wrong! That isn’t <strong>novel</strong>. You’ve built a “Page” content type 100 times. You won’t learn anything from that. </p>



<p>Instead, start with the daily mortgage rate ingestion engine. The site will use that data for displaying up to date rates and powering loan calculators. That is <strong>core</strong> (it’s a bank, after all), <strong>small</strong> (you could build it in a week or less), and <strong>novel</strong> (you’ve never ingested data like this). </p>



<p><em>The Pragmatic Programmer</em> talks a lot about <a href="https://flylib.com/books/en/1.315.1.25/1/">tracer bullets</a> which fit right in here. Tracer code is a complete end to end connection with all the pieces of your system. You’re forced you to think about the integration points. Tracer code is <strong>core</strong> (duh, it’s the skeleton of the project) and <strong>novel</strong> (you’ve never connected those pieces in that way) and <strong>small</strong> (if it’s not, then find a way to make it smaller).</p>



<p>It’s all about eliminating uncertainty while also building momentum. </p>



<ul><li>Starting with something that isn’t <strong>novel</strong> won’t touch uncertainty. If you save all the risky bits until the last half, then you have half the time to deal with what you find.</li><li>Starting with something that isn’t <strong>small</strong> won’t build momentum. There’s power in finishing something early. Showing quick progress sets the tone and gets people excited. </li><li>Starting with something that isn’t <strong>core</strong> won’t give you a structure to build around as you go. To iterate, you need something to iterate <em>on</em>. You need some meat and bone rather than just fat. </li></ul>



<p>Core, small, novel. Start in the middle. <a href="https://basecamp.com/shapeup/3.2-chapter-11#start-in-the-middle">Read more here, from Shape Up</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            <div>
                <div><p>I have a great friend by the name of Matthias. Recently, I went on a short hiking trip with him up a mountain to a cabin where we stayed together overnight. The next morning, as I packed my rucksack to wander back down through the forest on a narrow path as rays of sun were peeking through the leaves, I pondered this question – what makes a great friend? What makes Matthias such a great friend in my mind? As I broke down my general feelings of warmth and gratitude for having him in my life, these are the 9 points that I came up with:</p>
<h2><b>He respects and observes my boundaries</b></h2>
<p>In relationships generally, I regularly struggle to maintain and set boundaries, particularly when it comes to taking space and time for myself to figure something out. When this happens I often agree to do things that after some time, I realize, don’t fully resonate with me anymore. On many occasions, I would still do the thing I agreed to, sometimes out of fear that if I canceled plans or rescheduled, then the other person would be so upset that I’d be left alone and stranded.</p>
<p>With Matthias, I’ve had a chance to practice and observe firsthand that that’s not always the case with people. I’ve dared on a number of occasions to let him know that I don’t quite feel like meeting up anymore that evening or that on another thing something changed for me and I couldn’t commit anymore. He’s received me with warm understanding, spaciousness and most importantly flexibility to come up with new plans and schedules that would fit my current state of mind better and also acknowledge his wishes and ideas. This has been a fairly new experience for me compared to others from the past.</p>
<p>I’m most grateful for this practice with him and how it has taught me that taking care of myself first is the most important element in maintaining a strong friendship or relationship of any kind.</p>
<h2><b>He doesn’t shy away from sharing his strong opinions and reflections&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p>One thing I love about talking to Matthias is that he’s bold in expressing his own views and ideas about the world when we have conversations. We don’t always agree on things. He’s stating them in a way so that they are powerful and stand on their own, without landing in any way as a suggestion or something that I should do or consider. He states them simply as his truth and expression of himself.</p>
<p>I greatly value this and often come away feeling enlightened and curious from most of our conversations, without any sense of not having been heard for my own views and ideas. There’s a special ability that he has where he can listen attentively and then still express and share his own strong views, that might differ from my own, but those are able to live peacefully side by side with each other.</p>
<p>I believe this is a rare quality and requires a vast amount of self-confidence and the ability to hold two views, sometimes differing ones in one’s mind and body.</p>
<h2><b>He can hold space for me when I’m going through something difficult</b></h2>
<p>Matthias has spent almost 2 decades practicing meditation, spent months living in a monastery, and is a certified <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Kayavidya.Grinberg.Gruemayer/">Grinberg body coach</a> as I like to think of him. All of this training and practice has helped him to develop a deep capacity to listen and make space for someone’s reality when they bring it to him, on many occasion that reality is mine.</p>
<p>Even if I feel completely disorganized and unsure of myself, there’s room for that to be laid out and with his genuine reflection and curiosity, I’ve had a chance to find myself again and put together the pieces that were in disarray just moments earlier.</p>
<p>I believe that this ability to listen deeply to someone else’s experience without adding any of one’s own ideas or thoughts is among the rarest gifts in today’s world and I’ve only met a small handful of people who can do this to the depth and ability that he can. When I reflect on this, it makes me even more grateful to call him my friend and get the chance to sometimes bask in his ability to be there for me in this way.</p>
<h2><b>He’s determined to chart his own path in thought and in action&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p>I’ve watched Matthias over the last several years continue to experiment and bring together many of the different streams of wisdom that he’s been exposed to. Most notably, this has been Buddhism, particularly the tradition of Thich Nhat Hanh, as well as various other forms of mindfulness teachings from different traditions, and the Grinberg Method, a powerful bodywork methodology that centers around the core idea that returning to living in our bodies is the key to regain our aliveness and freedom to live the life we want.</p>
<p>I’ve seen him weave together different elements from these teachings and combining it with his own experiences. Lately and particularly I’ve enjoyed observing him share his experiences from welcoming his first daughter into the world.</p>
<p>I find there are plenty of people in the world who follow this or that methodology or way of thinking and that is fine, but there are few who truly take what they have learned and string it together to a whole new way of looking at the world and that is what I see when I look at Matthias. It takes a considerable amount of courage and the ability to stand alone and by one’s hard-earned wisdom, even if it doesn’t reflect a widely held view. When I see this, I continue to feel encouraged about the views I’m having and feel called to share with the world and that is a sweet and valuable thing to me.</p>
<h2><b>He’s vulnerable and willing to share his shortcomings and difficulties&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p>On a number of occasions, I had the chance to hear from him about what he’s deeply struggling with. Experiences he feels ashamed about, sad, angry, and frustrated. Not only do I value this vulnerability and honesty so much in a friend, I do so even more because it is tied to a fundamental understanding in him that being with and observing these feelings of his will lead him to more insight and transformation, even if it feels like hell at the moment. To me, this always shines through, in part, because of Matthias’s ability to have learned how to express his difficult feelings and emotions both to himself and myself in a way that clearly takes responsibility for these feelings and rarely do I notice him projecting them onto others, even if he notices the triggers from others.</p>
<p>In particular, I’m valuing how he’s able to come to me about difficulties and his own shortcomings in our own relationship, something that is on a whole other level of intensity, and most people I know wouldn’t do that and leave it under the rug or sever ties instead. His capacity to hold that intensity and fear in the body and still come to me about moments where he felt hurt or where he felt he didn’t live up to his own ideals in our relationship are amongst the most powerful moments I can remember, where I’ve learned so much from him and his honesty.</p>
<h2><b>He’s curious about my life and my explorations&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p>With the success in my life, I’ve had plenty of people reach out to me and want to connect to me over the years. There is no one I can remember however that has consistently been so curious and interested in me and my way of living in the way that Matthias has been. I’ve experienced this in a form where he has no agenda whatsoever other than wishing to stay up to date with my inner world for the sake of genuine connection. I find this incredibly rare and I sometimes wonder where he learned that skill.</p>
<p>Most people have told me they have a sense I live a fast life, where I have many new ideas and experiences and projects that develop fast. To keep up with that and stay interested in the twists and turns, particularly when one idea isn’t quite relevant to me anymore and I’ve moved on to a new one is something that helps me feel deeply held and connected. Some people see what I produce along the way, and through my work and writing, some also see glimpses of my inner world and churnings. Outside of Matthias, there is maybe only 1 or 2 other people in my life that have exposure to the rapid-fire inner world changes on the regular and it gives me a deep sense of being known.</p>
<h2><b>He’s unfazed by my strong ideas and opinions but not untouched&nbsp;</b></h2>
<p>I celebrate my newfound insights and beliefs with great excitement and candor, to a degree where I’ve heard that it can feel overwhelming for others often. What I value so deeply when it comes to my friendship with Matthias is that he’s deeply able to hear about my celebrations and strong views and opinions, without feeling swept away by them or rocked in his own core set of beliefs. I believe that this requires a deep level of self-confidence and self-esteem that in my path of life I’ve witnessed in a shockingly low amount of people over the years.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean that he isn’t touched by the things I’m sharing with him that I’ve learned and uncovered. Often, he tells me about how this or that conversation inspired him to look at certain aspects of his life again and rethink the parts that we touched on in our talks. This is wildly different from the above point but shows a genuine curiosity and willingness to let new ideas enter one’s life, without using it as a moment to completely question one’s whole identity.</p>
<p>This is a fine balance and fine line often, but walking it well, makes Matthias such a great and trusted friend for me.</p>
<h2><b>He’s able to hold his own</b></h2>
<p>I love making space for the dear people in my life to listen to them and to help them resolve something meaningful and difficult. I also love it when I see them tell me about a difficult experience that they worked through on their own and told me about afterward. To me, this is a profound expression of someone’s self-reliance and independence, and something I value deeply. With Matthias, I feel almost proud and grateful to hear him share about moments where he went through his own darkness and faced it on his own to tell the tale of it afterward.</p>
<p>It reminds me of my own capacity to be with my own difficulty where I can, without …</p></div></div></section></div>

              <p><span>On</span><span>&nbsp;September 3, 2020, Voatz — a blockchain voting company with a publicly </span><span>documented track record of </span><span>hostility</span><span>&nbsp;towards security research</span><sup><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;— filed an </span><span>amicus brief</span><span>&nbsp;with t</span><span>he U.S. Supreme Court in </span><span>Van Buren v. United States</span><span>&nbsp;arguing in favor of a broad interpretation of the </span><span>Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA)</span><span>, the federal anti-hacking law enacted in 1986</span><span>.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span>,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Voatz’s amicus brief repeatedly refers to independent good-faith security research as a threat to cybersecurity</span><span>&nbsp;and glosses over </span><span>harmful effects to security research that would result from an overbroad CFAA.</span></p>
              
              <p><span>As representatives of the security community, including pioneers of coordinated vulnerability disclosure, bug bounties, </span><span>and election security</span><span>, it is our opinion that Voatz’s brief to the Court fundamentally misrepresents widely accepted practices in security research and vulnerability disclosure, and that the broad interpretation of the CFAA threatens security research activities at a national level. We stand in support of the </span><span>petitioner</span><span>, reiterating arguments </span><span>made by the </span><span>Computer Security Researchers, Electronic Frontier Foundation, et al.</span><span>,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Orin S. Kerr</span><span>,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Technology Companies</span><span>,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and many others </span><span>advocating</span><span>&nbsp;a narrow interpretation of </span><span>the CFAA in which contractual violations do not constitute CFAA violations</span><span>.</span></p>
              
              
              <p><b>Security research is vital to the public interest.</b></p>
              
              <p><span>W</span><span>e</span><span>&nbsp;benefit from security research in nearly every aspect of our lives. From crucial work exposing vulnerabilities in technologies ranging from </span><span>election </span><span>systems</span><sup><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;to</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>medical devices</span><sup><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and automobiles,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;it is clear security research has tangibly improved the safety and security of systems we depend upon. It is not a given that this vital security work will continue. A broad interpretation of the CFAA would magnify existing chilling effects, even when there exists a societal obligation to perform such research.</span></p>
              
              <p><span>Coordinated vulnerability disclosure (CVD) is a standard, widely adopted practice in which the public may engage in the process of security research and safely report vulnerabilities to organizations. Under CVD, researchers give organizations a </span><span>reasonable</span><span>&nbsp;set timeframe to fix a vulnerability before disclosing it publicly; organizations in turn agree to consider such activities authorized and not take legal action against such research. </span><span>Hundreds</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>of</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>private sector entities</span><span>,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt10" id="ftnt_ref10">[10]</a></sup><span>,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt11" id="ftnt_ref11">[11]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;including leading technology companies and </span><span>election vendors</span><span>,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt12" id="ftnt_ref12">[12]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;as well as government o</span><span>rganizations including the </span><span>U.S. Department of Defense</span><sup><a href="#ftnt13" id="ftnt_ref13">[13]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and the </span><span>U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission</span><span>,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt14" id="ftnt_ref14">[14]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;operate vulnerability disclosure programs to provide a channel for receiving vulnerability reports from security researchers and authorize such testing. </span><span>A recent directive from the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)</span><span>&nbsp;has adopted these best practices, requiring every federal civilian executive branch agency to establish a vulnerability disclosure program authorizing security research against their</span><span>&nbsp;live internet-accessible systems.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup></p>
              
              <p><span>Vulnerability disclosure policies and bug bounties help mitigate, but do not solve, the broader chilling effects of the law toward security research. As we explore below, a company claiming to offer safe harbor through a vulnerability disclosure policy may still take legal action against security researchers. </span><span>Likewise</span><span>, under a broad interpretation of the CFAA, a failure to comply with any component of a vulnerability disclosure policy would itself constitute a contractual violation, and hence a CFAA violation, even if the policy specifically authorizes testing.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Even when a company abides by its vulnerability disclosure policy’s safe harbor, that promise only binds the company itself.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The reach of that protection is insufficient since security research can often involve a company’s vendors or third-party services. The fact that the Department of Justice has provided </span><span>guidance on establishing vulnerability disclosure programs</span><sup><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;and acknowledged that the CFAA remains an issue for conducting good-faith security research on systems</span><sup><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;(research that is otherwise authorized under the </span><span>Digital Millennium Copyright Act, o</span><span>r </span><span>DMCA</span><sup><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span>) only further exemplifies the difficult reality of navigating the CFAA. Individual companies should not need to address these intricacies when seeking to authorize testing on their systems.</span></p>
              
              <p><span>Voatz acts in bad faith </span><span>towards </span><span>coordinated</span><span>&nbsp;vulnerability </span><span>disclosure</span><span>. </span></p>
              
              <p><span>There is great irony in the fact that Voatz’s own interactions with researchers highlight the need for CFAA reform; Voatz’s actions demonstrate how firms are not necessarily incentivized to behave well. A firm acting in bad faith should not subject a good-faith researcher to legal action.</span></p>
              
              <p><span>In coordinated vulnerability disclosure, both parties agree to play by established rules in order to improve the state of security, and Voatz has not followed the rules of its own policies. In 2019, as acknowledged by the company in its court brief, Voatz </span><span>referred a student security researcher to state authorities</span><span>&nbsp;for what its CEO alleged was</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>“unauthorized activity</span><span>.”</span><sup><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Voatz took this action despite purporting to </span><span>offer a safe harbor as part of its bug bounty program</span><span>, which stated at the time of the student’s testing </span><span>that</span><span>&nbsp;“[a]ny activities conducted in a manner consistent with this policy will be considered authorized conduct and we will not initiate legal action against you.”</span><sup><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;Shortly after news of this incident became public, Voatz </span><span>retroactively</span><span>&nbsp;updated its safe harbor</span><span>&nbsp;to disallow the student’s activity.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup></p>
              
              <p><span>In </span><span>Voatz’s amicus brief</span><span>, the company states that it reported the </span><span>student</span><span>&nbsp;to state authorities because they “did not seek any prior authorization privately or through Voatz’s public bug bounty </span><span>program</span><span>.”</span><sup><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In truth, </span><span>Voatz</span><span>’s public bug bounty program authorized any member of the public to report vulnerabilities to Voatz without needing to seek prior authorization.</span></p>
              
              <p><span>Many signatories of this letter have </span><span>operated</span><span>&nbsp;and participated in public bug bounty programs, in both the private sector and government. We can attest that requiring researchers to obtain prior authorization for a public bug bounty program is </span><span>non-standard and</span><span>&nbsp;discourages participation. In March, </span><span>HackerOne</span><span>&nbsp;(a signatory of this letter) </span><span>removed Voatz from its bug bounty platform</span><span>, citing Voatz’s failure to act in “good faith” towards researchers.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;This marked the </span><span>first time in the platform’s history</span><span>&nbsp;that a company was removed.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup></p>
              
              <p><span>A </span><span>security assessment of Voatz published by MIT researchers</span><span>&nbsp;in February is a model example of coordinated vulnerability disclosure.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;The r</span><span>esearchers took care not to enter legal gray areas, </span><span>only </span><span>reverse</span><span>&nbsp;engineering the client of the Voatz app.</span><span>&nbsp;After discovering a slew of worrying vulnerabilities, the researchers followed standard coordinated disclosure procedures, working with CISA to disclose and then </span><span>giving</span><span>&nbsp;Voatz adequate time to fix the vulnerabilities identified before publicly releasing the research. Despite a </span><span>report by the independent security firm Trail of Bits (a signatory of this letter), </span><span>commissioned by Voatz, that confirmed </span><span>the MIT researchers’ findings as valid vulnerabilities,</span><sup><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;</span><span>Voatz would later dispute</span><span>&nbsp;both the MIT assessment and the confirmation by Trail of </span><span>Bits</span><span>.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup></p>
              
              <p><span>Despite the MIT researchers’ extensive efforts to perform and disclose their work in </span><span>good faith</span><span>, Voatz claims in its brief that the research was conducted “on an unauthorized basis” and that such “unauthorized research and public dissemination of unvalidated or theoretical security vulnerabilities can actually cause harmful effects.” To be clear, the MIT team did not need authorization to </span><span>perform</span><span>&nbsp;or publish their work, as the research was protected by the </span><span>2018 DMCA</span><span>&nbsp;security research exemption</span><span>&nbsp;and did not violate the CFAA as no systems owned or operated by Voatz were ever accessed</span><span>&nbsp;in</span><span>&nbsp;the course of security testing.</span><sup><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;In this case, the MIT researchers upheld the principles of coordinated vulnerability disclosure by first disclosing the vulnerability to Voatz. </span><span>Voatz responded to this act of good-faith coordinated vulnerability disclosure by claiming that the MIT researchers’ activities were conducted on an “unauthorized basis,” implying that they “knowingly </span><span>exceed</span><span>[ed] their authorized access to a computer system.”</span></p>
              
              <p><span>Voatz’s insinuation that the researchers broke the law despite having taken all precautions to act in good faith and respect legal boundaries shows why authorization for this research should not hinge on companies themselves acting in good faith.</span><span>&nbsp;To companies</span><span>&nbsp;like Voatz, coordinated vulnerability disclosure is a mechanism that shields the company from public scrutiny by allowing it to control the process of security research. The fact that the MIT researchers discovered vulnerabilities that reflect poorly on Voatz’s security only underscores the need for public scrutiny — what is simply a hassle to Voatz is a crucial warning flare to </span><span>the public.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
              
              <p><span>We support efforts to strengthen security research.</span></p>
              
              <p><span>We </span><span>reiterate</span><span>&nbsp;our support for the petitioner and the amicus briefs of EFF et al., Orin S. Kerr, Technology Companies, and many others. The work of security researchers is vital to the public interest, and a broad interpretation of the CFAA chills such security research. Voatz’s self-interested amicus brief should not be persuasive to this important case; it ignores the overwhelmingly positive and necessary role played by security researchers.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>If anything, …</span></p></div></section></div></div>

September 14, 2020 | https://swimm.io/blog/2020-07-14-who%E2%80%99s-mentoring-the-mentor/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://swimm.io/blog/2020-07-14-who%E2%80%99s-mentoring-the-mentor/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-v-61c0ab88=""> <!----> <div data-v-75e492e5="" data-v-61c0ab88=""><div><p>Anyone who has ever queried information about developer onboarding, could notice right away, what we at Swimm call ‘The Onboardee Bias’. Most onboarding approaches are centered on guiding new hires through their first days, tasks or overcoming the hurdles of getting started. But this approach rarely highlights the troubles and challenges of the mentors*. While we frequently hear about the “Sink or Swim” approach by which new engineers are “thrown into the deep end” with hands-on tasks on their first day in, the truth is, mentors are also treated this way, although unintentionally with no buoy waiting for them.</p>
<p>Mentors are, by definition, some of the more experienced and confident engineers on the team, so it’s almost counter intuitive to highlight their insecurities. Yet, our experience is that this is in-fact the core problem of engineer onboarding.** <strong>In this post we try to shed light on the role of the mentor in the onboarding process:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>‘The Good Mentor Checklist’</li>
<li>How Poor Mentorship Reflects in Business</li>
<li>Mentoring the Mentor 101</li>
</ul>
<p><em>* By ‘mentors’ we mean experienced engineers tasked with onboarding a new hire, sometimes also called “buddies” among engineering teams.</em></p>
<p><em>** There are some awesome onboarding experiences out there. We are not saying they don’t exist. But our experience is that they are not the norm.</em></p>
<h2>1. ‘The Good Mentor Checklist’</h2>
<p>The journey to good mentorship starts with reflecting on your own experiences (as a mentor or mentee). Form a list with some of the tools and traits of a super successful mentor, and then try to map out the hurdles - why do some mentors fail to thrive? Here are some key reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time.</strong> Or lack of it. It’s no coincidence that most mentors are extremely busy. Knowing their way around means they get picked for harder tasks. Good mentorship requires ample time and patience, and many mentors lack those.</li>
<li><strong>Good Documentation.</strong> So much has been written and said about how challenging it is to create and maintain good documentation. Suffice to say that a mentor’s life would be much easier with it, and it rarely exists.</li>
<li><strong>Mentorship Skills.</strong> If you have been picked to be a mentor (congrats), you are likely very experienced and know your way around the company or code. But being a really good mentor means you also need an entire skill-set associated with mentorship such as leadership skills, best practices, up to date training techniques, and more.</li>
<li><strong>A Realistic Plan.</strong> While most organisations create a basic onboarding plan for the first few days on the job, this plan consists mostly of HR issues and basic orientation. Our experience shows that most teams don’t have a plan for onboarding the new hires onto the codebase, explaining common issues, legacy code, best practice or edge cases. If they do, it’s a basic checklist.</li>
<li><strong>Passion for apprenticeship</strong>. It goes without saying that a little passion for paying it forward and teaching others, goes a long way and makes all the difference between a mentor and a really good mentor. A major hurdle is identifying such spirit in mentors and leveraging it, but also making sure they don’t burn out.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. How Poor Mentorship Reflects in Business</h2>
<p>So we have established some key elements needed for the job. We also established that many times, mentors, experienced and competent as they may be, are not properly prepared for the task.</p>
<p>How does this affect our job and business?</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Swiveling Chair Syndrome</strong>. Getting a task you feel unqualified for, might lead many mentors - even potentially great ones to procrastinate. Preparations for the new hire are pushed to the day before their arrival, and sometimes happen on-the-go. The result of which - talented new engineers swiveling in their chairs for quite some time, waiting for something to happen…(or in other words, stretched out time-to-value).</li>
<li><strong>System malfunctions</strong>. Another unfortunate product could be finger-pointing and blaming “the system”. Feeling embarrassed with their inadequacy, mentors might vent hints of frustration with the new hire: “Yeah, there’s some documentation, but I wouldn’t bother with it… Just try to figure it out…” or “They told me you were coming last week, but we have a version coming out, so I guess you’ll have to manage…”. Of course, these are the last things you want new hires to hear in their first few weeks.</li>
<li><strong>Sinking, not swimming</strong>. We mentioned the “sink or swim” approach earlier. Sure, letting new hires struggle with no help is a way to weed out weaker hires, and it may shorten the time it takes to spot a poor fit. But this also means you are giving the good hires a hard time, sending them to fend for themselves. This method is often used to mask insecurity. Rather than admitting you don’t know how to deal with onboarding someone, it is much easier to explain a lack of a plan with ideology. So, even if this method is not beneficial in the long run, unprepared mentors might adopt it anyway.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>3. Mentoring the Mentor 101</strong></h2>
<p>So, what can you do about this naturally occurring bias?</p>
<p>Like with other issues, acknowledging there is a problem (i.e. that mentors are being overlooked) is a good starting point. Ask senior developers how prepared they were or currently feel to mentor. Ask them how their own onboarding was like, and whether they would have wanted it to be different. Recall your own onboarding experiences, both as a mentor and a new hire. But mainly, focus on cultivating a culture of knowledge sharing, and creating a tier of mentors equipped with the best tools to handle their next mentoring assignment.</p>

Our Standard Support plan now includes consultancy calls</p><!-- --> <p><a href="https://www.graphile.org/support/">Get support</a></p></div></div><div><div><div><div><div><h2>Introduction</h2><div><p>
PostGraphile (formerly PostGraphQL) builds a powerful, extensible and
performant GraphQL API from a PostgreSQL schema in seconds; saving you
weeks if not months of development time.
</p>
<p>If you already use PostgreSQL then you understand the value that a strongly
typed and well defined schema can bring to application development; GraphQL is
the perfect match for this technology when it comes to making your data layer
accessible to your frontend application developers (or even API clients). Why
duplicate your authorization and business logic in a custom API when you can
leverage the tried and tested capabilities built into
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">the worlds most advanced open source database</a>?</p>
<p><em>If you are new to GraphQL then we recommend you read through the official
introduction to GraphQL <a href="https://graphql.org/learn/">here</a> before continuing
through the PostGraphile documentation.</em></p>
<p>By combining powerful features such as PostgreSQL's
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/user-manag.html">role-based grant system</a>
and
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-rowsecurity.html">row-level security policies</a>
with Graphile Engine's advanced
<a href="https://www.graphile.org/graphile-build/look-ahead/">GraphQL look-ahead</a> and
<a href="https://www.graphile.org/graphile-build/plugins/">plugin expansion</a> technologies, PostGraphile ensures
your generated schema is secure, performant and extensible.</p>
<p>Some of the features we offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/performance/">Incredible performance</a> - no N+1 query issues</li>
<li>Extensibility via <a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/extending/">schema</a> and
<a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/plugins/">server</a> plugins</li>
<li><a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/relations/">Auto-discovered relations</a> e.g. <code>userByAuthorId</code></li>
<li><a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/computed-columns/">Computed columns</a> allowing easy expansion of
your API</li>
<li><a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/custom-queries/">Custom query procedures</a> enabling arbitrary
SQL queries</li>
<li><a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/crud-mutations/">Automatic CRUD mutations</a> e.g. <code>updatePost</code></li>
<li><a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/custom-mutations/">Custom mutation procedures</a> enabling complex
changes to be exposed simply</li>
<li><a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/realtime/">Real-time</a> features powered by LISTEN/NOTIFY and/or
logical decoding</li>
</ul>
<p>The easiest way to get started is with the
<a href="https://www.graphile.org/postgraphile/usage-cli/">CLI interface</a>; if you have <code>npx</code> installed you can
try it out with:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>npx postgraphile -c postgres://user:<a href="https://www.graphile.org/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="5c2c3d2f2f1c30333f3d3034332f28">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>/mydb --watch --enhance-graphiql --dynamic-json</code></pre></div>
<p>(replacing user, pass and mydb with your PostgreSQL username, password and the
name of your database)</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section></section></div></div>]]>

According to direction of the data moved, the connector is classified as:</p><ul><li><code>Source Connector</code>: Reads data from a datasource and writes to Kafka topic.</li><li><code>Sink Connector</code>: Reads data from Kafka topic and writes to a datasource.</li></ul><p>Kafka Connect uses connector plugins that are community developed libraries to provide most common data movement cases. Mostly developers need to implement migration between same data sources, such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, Cassandra, MongoDB, Redis, JDBC, FTP, MQTT, Couchbase, REST API, S3, ElasticSearch. Kafka plugins provides the standardised implementation for moving the data from those datastores. Find all available Kafka Connectors on <a href="https://www.confluent.io/hub/">Confluent Hub</a>.</p><p>So what Kafka Connect provides is that rather than writing our own Consumer or Producer code, we can use a Connector that takes care of all the implementation details such as fault tolerance, delivery semantics, ordering etc. and get the data moved. For example we can move all of the data from Postgres database to Kafka and from Kafka to ElasticSearch without writing code. It makes it easy for non-experienced developers to get the data in or out of Kafka reliably.</p><h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2><p>Connector plugins implement the connector API that includes connectors and tasks.</p><ul><li><code>Connector</code>: is a job that manages and coordinates the tasks. It decides how to split the data-copying work between the tasks.</li><li><code>Task</code>: is piece of work that provides service to accomplish actual job. </li></ul><p>Connectors divide the actual job into smaller pieces as tasks in order to have the ability to scalability and fault tolerance. The state of the tasks is stored in special Kafka topics, and it is configured with <code>offset.storage.topic</code>, <code>config.storage.topic</code> and <code>status.storage.topic</code>. As the task does not keep its state it can be started, stopped and restarted at any time or nodes.</p><p>For example JDBC Connector is used to copy data from databases and it creates task per each table in the database.</p><ul><li><code>Worker</code>: is the node that is running the connector and its tasks. &nbsp;</li></ul><p>Kafka Connect workers executes 2 types of working modes:</p><ul><li><code>Standalone mode</code>: All work is performed in a single worker as single process. It is easier to setup and configure and can be useful where using single worker makes sense. However it does not provide fault tolerance or scalability.</li><li><code>Distributed mode</code>: Multiple workers are in a cluster. Configured by REST API. Provides scalability and fault tolerance. When one connector dies, its tasks are redistributed by rebalance mechanism among other workers.</li></ul><h2 id="running-kafka-connect">Running Kafka Connect</h2><p>Kafka Connect ships with Apache Kafka binaries. So there is no need to install it separately, but in order to run it we need to <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/downloads">download Kafka binaries</a>. The executables are in the bin directory and configurations are in the config directory.</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-13-at-16.13.47.png"></figure><p>I personally would prefer you to start practising with distributed mode as it is gets unnecessarily confusing if you work with the standalone and after switch to distributed mode. Also it is recommended to use distributed mode in production, and if we don't want to have a cluster we can run only 1 worker in distributed mode. </p><h3 id="1-running-kafka-cluster">1 - Running Kafka Cluster</h3><p>Let's start with getting a Kafka cluster up and running. We can set up a cluster with one zookepeer and one broker in docker environment with using the following docker compose file. </p><pre><code>version: '2'
services:
  zookeeper:
    image: confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:latest
    hostname: zookeeper
    container_name: zookeeper
    ports:
      - "2181:2181"
    environment:
      ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT: 2181
      ZOOKEEPER_TICK_TIME: 2000

  kafka:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka:latest
    hostname: kafka
    container_name: kafka
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    ports:
      - "9092:9092"
      - "29092:29092"
    environment:
      KAFKA_BROKER_ID: 1
      KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT: zookeeper:2181
      KAFKA_LISTENER_SECURITY_PROTOCOL_MAP: PLAINTEXT:PLAINTEXT,PLAINTEXT_HOST:PLAINTEXT
      KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS: PLAINTEXT://kafka:9092,PLAINTEXT_HOST://localhost:29092
      KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR: 1</code></pre><p>Run the <code>docker-compose up -d</code> command to start the containers. One thing to pay attention here is that <code>KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS</code> are set to be <code>localhost:29092</code> for outside of docker network, and <code>kafka:9092</code> for inside the docker network. So from out host machine we can access kafka instance with <code>localhost:29092</code>.</p><h3 id="2-running-kafka-connect">2 - Running Kafka Connect</h3><p>We can run the Kafka Connect with <code>connect-distributed.sh</code> script that is located inside the kafka <code>bin</code> directory. We need to provide a properties file while running this script for configuring the worker properties. </p><pre><code>connect-distributed.sh &lt;worker properties file&gt;</code></pre><p>We can create create <code>connect-distributed.properties</code> file to specify the worker properties as follows:</p><pre><code># A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster.
bootstrap.servers=localhost:29092

# unique name for the cluster, used in forming the Connect cluster group. Note that this must not conflict with consumer group IDs
group.id=connect-cluster

# The converters specify the format of data in Kafka and how to translate it into Connect data. 
key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter
value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter
key.converter.schemas.enable=true
value.converter.schemas.enable=true

# Topic to use for storing offsets. This topic should have many partitions and be replicated and compacted.
offset.storage.topic=connect-offsets
offset.storage.replication.factor=1

# Topic to use for storing connector and task configurations; note that this should be a single partition, highly replicated,
config.storage.topic=connect-configs
config.storage.replication.factor=1

# Topic to use for storing statuses. This topic can have multiple partitions and should be replicated and compacted.
status.storage.topic=connect-status
status.storage.replication.factor=1

# Flush much faster than normal, which is useful for testing/debugging
offset.flush.interval.ms=10000</code></pre><p><code>group.id</code> is one of the most important configuration in this file. Worker groups are created according to group id. So if we start multiple worker with same group id, they will be in the same worker cluster.</p><p><code>offset.storage.topic</code>, <code>config.storage.topic</code> and <code>status.storage.topic</code> configurations are also needed so that worker status will be stored in Kafka topics and new workers or restarted workers will be managed accordingly.</p><p>Now we can start Kafka connect with the following command:</p><pre><code>connect-distributed.sh /path-to-config/connect-distributed.properties</code></pre><h3 id="3-starting-connector">3 - Starting Connector</h3><p>Now we have Zookeeper, Kafka broker, and Kafka Connect running in distributed mode. As it is mentioned before, in distributed mode, connectors are manages by REST API. Our connector exposed REST API at <a href="http://localhost:8083/">http://localhost:8083/</a>.</p><p>As an example, we can run a <code>FileStreamSource</code> connector that copies data from a file to Kafka topic. To start a connector we need to send a POST call to <a href="http://localhost:8083/connectors">http://localhost:8083/connectors</a> endpoint with the configuration of the Connector that we want to run. Example configuration for Connector looks like as follows:</p><pre><code>{
  "name": "local-file-source",
  "config": {
    "connector.class": "FileStreamSource",
    "tasks.max": 1,
    "file": "/Users/cemalturkoglu/kafka/shared-folder/file.txt",
    "topic": "file.content"
  }
}
</code></pre><p>Every connector may have its own specific configurations, and these configurations can be found in the connector's Confluent Hub page.</p><ul><li><code>connector.class</code> specifies the connector plugin that we want to use. </li><li><code>file</code> is a specific config for <code>FileStreamSource</code> plugin, and it is used to point the file to be read.</li><li><code>topic</code> is the name of the topic that the data read from file will be written to.</li></ul><p>We need to send this json config in the content body of REST call. We can read this config from file for <code>curl</code> command as follows:</p><pre><code>curl -d @"connect-file-source.json" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-X POST http://localhost:8083/connectors</code></pre><p>After this call connector starts running, it reads data from the file and send to the kafka topic which is <code>file.content</code> in the example. If we start a consumer to this topic: </p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-14-at-13.41.00.png"></figure><p>We can see that every line in the file.txt is send to Kafka topic as a message. Note that <code>key.converter.schemas.enable</code> and <code>value.converter.schemas.enable</code> is set to be true for the worker at the beginning. So messages are wrapped with Json schema. </p><p>In order to scale up the worker cluster, you need to follow the same steps of running Kafka Connect and starting Connector on each worker (All workers should have same group id). The high level overview of the architecture looks like as follows:</p><figure><img src="https://turkogluc.com/content/images/2020/09/Screenshot-2020-09-14-at-14.49.33.png"><figcaption>Kafka Connect Overview</figcaption></figure><h2 id="running-kafka-connect-in-docker">Running Kafka Connect in Docker</h2><p>In the above example Kafka cluster was being run in Docker but we started the Kafka Connect in the host machine with Kafka binaries. If you wish to run Kafka Connect in Docker container as well, you need a linux image that has Java 8 installed and you can download the Kafka and use <code>connect-distribued.sh</code> script to run it. For a very simple example, you can use the following Dockerfile to run workers:</p><pre><code>FROM openjdk:8-jre-slim

RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; \
    apt-get install wget -y

COPY start.sh start.sh
COPY connect-distributed.properties connect-distributed.properties

RUN echo "Downloading Apache Kafka" &amp;&amp; \
    wget "http://ftp.man.poznan.pl/apache/kafka/2.6.0/kafka_2.12-2.6.0.tgz" &amp;&amp;\
    tar -xzvf kafka*.tgz &amp;&amp; \
    rm kafka*.tgz &amp;&amp; \
    mv kafka* kafka &amp;&amp; \
    export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd)kafka/bin"


CMD /kafka/bin/connect-distributed.sh connect-distributed.properties</code></pre><p>You can customise the Dockerfile according to your needs and improve it or you can use Confluent's Kafka Connect image by adding it to the docker-compose file as follows:</p><pre><code>connect:
    image: confluentinc/cp-kafka-connect:latest
  …</code></pre></div></div>

<p> <em>Obligatory disclaimer: all opinions are mine and not of my employer </em></p>
<hr>

<p>Many users of Python deprioritize performance in favor of soft benefits like ergonomics, business value, and simplicity. Users who prioritize performance typically end up on faster compiled languages like C++ or Java.</p>
<p>One group of users is left behind, though. The scientific computing community has lots of raw data they need to process, and would very much like performance. Yet, they struggle to move away from Python, because of network effects, and because Python’s beginner-friendliness is appealing to scientists for whom programming is not a first language. So, how can Python users achieve some fraction of the performance that their C++ and Java friends enjoy?</p>
<p>In practice, scientific computing users rely on the NumPy family of libraries e.g.&nbsp;NumPy, SciPy, TensorFlow, PyTorch, CuPy, JAX, etc.. The sheer proliferation of these libraries suggests that the NumPy model is getting something right. In this essay, I’ll talk about what makes NumPy so effective, and where the next generation of Python numerical computing libraries (e.g.&nbsp;TensorFlow, PyTorch, JAX) seems to be headed.</p>
<h2 id="data-good-pointers-bad">Data good, pointers bad</h2>
<p>A pesky fact of computing is that computers can compute far faster than we can deliver data to compute on. In particular, data transfer <em>latency</em> is the Achille’s heel of data devices (both RAM and storage). Manufacturers disguise this weakness by emphasizing improvements in data transfer <em>throughput</em>, but latency continues to stagnate. Ultimately, this means that any chained data access patterns, where one data retrieval must be completed before the next may proceed, are the worst case for computers.</p>
<p>These worst-case chained data access patterns are unfortunately quite common – so common that they have a name you may be familiar with: a pointer.</p>
<p>Pointers have always been slow. In the ’80s and ’90s, our hard drives were essentially optimized record players, with a read head riding on top of a spinning platter. These hard drives had physical limitations: The disk could only spin so fast without shattering, and the read head was also mechanical, limiting its movement speed. Disk seeks were slow, and the programs that were most severely affected were databases. Some ways that databases dealt with these physical limitations are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of using binary trees (requiring <span>\(\log_2 N\)</span> disk seeks), B-trees with a much higher branching factor <span>\(k\)</span> were used, only requiring <span>\(\log_k N\)</span> disk seeks.</li>
<li>Indices were used to query data without having to read the full contents of each row.</li>
<li>Vertically-oriented databases optimized for read-heavy workloads (e.g.&nbsp;summary statistics over one field, across entire datasets), by reorganizing from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA">arrays of structs to structs of arrays</a>. This maximized effective disk throughput, since no extraneous data was loaded.</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, compute speed is roughly <span>\(10^5 - 10^6\)</span> times faster than in 1990. Today, RAM is roughly <span>\(10^5\)</span> times faster than HDDs from 1990. I was amused and unsurprised to find that Raymond Hettinger’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npw4s1QTmPg">excellent talk on the evolution of Python’s in-memory <code>dict</code> implementation</a> plays out like a brief history of early database design. Time, rather than healing things, has only worsened the compute-memory imbalance.</p>
<h2 id="numpys-optimizations">NumPy’s optimizations</h2>
<h3 id="boxing-costs">Boxing costs</h3>
<p>In many higher-level languages, raw data comes in boxes containing metadata and a pointer to the actual data. In Python, the PyObject box holds reference counts, so that the garbage collector can operate generically on all Python entities.</p>
<p>Boxing creates two sources of inefficiency:</p>
<ul>
<li>The metadata bloats the data, reducing the data density of our expensive memory.</li>
<li>The pointer indirection creates another round trip of memory retrieval latency.</li>
</ul>
<p>A NumPy array can hold many raw data within a single PyObject box, <em>provided that all of those data are of the same type</em> (int32, float32, etc.). By doing this, NumPy amortizes the cost of boxing over multiple data.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/deep_dive_mcts">my previous investigations into Monte Carlo tree search</a>, a naive UCT implementation performed poorly because it instantiated millions of UCTNode objects whose sole purpose was to hold a handful of float32 values. In the optimized UCT implementation, these nodes were replaced with NumPy arrays, reducing memory usage by a factor of 30.</p>
<h3 id="attribute-lookup-function-dispatch-costs">Attribute lookup / function dispatch costs</h3>
<p>Python’s language design forces an unusually large amount of pointer chasing. I mentioned boxing as one layer of pointer indirection, but really it’s just the tip of the iceberg.</p>
<p>Python has no problem handling the following code, even though each of these multiplications invokes a completely different implementation.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; mixed_list = [1, 1.0, 'foo', ('bar',)]
&gt;&gt;&gt; for obj in mixed_list:
...     print(obj * 2)

2
2.0
'foofoo'
('bar', 'bar')</code></pre>
<p>Python accomplishes this with a minimum of two layers of pointer indirection:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Look up the type of the object.</li>
<li>Look up and execute the <code>__mul__</code> function from that type’s operation registry.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional layers of pointer indirection may be required if the <code>__mul__</code> method is defined on a superclass: the chain of superclasses must be traversed, one pointer at a time, until an implementation is found.</p>
<p>Attribute lookup is similarly fraught; <code>@property</code>, <code>__getattr__</code>, and <code>__getattribute__</code> provide users with flexibility that incurs pointer chasing overhead with something as simple as executing <code>a.b</code>. Access patterns like <code>a.b.c.d</code> create exactly the chained data access patterns that are a worst-case for data retrieval latency.</p>
<p>To top it all off, merely <em>resolving</em> the object is expensive: there’s a stack of lexical scopes (local, nonlocal, then global) that are checked in order to find the variable name. Each check requires a dictionary lookup, another source of pointer indirection.</p>
<p>As the saying goes: “We can solve any problem by introducing an extra level of indirection… except for the problem of too many levels of indirection”. The NumPy family of libraries deals with this indirection, not by removing it, but again by sharing its cost over multiple data.</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; homogenous_array = np.arange(5, dtype=np.float32)
&gt;&gt;&gt; multiply_by_two = homogenous_array * 2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(multiply_by_two)
array([ 0.,  2.,  4.,  6.,  8.], dtype=float32)</code></pre>
<p>Sharing a single box for multiple data allows NumPy to retain the expressiveness of Python while minimizing the cost of the dynamism. As before, this works because of the additional constraint that all data in a NumPy array must have identical type.</p>
<h2 id="the-frontier-jit">The Frontier: JIT</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve seen that NumPy doesn’t solve any of Python’s fundamental problems when it comes to pointer overhead. Instead, it merely puts a bandaid on the problem by sharing those costs across multiple data. It’s a pretty successful strategy – in my hands (<a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/vectorized_pagerank">1</a>, <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/deep_dive_mcts">2</a>), I find that NumPy can typically achieve 30-60x speedups over pure Python solutions to dense numerical code. However, given that C code typically achieves <a href="https://www.moderndescartes.com/essays/data_oriented_python/(https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/python3-gcc.html)">100-200x performance</a> over pure Python on dense numerical code (common in scientific computing), it would be nice if we could further reduce the Python overhead.</p>
<p>Tracing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_compilation">JITs</a> promise to do exactly this. Roughly, the strategy is to trace the execution of the code and record the pointer chasing outcomes. Then, when you call the same code snippet, reuse the recorded outcomes! NumPy amortizes Python overhead over multiple data, and JIT amortizes Python overhead over multiple function calls.</p>
<p>(I should note that I’m most familiar with the tracing JITs used by TensorFlow and JAX. <a href="https://doc.pypy.org/en/latest/">PyPy</a> and <a href="https://numba.pydata.org/">Numba</a> are two alternate JIT implementations that have a longer history, but I don’t know enough about them to treat them fairly, so my apologies to readers.)</p>
<p>Tracing unlocks many wins typically reserved for compiled languages. For example, once you have the entire trace in one place, operations can be fused together (e.g., to make use of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FMA_instruction_set">fused multiply-add instructions</a> common to most modern computers), memory layouts can be optimized, and so on. TensorFlow’s <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/graph_optimization">Grappler</a> is one such implementation of this idea. Traces can also be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backpropagation">walked backwards</a> to automatically compute derivatives. Traces can be compiled for different hardware configurations, so that the same Python code executes on CPU, GPU, and TPU. JAX can <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html#Auto-vectorization-with-vmap">autovectorize traces</a>, adding a batch dimension to all operations. Finally, a trace can be exported in a language-agnostic manner, allowing a program defined in Python to be executed in <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/js">Javascript</a>, <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide/serving">C++</a>, or more.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there’s a catch to all this. NumPy can amortize Python overhead over multiple data, but only if that data is the same type. JIT can amortize Python overhead over multiple function calls, but only if the function calls would have resulted in the same pointer chasing outcomes. Retracing the function to verify this would defeat the purpose of JIT, so instead, TensorFlow/JAX JIT uses array shape and dtype to guess at whether a trace is reusable. This heuristic is necessarily conservative, rules out otherwise legal programs, often requires unnecessarily specific shape information, and doesn’t make any guarantees against mischievous tinkering. Furthermore, data-dependent tracing is a known issue (<a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.jit.trace.html">1</a>, <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#python-control-flow-+-JIT">2</a>). I worked on <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2018/07/autograph-converts-python-into-tensorflow-graphs.html">AutoGraph</a>, a tool to address data-dependent tracing. Still, the engineering benefits of a shared tracing infrastructure are too good to pass up. I expect to see JIT-based systems flourish in the future and iron out their user experience.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>The NumPy API’s specifically addresses Python’s performance problems for the kinds of programs that scientific computing users want to write. It encourages users to write code in ways that minimize pointer overhead. Coincidentally, this way of writing code is a fruitful abstraction for tracing JITs targeting vastly parallel computing architectures like GPU and TPU. (Some people argue that <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3321441">machine learning is stuck in a rut</a> due to this NumPy monoculture.) In any case, tracing JITs built on top of …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-397" itemtype="https://schema.org/CreativeWork" itemscope="itemscope"><div><div itemprop="text"><h3>Day 1: Finally, an easy one</h3><p>Got a pretty simple task for a change – read a new type of event stream generated by sales, and publish it to the data lake. Sounds like a straightforward ETL. I estimate this as one day of work. I can reuse a bunch of code from similar jobs and maybe finish even earlier.</p><p>This input data is being spilled from Kafka to S3, as Parquet files, which is nice, but oh boy – they decided to include every possible bit of information here – 350 different columns.</p><p>I need to understand both the schema and the properties – volume, column ranges, possible values and their meaning, and decide which fields I want to extract from this.</p><p>I also need to understand the SLA for this source – how often does it update? How much could it delay?&nbsp; Is it only ever appended to – or will history change?</p><p>Another important aspect – how does it relate to other data in the org? Can I join it using the columns I have? Do I need a lookup table? Does a “user_id” mean the same thing here as it does in other collections in the organization?</p><h3>Day 2: Let’s write a Spark Job</h3><p>Once I have all these sorted out, it’s time to do something useful with this data. Let’s start by aggregating it, pruning out the uninteresting columns, and partitioning it by date. Not sure which of the six columns that look like a date I should be using.&nbsp;</p><p>Guess I’ll need to sit down with the collection team a third time.</p><p>Now that I know what transformation I want to write, I remembered I have a Spark job that does something similar – I’ll modify it for this collection.&nbsp;</p><p>Spark is so expressive – it’s only 6 lines of code!</p><p>Well, 6 lines of business logic surrounded by 120 lines of wiring and boilerplate. Still nice though.</p><h3>Days 3-5: From sample data to real, somewhat big data</h3><p>So running on a small sample looks ok, lets run it on all of yesterday’s events!</p><p>Spark basically died. I’ll now spend the next day digging through logs: Spark executors, driver, yarn, stdout and stderr. Found a weird JVM error – <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">StackOverflow</a> says I need to add some property to an xml file. Not sure I understand which one – all examples I found are for much older Hadoop versions. After 2 days of brute-forcing this setting into all possible XML files, I managed to complete successfully!</p><h3>Days 6-11: Let’s write a table</h3><p>So now, I need to think about how my output will be consumed: how often do I run it? Where do I keep its metadata? Do I provide an SLA? What guarantees do I give about the quality and validity of this dataset? Also, how do I keep it in sync with other related data? How long do I retain it for?</p><h3>Days 12-17: Going to Production</h3><p>Ok, so now we can deploy this to production!</p><p>I will write an Airflow DAG to orchestrate a daily job. When should it start? How do I know a full day is available for processing?</p><p>I’ll wait long enough and assume it’ll be fine. DAG deployed, scheduled for 3AM daily.</p><p>Maybe I’ll try to spin up a dedicated cluster on EMR?&nbsp;</p><p>4 days and 7 Zoom meetings later, I have pretty clear requirements. I think.</p><p>Last time I tried that, we ran out of IP addresses in the subnet. A time before that we hit the quota for the instance type I chose, so it couldn’t start running.</p><p>Let’s try just running it at 3:17 instead..? 🤷‍♂️</p><p>Next morning I see that our new collection is live! Airflow is green! Task is DONE.</p><p>Took only 6 lines of code, 17 Zoom meetings and 3 weeks to complete 🤦‍♀️</p><figure><img src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2.png" alt="Diary of a Data Engineer" width="597" height="336" srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2.png 960w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-300x169.png 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-768x432.png 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-24x14.png 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-36x20.png 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-48x27.png 48w" sizes="(max-width: 597px) 100vw, 597px" data-old-src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2.png" data-srcset="https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2.png 960w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-300x169.png 300w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-768x432.png 768w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-24x14.png 24w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-36x20.png 36w, https://lakefs.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Diary-2-48x27.png 48w"><figcaption>Diary of a Data Engineer</figcaption></figure><h3>Day 21: Oh no, I forgot about monitoring.</h3><p>A few days later – i’m thinking, maybe it’d be a good idea to do a quick count(*) from Athena to make sure it still looks ok.</p><p>Damn. Yesterday’s partition is only about 10% the size of previous days. I better reply-all on my go-live email and tell everyone. Not even sure who else is using this. Seems like it’s gonna be one of THOSE days again…</p><p>Coming in the next day, I see my simple Spark job has been running for 8 hours already, barely making any progress. Apparently using a shared Spark cluster wasn’t the best idea – there are 12 other jobs scheduled to start at 3AM as well. Guess everyone else also thought 3 hours after midnight was a safe bet for daily data.</p><h5><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/ozkatz100">Oz Katz</a> is the co-creator of <a href="https://docs.lakefs.io/">lakeFS</a>, an open source platform that delivers resilience and manageability to object-storage based data lakes.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The most comprehensive and compelling book on sleep I have ever read.</p><p>I am becoming convinced (aided by this book) that being able to sleep well is a huge advantage in life. This book is likely to convince you of the same.</p><p>It is a summary of scientific research on sleep to date, providing insight on how sleep affects cognitive and physical performance in both the short and long term, and what you can do improve your own sleep (which often involves avoiding things causing bad sleep).</p><p>Recommended for everyone, as sleep affects us all.</p></div><div><h2><strong>Part 1 - This Thing Called Sleep</strong></h2><h3><strong>Chapter 1 - To Sleep . . .</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>The shorter your sleep, the shorter your life span.</li><li>Sleep is the most effective thing we can do to reset our brain and body health each day.</li></ul><h3><strong>Chapter 2 - Caffeine, Jet Lag, and Melatonin</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>Your circadian rhythm is one of two factors determining wake and sleep. Melatonin helps regulate the timing of when sleep occurs by signalling darkness throughout the organism, but has little influence on the generation of sleep itself.</li><li>Sleep pressure, caused by a buildup of the chemical adenosine in your brain, is the second factor affecting sleepiness.</li><li>Caffeine works by blocking the receptors that adenosine affects (after about 30 minutes).</li><li>Some people process caffeine faster than others, and we get less efficient as we age.</li><li>To identify sleep deficiency:</li><li>If you didn’t set an alarm clock, would you wake up on time?</li><li>Do you find yourself re-reading things?</li><li>Can you function optimally before noon without caffeine?</li></ul><h3><br><strong>Chapter 3 - Defining and Generating Sleep</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>When it comes to information processing, think of the wake state principally as reception (experiencing and constantly learning the world around you), NREM sleep as reflection (storing and strengthening those raw ingredients of new facts and skills), and REM sleep as integration (interconnecting these raw ingredients with each other, with all past experiences, and, in doing so, building an ever more accurate model of how the world works, including innovative insights and problem-solving abilities).</li><li>Why did evolution decide to outlaw muscle activity during REM sleep? Because by eliminating muscle activity you are prevented from acting out your dream experience.</li></ul><h3><strong>Chapter 4 - Ape Beds, Dinosaurs, and Napping with Half a Brain</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>That humans (and all other species) can never sleep back that which we have previously lost is one of the most important take-homes of this book, the saddening consequences of which I will describe in chapters 7 and 8.</li></ul><p>How Should We Sleep?</p><ul role="list"><li>Throughout developed nations, most adults currently sleep in a monophasic pattern—that is, we try to take a long, single bout of slumber at night, the average duration of which is now less than seven hours.</li><li>Visit cultures that are untouched by electricity and you often see something rather different. Hunter-gatherer tribes, such as the Gabra in northern Kenya or the San people in the Kalahari Desert, whose way of life has changed little over the past thousands of years, sleep in a biphasic pattern. Both these groups take a similarly longer sleep period at night (seven to eight hours of time in bed, achieving about seven hours of sleep), followed by a thirty- to sixty-minute nap in the afternoon.</li><li>Apparent from this remarkable study is this fact: when we are cleaved from the innate practice of biphasic sleep, our lives are shortened. It is perhaps unsurprising that in the small enclaves of Greece where siestas still remain intact, such as the island of Ikaria, men are nearly four times as likely to reach the age of ninety as American males.</li></ul><p>REM Sleep</p><ul role="list"><li>REM sleep exquisitely recalibrates and fine-tunes the emotional circuits of the human brain (discussed in detail in part 3 of the book).</li><li>Second, and more critical, if you multiply these individual benefits within and across groups and tribes, all of which are experiencing an ever-increasing intensity and richness of REM sleep over millennia, we can start to see how this nightly REM-sleep recalibration of our emotional brains could have scaled rapidly and exponentially.</li><li>REM sleep fuels creativity.</li></ul><h3><strong>Chapter 5 - Changes in Sleep Across the Life Span</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>Alcohol is one of the most powerful suppressors of REM sleep that we know of.</li></ul><p>Childhood Sleep</p><ul role="list"><li>The changes in deep NREM sleep always precede the cognitive and developmental milestones within the brain by several weeks or months, implying a direction of influence: deep sleep may be a driving force of brain maturation, not the other way around.</li><li>We are still learning more about the role of sleep in development. However, a strong case can already be made for defending sleep time in our adolescent youth, rather than denigrating sleep as a sign of laziness.</li></ul><p>Sleep in Midlife and Old Age</p><ul role="list"><li>That older adults simply need less sleep is a myth. Older adults appear to need just as much sleep as they do in midlife, but are simply less able to generate that (still necessary) sleep.</li><li>As you enter your fourth decade of life, there is a palpable reduction in the electrical quantity and quality of that deep NREM sleep.</li><li>The second hallmark of altered sleep as we age, and one that older adults are more conscious of, is fragmentation. The older we get, the more frequently we wake up throughout the night.</li><li>Due to sleep fragmentation, older individuals will suffer a reduction in sleep efficiency, defined as the percent of time you were asleep while in bed.</li><li>As healthy teenagers, we enjoyed a sleep efficiency of about 95 percent. As a reference anchor, most sleep doctors consider good-quality sleep to involve a sleep efficiency of 90 percent or above.</li><li>Any individual, no matter what age, will exhibit physical ailments, mental health instability, reduced alertness, and impaired memory if their sleep is chronically disrupted.</li><li>The third sleep change with advanced age is that of circadian timing. In sharp contrast to adolescents, seniors commonly experience a regression in sleep timing, leading to earlier and earlier bedtimes.</li></ul><h2><strong>Part 2 - Why Should You Sleep?</strong></h2><h3><strong>Chapter 6 - Your Mother and Shakespeare Knew</strong></h3><p>The Benefits of Sleep for the Brain</p><ul role="list"><li>Of the many advantages conferred by sleep on the brain, that of memory is especially impressive, and particularly well understood. Sleep has proven itself time and again as a memory aid: both before learning, to prepare your brain for initially making new memories, and after learning, to cement those memories and prevent forgetting.</li></ul><p>Sleep for Other Types of Memory</p><ul role="list"><li>My final discovery, in what spanned almost a decade of research, identified the type of sleep responsible for the overnight motor-skill enhancement, carrying with it societal and medical lessons. The increases in speed and accuracy, underpinned by efficient automaticity, were directly related to the amount of stage 2 NREM, especially in the last two hours of an eight-hour night of sleep (e.g., from five to seven a.m., should you have fallen asleep at eleven p.m.).</li><li>Obtain anything less than eight hours of sleep a night, and especially less than six hours a night, and the following happens: time to physical exhaustion drops by 10 to 30 percent, and aerobic output is significantly reduced. Similar impairments are observed in limb extension force and vertical jump height, together with decreases in peak and sustained muscle strength. Add to this marked impairments in cardiovascular, metabolic, and respiratory capabilities that hamper an underslept body, including faster rates of lactic acid buildup, reductions in blood oxygen saturation, and converse increases in blood carbon dioxide, due in part to a reduction in the amount of air that the lungs can expire. Even the ability of the body to cool itself during physical exertion through sweating - a critical part of peak performance - is impaired by sleep loss.</li><li>Even teams that are aware of sleep’s importance before a game are surprised by my declaration of the equally, if not more, essential need for sleep in the days after a game. Post-performance sleep accelerates physical recovery from common inflammation, stimulates muscle repair, and helps restock cellular energy in the form of glucose and glycogen.</li></ul><p>Sleep for Creativity</p><ul role="list"><li>A final benefit of sleep for memory is arguably the most remarkable of all: creativity.</li></ul><h3><strong>Chapter 7 - Too Extreme for the Guinness Book of World Records</strong></h3><ul role="list"><li>In the following two chapters, we will learn precisely why and how sleep loss inflicts such devastating effects on the brain, linking it to numerous neurological and psychiatric conditions (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, suicide, stroke, and chronic pain), and on every physiological system of the body, further contributing to countless disorders and disease (e.g., cancer, diabetes, heart attacks, infertility, weight gain, obesity, and immune deficiency). No facet of the human body is spared the crippling, noxious harm of sleep loss.</li></ul><p>Pay Attention</p><ul role="list"><li>One brain function that buckles under even the smallest dose of sleep deprivation is concentration. The deadly societal consequences of these concentration failures play out most obviously and fatally in the form of drowsy driving. Every hour, someone dies in a traffic accident in the US due to a fatigue-related error.</li><li>Not only this, but participants who are sleep deprived consistently underestimate the degree to which their performance is reduced.</li><li>Humans need more than seven hours of sleep each night to maintain cognitive performance. After ten days of just seven hours of sleep, the brain is as dysfunctional as it would be after going without sleep for twenty-four hours.</li><li>Three full nights of recovery sleep (i.e., more nights than a weekend) are insufficient to restore performance back to normal levels after a week of short sleeping. Finally, the human mind cannot accurately sense how sleep-deprived it is when sleep-deprived.</li><li>There are many things that I hope readers take away from this book. This is one of the most important: if you are drowsy while driving, please, please stop. It is lethal.</li></ul><p>Can Naps Help?</p><ul role="list"><li>No matter what you may have heard or read in the popular …</li></ul></div></div>

	<h3><a href="http://reasonableapproximation.net/2020/09/14/against-boots-theory.html">Against boots theory</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reason that the rich were so rich, Vimes reasoned, was because they managed to spend less money.</p>

  <p>Take boots, for example. He earned thirty-eight dollars a month plus allowances. A really good pair of leather boots cost fifty dollars. But an affordable pair of boots, which were sort of OK for a season or two and then leaked like hell when the cardboard gave out, cost about ten dollars. Those were the kind of boots Vimes always bought, and wore until the soles were so thin that he could tell where he was in Ankh-Morpork on a foggy night by the feel of the cobbles.</p>

  <p>But the thing was that good boots lasted for years and years. A man who could afford fifty dollars had a pair of boots that'd still be keeping his feet dry in ten years' time, while the poor man who could only afford cheap boots would have spent a hundred dollars on boots in the same time and would still have wet feet.</p>

  <p>This was the Captain Samuel Vimes 'Boots' theory of socioeconomic unfairness.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>– Terry Pratchett, <em>Men at Arms</em></p>

<p>This is a compelling narrative. And I do believe there's some truth to it. I could believe that if you always buy the cheapest boots you can find, you'll spend more money than if you bought something more expensive and reliable. Similar for laptops, smartphones, cars. Especially (<a href="https://siderea.dreamwidth.org/1477942.html">as Siderea notes</a>, among other things) if you know how to buy expensive things that are more reliable.</p>

<p>But it's presented as "the reason that the rich [are] so rich". Is that true? I mean, no, obviously not. If your pre-tax income is less than the amount I put into my savings account, then no amount of "spending less money on things" is going to bring you to my level.</p>

<p>Is it even a contributing factor? Is <em>part of</em> the reason why the rich are so rich, that they manage to spend less money? Do the rich in fact spend less money than the poor?</p>

<p>That's less obvious, but I predict not. I predict that the rich spend more than the poor in total, but also on boots, laptops, smartphones, cars, and most other things. There might be exceptions where rich people consume less of the thing than poor people - bus tickets, for example - but I think if you group spending in fairly natural ways, the rich will spend more than the poor in almost every group.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Maybe they spend less money on their daily wear boots, but own more pairs of shoes for different occasions. Or maybe they decide that they care about other things than lifetime cost for their daily wear boots, and spend more on those, too. (Being rich means they can <em>afford</em> to care about other things than lifetime cost.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Apparently famous people often get comped meals, but I bet most of them still spend more money on food than I do.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I spent £500 on a laptop in 2013, and before that, £300 in 2008. If I'd gone for £200 laptops each time, maybe they would only have lasted two years each. But if I weren't a techno-masochist, maybe I'd realize that using old laptops actually kind of sucks, and I'd upgrade far more often. My work laptop, bought by people who want me to be maximally effective at my job, cost over £1000 and isn't going to last ten years.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Financial services are a case where I'd guess the rich and the poor spend money on very different things. I assume the rich don't have to pay to cash a cheque, and very rarely visit loan sharks. But the poor rarely have Amex Platinum cards (<a href="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/credit-cards/card/platinum/">$550/year</a>), or personal accountants. (Maybe it's unfair to count those because they save you money in other areas?)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Buying a house may be cheaper in the long run than renting a similar house nearby. But rich people tend to live in nicer houses and/or nicer areas.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Those are all guesses. I don't have good data on this, and I'd love to see it if you do.</p>

<p>For what data I do have, the first google result was <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/expenditure/bulletins/familyspendingintheuk/april2018tomarch2019">this page</a> from the UK's Office of National Statistics. Specifically, look at figure 4, "Indexed household income, total spending and spending by component by income decile, UK, FYE 2019".</p>

<p>They split households into ten income levels, and look at four categories of spending plus total spending. Each of those is a near-strictly increasing line from "poor people spend less" to "rich people spend more". (I see two blips: the 90th percentile of income spends slightly less on housing than the 80th, and the 70th spends slightly less on food and non-alcoholid drinks than the 60th. The other categories are transport, and recreation and culture. These four are the largest spending categories on average across all income levels. The graph also has disposable income, which I think is irrelevant for current purposes.)</p>

<p>(I repeat that this specific data is not strong evidence. The source for it is the <a href="https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=8459">living costs and food survey</a>, which might have more detail. (Link goes to the previous year's version because that's what I could find.) Unfortunately it's not open access. It might be freely available if I register, but I don't care enough to try right now. In any case, we'd also want data from outside the UK.)</p>

<p>There will obviously be some exceptions. There will be some rich people who spend less money than some poor people. There will probably even be some rich people who spend less money than some poor people, and would not be rich otherwise. But as a general theory for why the rich are rich? I just don't buy it.</p>

<p>I believe boots theory points towards one component of socioeconomic unfairness. But boots theory itself is supposed to be a theory of why the rich are so rich. It's very clear about that. It's clearly wrong, and I predict that even a weakened version of it is wrong.</p>

<hr>

<p>To be a little more precise, I think boots theory as written makes three increasingly strong claims, that we could think of as "levels of boots theory":</p>

<ol>
  <li>Being rich enables you to spend less money on things. (More generally: having incrementally more capital lets you spend incrementally less money. Also, being rich is super convenient in many ways.) This phenomenon is also called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghetto_tax">ghetto tax</a>.</li>
  <li>Also, rich people do in fact spend less money on things.</li>
  <li>Also, this is why rich people are rich.</li>
</ol>

<p>All of these levels have stronger and weaker forms. But I think a quick look at the world tells us that the first level is obviously true under any reasonable interpretation, and the third level is obviously false under any reasonable interpretation. The second I predict is "basically just false under most reasonable interpretations", but it's less obvious and more dependent on details. There may well be weak forms of it that are true.</p>

<p>It may be that most people, when they think of boots theory, think only of levels one or two, not level three. I don't know if you can read <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-applicable-to-real-life-is-the-Sam-Vimes-%E2%80%9CBoots%E2%80%9D-Theory-of-Economic-Injustice">this quora thread</a> that I found on Google. It asks "How applicable to real life is the Sam Vimes "Boots" Theory of Economic Injustice?" The answers mostly agree it's very applicable, but I think most of them are on level one or two. (The one talking about leverage seems like level three, if it's talking about boots theory at all. I'm not convinced it is.)</p>

<p>But it seems to me that boots theory is usually presented in whole in its original form. Its original form is succinct and well written. When people want to comment on it, they very often include the very same quote as I did. And the original form starts by very clearly telling us "this is a theory of why the rich are so rich". It is very obviously level three, which is very obviously wrong.</p>

<p>So I have a few complaints here.</p>

<p>One is, I get the impression that most people don't even notice this. They link or quote something that starts out by saying very clearly "this is a theory of why the rich are so rich", and they don't notice that it's a theory of why the rich are so rich.</p>

<p>(I wouldn't be too surprised (though this is not a prediction) if even the author didn't notice this. Maybe if you had asked him, Terry Pratchett would have said that no, obviously Sam Vimes does not think this is why the rich are so rich, Sam Vimes just thinks this is a good illustration of why it's nice to be rich.)</p>

<p>This disconnect between what a thing actually says, and what people seem to think it says, just bothers me. I feel the desire to point it out.</p>

<p>Another is, I think there's a motte-and-bailey going on between levels one and two. A quora commenter says it's "far more expensive to be poor than it is to be rich, both in a percentage of income respect and a direct effect". He gives examples of things that rich people can spend less money on, if they choose. He doesn't provide data that rich people <em>do</em> spend less money on these things. Another describes how being rich lets you save money on food staples by stocking up when there's a sale. He doesn't provide data that rich people <em>do</em> spend less money on food or even staples. You could certainly make the case that neither of these people is explicitly claiming level two. But I do think they're hinting in that direction, even if it's not deliberate.</p>

<p>And relatedly: if we want to help people escape poverty, we need to know on what levels boots theory is true or false.<sup id="fnref:feedback-loops" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:feedback-loops">1</a></sup> If we want to know that, we need to be able to distinguish the levels. If "boots theory" can refer to any of these levels, then simply calling boots theory "true" (or even "false") is uninformative. We need to be more precise than that. To be fair, the quora commenters make specific falsifiable claims, which is commendable. But the claims are meant to be specific examples of a general phenomenon, and the general phenomenon is simply "boots theory", and it's not clear what they think that means.</p>

<p>I advise that if you talk about boots theory, you make it clear which level you're talking about. But maybe don't use that name at all. If you're talking about level one, the name "ghetto tax" seems fine. If you …</p></section></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
          <p>I gave a talk in October 2019. The recording sadly got lost because the conference organizer <a href="https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/11/05/skills_matter_goes_into_administration/">folded</a>. The talk was called <em>Stick to Simple Haskell</em>. I put a lot of effort into writing and preparing it. Quite a few people came up to me to say they really liked it. They weren't your usual suspects: those that will never give up type level programming. Rather, they were normal Software developers. Like me and many others, they want their day job to be a bit less shit. I think some of the ideas in that talk are worth spreading, or at least worth talking about. Initiatives like the <a href="https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2019/11/boring-haskell-manifesto">Boring Haskell Manifesto</a> are a breath of fresh air and we need more of those. This is my tiny contribution.</p>

<h3>30 Years old</h3>
<p>In 2020, Haskell will turn 30. Since the beginning, the language designers wanted Haskell to be used for:</p>
<ul>
<li>teaching functional programming</li>
<li>innovating and advancing programming language research</li>
<li>building real world applications and large systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's ignore teaching and focus on the other two.</p>
<p>Programming Language researchers love Haskell because GHC can be augmented through Extensions. GHC is the perfect playground to try out new ideas. It's pretty common nowadays to open up a file and be greeted with a wall of extensions:</p>
<pre><code><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></code></pre>
<p>These radically change the language and the type system. You get to work with a much more complicated and capable beast. You get closer to Dependent Types. You get more guarantees at compile time because more information can be encoded in types. We usually refer to these as <em>Fancy types</em>.</p>
<p>And yet, "Haskell the language" hasn't evolved much since 1998. In very broad and inaccurate terms, Haskell98 is what you get when running GHC with no extensions enabled. You get simple data types, type classes and a lazy purely functional core.</p>

<h3>Building applications in Haskell</h3>
<p>PL researchers go all in on Fancy types. But I'm no PL researcher. I'm a Software developer. Recall that one of the designers' goals was for Haskell to be used in the Industry, to write real world applications. Is Fancy Haskell suitable for this?</p>
<h6>Looks good on Paper</h6>
<p>Writing production software is very different than writing a paper.</p>
<p>Once a research write up is out, it doesn't have to be maintained. Techniques and tricks shown in code samples that look good on a PDF aren't indicative of how they would affect a real codebase. Researchers can rely on experimental features and untested extensions. They can get by with slow compilation times.</p>
<h6>Inclusivity</h6>
<p>Writing production software is a team effort.</p>
<p>I want to work with a diverse group of people. I don't want a PhD to be a requirement to work with Haskell. I want a codebase that is accessible to all skill levels. Most business logic in applications isn't rocket science. There's no reason to make apps more complex than they need to be.</p>
<p>Selfishly, as a company betting on Haskell, you get access to a wider pool of talent by lowering the barrier to entry.</p>
<h6>Marginal benefits</h6>
<p>Fancy types give us more guarantees, so we can write safer and more correct code. Why would we want to give that up?</p>
<p>I'm not convinced the benefits are that dramatic. The jump from a mainstream programming language to Haskell is fairly stark. There are clear gains in having a compiler help you write correct code. That might still not be <em>the most correct</em> code. It's true, with Fancy types I could gain that extra x% confidence. Is the complexity worth it?</p>
<p>In the interest of being pragmatic, we need to look out of the box for a second. We need to realize types are an invaluable tool, but they're not the only tool we can employ. Types aren't an excuse to avoid testing.</p>

<h3>Simple Haskell</h3>
<p>I'm not suggesting we ignore everything that happened after 1998.</p>
<p>Haskell98 is a nice foundation, but we can improve it. The core idea is to <strong>accept the type system</strong> as it is and <strong>focus on ergonomics</strong>. Make the language nicer, not the type system.</p>
<p>This boils down to using Generics and enabling ergonomic extensions.</p>
<p>Generics aren't available in Haskell98. They're fantastic to remove boilerplate. You can automatically derive JSON instances and lenses with generic-lens.</p>
<p>Certain extensions are unharmful and make Haskell that much nicer to work with.</p>
<pre><code><br><br><br></code></pre>

<h3>Application architecture</h3>
<p>Most applications should just be built as:</p>
<pre><code><span>app</span> <span>::</span> <span>Env</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre>
<p>where <code>Env</code> represents a dependency injection container.</p>
<pre><code><span>data</span> <span>Env</span> <span>=</span> <span>Env</span><br>      <span>{</span> <span>usersCache</span> <span>::</span> <span>TVar</span> <span>[</span><span>User</span><span>]</span><br>      <span>,</span> <span>postgresConnection</span> <span>::</span> <span>PG.Connection</span><br>      <span>,</span> <span>log</span> <span>::</span> <span>Severity</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Text</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><br>      <span>,</span> <span>fetchUser</span> <span>::</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>Maybe</span> <span>User</span><span>)</span><br>      <span>,</span> <span>storeFile</span> <span>::</span> <span>Filename</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>ByteString</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>Either</span> <span>Text</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>      <span>}</span></code></pre>
<p>My euristic to determine if something belongs to <code>Env</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is the thing a resource shared across the application? (ie. a Postgres connection)</li>
<li>Do I want to provide a different implementation? (ie. a mock during testing)</li>
</ul>
<p>When the type gets big, you can split it up further.</p>
<pre><code><span>data</span> <span>UserService</span><br>  <span>=</span> <span>UserService</span><br>      <span>{</span> <span>fetchUser</span>  <span>::</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>Maybe</span> <span>User</span><span>)</span><br>      <span>,</span> <span>updateUser</span> <span>::</span> <span>User</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>Either</span> <span>UserServiceError</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>      <span>,</span> <span>deleteUser</span> <span>::</span> <span>UserId</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>(</span><span>Either</span> <span>UserServiceError</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br>      <span>}</span><p><span>data</span> <span>Env</span> <span>=</span> <span>Env</span><br>      <span>{</span> <span>userService</span> <span>::</span> <span>UserService</span><br>      <span>,</span> <span>...</span><br>      <span>}</span></p></code></pre>
<p>When the application gets big, you can refactor to use the <a href="https://www.fpcomplete.com/blog/2017/06/readert-design-pattern">ReaderT design pattern</a>.</p>

<h3>Haskell in 2020</h3>
<p>Haskell managed to succeed despite trying to please two different crowds: Programming Language researchers and Software developers. 30 years later, we have a language that is still used by both groups. But their needs couldn't be more different.</p>
<p>As Software developers, we need to understand which Haskell features are useful in writing applications. And more importantly, which features are harmful or ineffective. PL researchers and Software developers share the same tool, but that's not an excuse to blindly adopt Fancy types.</p>
<p>As Haskell developers, we need to realize not all problems deserve to be turned into a paper. You have a choice:</p>
<ul>
<li>Embark on a 4 hours quest to find a beautiful solution at the type level.</li>
<li>Spend 10 minutes and solve it the boring way. Maybe even write a test.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's ok to sacrifice a bit of type safety in favour of Inclusivity. We can still make sure our software is correct through testing. This is what Simple Haskell really is about. The term Boring Haskell works even better.</p>
<p>Writing Simple/Boring Haskell is a joy. Concrete code is so liberating. Abstractions are nice, but Boring Haskell is nicer.</p>
<p>Next time a beginner talks to you:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don't recommend Servant. Scotty works great. Type safe routing can wait.</li>
<li>Don't recommend any effect system. Massive abstractions can wait.</li>
<li>Don't trash Elm. Or Go. You're not accomplishing anything.</li>
<li>Don't recommend Nix. Stack works great.
Yes, no matter how many hours it took you to get nix-build do what you intended.</li>
<li>Continue talking to them, even if they don't have a PhD.</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2020, get <s>the fuck</s> off the Ivory tower. Write Boring Haskell.</p>

<p>In an unexpected turn of events, just a few hours after this post came out, <a href="https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2019/12/26/write_junior_code.html">Matt Parsons</a> published a very good article promoting Junior Code.

<p><em>Do you know why social media sites are so addictive? Yeah, sure, let’s cover the basics: they’re flooded with funny memes and short-form videos that play themselves when you scroll, all of your friends are on social media, and besides, where else to nag about your recent Uber experience? But there is something else entirely that’s keeping you inside Facebook and Twitter like a crackhead inside a drugstore – immediate feedback. Sadly, this same thing, is also the reason you abandon your <a href="https://durmonski.com/life-advice/long-term-thinking/">long-term projects</a>.</em></p>

I write stuff, I publish them, and nothing really happens. <a aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/lack-of-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The lack of feedback</a> – good or bad – makes me doubt the work I do. It immediately instills negative thoughts that whisper in my head, “Go do something else, you suck at writing. You see? No one is noticing.”</p>



<p>The same is with any other form of venture if you’re just starting. You open an online shop, you carefully arrange your categories, you sit, and you wait. Unless you market the shit out of your brand new site, no one will notice what you did – except probably your mom. If you want to make sales, you need to basically purchase your own stuff in the beginning.</p>



<p>But this is not limited to business, this same principle applies if you want to lose weight, learn a new language, a new skill, <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/atomic-habits/">adopt a new habit</a>, and anything else that can potentially make you a better human being.</p>



<p>“Good things take time,” others say. But being patient in the world of reactions without delay is hard. It takes true heroism to keep working on a project for years until you finally <em>make it</em>.</p>



<p>The lack of immediate feedback, or any form of feedback for that matter, can crush your enthusiasm and get you back to the drawing board. That’s why social media platforms feel so good and so many people sit inside. You publish something, and you immediately get some sort of response or reaction. Yes, you can only get a few likes but it surely feels a lot better than writing for years till someone notices, or restlessly sweating in the gym till you finally <em>get </em>that shred body.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there is a way to overcome the devastating thoughts that consume your mind when there’s no response from users and keep working on your business idea. You just need to shift your perspective and use the three-year rule.</p>







<h2><strong>What’s The Three Year Rule</strong>?</h2>



<p>Nowadays, we expect things to happen overnight. We have same-day deliveries, instant messaging, a quick way to buy things online, leave a review, get a refund, and above all we see people who worked as bank clerks, as if it were yesterday, but today, these same people run a multi-million dollar business.</p>



<p>Media outlets emphasis only on the last part of creating a project – the part where people are now successful. They don’t talk enough about the long hours, the doubt, all the hard work. They try to sell you the idea that you, too, can make it big. And I’m not saying that you can’t, but it will surely take a lot more time than what the online gurus are telling you.</p>



<p>That’s where the three year rule comes in.</p>



<p>There’s nothing fancy about this command. It will simply give you a different perspective when you want to make a project successful or make some positive changes in your life.</p>



<p>Instead of hoping to succeed till the end of the month, and be disappointed when this doesn’t happen, give yourself the opportunity to make it. Give yourself three years.</p>


<div id="ub_click_to_tweet_d948d44f-7576-4384-80fc-c740963b536a"><p>Instead of hoping to succeed till the end of the month, and be disappointed when this doesn’t happen, give yourself the opportunity to make it. Give yourself three years.</p></div>






<h2>Why The Three Year Rule is Important?</h2>



<p>Ask any successful person. Ask any experienced person. They’ll all tell you the same thing – It takes time to create something valuable. Something worth doing.</p>



<p>Yet, we’re not able to accept this narrative. We want things to happen right now because everything around us is moving so fast. </p>



<p>When we begin working on a project, start learning something new, when we open our online store, we want to see results. We want to see some sort of progress because progress means that what we’re doing is working. That our efforts are not in vain. </p>



<p>Of course, things don’t work like that. Reality is different from our expectations. Progress is slow, sales are stagnant, people are not commenting on our new blog post… When these things happen, naturally, we start to lose faith in what we’re doing and we abandoned things.</p>



<p>But the problem is not that our work suck – at least this is not the main issue – or because we’re not doing the right things, it’s simply because we’re entering the project with the wrong expectations. We expect things to happen fast, and when they don’t – which is normal – we blame the market, our customers, our spouse, and we close shop.</p>

They expect quick results and when reality does not meet their expectations, they give up.</figcaption></figure>







<p>But things can be way different if we reframe our expectations. If we enter this project, any project, with reasonable expectations. </p>



<p>Instead of hoping for overnight success, we need to accept reality. To tell our instant-feedback-craving minds that it takes time to create something lasting. </p>

<p>Right from the start, set the right expectations. Don’t aim to succeed this month, neither this year, plan to succeed after 3 years.</p>







<h2>How To Apply The Three Year Rule?</h2>



<p>Commit to doing something for 3 years. 5 years. Even 20 years.</p>



<p>The number of years is not that important – of course, it should be at least a couple of years so you can make some real progress. The most important thing is to set the right expectations right from the start. To convince your mind that it will take time to see results.</p>



<p>Here are some actionable steps:</p>



<ul><li><strong>What?</strong> Start with what you want to do and why you want to do it. Opening an online shop surely feels exciting but if your main ambition is to make money, and nothing else, you won’t last long. You need a strong motive. Something that will inspire you to wake up every day at 5 in the morning. Something that will motivate you to <a aria-label="keep you going despite the obstacles (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/overcoming-obstacles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep you going despite the obstacles</a>.<span id="easy-footnote-1-8884"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-8884" title="Read <a href=&quot;https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/start-with-why/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; aria-label=&quot;Start with Why (opens in a new tab)&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Start with Why</a> by Simon Sinek for more actionable strategies on this."><sup>1</sup></a></span></li><li><strong>Commit:</strong> Allow yourself at least 3 years to do the above. Good things take time. There’s no such thing as an overnight success. The stories we read online are showing us only the tip of the iceberg. Beneath the water, there’s always years of hard work. If you’re not willing to commit at least 3 years to a project, save yourself some time and money and don’t start at all.</li><li><strong> Say no:</strong> Once you know what you’re going to do, say no to things unrelated to your main goal. Say no to other opportunities. Say no to emerging business trends. And be firm when you say it. This step is crucial. If you stay open for opportunities you won’t make any progress. Close all windows of opportunity and stay committed to your long term goal.</li><li><strong>Adjust:</strong> Don’t blindly follow the path you originally set. It’s normal for our mission to be flawed at first. After all, we didn’t have any experience in the field initially. When we actually start working on the project, we’ll know better. So, after a couple of months, when we see the flaws in our original idea, once we know what’s not working, and what’s not going to work, make the correct adjustments and move forward.</li></ul>



<p>These are the basics.</p>



<p>For reference, and inspiration, let me share how things look for me at <a href="https://durmonski.com/">durmonski.com</a>:</p>



<ul><li><strong>What?</strong> I see more and more people obsessing about trivial stuff – cheap clothes, gadgets, video games, famous people with no real values, the latest trends, etc. Sadly, The more we consume this type of hollow content, the more ambitionless we became. We settle for Netflix and chill, and we don’t have any desire to make something lasting. I want to even things out. I want to be a source of quality content that can help more people realize that they can do so much more with their time. My drive since the beginning of this site is to create thought-provoking content that will inspire and help folks become more rational.</li><li><strong>Commitment:</strong> I started in 2018 and my original commitment was to work on the site for 3 years. It’s been 2 years, but progress is slower than I thought. And while I often feel down about the lack of big results, my original commitment changed to 5 years. Why keep doing it since results are low? Because I can see myself doing this type of work for at least another 10 or 20 years. I love it and I often receive praise from readers. With this in mind, I’m fine with waiting for 2-3 more years to see results.<span id="easy-footnote-2-8884"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-8884" title="I say that the progress is slow because I don&amp;#8217;t have a lot of visitors to my site. Hence, a lot of <a aria-label=&quot;members (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://durmonski.com/membership/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>members</a>. Getting a lot of traffic usually happens when you have a lot of sites linking back to your site. And this process, unfortunately, takes time."><sup>2</sup></a></span></li><li><strong>Say no: </strong>Every now and then, I have an idea for a new project. A concept for a new site that seems way better than what I’m currently doing. But instead of going forward with the new ideas, I write them down. In most cases, after just a few days, I realize that this new concept is not going to work and I feel even more inspired to work on my main goal.</li><li><strong>Adjust:</strong> When I first started this site, I was publishing mainly articles about <a aria-label="how to become a minimalist (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/well-being/the-remedy-for-modern-busyness/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to become a minimalist</a>, how to travel with less, all the minimal stuff. I did it because it was trendy back then. My goal was still the same back then – help people get out of the consumerist mindset. However, after a couple of months, I realized that I want to write about slightly different things. Put simply, I was trying to be someone I’m not initially. So, I’ve made some adjustments. The main mission didn’t change much but my daily actions did. The content I publish now represents truly who I am.</li></ul>

However, the DevOps paradigm mainly focuses on the more technical aspects of delivering value as a team. A question posed after DevOpsDays Amsterdam 2019 illustrates the issue: <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/devops-weve-come-so-far-where-business-daniela-resch/" rel="noopener">we’ve come so far, but where is the business</a>? In this article, I will share how we are trying to go beyond the success of DevOps to tackle the divide between agile DevOps teams and the Business. We have found our approach makes it possible to do true agile outsourcing while still avoiding much of the typical friction between business owners and developers, and I hope to inspire you to try our approach to BizDevOps yourself.</h2></div></div></section><hr><section><div><p id="6cef"><span>A</span>ll too often, business stakeholders are unexpectedly involved in the development process, and business requirements tend to get lost in translation. This is why the solution provided by the development team often scarcely addresses the needs of the business, and little value is delivered. How can we best bridge that dominant divide between the Business and IT?</p></div></section><hr><section><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5288/1*lJSwQTkz7zsAy-wShTULkg.png" width="2644" height="2314" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*lJSwQTkz7zsAy-wShTULkg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*lJSwQTkz7zsAy-wShTULkg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*lJSwQTkz7zsAy-wShTULkg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*lJSwQTkz7zsAy-wShTULkg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*lJSwQTkz7zsAy-wShTULkg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>More complex technology is further abstracted away over time (source: <a href="https://medium.com/u/fde1eb3eb589?source=post_page-----c1194297a706--------------------------------" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Michal Malewicz</a>, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/simple-beautiful-interfaces-are-the-future-9f77e33af5c4" rel="noopener">SpaceX: Simple, beautiful interfaces are the future</a>)</figcaption></figure><p id="6f57"><span>R</span>ecently I stumbled on this picture. It struck me that, if anything, our spacecraft have become <em>more</em><strong> </strong>technically complex over time. Yet, somehow, we have managed to remove this complexity from sight over the years. At least it <em>looks</em> as if everyone could control a (SpaceX) spaceship nowadays.</p><p id="74f3">When technology is hidden, it tends to become accessible for a broader public (this is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratization#Design,_products_and_services" rel="noopener">democratization</a>). Where public cloud technology (e.g. AI, ML, Deep Learning, blockchain—feel free to complete your own buzzword bingo card) from Microsoft, Google and Amazon is still targeting professionals, their respective low-code platforms—PowerApps, AppSheet and HoneyCode—are designed for citizen developers: those who ‘create new business applications for consumption by others using […] shared services, fourth-generation language (4GL)-style development platforms and cloud computing services’ (<a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/information-technology/glossary/citizen-developer" rel="noopener">source</a>). The same applies to the low-code platforms from Mendix, Betty Blocks, and others. Moreover, programming tools such as IFTTT, Apple’s Shortcuts, and good old Excel can easily be used by the average consumer.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6520/1*42r-9o1NX3_dg-YYZIiFKQ.png" width="3260" height="2014" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*42r-9o1NX3_dg-YYZIiFKQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*42r-9o1NX3_dg-YYZIiFKQ.png 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*42r-9o1NX3_dg-YYZIiFKQ.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Tech is increasingly impacting products and services</figcaption></figure><p id="9d96">With all this technology becoming available for a wider public, products and services are increasingly impacted. It’s not only internal or secondary business processes that are impacted: the customer-facing, primary processes of businesses are increasingly changing because of the driving force of technology and innovation. Just look at the premier provider of postal and parcel services in the Netherlands, PostNL, which has developed a digital alternative for postage stamps. Regardless of how this trend will develop precisely — it’s happening. Under these circumstances the business expects more from teams than ‘just’ doing their ‘DevOps trick’: they expect teams to understand that it’s all about creating value. If they don’t do that, the chances are that ‘the business’ will swipe their credit card and starts building themselves. That last point is an important difference compared to the business-IT gap in the 1980s.</p></div></div><div><div><div><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/4516/1*nn_wEXBml-TS0_2UUkio5Q.png" width="2258" height="610" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*nn_wEXBml-TS0_2UUkio5Q.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*nn_wEXBml-TS0_2UUkio5Q.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*nn_wEXBml-TS0_2UUkio5Q.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1456/1*nn_wEXBml-TS0_2UUkio5Q.png 728w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1632/1*nn_wEXBml-TS0_2UUkio5Q.png 816w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1808/1*nn_wEXBml-TS0_2UUkio5Q.png 904w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1984/1*nn_wEXBml-TS0_2UUkio5Q.png 992w, https://miro.medium.com/max/2000/1*nn_wEXBml-TS0_2UUkio5Q.png 1000w" sizes="1000px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*nn_wEXBml-TS0_2UUkio5Q.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>PostNL realized that sending letters was going to be impacted by digital technologies and developed a digital replacement for a postage stamp (this was created ‘way back’ in 2013)</figcaption></figure></div></div></div><div><div><p id="a624">Because the thing is, today, IT is mostly <em>still </em>totally separated from the business. It’s separated within organisations (different departments, islands, silos) as well as between organisations (when IT is being outsourced to a third party). Neither side understands the other, yet both expect the other to do more to understand <em>them</em>. There’s a lot of finger pointing and, as a result, real fortresses are built. A <em>corporate immune system</em> is delaying innovation and delays smart people finding an answer to the question how are the company’s products and services going to be impacted/changed/improved by all these new technologies?</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7680/1*3vt4H6wghJ2QpxQtdMIxww.png" width="3840" height="1590" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*3vt4H6wghJ2QpxQtdMIxww.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*3vt4H6wghJ2QpxQtdMIxww.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*3vt4H6wghJ2QpxQtdMIxww.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3vt4H6wghJ2QpxQtdMIxww.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*3vt4H6wghJ2QpxQtdMIxww.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>IT is often separated from the business (bonus points if you recognize the movie shot)</figcaption></figure><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7680/1*Wq7NtBIfTMESQERRn9fh8g.png" width="3840" height="1598" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Wq7NtBIfTMESQERRn9fh8g.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Wq7NtBIfTMESQERRn9fh8g.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Wq7NtBIfTMESQERRn9fh8g.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Wq7NtBIfTMESQERRn9fh8g.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Wq7NtBIfTMESQERRn9fh8g.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>A typical business-IT conversation</figcaption></figure><p id="b221">The hierarchical structure of many organizations doesn’t help. It creates a comfort zone that discourages transparency and vulnerability. As an attempt at diplomatic cooperation, external consultants, project managers, agile coaches, and/or so-called ‘thought leaders’ are hired to function as translators between the two sides. Clearly this only addresses the effects of the divide, and fails to tackle its cause. Worse: it just introduces more overhead.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="fe3d"><span>S</span>o, how <em>do</em> we bridge the gap between those who write code and those who write emails? Maybe I can share a bit about how we work together at Schuberg Philis, and what I’ve learned during my time there.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/5456/1*zwzzxN6Kx3Ean_qk7bX2Uw.png" width="2728" height="944" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*zwzzxN6Kx3Ean_qk7bX2Uw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*zwzzxN6Kx3Ean_qk7bX2Uw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*zwzzxN6Kx3Ean_qk7bX2Uw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*zwzzxN6Kx3Ean_qk7bX2Uw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*zwzzxN6Kx3Ean_qk7bX2Uw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Making space for team members from the customer</figcaption></figure><p id="bf8a">Imagine the collection of blue dots on the right is a team. Developers, Engineers, and Sales are roles that are typically represented in the dedicated customer teams of Schuberg Philis. When we’re about to embark on a journey with a customer, one of the first things we do is think about the roles we need those in the business to play (the yellow circles). What responsibilities do we expect? And which roles seem to fit those responsibilities? Do these roles generate the required mandate? Who do we need to contact to get this approved and arranged on the customer side?</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3936/1*BHcaFWmOz9ZbcquwLkaIpA.png" width="1968" height="1692" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*BHcaFWmOz9ZbcquwLkaIpA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*BHcaFWmOz9ZbcquwLkaIpA.png 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*BHcaFWmOz9ZbcquwLkaIpA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Whole system in a (single) room</figcaption></figure><p id="b6ba">Once all the roles are allocated, before the start of the project, we go and sit together in a room. We close the door. Call it a cross-functional team, self-steering team, X-team or even co-creation—the name doesn’t really matter. It’s about putting the people with the right knowledge, expertise, vision, and passion together.</p><p id="d503">We call this “w<em>hole system in a room”. </em>In this setting, there’s not much hierarchy. It’s all about getting unnecessary management out of the way and putting experts in the lead.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*CTznJvCCqr0oj-w_9oCMAw.png" width="600" height="564" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*CTznJvCCqr0oj-w_9oCMAw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*CTznJvCCqr0oj-w_9oCMAw.png 500w" sizes="500px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*CTznJvCCqr0oj-w_9oCMAw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>See you on the other side, kiddo</figcaption></figure><p id="ffa2">The idea is to then cross over in each other’s space and commit to mutual bridge-building—to share the responsibility for building a bridge to the other side. Ideally, IT has someone from the business who talks their language, appreciates them, and even can be an advocate for them. The business then takes more ownership of tech decisions and understands better what‘s needed. Since both sides are involved in a single team, there’s no finger pointing.</p><p id="71e1">So the challenge is to find people from IT and the business who can operate in the purple shaded area and won’t meet resistance from the business and IT sides, respectively. This is not a walk in the park. It really <em>is </em>more work and it can be very demanding to go over to ‘the other side’. We see from our colleagues, too, that they find it difficult to cross the space sometimes and show respect to either business or IT people. Each side has its own language and practices. Screaming ‘#noestimates!’ isn’t really helpful if business is trying to cope with milestones, budgets and release deadlines. Yelling ‘#justdoit!’ is just as unconstructive when engineers are trying to understand ‘the why’ before sharing their advice, let alone committing to a deadline. I think that, at the end of the day, bridging the gap boils down to things like vulnerability, honesty and transparency. Getting out of your comfort zone. Genuinely trying to understand the other person. When such an atmosphere is established, there’s no finger pointing—and the other party praises you for the partnership you’ve created together (this then replaces the more usual transactional customer/supplier relationship).</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="afeb"><span>G</span>etting into the same room with the right roles and disciplines can be very valuable for sharing project updates (think of the Sprint Review, for instance). In addition, we’ve found it to be a powerful way to kickstart projects. Getting into the same room from Day One creates an atmosphere of trust and transparency, which helps us realise short time-to-value together. Let me introduce the Proof of Value Pressure Cooker™. This consists of five phases that are typically executed in 1–2 weeks. These phases are detailed below.</p><h2 id="57e9"><strong>1. Prepare</strong></h2><p id="420b">Well begun is half the work. This phase typically starts <em>before</em> the pressure cooker starts and is performed by the more solution- and/or technically oriented team members. It involves getting to the heart of the matter:</p><ul><li id="500a">So what is this really about?</li><li id="bd58">Why (why, why) are we doing this? Are we doing this?</li><li id="3e59">(How) can we be successful?</li></ul><p id="9ba2">Only if all questions have a satisfactory answer, can the team continue to the next phase.</p><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*iI2PRnUFR608tlc6mfwVGA.png" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*iI2PRnUFR608tlc6mfwVGA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*iI2PRnUFR608tlc6mfwVGA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*iI2PRnUFR608tlc6mfwVGA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*iI2PRnUFR608tlc6mfwVGA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*iI2PRnUFR608tlc6mfwVGA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Formulating a core question at the start of a Pressure Cooker™ helps the team to focus</figcaption></figure><h2 id="8795"><strong>2. Ideate</strong></h2><p id="f0aa">This phase is where the business takes the stage, and shares their knowledge, experience, frustrations, wishes, ideas. IT is listening, in an emphatic way, trying to ask smart questions. In addition, the technical team members should ask themselves:</p><ul><li id="f26d">Do we understand?</li><li id="ba0c">What are we missing?</li><li id="4ec7">Shall we start? When do we start?</li></ul><figure><div><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3840/1*gkJP7g2MV6DaENo3RmSWQw.png" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*gkJP7g2MV6DaENo3RmSWQw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*gkJP7g2MV6DaENo3RmSWQw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*gkJP7g2MV6DaENo3RmSWQw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*gkJP7g2MV6DaENo3RmSWQw.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*gkJP7g2MV6DaENo3RmSWQw.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Visualizing a primary business process helps establish an initial understanding of the scope and complexity of the problem at hand</figcaption></figure><h2 id="e7e6"><strong>3. Sketch</strong></h2><p id="3794">After the problem domain has been laid out by the business, it’s time for IT to reflect and share how they understood the explanation made by the business. Visualizing this interpretation helps mutual understanding. Moreover, sketching initial screens helps the team keep the final goal in mind, while answering the following questions:</p><ul><li id="6dd2">Is this what you mean?</li><li id="ac75">What should be changed?</li><li id="8f0f">Is this going to bring you value?

In the former case, it can aggregate data from a large number of individuals and provide alerts where medications have been missed (or taken more than scheduled). This has the potential to significantly reduce time taken by humans to physically check on each case. For the elderly, relatives could check up on medicine taking habits from across town, state, or country.</p><p>It also has uses for the young and healthy who can sometimes forget if they took a medication. The idea for Memory Pill came to me when my wife had a headache, but couldn't remember if she had already taken medicine for it, or had just thought about it and not yet done so (kids can do that to a person).</p><h3 id="toc-media-3"><span>Media</span></h3>

                    <p>After moving into a new apartment I have already had plans in my to build a custom workbench setup for my home office room so this series will be oriented in the home office room and workbench design.</p><p>Currently, my room looks pretty simple it's 6.5 tatamis sized room with an integrated closet. It has 2 windows one on the north side and another on the east side.</p><figure><div><div><p><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/photo_2020-09-14_18-04-25-1.jpg" width="1280" height="960" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/photo_2020-09-14_18-04-25-1.jpg 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/photo_2020-09-14_18-04-25-1.jpg 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/photo_2020-09-14_18-04-25-1.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/photo_2020-09-14_18-04-26.jpg" width="1280" height="960" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/photo_2020-09-14_18-04-26.jpg 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/photo_2020-09-14_18-04-26.jpg 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/photo_2020-09-14_18-04-26.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p><p><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/photo_2020-09-14_18-04-25--2-.jpg" width="1280" height="960" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/photo_2020-09-14_18-04-25--2-.jpg 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/photo_2020-09-14_18-04-25--2-.jpg 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/photo_2020-09-14_18-04-25--2-.jpg 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></p></div></div></figure><p>The first step was, to measure out the room to have the exact dimensions for future planning.

Which ended up being aluminum extrusion profiles. After spending a day on CAD software I have designed some preliminary design but after calculating the price on materials and etc, the total cost of only the metal frame was way out the league for just a simple workbench.</p><p>After considering for some time I decided to go with plain wood framing using standardized Japanese wood planks like 2x4 (38x76 mm) 1x2 (19x38 mm), 2x2 (38x38).</p><p>Now that I can build a much larger sized workbench my initial thoughts were to build an inverse U shaped workbench but the room width is too narrow for going 90cm depth table on both sides it would leave only a 70cm gap between two sides. So in the end I decided to build L style shape workbench.</p><p>The long L part will be my DIY/Electronics work station with soldering and construction space. The shorter L part will be the PC workstation.</p><p>To try out the location I have put my temporary table in the corner where I am planning to put the PC workstation.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-43.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-43.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-43.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-43.png 1280w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>After seeing the situation with monitors I decided to place the left monitor on top of the center monitor to make better as the left one with the angle it blocks a lot of space on the table and blocks the window.</p><p>After knowing all details it was time for design.</p><figure><img src="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-44.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-44.png 600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-44.png 1000w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/09/image-44.png 1600w, https://www.techprowd.com/content/images/2020/09/image-44.png 1770w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>I kept rear columns tall and with supports because I am planning to use them for mounting some cabinets/shelves and have the grided panel for hooks.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>I’m trialing a move to MacVim, and with it, moving to Vim 8’s new built-in terminal
emulator.</p>

<p>My purpose in doing this is to see how GUI Vim is looking these days and to see
if GUI Vim running a terminal emulator can actually compete with a terminal
emulator running Vim for my development uses.</p>

<h4 id="why-use-gui-vim">Why use GUI Vim?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>I like that tab management looks nice and I can re-order tabs easily</li>
  <li>No dealing with terminal color limitations</li>
  <li>Less keybinding weirdness, want to bind to Meta/Option/Alt? Easy, <code>set macmeta</code></li>
  <li>Proper bold/italics</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="why-have-a-terminal-inside-gui-vim">Why have a terminal inside GUI Vim?</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Navigating terminal output using Vim bindings</li>
  <li>Easily yank/put between buffers and terminal, no system clipboard involved</li>
</ul>

<p>Honestly this argument is kind of weak. If you like tinkering with your tools though,
carry on!</p>

<h3 id="launching-terminal">Launching Terminal</h3>



<p>This launches a horizontal split with a terminal taking up precious vertical space.</p>

<p>Let’s define some keybindings that are more comfortable. I use <code>&lt;space&gt;</code> as my leader,
and tend to group related commands under a prefix. I chose <code>&lt;leader&gt;t</code> to be my
<em>terminal</em> prefix.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>" terminal in tab</span>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span>tt <span>:</span><span>tab</span> <span>term</span><span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span>
<span>" terminal in current window</span>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span><span>tc</span> <span>:</span><span>term</span><span>++</span>curwin<span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span>
<span>" terminal in vertical split</span>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span>tv <span>:</span><span>vert</span> <span>term</span><span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>These cover my use cases pretty well, I never use horizontal split terminals.</p>

<h3 id="getting-out">Getting Out</h3>

<p>How do you get out of terminal windows? <a href="https://vimhelp.org/terminal.txt.html"><code>:help Terminal-Mode</code></a> shows that
<code>CTRL-W</code> basically works as expected. You can move to different windows,
tabs, or escape normal mode commands by prefixing with <code>CTRL-W</code>. You can
escape to terminal normal mode using <code>CTRL-W N</code>, but I found this annoying.</p>

<p>If you don’t really need escape inside your terminal sessions you can bind
it to escape terminal mode (this is from the Vim docs!).</p>



<h3 id="passing-through-special-keys">Passing through special keys</h3>

<p>The most annoying thing I find with these built-in terminals is how they
always seem to break shell bindings.</p>

<p>I’ve learned bits and pieces of emacs-ish bindings available in common shells.
For example, <code>&lt;M-b&gt;</code> goes backwards a word in most shells and <code>&lt;M-f&gt;</code> goes forward
a word. Also, <code>&lt;CTRL-W&gt;</code> deletes backwards one word.</p>

<p>These are totally broken in Vim’s built-in terminal. Obviously <code>&lt;CTRL-W&gt;</code> gets
stolen by Vim since it is using <code>&lt;CTRL-W&gt;</code> to escape to normal mode.
In addition, <code>&lt;M-b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;M-f&gt;</code> will leave you frustrated with a bunch
of special characters like so <code>∫∫ƒƒƒ</code>.</p>

<p>I don’t really have a great solution for <code>&lt;CTRL-W&gt;</code>, I don’t want to make
drastic changes to how Vim sets up these bindings by default, so I’m just
getting used to hitting <code>&lt;M-BS&gt;</code> to delete a word while avoiding
Vim’s bindings.</p>

<p>I do have a solution for my <code>&lt;M-b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;M-f&gt;</code> woes though! Vim’s docs have
a <a href="https://vimhelp.org/terminal.txt.html#terminal-special-keys">little function definition</a>
to help with passing special keys.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>" Allow us to create &lt;M-*&gt; bindings</span>
<span>set</span> macmeta
<span>" Remap to call send_term function</span>
<span>tmap</span> <span>&lt;</span>expr<span>&gt;</span> <span>&lt;</span>M<span>-</span><span>b</span><span>&gt;</span> SendToTerm<span>(</span><span>"\&lt;Esc&gt;b"</span><span>)</span>
<span>tmap</span> <span>&lt;</span>expr<span>&gt;</span> <span>&lt;</span>M<span>-</span><span>f</span><span>&gt;</span> SendToTerm<span>(</span><span>"\&lt;Esc&gt;f"</span><span>)</span>
func SendToTerm<span>(</span>what<span>)</span>
    <span>call</span> <span>term_sendkeys</span><span>(</span><span>''</span><span>,</span> <span>a:what</span><span>)</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>''</span>
endfunc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This lets Vim actually pass the correct terminal escape code to get these
shortcuts working as expected again.</p>

<h3 id="thoughts">Thoughts</h3>

<p>I’m sure I’ll run into some more annoyances soon, but so far this is working
out pretty well for me, and there’s a clear path to adding additional
escape sequences for other broken shortcuts. I will say that being
able to navigate terminal output and rapidly yank/put has really been an
improvement.</p>

<h3 id="protip">Protip</h3>

<p>Want to know what keycode is being sent by a terminal to your application?
Run <code>cat</code> then hit the key combination, you’ll see the keycode output.</p>

<p>There isn't a great pullquote here, because the whole thing is ridiculous</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While out at a nearby cafe in smoke-engulfed Vancouver, I noticed that the screen on my partner's 2015 13" MacBook Pro had experienced some delamination. She's also been complaining about her battery life, and since the computer had just run out of that, and since I had the same screen problem resolved under their repair program, I decided to start up a chat with Apple Support to see if they could assist us.</p>
<p>To be clear, the vast majority of my experiences with Apple Support have been pretty good. Sometimes it takes a little bit of work, but I've generally ended up better off than before with few exceptions. This was the single most dissapointing interaction I've had with any tech support rep as far as I can recall. The numbers Joe suggested in this conversation are either entirely fabricated, or belong to the cost of replacing the entire machine if its experienced catastrophic damage. But, after clarifying numerous times about what the numbers actually represent and comparing to previous repair bills for the same issue, my belief is that the rep used a false and obscured repair order to persuade me to replace my girlfriend's minimally damaged screen with a new computer.</p>
<p>I'm sorry ahead of time for the entire transcript taking the form of a number of screenshots, but after trying to wrangle Acrobat Pro for far too long in order to redact the sensitive information, I just took the shortest path.</p>
<p>Also, after re-reading, I did make some minor grammatical errors and typos, particularly when asking for clarification on the cost of the 2019 MBP screen repair. This should be the $2051.84 from the post screenshot.</p>
<p>All dollar amounts are in <strong>CAD</strong></p>

Here it is below, for both my 2019 MBP 13" and the 2015 model that spurred the conversation. My main issue here, is that it's just a number and a payment request, there isn't any way to confirm the very confident claims made by the support rep. Is it really just a top case replacement? Probably not, considering previous top case replacements have only run between $500 and $1000.</p><figure><img src="https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://luketully.ca/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-1.png 600w, https://luketully.ca/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-1.png 1000w, https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-1.png 1062w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://luketully.ca/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-2.png 600w, https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png 691w"></figure><figure><img src="https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://luketully.ca/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-3.png 600w, https://luketully.ca/content/images/2020/09/image-3.png 991w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>But what's it for!?</figcaption></figure><p>Here also is a copy of a previous repair bill, this time for a logic board and display assembly replacement under warranty.

                    <p>What this article is about, what I assume you to know, how the article is structured and how it is to be used.</p>
                    <div id="section_intro">
                      <p>The Conjugate Gradient method is one of the most important ideas in scientific computing: It is applied for solving large sparse linear equations, like those arising in the numerical solution of partial differential equations 
                        and it is also used as a powerful optimization method.

                      <p>This article is trying to give an intuitive introduction to the <span>Conjugate Gradient method.<span>from now on often abbreviated as "CG"</span></span></p>
                      <p>The CG method is based on a beautiful geometric idea but this idea is barely explained in most exposition texts, a fact that was lamented (and alleviated) by Jonathan Shewchuk's grandiose paper "An Introduction to the Conjugate Gradient Method Without the Agonizing Pain". 
                        This article tries to transfer Shewchuk's brilliant explanations into a more interactive medium. 
                      </p>
                      <p>Note that this article is designed to be read on a decently sized monitor. While a phone screen will show the necessary info, there are some features and visualizations that might not work satisfactorily.</p>
                      <p>If you find errors, have comments on the mathematical and/or didactical exposition, please drop me an email at contact@pwacker.com.</p>
                      <p>I assume you need this algorithm for one of the following use-cases:
                        </p><ol>
                          <li>Solving a linear system of equations \[A x = b\]for a matrix \(A\in \mathbb R^{n\times n}\) 
                            symmetric and positive definite and vectors \(x, b\in \mathbb R^n\). This setting typically arises when you need to solve partial differential equations numerically.</li>
                          <li>Minimizing a quadratic function \[f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^TAx - b^T x + c\] with a matrix 
                            \(A\in \mathbb R^{n\times n}\) symmetric and positive definite, vectors \(x, b\in \mathbb R^n\) 
                            and a scalar \(c\in \mathbb R\)</li>
                          <li>Minimizing a more complicated function \[f : \mathbb R^n\to \mathbb R.\]</li>
                        </ol>
                          <p>The first two cases are equivalent (<span><i onclick="clickMinimizeUnminimize(['equivalenceLGS_SQOPT'], this, event)" onmouseout="unhighlightParent(document.getElementById('equivalenceLGS_SQOPT'), col='lavender')" onmouseover="highlightParent(document.getElementById('equivalenceLGS_SQOPT'))"></i> </span>).</p>
                          <p>
                            Note that the quadratic function is differentiable and has gradient \(\nabla f(x) = \frac{1}{2}(A^T + A)x - b = Ax - b\) (last step by symmetry of \(A\)) and (by positive definiteness of \(A\)) 
                            is guaranteed to have exactly one minimum which needs to fulfill \(\nabla f(x) = 0\). Hence, minimization of \(f\) amounts exactly to solving the linear equation \(Ax = b\).
                          </p>
                          <p>Although CG was developed for minimization of quadratic functions, it is
                            applied to non-quadratic minimization problems as well.
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Obviously, the solution to \(Ax = b\) is \(x = A^{-1}b\) but we assume that the dimension \(n\) of the problem 
                            is so high that we cannot invert the matrix. From here on, we won't allow matrix inversion as a feasible operation. We even forbid 
                            explicitly solving linear equations of the form \(Ax = b\). This is not the same as inverting \(A\) and multiplying \(A^{-1}b\) and is a lot 
                            faster than that, but we assume that the problem is so big that even this will not work.
                            We allow, on the other hand, all kinds of (valid) multiplications between vectors and matrices and assume that those can be 
                            done efficiently.
                          </p>
                          <p>Because the CG method is most intuitively understood in the context of optimization, we will drop the \(Ax = b\) aspect for now and 
                            we will mostly look at the problem of minimizing a quadratic function of the form \[f(x) = \frac{1}{2}x^TAx - b^T x + c.\]
                            We also make the standing assumption that \(A\) is square, symmetric and positive definite. 
                          </p>
                          <p>
                            Because we assume that exact solution of the minimization problem (or equivalently, solving the corresponding linear equation) cannot be done efficiently, 
                            we will look at <emph>iterative methods</emph>, i.e. we will construct an iteration \(x_{i}\mapsto x_{i+1}\) such that the sequence 
                            \[ x_0, x_1,x_2,\ldots\] converges to the minimum.
                          </p>

                        <p>We are going to discuss iterative optimization methods, i.e. we will construct
                          a sequence \[x_0, x_1, x_2,\ldots\] such that

                          <li>The more iterations we compute, the closer we are to \(x^\star\), i.e. \(\lim_{i\to\infty} x_i = x^\star.\)</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>Compare this to the direct solution of the optimization problem, which is possible by computing \(x^\star \) such that \(A x^\star = b\). This is one giant calculation and it does not make sense to "stop early", i.e. you
                        are either done or not (with the obvious upside of the solution being provably exact).</p>

                        <li>The error \(e_i\) is a quantity used in theoretical analysis of the optimization algorithms but is inaccessible for each concrete optimization problem.</li>
                        <li>The residual \(r_i\) is the direction of steepest descent and is easily computed by \(r_i = b - Ax_i\). </li>
                        <li>Error and residual do in general <emph>not</emph> point along the same axis. It is for this reason that gradient descent does not converge in exactly one step (more to this later).</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We have been running a fully remote team since we first started experimenting with some of the key aspects around <a href="https://www.archimydes.dev/" target="_blank">Archimydes</a> in the summer of 2017. Back then, it was just 3 people: two developers, one based out of Melbourne, the other based out of Perth, and myself based out of New York City. Since then, the core team has scaled to approximately a half dozen developers and a similar number of designers, QA analysts and product folks. The team now stretches from Melbourne to San Francisco. We have achieved some decent success in that time frame, including:</p><ul><li><p>Attracting $1M in pre-seed funding last year</p></li><li><p>100% customer retention from early 2018 through to late 2019</p></li><li><p>Great initial response to our core offerings from the developer community</p></li></ul><p>We like to think of ourselves up to this point as a relatively successful <strong>remote-native</strong> story and wanted to share with you some of the things that we have learned along the way. These lessons are useful regardless of whether you, like us, consider yourself <strong>remote-native</strong>, remote-first, remote-friendly, or are considering going remote at any level. Below are what we consider the Big 3 lessons learned.</p><ul><li><p>Minimize communication friction</p></li><li><p>Develop a hub and spoke staffing model</p></li><li><p>Conduct auditions, not interviews</p> <br></li></ul><p><strong>MINIMIZE COMMUNICATION FRICTION</strong></p><hr><p>This one sounds fairly obvious, but the devil is in the details. What is the #1 cause of communication friction in managing a remote team? By far and away, the award goes to <strong>unclear requirements</strong>. In our experience, most of the challenges in software development can be attributed back to unclear or ambiguous requirements, not poor developers. This results in all kinds of delays, back-and-forth and, quite often, failed projects. Let's illustrate this with an actual example of where we were when we first started and where we are today in terms of requirements:</p> <br><h3>Sample Requirement (circa 2017):</h3><p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, when I click "submit" on the landing page, I am navigated to the first page of the intake application and my account is created in the background.</p> <p><strong>Detail:</strong> As a user, when I am coming through the landing page into the intake application</p><ul><li><p>My account, against the email that I provided on the landing page, is automatically created.</p></li><li><p>An email is sent to me, with a link, in case I want to access my non-submitted user stories.</p></li></ul><h3>Sample Requirement (2020):</h3><p><strong>User Story:</strong> As a user, I should be able to view a single comment</p><p><strong>Story Category:</strong> Design | Frontend | <strong>API</strong></p><p><strong>Authenticated:</strong> Yes</p><p><strong>RBAC:</strong> Any authenticated user that has permissions for that entity</p><p><strong>API Description:</strong> Any authenticated user is able to get a comment against comment id</p><p><strong>Architecture Requirements:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Implement using Type ORM -- refer to existing implementations for reference</p></li><li><p>Typescript to be used through the development</p></li></ul><p><strong>Datastore Requirements:</strong></p><p>Refer to reference table structure identified here: URL to reference table structure</p><p><strong>Unit Test Cases:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Able to get a comment against a comment id</p></li><li><p>Test against if entity is private or user does not have permissions on that entity (<em>e.g</em>. a project that is owned by someone else should not be able to fetch the comment)</p></li><li><p>Admin role type can fetch any comment</p></li><li><p>if user is the comment creator, then should be allowed to fetch the comment</p></li></ul><p><strong>API Reference Documentation:</strong> URL to swagger hub API documentation</p><p><strong>Implemented API:</strong> URL to implemented API</p><p><strong>Success Criteria:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Able to get a comment by comment id</p></li><li><p>If entity type has view permissions then authenticated user needs to have those permissions in order to get comment against that entity type and id</p></li><li><p>Admin can get comment on all entities without permission checks</p></li><li><p>Author of the comment should be able to get the comment</p></li></ul><p>We will get to the nitty-gritty of how we write out user stories and acceptance criteria in a later post, but for now let's look at some of the common criticisms that one might hear, including:</p><ul><li><p><strong>This requires too much effort</strong>: Yes it does, but so what? What is the job of your solution architect, product manager, and business analysts if not to make requirements explicit and clear? Developers, remote or otherwise, are not sorcerers -- they cannot guess what's in your head. If you can't talk to a machine in its language, at least communicate to those that can in the clearest manner possible.</p></li><li><p><strong>But we are an agile shop!</strong>: Where in the <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html" target="_blank">Agile Manifesto</a> does it say that you need to work off of unclear and/or ambiguous requirements? The purpose of agile is to release software quickly and iteratively, and to communicate clearly and throughout the development process, not to be unclear about what is required.</p></li><li><p><strong>This takes away from a developer's creative agency</strong>: A developer's job is to be creative in his/her solution for a given requirement, not to be inventive in creating the requirement. Yes, developers, will occasionally question the need for a particular requirement, but it's the job of the solution architect and product manager to prioritize requirements.</p></li></ul><p>All-in-all, the #1 thing your team can do when working remotely to minimize communication friction is provide clear requirements. If they are not as clear as the sample above then that's fine, but a good rule of thumb is that any questions arising from a requirement should be addressable within 1 or 2 Jira comments or in your daily stand up.</p><p>This goes beyond communicating software development requirements, we adhere to these same principles even when communicating other types of business requirements. More on this in later posts.</p>  <p><strong>DEVELOP A HUB AND SPOKE OPERATING MODEL:</strong></p><hr><p>When we first started we had the team spread across 2 countries and 3 different time zones. Today we have a team spread across half a dozen countries, and across 7 different time zones. Have you ever tried organizing a scrum call that works for everyone in Melbourne, Bangalore and San Francisco? In a 24-hour time window there is literally only 1 somewhat normal working hour, 7 PM San Francisco time (8:30 AM Bangalore, 2 PM Melbourne), where a scrum call is possible across these time zones:</p><center><img src="https://fourthact.co//wp-content/uploads/2020/02/htime-sf-melbourne-bengaluru-3feb2020.png" width="100%"></center><p>Credit:<a href="https://www.thehtime.com/intersect?locations=USA+-+San+Francisco%2CAustralia+-+Melbourne%2CIndia+-+Bangalore" target="_blank"> thehtime.com</a></p>  <p>Now, lets add Lagos, Nigeria, a very really realistic scenario for our team, into this mix and see what we end up with:</p><center><img src="https://fourthact.co//wp-content/uploads/2020/02/htime-sf-melbourne-bengaluru-lagos-3feb2020.png" width="100%"></center><p>Credit:<a href="https://www.thehtime.com/intersect?locations=USA+-+San+Francisco%2CAustralia+-+Melbourne%2CIndia+-+Bangalore%2CNigeria+-+Lagos" target="_blank"> thehtime.com</a></p>  <p>Suddenly there are literally zero time slots that work for everyone involved. How did we solve for this? We took a page from the airline industry and went the hub-and-spoke model. We now consider ourselves having 2 hub locations -- New York and Bengaluru and try to center teams around these locations. This is what a time intersect between NYC, San Francisco, and Lagos looks for us:</p><center><img src="https://fourthact.co//wp-content/uploads/2020/02/htime-sf-nyc-lagos-3feb2020.png" width="100%"></center><p>Credit:<a href="https://www.thehtime.com/intersect?locations=USA+-+San+Francisco%2CUSA+-+New+York%2CNigeria+-+Lagos" target="_blank"> thehtime.com</a></p>  <p>In the above example, NYC is the hub location. We now have a 2-hour time window that works well, in relatively normal working hours, for everyone across each city:</p><ul><li><p>San Francisco: 8:00 AM -- 10:00 AM</p></li><li><p>NYC: 11:00 AM -- 1:00 PM</p></li><li><p>Lagos: 5:00 PM -- 7:00 PM</p></li></ul><p>It's even better in the case of Bangalore, Melbourne, and Dubai (see below), where there is a 4-hour time zone overlap between the three cities.</p><center><img src="https://fourthact.co//wp-content/uploads/2020/02/time-zone-bangaloremelbournedubai1.png" width="100%"></center><p>Credit:<a href="https://www.thehtime.com/intersect?locations=USA+-+San+Francisco%2CUSA+-+New+York%2CNigeria+-+Lagos" target="_blank"> thehtime.com</a></p><p><strong>Note</strong>: <a href="https://www.thehtime.com/" target="_blank">Htime</a> in particular is a great tool at a remote team's disposal. It's objective is to develop a new clock concept that eliminates time zone math. It utilizes UTC and rotates based on your location. It unifies the reading of time everywhere, as a result no more time difference calculations are required.</p>  <p><strong>CONDUCT AUDITIONS NOT INTERVIEWS:</strong></p><hr><p>When you are working with developers or other resources remotely it is not good enough to know that they have the appropriate skill. What's as critical is to determine if they can execute their job with minimal communication friction and with an appropriate level of responsiveness in a remote manner. In order to accomplish this, our on-boarding process looks something like this:</p><center><img src="https://fourthact.co//wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2audition-process-v01-msa-4feb2020.png" width="100%"></center><p>A few salient points that need further explanation:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Do a quick screening audition prior to a skills interview.</strong> In our experience, developers with only limited or theoretical knowledge of concepts can generally pass a skills interview, however, those same developers might struggle with real-world work. To avoid this problem we reverse the order. We give them a very real-world screening audition upfront and test how they perform. If they perform well, then we move them to a skills interview. This also preserves the valuable time of on-boarded developers in executing interviews up-front.</p></li><li><p><strong>Make sure that the auditions are as realistic as possible</strong>. In particular, test them with as-close-to-real-world-work as possible. We use pre-designed simulated projects for the screening audition and a real project for the extended audition. Requirements are communicated to auditioning developers in the same user story and acceptance criteria format as they will be expected to work in so that there is no ambiguity in terms of how requirements will be communicated and what the criteria are that need to be met for a requirement to be considered complete.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do an extended audition even if the developer passes the screening audition and the skills interview</strong>. In some cases, we have found that developers get through a screening audition and skills interview fine, but then you run into problems with them that you cannot pick up in a relatively quick screening audition or skills interview. A very common example here is around developer responsiveness. A remote developer might be very responsive when going through a 4-8 hour screening audition, however it is very hard to fake responsiveness over an extended period of time.</p></li></ul><p>In summary it is critical that remote teams account for extremely clear communication, a hub and spoke operating model, and an audition process instead of traditional interviews. In our experience, these three tweaks make for a better company regardless of your remote work policy.</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>You probably know the saying: "Don't compare apples with oranges." You have other desires and value different things than (probably) your neighbor. You may pay a subscription fee for a cute productivity app, but your dear neighbor won't. One price simply does not fit all!&nbsp;<br></p><p>If you already published a mobile app, you already came across at least one customer complaining about your pricing. An excellent strategy to tackle that dilemma is a concept called "dynamic pricing", which we covered in a previous blog post: "<a href="https://www.getmage.io/post/dynamic-pricing-for-mobile-apps">Dynamic Pricing for mobile Apps</a>". Dynamic pricing in a mobile app context is a pricing strategy where you set multiple price points of your in-app purchase products for different customer types. This way, you can charge different amounts of money depending on the person you are selling to! The problem you need to solve is how to group your customers for different prices. This process is called customer segmentation.<br></p><p>In this blog post, we want to cover the four most effective customer segmentation methods for mobile app users.<br>‍<br></p><h2>Customer segmentation by demographics&nbsp;</h2><p>In the non-mobile app environment, we sometimes see pricing based on demographics. A good example is special discounts for the young or elderly. Seeing that kind of discrimination in action in a mobile app is probably hard to witness. It may happen without the user noticing anything.&nbsp;<br></p><p>Since we are in the mobile app environment, app developers can collect all kinds of data about app users. Age, gender, language, or other characteristics might come in handy to group people of different purchasing powers together. Using demographics is probably the most effective kind of user segmentation, but it also has several drawbacks.<br></p><p>First of all, using that kind of data always needs to be in the user's consent. In any case, sensitive information should be communicated clearly, and legal advice should always be taken before implementing any customer data gathering. This goes especially when you want to offer your app to customers in the EU.<br></p><p>Second of all, practice pricing discrimination on these kinds of sensible characteristics might be recognized as unethical. In some cases, it could also be illegal! Keep that in mind.<br>‍<br></p><h2>Customer segmentation by mobile app user behavior&nbsp;</h2><p>Like using a user's demographic characteristics, app developers might segment users by their behavior and actions inside an app. This practice may also be a more privacy-friendly solution, as long as the usage data cannot be used to identify the user uniquely.<br></p><p>An example would be the usage time or login frequency. In the case of a dating app, it could be the number of swipes or within a gaming app, the number of achieved levels. There are thousands of possibilities to use this kind of information. The drawback is that it is sometimes hard to quantify if an attribute makes sense for segmentation purposes. Especially combinations of behavior attributes may result in thousands of customer groups. These groups may somehow need to be categorized together to prevent enormous complexity and too many price points. Hence a data science team may be required to accomplish such a segmentation.<br>‍<br></p><h2>App user segmentation based on device type&nbsp;</h2><p>Welcome to an ancient and often useless discussion. Do Android users have a lower purchasing power than Apple users? Sure, you can segment your app's users by the app store platform. But which users of which platform pay more? Studies found that apps may be more expensive in the Android environment due to less app competition. Others found that Apple users have a higher purchasing power. Putting all that aside, it will likely vary from app to app. Hence research is needed. A general answer might be as meaningful as the current position of the moon relative to the earth.<br></p><p>But a segmentation based on the app store platform is just one way of segmenting a device. You can go even further. You could segment based on the device manufacturer, device age, os version, or even network provider. But again, massive research is needed to put this kind of segmentation to work.<br>‍<br></p><h2>In-App purchase power segmentation by country&nbsp;</h2><p>The most simple yet powerful segmentation possible is by the app users' location. It's well known that developed countries have a higher purchasing power than an emerging economy. So why would you charge the same price for your in-app purchase in both regions? You will miss a lot of sales in low-income countries if the price is as high as in wealthier countries. The other way around, you would probably have high opportunity costs! In both cases, you would "lose" money. The question that remains is, how do we know what to charge for in-app purchases in each country? The answer again is excessive research in all app store countries. Which means running hundreds of price sensitivity tests around the globe.<br>‍<br></p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>All strategies for a mobile customer segmentation have their advantages and disadvantages. In the end, you need to know how many resources you are able to spend on price optimization. All strategies do require a lot of time and work. You probably need at least one person in a full-time job position who manages the whole research, implementation, and testing process. What you also have to keep in mind is that markets always change. Once you completed your first market research, your knowledge will not be true forever. It is a continuous process of learning and adapting. Like rolling out mobile app updates, you always want to update your research and implement your latest findings, aka in-app purchase prices.<br></p><p>The good thing is that there is a cost-effective alternative for doing in-app purchase price optimization based on the country and device segmentation strategy: Mage.<br></p><p>With Mage, you do not need to change your app's logic or hire a data science team. You just need to configure your app and its product in our dashboard. Once you have done that, you are going to add new in-app purchases to Google Play Console or iTunes Connect. After completion, you implement our SDK for iOS, Android, or React-Native. The whole process may take up two to eight hours, depending on the complexity of your app. After that, you have an automatic price research and optimization process for your in-app purchases in 170+ countries. Mage generates new price recommendations for you on a continuous basis. You can always accept or deny price changes. Once you accept a price change, the new price goes live to your app users without the need to update your app.<br></p><p>With Mage, you get price optimization through a user segmentation based on country and device. Our future versions probably offer other strategies as well. So stay tuned!</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p>Published on: 2020-09-13</p>
        
<p>I'm a fan of tea and cinnamon, but I dare say my enjoyment of these things wouldn't be motivation enough to go on a murderous crusade across the globe and fund the world's biggest empire.</p>
<p>Granted, it wasn't only tea and cinnamon that motivated the British, Dutch, French, Belgians, Spanish, and Germans to conquer the world. It was also silver, gold, exotic wood, peppercorn, silk, and coffee.</p>
<p>But on the whole, it always seems odd to me that there was this 400-year gap in whig history, where technology and social cohesion was progressing at an astounding rate, with its almost sole driver being to fund the colonialist armies that supplied spices to the aristocrats.</p>
<p>This is only made more surprising by the fact that this period seems like a sucky one to live in.</p>
<p>Don't get me wrong, the middle ages weren't all fun and dandy, but on the whole, I can see worst fates than being a peasant doing that time. Life expectancy was up into your 60s once you made it past 4, wars were seldom and not bloody and your diet would have made a lot of modern health nuts jealous. Add to that a relative lack of plagues, reasonably lose sexual taboos, and having a strong community that's there for you both in good and bad times.</p>
<p>Compare that to the first and second industrial revolutions. Smog is covering half of Europe, children as young as 10 are working 14-hour shifts in factories, the countryside is overpopulated. The cities spawn so many plagues that it's regarded as a common fact of life. None of the advances of medicine are upon us, clean water has become a commodity, and food for the "working classes" is so vile a modern-day human would be forgiven for preferring starvation.</p>
<p>Now consider the fact that Europe was "the oppressor" in this period. People here were faring "better" than the ones being massacred and enslaved by our guns and germs.</p>
<p>Yet during all this time, somewhere in the background, not heavily incentivized but developed out of curiosity and sometimes necessity, modern physics, chemistry, biology, mechanical engineering, and medicine are born.</p>
<p>This is outright infuriating, it's not a story of progress, it's a story of luck. Of luck that the pointless slaughter in search of spices and shiny rocks somehow resulted in a few visionaries being able to put the scaffoldings for a better future.</p>
<h2>I</h2>
<p>This is kind of how I feel about the modern world and the way we are using hardware and software.</p>
<p>Improving hardware means we can run software faster and gather data at ever-increasing rates and resolution. Improving software gives us more complex algorithms to extract insights out of that data and solve coordination problems between people.</p>
<p>And by golly, solving coordination problems and gathering insights about the world seem like a good idea since we have some fairly serious problems in those areas.</p>
<p>I don't want to draw attention to any particular political problem a given sociopolitical tribe thinks is of great importance at the moment, but rather to the broader context.</p>
<p>Every day it feels like more pieces are falling in place and we are getting closer and closer to solving problems we would have thought to be the realm of actual Gods when the 20th century was in its infancy.</p>
<p>There are real opening through which we can tackle the problem of aging, essentially solving most diseases and potentially defeating death itself.</p>
<p>Visionaries among us are cracking the problem of traveling over long distances and surviving in harsh environments. So much so that a Mars colony now seems like an overdue reality rather than the realm of science fiction.</p>
<p>We have machines that can automate the most physically demanding and repetitive tasks away from us. Be them driving, mining, working in warehouses, working a checkout counter, or building homes. It feels like all modern humans could be philosophers, poets, mathematicians, musicians, outright hedonists. Living a life full of creating meaning and exploring the joy-inducing limits of consciousness.</p>
<p>Most if not all parasitic and bacterial diseases, together with the hunger that's plaguing the less developed countries, seem like a matter of funding to eradicate. Some extra mosquito nets and better insecticides would be enough to rid the world of a disease that is killing hundreds of thousands and making hundreds of millions more suffer terribly each year.</p>
<p>On the other hand, we face an ever-looming specter of death and misery. Or rather, we face several. From the damage being often pointlessly inflicted upon our soil and atmosphere in order to cut costs. To the ever-growing population bubble in places that will be hardest hit by environmental calamities, to the literal arsenal of humanity-eradicating weapons that China, Russia, India, Pakistan, the UK, France, and the USA are pointing at each other. A few dozen clicks or 2 unlucky software bugs away from triggering Armageddon.</p>
<p>Ok, maybe I am taking a bit too much poetic license here.</p>
<p>Maybe the scary things aren't so scary. Maybe the utopian vision is not so close.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p><em>Still</em>, one gets a feeling we could be doing better. Maybe not all of us, but those of us working on software certainly could.</p>
<p>Have you had a look at Unicron startups lately?</p>
<p>Other than SpaceX, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unicorn_startup_companies">the US and Europe have</a> Strip, JUUL, Palantir, Airbnb, Epic Games, Instacart, Wish, UiPath, Robinhood, Coinbase, DoorDash, WeWork... etc.</p>
<p>These are not companies working on humanity-advancing problems, these are marketing-driven monsters trying to create monopolies around phone banking, vaping, home-delivery, crypto trading (which I find particularly disturbing since the whole value of crypto comes from decentralization), ad data collection, and short-term property renting.</p>
<p>And when one looks at the tech giants, companies like Google, Apples, Facebook, and Twitter, the situation becomes even more dire.</p>
<p>A sea of talented people working on the most redundant of problems, how to keep a monkey glued to a dopamine-inducing screen in order to better imprint advertising material into its brain.</p>
<p>From this sea of pointless rehashing of crab-bucket-economy ideas a few interesting things arose. After all, Google is funding Deep Mind and creating JAX, and google maps. Facebook is funding the development of PyTorch. And apple is... certainly doing something useful, it initially put a lot of the money behind the original development efforts towards clang &amp; llvm.</p>
<p>But any and all advancements that will bring us closer to a utopian future are incidental, happy accidents not core goals. It is indeed a happy coincidence that the same techniques used to auto-label photos and separate them into albums lead to miraculous advances in <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/AlphaFold-Using-AI-for-scientific-discovery">molding in-vitro protein folding</a>. But make no mistake, 99% of the progress that we have right now are happy coincidences.</p>
<p>Neural networks are praised as an innovation of modern ML/computer-science that has near-universal applications and much-untapped potential. But autograd and the kind of tensor-graph based computation being used have been "a thing" since the 50s.</p>
<p>It isn't researchers that made neural networks viable and useful, it's GPU companies. And the fact that Nvidia stumbled upon this market is in itself a fortunate accident. The purpose of GPUs was to generate higher framerates and more detailed graphics for people playing World of Warcraft as part of their doritos&amp;monutain-dew fueled run on the hedonic treadmill. It is a stroke of luck that this same hardware proved adequate enough for solving problems that might revolutionize the way we do science, math, and intellectual labor.</p>
<p>Much like the first and second industrial revolutions happened to have small niches where better science was required to speed up progress, so does the internet revolution.</p>
<p>But much like the driver of the first and second industrial revolution was a pointless quest for spice, so is the engine of our current era a pointless quest for click generation and on-demand indoctrination.</p>
<p>We are none the wiser or happier, indeed one could argue <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/115/26/6674">our environment is making us dumber</a> (well, at least one could if our data point was every single military-aged man in Norway, but I'm not sure how representative that is). We must go further and further back in history in order to consider our station in life to be "favorable" compared to that of our ancestors.</p>
<h2>III</h2>
<p>I don't think a solution to our current predicament doesn't exist. Nor do I think this is a particularly novel or desperate situation.</p>
<p>Progress seems to inevitably come from happy accidents and small niches of insane people drudging away at seemingly pointless problems. There never was and never will be a kingdom founded on the pursuit of a better life for those who are yet to be born.</p>
<p>Indeed, I think that we live in a time more hopeful than any, where the tech economy has allowed smarter-than-average people such as Bill Gates to accumulate large amounts of wealth with which they can fund utopian projects.</p>
<p>Even more so, we have spare time more than ever and a lot of computational resources available to almost everyone.</p>
<p>But I think the message I'm trying to convey, is that we shouldn't forget there is software which has and will continue to be critical for the advancement of the "noble" goals of humanity, be those spreading into spaces or alleviating suffering and bringing joy here on Earth.</p>
<p>It includes things like the linux kernel, llvm, rustc, wikipedia, autograd, coq , and thousands of other such projects. Almost all of them worked on by volunteers or by people taking below-market wages and working long hours, funded by the charity of governments and tech giants.</p>
<p>But for every person working on world-changing projects, there's 100 more working on perfecting banner insertion into mobile apps and web pages. For every person working on important software, there's 100 working on the 9th iteration of an online-store frontend. For every SpaceX and DeepMind, there's 100 Ubers and Airbnbs.</p>
<p>Progress, it seems to me, is not the …</p></div></div>

<p><span>Blog post 11 September 2020, by Tom Tervoort, Senior Security Specialist and Ralph Moonen, Technical Director at Secura</span></p>
<p><span><span><em></em></span></span><span><strong><span>Last month, Microsoft patched a very interesting vulnerability that would allow an attacker with a foothold on your internal network to essentially become Domain Admin with one click. All that is required is for a connection to the Domain Controller to be possible from the attacker’s viewpoint. </span></strong></span></p>
<p><span>Secura's security expert Tom Tervoort previously discovered <strong><span><a target="_blank" href="https://www.secura.com/blog-cve-2019-1424" rel="noopener noreferrer">a less severe Netlogon vulnerability last year that allowed workstations to be taken over</a></span></strong>, but the attacker required a Person-in-the-Middle (PitM) position for that to work. Now, he discovered this second, much more severe (CVSS score: 10.0) vulnerability in the protocol. By forging an authentication token for specific Netlogon functionality, he was able to call a function to set the computer password of the Domain Controller to a known value. After that, the attacker can use this new password to take control over the domain controller and steal credentials of a domain admin. </span></p>
<p><span>The vulnerability stems from a flaw in a cryptographic authentication scheme used by the Netlogon Remote Protocol, which among other things can be used to update computer passwords. This flaw allows attackers to impersonate any computer, including the domain controller itself, and execute remote procedure calls on their behalf. </span></p>
<p><span>Secura urges everybody to install the patch on all their domain controllers as fast as possible. Please refer to Microsoft’s advisory. <strong>We published a test tool on Github</strong>, which you can download here:&nbsp;<strong><span><a href="https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472">https://github.com/SecuraBV/CVE-2020-1472</a></span></strong> that can tell you whether a domain controller is vulnerable or not.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p><img src="https://matej.laitl.cz/images/2020-09-13-bench-rust-kotlin-microservices/cover.png" alt="illustration">
Back in spring 2020 at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>,
we were looking to replace our <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework">Spring</a>-<a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>
duo by a more lightweight framework to power our future Kotlin microservices.
We did some detailed (at times philosophical) theoretical comparisons that I much enjoyed,
but these cannot substitute a hands-on experience.
We decided to implement proof-of-concept microservices using the most viable frameworks,
stressing them in a benchmark along the way.
While <strong>Kotlin</strong> was the main language,
I saw this as an opportunity to have some fun at home and test (my proficiency with) <strong>Rust</strong>,
which is touted for being fast.
I ended up stress-testing Kotlinâ€™s <a href="https://www.http4k.org/"><strong>Http4k</strong></a>, <a href="https://ktor.io/"><strong>Ktor</strong></a>,
and Rustâ€™s <a href="https://actix.rs/"><strong>Actix</strong> Web</a>, read on to see how they fared.</p>

<p><em>Feel free to <a href="#the-results">jump to the results</a> and read the background later, if youâ€™re impatient.</em></p>

<h2 id="on-techempower-framework-benchmarks">On TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Why not just refer to excellent <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/">TechEmpower Benchmarks (TEB)</a>?</p>

<p>A very valid question to ask. A couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submitted TEB implementations tend to be rather optimised.
We wanted to measure such a code style that we would normally write:
one striving to be simple/idiomatic/readable,
but finished promptly and not extensively profiled.
On the other hand, we wanted to include production-grade API error handling
(correct HTTP codes and JSON error messages listing problems of individual parameters etc.),
request logging, and OpenAPI (Swagger) spec generation.</li>
  <li>Besides high-water req/s performance and associated latencies,
we wanted to capture more operational characteristics like memory usage, CPU usage and efficiency,
along the lifetime of a microservice instance.</li>
  <li>In production, we run our microservices in a rather high-density Kubernetes cluster,
where every instance has to be CPU- and memory-constrained.
We wanted to simulate this environment
and check whether we can use trending â€œserverlessâ€� offerings for new services.</li>
  <li>Our data store, Elasticsearch, differs from ones included in TEB,
and we were curious how synchronous vs. asynchronous flavours of the Elasticsearch client compare.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-service">The Service</h2>

<p>For a description of the service to implement &amp; benchmark,
<a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/api-spec.md">see its API Spec document available in the locations-rs repository</a>.</p>

<p>We benchmark its simplest <code>/city/v1/get</code> endpoint,
whose work is to look up a <code>city</code> document by id in Elasticsearch,
look up associated <code>region</code> document,
and render response JSON.
It uses internal in-memory cache for regions (there is just tens of them),
but no cache for much more numerous cities.</p>

<p>To reduce bandwidth when fetching documents from Elasticsearch,
all implementations instruct it to strip (at least) the largest property <code>geometry</code>.
This property is only used in Elasticsearch-side filtering, not by the microservice.
I believe the stripping significantly strains Elasticsearch
(or rather transfers the strain from the microservice to it).</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark">The Benchmark</h2>

<h3 id="recipe">Recipe</h3>

<p>The benchmark consists of multiple identical â€œrunsâ€� for each Dockerised implementation spawned
by <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/bench-3-impls.py">bench-3-impls.py</a>.
The runs are named after the implementation and their ordinal number,
thus <code>rs-actix-1</code> is the first run of the Rust (Actix) implementation,
and <code>kt-ktor-3</code> is the third run of Kotlin (Ktor) implementation.</p>

<p>Each run simulates the first couple of minutes of the microservice instance using <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/test-image.py">test-image.py</a>.
Steps of one run:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Docker container is started, measuring the time until the service starts responding,</li>
  <li>a suite of HTTP checks is made ensuring correct responses and error handling behaviour,</li>
  <li>HTTP load is generated using <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a>
in a series of 10-second long steps with increasing concurrent connection count;
the metrics are collected from <code>wrk</code> and Docker API after each step:
    <ul>
      <li>first 5 steps use just one concurrent connection, acting as a warm-up,</li>
      <li>each of the next 11 steps doubles concurrent connection count, i.e. continuing with 2, 4,
8, â€¦, 1024, 2048.<sup id="fnref:conn-count" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:conn-count">1</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, all runs are plotted using the awesome <a href="http://www.pygal.org/">Pygal</a> library
in <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/render-tests.py">render-tests.py</a>.
Different runs of a single implementation use the same colour,
allowing for visual inspection of the variance between them.</p>

<h3 id="runtime-environment">Runtime Environment</h3>

<p>Docker is told to constrain resources available to the microservice containers,
a practice usual in typical Kubernetes clusters.</p>

<p>The CPU is limited to 1.5 CPU-units using an equivalent of the <code>--cpus=1.5</code> Docker option.
This means that even though the instance has access to all 4 CPU cores of the machine,
it can use only 15 CPU-seconds (out of theoretical 40 CPU-seconds) in each 10-wall-clock-second step.
The value of 1.5 was chosen small enough to ensure the tested microservice is the actual bottle-neck during the benchmark,
and large enough to assert frameworks make proper use of multiple CPU cores.</p>

<p>Memory is limited to 512 MiB. I argue that anything beyond 512 MiB should not be called a <em>micro</em>service.</p>

<p>The two JVM-hosted Kotlin implementations run in OpenJDK 11,
with <code>-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75</code> as the sole option.
It should allow JVM to allocate up to 75% of available 512 MiB memory to Java heap.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>The benchmarks run on 2 Virtual Machines in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Engine
located in the same zone.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1st VM, <code>n2d-highcpu-4</code> machine type (4 AMD Epyc <em>Rome</em> vCPUs, 4 GB memory):
    <ul>
      <li>Runs the benchmarked microservice in a Docker container <em>and</em> the <code>wrk</code> load generator.</li>
      <li>As the container is limited to 1.5 CPU and <code>wrk</code> takes less than leftover 2.5 CPUs,
they should not affect each other.</li>
      <li>Indeed, the maximum CPU utilisation during short peaks never exceeded 70%.</li>
      <li>The N2D <a href="https://www.quortex.io/post/an-open-source-framework-to-benchmark-cloud-providers-performances-for-live-streaming">machine type is said to have the best performance/cost ratio on GCP and even across cloud providers</a>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>2nd VM, <code>e2-custom</code> machine type
(12 <a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/compute/understanding-dynamic-resource-management-in-e2-vms">high-density vCPUs</a>, 6 GB memory):
    <ul>
      <li>Runs a stock Dockerised Elasticsearch 7.8.0 instance, storage backend for the microservices.</li>

<p>We also initially implemented a Kotlin proof-of-concept in <a href="https://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a>,
but it turned out none of the team members was keen on the programming paradigm this framework suggested
(which may be a subjective matter), so we hadnâ€™t proceeded further with it.</p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-locations-kt-http4k">The Story of <code>locations-kt-http4k</code></h3>

<p>Http4k Locations service was written by <a href="https://buhvi.co/">@<strong>goodhoko</strong></a> at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>.
It became the production implementation at GoOut
and is thus most complete along with extras like Swagger serving.</p>

<p>Http4k <a href="https://www.http4k.org/guide/modules/servers/">allows one to select from several server backends</a>,
so we first need to do a qualification benchmark and select the best performing engine to be fair.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-http4k-server-engines-pub/bench-results.html"><strong>Kttp4k server engine results on a dedicated page</strong></a>.
Line labels on the graph correspond to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gooutopensource/locations-kt-http4k/-/tags">tags in the locations-kt-http4k repository</a>.</p>

<p>One nice side-effect of this benchmarking was that
I have <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/141#issuecomment-679330954">discovered a cause</a>
of the <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/141"><strong>Netty</strong> backend performance issue</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/pull/480">@<strong>daviddenton</strong> was quick to fix it</a>.
The <code>netty-updfix-*</code> graphs, which exhibit some nice latency characteristics, already contain the fix.
It was later released in http4k v3.259.0 (be sure to upgrade if you use this backend).</p>

<p><strong>Apache HttpCore</strong> version 4.4, labelled as <code>apache4-*</code>, was most CPU-efficient backend
and achieved shared first place in peak req/s performance.
However, it tends to draw too much memory as the number of concurrent connections grows,
and is out-of-memory-killed once their number reaches (extreme) 1024.
Apache HttpCore version 5.0 (<code>apache-*</code>) and a variant with lowered socket backlog (<code>apache-q100-*</code>)
suffer from the same problem.
I have <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/481">opened an issue</a> to see if thatâ€™s a bug or not,
insights welcome.
Meanwhile, I would recommend different http4k backends for services not shielded by load balancers.</p>

<p>The winner of this qualification round is the <strong>Undertow</strong> backend
(<code>undertow-*</code> for v3.163.0 and <code>undertow-upd-*</code> for v3.258.0),
which shares the first place in high-water req/s performance,
but also brings good all-round results in the rest of the metrics,
especially memory consumption under load.</p>

<p>The <strong>Jetty</strong> backend (<code>jetty-*</code>) slightly but consistently lags behind other production engines
in most metrics.
For completeness, I have also included the <strong>SunHttp</strong> backend that is intended for development only,
which the benchmarks confirm.</p>

<p><em>Update: Http4k author <a href="https://gitlab.com/gooutopensource/locations-kt-http4k/-/issues/1">has pointed out that OpenAPI generation through Contracts API may incur some performance penalty</a>.
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-http4k-contractless/bench-results.html"><strong>Benchmarks confirm that removing the Contracts layer indeed increases performance</strong></a>, shifting Http4k closer to Ktor.
Graphs below reflect the original version with Contracts (OpenAPI support).</em></p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-locations-kt-ktor">The Story of <code>locations-kt-ktor</code></h3>

<p>Ktor variant was also written by <a href="https://buhvi.co/">@<strong>goodhoko</strong></a> at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>,
I later tweaked the <code>/city/v1/get</code> endpoint for functional parity with other implementations.
It remains the least complete implementation with just this single endpoint.</p>

<p>It uses <a href="https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client">es-kotlin-wrapper-client</a> to wrap
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-high-getting-started-asynchronous-usage.html">intrinsic async API of the Elasticsearch client</a>
into Kotlin coroutines.</p>

<p>Ktor also allows for pluggable HTTP server engines which I benchmarked.
See <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-ktor-server-engines/bench-results.html"><strong>Ktor server engine benchmarks page</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The pattern is similar here with <strong>Netty</strong> being more efficient and performant than <strong>Jetty</strong>,
thus qualified as Ktorâ€™s engine of choice for the main benchmark.</p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-locations-rs">The story of <code>locations-rs</code></h3>

<p>I wrote the Rust clone in my free time, closely following the development of <code>locations-kt-http4k</code>.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/iqq8k9/announcing_actixweb_v30/">Actix Web 3.0 was <em>just</em> released</a>
and I was eager to compare how it fares against v2.0 performance-wise.
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-actix-versions/bench-results.html"><strong>The one-to-one benchmark shows v3.0 is at least on par with v2.0</strong></a>.
I think thatâ€™s good news given that v3.0 …</p></div></div>

"We call it the silent killer," she&nbsp;told <a href="http://cbc.ca/day6"><em><u>Day 6</u></em></a><em> </em>host Brent Bambury.</p>  <p>According to a <u><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125937/">recent study out of Duke University</a></u>, heat-related illnesses are responsible for more than 12,000 premature deaths each year in the U.S.</p>  <p>The U.S. Centres for Disease Control, meanwhile, puts that number at approximately 600. Baughman-McLeod says the lower number is likely the result of underreporting given many health record-keeping systems don't allow for heat-related mortality and morbidity in most places.</p>  <p>"Part of the challenge is that we don't keep records of heat-related illness and death, and oftentimes you would show up to the emergency room with a heat illness and it would be categorized as a kidney failure or a heart attack," she said.</p>  <h2>Protecting the most vulnerable</h2>  <p>Several cities — including Athens, Tel Aviv and Melbourne — and international climate organizations have signed on in support of the alliance's naming goal.</p>  <p>Those living in cities are more susceptible to the effects of extreme heat. Cities are built from materials that trap heat and lead to a "heat island effect" that can increase temperatures by up to 8 C, sayid&nbsp;Baughman-McLeod.</p>    <p>She believes that naming heat waves could help create measures that protect those most vulnerable to the heat, including those living in cities without access to air conditioning or other ways to cool down.</p>  <p>"Farm workers and delivery workers and construction workers ...&nbsp;wouldn't be expected to work during a named heat wave where they are," she said as an example.</p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>Area residents capture video along the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge as the city's skies are blanketed with smog and debris from wildfires throughout the state.<!-- --> <!-- -->0:45</span></span></span></p>  <p>With a name, she argued, news and social media could more easily elevate awareness of a heat wave.</p>  <p>But not everyone agrees on what is considered extreme heat, a challenge Baughman-McLeod is aware of.</p>  <p>She says that for this to work, an international framework must be created. From there, regions will be able to adapt what is considered extreme to their own climate.</p>  <p>"It will be about local conditions and the people who live in those areas there, what they're used to," she said.</p>  <p>When the U.S.-based Weather Channel began naming winter storms, there was <a href="https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/74744/why-it-controversial-name-winter-storms">disagreement</a> among meteorologists and scientists. While Baughman-McLeod acknowledges that it has presented some challenges, she believes her group is working to develop the best framework.</p>  <p>"We are in discussions with those groups of scientists and researchers, applied scientists, climatologists, heat-health scientists, social scientists," she told <em>Day 6.</em></p>  <p>"We will 100 per cent depend on science- and data-informed strategy to get to heat wave naming."</p>  <hr>  <p><em>Written by Jason Vermes&nbsp;with files from The Associated Press.

through the direct equivalent of a fine Convolutional network example in Keras.
</p>

<p>
Good News: <a href="https://github.com/uncomplicate/deep-diamond">Deep Diamond</a>() preview release is in Clojars, and is already quite useful! And fast!
It is yet to be fully polished, but you can try it now and, I hope, you'll like it.
</p>

<p>
It now covers the functionality that is being explained from scratch in the <a href="http://aiprobook.com/">books that I'm writing</a>.
Convolutions work, too; at the speed of Road Runner!
</p>

<p>
In accordance with my philosophy, "less talk, more walk", I introduce Deep Diamond
through the direct equivalent of this fine <a href="https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/mnist_cnn.py">MNIST CNN example in Keras</a>.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org54ea652">
<h2 id="org54ea652">Specify the network blueprint</h2>
<div id="text-org54ea652">
<p>
We specify the network by plain Clojure vectors and functions, and create the blueprint.
No need for special compilers and whatnot. The structure of internal parts would be
picked up automatically, or we can specify these explicitly.

<div id="outline-container-orgb8d8bce">
<h2 id="orgb8d8bce">Create the network</h2>
<div id="text-orgb8d8bce">
<p>
The blueprint is a Clojure function that can instantiate the network
object that holds the parameter tensors that the network should learn by using
one of the built-in optimization algorithms. In this case, I'll use adaptive moments,
<code>:adam</code>. Xavier initialization is, again, a plain function that initializes
the network with appropriate weights.

<div id="outline-container-orgae4dec0">
<h2 id="orgae4dec0">Train the network on MNIST data (CPU)</h2>
<div id="text-orgae4dec0">
<p>
The original MNIST data is distributed through four binary files that
you can download <a href="http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/">here</a>. To demonstrate how nice Clojure is, I'm not
using any special MNIST-specific code that is magically imported
from the framework's model Zoo. The complete code, from scratch, is at the
end of the article (I'm just pushing it there so it doesn't steal the spotlight :).
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>(</span>time <span>(</span>train net train-images y-train <span>:crossentropy</span> 12 <span>[]</span><span>)</span><span>)</span>
</pre>
</div>

<p>
The network learns in mini-batches of 128 images of the total of 60000,
with adaptive moments, through 12 full epochs. That makes 5625 forward/backward
update cycles.
</p>

<p>
The total time for that on my old 2013. i7-4790k CPU is: <b>368</b> seconds.
<b>6 minutes for 6000 cycles. A thousand cycles per minute.</b>
</p>

<p>
Isn't that a lot? You should try and run this in Keras with TensorFlow, and
see that we got a pretty nice performance! (I'll publish some comparisons soon,
and in the meantime you can try for yourself!).

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<div>

<p>Over the last few years we’ve been seeing an interesting case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Innovator%27s_Dilemma">The Innovator’s Dilemma</a> playing out. The case is ARM, and how it through smartphones have grown from energy efficient but comparably slow CPUs, into something which is turning to an overall better choice for general use CPUs.</p>
<p>Looking at how Apple is moving to ARM in its computers, not just the iPhone, and how Amazon are using ARM in their cloud servers, it is clear that we’re very close to having ARM replace Intel across the board. Intel, on its side, have not managed to keep up, which, when viewed from the top of the S-curve, fits perfectly with what we’d expect to happen.</p>
<p>So with that, ARM is not just an interesting technology, but also an interesting business. It’s not surprising to see current interest in buying ARM. If and when that will happen remains to be seen, but to expect a new owner of ARM in the next few months is pretty clear in my view.</p>
<p>Whoever ends up owning ARM, Intel is in trouble no matter. They do not have an architecture which is capable of much further growth. It’s stagnant. I’m sure AMD can easily enough turn around and start selling ARM based CPUs, as they see that market growing. But for Intel to jump on the ARM path, that’s hard to imagine. There’s too much history tied to the x86 architecture for them to make that jump. So I’m not hopeful for Intel, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they almost end up dead in a few years.</p>
<p>But only then will they also be able to move forward, and that’s where I see <a href="https://riscv.org/">RISC-V</a> becoming interesting.</p>
<p>If we have Nvidia owning ARM, I concur with many others that, they probably will eventually <a href="https://tech.newstatesman.com/business/hermann-hauser-nvidia-destroy-arm">introduce too much friction</a>. Companies like Apple, Amazon, Google, and maybe even Microsoft through Azure, <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-arm-holdings-m-a-nvidia-industry-anal/nvidias-arm-deal-sparks-quick-backlash-in-chip-industry-idUKKBN2650GT">not to forget non-U.S. companies</a>, will become unhappy with their working relationship with Nvidia. </p>
<p>And because we at that point just recently switched from x86 to ARM, a new switch to RISC-V doesn’t seem that farfetched. Also, because ARM and RISC-V are both a RISC designs, you can argue its an easier switch than from the CISC design of the x86.</p>
<p>It’s at this point, with a new switch to RISC-V in 10 years or so, that Intel can jump back on the path to growth. If they can see this happening, and plan ahead, they could revive themselves through RISC-V.</p>
<p>RISC-V will remain an open source project, which would be a requirement from the industry, given their, at that point, lessons learned from ARM as owned by Nvidia. But open source projects need business backing to grow, and Intel could be one of those, as a significant member of a greater RISC-V community.</p>
<p>Time will tell..</p>

September 14, 2020 | https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-rust-juniper/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.graphqleditor.com/graphql-rust-juniper/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GraphQL started being developed internally at Facebook back in 2012, before being publicly released as open-source in 2015. <strong>GraphQL is a query language for APIs</strong>, its main advantage is allowing clients to query exactly for the type of data that is required. The definitions of all the data clients can query through the service are stored in GraphQL schema. Each field in the schema is attached to a function, called a resolver, which gets called to produce the values when a query is executed.</p>
<p>GraphQL is language-agnostic which makes it fairly easy to be adopted across different technologies, one of its successful implementations is done in Rust, by a library called Juniper.</p>
<h2>Code- first, fast &amp; type-safe GraphQL Servers in Rust</h2>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper">Juniper</a></strong> is a code-first approach that allows you to write <strong>type-safe and super fast GraphQL servers in Rust</strong>, keeping declaring and resolving GraphQL schemas as easy as possible.</p>
<p>GraphQL query language is fully supported, including interfaces, unions, schema introspection, validations, as well as some basic Rust crates integrations allowing you to use popular Rust types as <code>uuid</code>, <code>url</code>, <code>chrono</code>, or <code>bson</code> out of the box. </p>
<p>As previously mentioned <strong>Juniper is a code-first library</strong>, if you prefer the schema-first approach you can use <a href="https://github.com/davidpdrsn/juniper-from-schema">juniper-from-schema</a> to <strong>auto-generate resolvers</strong> for your GraphQL schema.</p>
<p>Although Juniper does not provide a built-in web server functionality it comes with building blocks to make integration with your servers as seamless as possible, as well as optionally providing pre-built integration for popular Rust web frameworks like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Actix,</li>
<li>Hyper,</li>
<li>Iron,</li>
<li>Rocket, </li>
<li>Warp.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Example of Juniper integration for Actix</h2>
<p>Below you can find a sample Juniper integration with the <strong>Actix web framework</strong>. The servers run on <code>127.0.0.1:8080</code> and has built-in GraphiQL for easier testing. Star it with:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>cd examples/juniper

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><img alt="proof of work and shake" src="https://getblock.io/public/article_images/article_image_10.svg"><img src="https://getblock.io/public/article_images/article_image_10_xs.svg"></p><p>While Ethereum currently becomes a hot topic due to its future upgrade to the PoS algorithm, it’s probably time to remember why PoS is considered a better algorithm than PoW. To summarize everything in advance: it’s even more secure and less demanding in terms of resources, it doesn’t require expensive equipment to produce new blocks thus allowing to process many times more transactions per second. Let’s see why it works this way.</p></div>
<h3 id="proof-of-work">Proof-of-Work</h3>
<div><p>PoW was the original scheme for Bitcoin and was the only viable way to maintain security back then. The whole network works on the mathematical task of finding the hash number that starts with 0000 and the node that finds it generates the next block with all the current transactions in the queue, sends it to the whole network and receives a reward. The more computational power a node has, the more chance it has to find this solution. PoW blockchains can’t scale well because of this, because otherwise malicious miners will try to attack the network trying to double spend their coins, canceling their own previous transactions. All PoW protocols are very hardware-dependent and consume a lot of electricity. Also, they are very slow, and the new Proof-of-Stake algorithm is designed to solve this.</p></div>
<h3 id="proof-of-stake">Proof-of-Stake</h3>
<div><p>PoS algorithm is totally different from PoW in terms of security approach. It doesn’t require any computational power to generate blocks, it needs the internal resources of the network itself, its tokens, to be staken to generate blocks. The node that has the largest amount of tokens has the highest chance of finding the block. On the other hand, the punishment for malicious actions in PoS blockchains are harder – if someone attempts to perform an attack, their tokens get destroyed. Given that tokens have a certain market value, it can cost a lot. All blockchain systems have such design to make attacking pointless. But while PoW algorithms simply try to prevent it by making it too expensive to buy all hardware for an attack, and if it fails, attackers still have their hardware and can make another attempt, PoS algorithms make it impossible to repeat.</p><p>Since it doesn’t involve complex calculations, PoS blockchains can have much higher throughput than PoW systems, thousands of transactions per second. Also, there are many additional technologies developed right now – such as sharding and layer two solutions. Sharding allows to divide the whole network into many smaller pools (shards), each one of them processing its own blocks and verifying its own set of transactions, all of them synchronized by the main beacon chain. Layer two solutions serve the purpose of moving some load from the main chain to additional chains and using it only to finalize a certain chain state from time to time.</p></div>
<h3 id="what-is-better-in-the-end">What is better in the end</h3>
<p>Anyway, even while the PoS algorithm is superior with all its features, PoW is a lot more stable and tested. A lot of PoW blockchains are up and running for a long time, including Bitcoin. All PoS blockchains are yet a great idea that has to prove its viability. But anyway, all of them will find their own segment on the market and their application. If you’re interested in any of these applications, and you want to run a node of any PoW or PoS blockchains, you can use a SaaS solution such as <a href="https://getblock.io/">GetBlock.io</a>.</p>

  <article>
    <p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/mexican_calendar_systems.jpg" alt="Confusing Mexican Calendar, at least for those not in the know" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>Freetype, included in the <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/06/04/fonts-on-unix.html">font stack on
Unix</a>, is quite
complex. There are so many layers to get it to do what it does that
it’s easy to get lost. From finding the font, to actually rendering it,
and everything in between.<br>
Like most of the world, I use a rather low screens definition
(1366x768 with 96 dpi) and rather old-ish laptop, unlike some <a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/monitors/">font
designers that live in a filter bubble where everyone has the latest
macbook</a>. Thus, good and legible font
rendering is important.<br>
Let’s play with lesser known toggles available to us when it comes to font
rendering and see what they do, let’s have fun and explore possibilities.</p>

<h2 id="a-general-picture">A General Picture</h2>

<p>Generally, to make a font look better on screens, which are arrays of
pixels, we use a combination of these three:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Antialiasing</strong>: Applying a light shade around the glyph. It is useful
at small scale, when you don’t have enough pixels, but it makes most
glyphs look bolder.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/font_antialias.jpg" alt="Font anti-alias example" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Subpixel rendering</strong>: A technique similar to antialias but using
subpixels, the color components inside the pixels. By applying a
small amount of colors on the sides you can reach more granular
precision. However, if applied clumsily, or if you simply move the
window containing the text, these colored subpixels will become
apparent, what we call fringe.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/font_subpixel_rendering.jpg" alt="Font sub-pixel rendering example" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Hinting</strong>: Pixels are blocks but text is made of curves, that means
these curves will never match exactly with screen pixels. Hinting
is about repositioning or selecting the closest pixels while trying
as much as possible to keep the shape of the glyph intact. There are
multiple levels of hinting, hinting information provided by the font
itself (bytecode interpreter hinting), and hinting provided by the
rendering library (auto-hinting).</li>
</ul>

<p><em>NB</em>: “It’s just text”… This article is yet another that
shows how fonts aren’t as easy as they look.  For more info
about the font stack, please visit <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/06/04/fonts-on-unix.html">my previous article on the
topic</a>, and if you
want an idea of what it means to draw them on the screen take a look a
<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2018/09/02/fonts-xcb.html">this article</a>.</p>

<p>What is applied, when, how to control all of this, can we see what they
do, and should we even care?</p>

<p>Freetype and fontconfig default rendering these days is pretty good,
so there shouldn’t be anything to worry about; Until there’s something
to worry about, like a font not looking the way you want.<br>
Our first stop will be something that intrigued me because I haven’t
heard many talk about it: the Freetype driver’s properties.<br>
The Freetype driver is used whenever hinting is needed, so this is the
part it actually changes — how hinting is applied.</p>



<p>Let’s start with arming ourselves with ways to easily test all this.<br>
Freetype2 demos utilities are a must, you can clone them
<a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2020/09/14/git.sv.nongnu.org/freetype/freetype2-demos.git">here</a>
or fetch them from your package repositiory, for example
<a href="https://packages.debian.org/jessie/freetype2-demos">Debian</a> and <a href="https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/freetype2-demos/">Arch
Linux</a>.<br>
These will give you a bunch of useful tools such as <code>ftdiff</code>, <code>ftview</code>,
<code>ftstring</code> <code>ftgrid</code>, <code>fttimer</code>, <code>ftbench</code>, and others. The most important
ones for us are <code>ftdiff</code> and <code>ftgrid</code>.</p>

<p>Example usage:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell">ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf
ftgrid <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-f</span> 20 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf
ftstring <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-m</span> <span>'Hello World!'</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p>Additionally, you can install <code>pango-view</code> from <code>pango-tools</code>
to later test if fontconfig applies your configurations
properly. It can be used by preparing a file written in <a href="https://developer.gnome.org/pygtk/stable/pango-markup-language.html">pango
markup</a>
and displaying it using <code>pango-view --markup file.pangpang</code>.<br>
You can set the fontconfig debug level higher to see which font is
actually loaded by setting the <code>FC_DEBUG</code> to something like 4096,
<code>FC_DEBUG=4096</code>.</p>

<p>More values can be found here, we’ll use them later to see if our
fontconfig settings are applied properly:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="man">Name         Value    Meaning
---------------------------------------------------------
MATCH            1    Brief information about font matching
MATCHV           2    Extensive font matching information
EDIT             4    Monitor match/test/edit execution
FONTSET          8    Track loading of font information at startup
CACHE           16    Watch cache files being written
CACHEV          32    Extensive cache file writing information
PARSE           64    (no longer in use)
SCAN           128    Watch font files being scanned to build caches
SCANV          256    Verbose font file scanning information
MEMORY         512    Monitor fontconfig memory usage

LANGSET       2048    Dump char sets used to construct lang values
MATCH2        4096    Display font-matching transformation in patterns</code></pre></figure>

<p>Yet another way is to test directly in your browser URL bar:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="xml">data:text/html,<span>&lt;meta</span> <span>charset=</span><span>"utf8"</span><span>&gt;&lt;p</span> <span>style=</span><span>"font-family: Times New Roman;"</span><span>&gt;</span>Hello World<span>&lt;/p&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<h2 id="the-freetype2-drivers-properties">The Freetype2 Drivers Properties</h2>

<p>So let’s get back to our testing of Freetype2 drivers.<br>
On <a href="https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-properties.html">this documentation
page</a>,
ft (freetype) properties are listed and are said to affect the behavior
of the drivers, each touching a different one. They are set by modifying
the <code>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</code> environment variable, normally loaded from
<code>/etc/profile.d/freetype2.sh</code>.<br>
However, most of the ones listed are targeted at the CFF, Type 1,
and CID fonts driver and not at TrueType fonts, so they do nothing
if you don’t have these font types. The only toggle <a href="https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/reference/ft2-tt_driver.html">available for
TrueType</a>
is the <code>interpreter-version</code> which controls the bytecode interpreter,
the rasterizer, and thus how the outline gets hinted.</p>

<p>The options available to us are the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>35 — For classic mode GDI (Win 98/2000)</li>
  <li>38 — GDI+ old (Vista, Win 7), Infinality, considered slow</li>
  <li>40 — For minimal mode (stripped down Infinality, this is the default)
(After Win 7)</li>
</ul>

<p>Kind of weird that we jump from 35 to 38, where did 36 and the rest go? The
answer is that it’s a choice from the Freetype devs to only include those
and not the ones in between.</p>

<p>And the differences look as follows, notice the native hinter in the
left column:</p>

<ul>
  <li>v35</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=35"</span> ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/ftgrid_v35.png" alt="ftgrid interpreter v35" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li>v38</li>
</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=38"</span> ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/ftgrid_v38.png" alt="ftgrid interpreter v38" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>

</ul>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=40"</span> ftdiff <span>-r</span> 96 <span>-s</span> 10 ~/.local/share/fonts/times.ttf</code></pre></figure>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/ftgrid_v40.png" alt="ftgrid interpreter v40" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>We can also test using <code>pango-view</code> (remember again that this should be a font
that has native hinting enabled but not the auto-hinter):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="xml"><span>&lt;span</span> <span>font_family=</span><span>"Times New Roman"</span> <span>font=</span><span>"10"</span> <span>foreground=</span><span>"black"</span> <span>alpha=</span><span>"83%"</span><span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;/span&gt;</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>You can also change the font via the <code>--font=</code> argument of <code>pango-view</code>.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>FREETYPE_PROPERTIES</span><span>=</span><span>"truetype:interpreter-version=35"</span> pango-view <span>--markup</span> text.bangarang</code></pre></figure>

<ul>
  <li>v35</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/pango-view_v35.png" alt="pango interpreter v35" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li>v38</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/pango-view_v38.png" alt="pango interpreter v38" loading="lazy"></p>

<ul>
  <li>v40</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/assets/fun_with_fonts/pango-view_v40.png" alt="pango interpreter v40" loading="lazy"></p>

<p>So definitely, older interpreter versions were rougher with hinting, much
bolder, and could deform the glyphs. The newer ones are more minimal with
it. We also notice that the auto-hinter isn’t that bad and that avoiding
hinting can help. I took the specific case of the Windows font ‘Times New
Roman’ because it has the reputation of rendering badly with Freetype,
mostly because of the job the interpreter does. Applying very light or no
hinting at all helps tremendously, even at very small point size as you
can see in the next comparison. The hinting does indeed help legibility
at this scale but the font shape and personality is completely destroyed.</p>

<p>From left to right: v35, v38, v40.</p>

<h2 id="how-fontconfig-works">How Fontconfig Works</h2>

<p>We’re not done with hinting yet, there can be many levels of hinting
that can be applied, but let’s first take a detour and learn a bit about
fontconfig and how to use it.</p>

<p>Fontconfig is the layer in the font stack responsible for loading the
font along with the configurations that tell the next layer how to find
the font file and what changes to apply when rendering it. It is usually
composed of a library, a preset of configuration files, and a bunch
of helpful tools all starting with the prefix <code>fc-</code> such as: <code>fc-cache</code>,
<code>fc-query</code>, <code>fc-match</code>, and <code>fc-conflist</code>, to name a few.</p>

<p>The configuration files are usually found in <code>/etc/fonts/</code> and split into
the presets available <code>/etc/fonts/conf.avail</code>, and the chosen presets in
<code>/etc/fonts/conf.d</code>, which are symbolic links to the former.<br>
The precedence of the rules is alphanumerical, a first-come
first-served principle, thus <code>01-custom-rule.conf</code> will be loaded
before <code>99-not-important-rule.conf</code>. Local user configurations, in
the user’s <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig</code> directory, are loaded from
one of these configurations that contains an include statement. On
my machine it is the <code>50-user.conf</code>, so it’s precedence is lower
than anything loaded before it. This isn’t practical when testing
rules so rename this file to something like <code>01-user.conf</code>. Now
anything you put in <code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/conf.d</code> or
<code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/fontconfig/fonts.conf</code> should have priority.<br>
You can make sure the order and configurations are loaded properly by
using the <code>fc-conflist</code> command. It lists in order of precedence the
configurations found, the ones starting with a <code>+</code> are loaded, the ones
with <code>-</code> are not.</p>

<p>These files are composed of mainly 4 components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Match rules: If something matches, then edit the properties
mentioned. There are ton of matching and editing rules, even including
stuff like the program name that is currently trying to load …</li></ul></article></div></div>

The government worries about user data being funnelled to Chinese authorities. TikTok denies it is a national-security risk and is suing to stop the administration from the threatened ban.</p>  <p>TikTok declined to comment Sunday. Oracle didn't return a request for comment but has previously declined comment.</p>  <p>Microsoft said in a Sunday statement that TikTok's parent company, Bytedance, "let us know today they would not be selling TikTok's US operations to Microsoft."</p>    <p>Walmart had planned to partner with Microsoft on the deal. It's not clear if Walmart was still interested before Microsoft was notified of the rejection Sunday.</p>  <p>Microsoft said Sunday it was "confident our proposal would have been good for TikTok's users, while protecting national security interests." The company said it "would have made significant changes to ensure the service met the highest standards for security, privacy, online safety, and combating disinformation."</p>  <h2>Concerns over&nbsp;ByteDance</h2>  <p>TikTok, which says it has 100 million U.S. users and about 700 million globally, is known for its fun, goofy videos of dancing, lip-syncing, pranks and jokes. It's recently become home to more political content such as the comedian Sarah Cooper, who drew a large audience by lip-syncing Trump's own often-disjointed statements from public appearances.</p>  <p>But the app has also raised concerns because of its Chinese owner, ByteDance. The White House has cracked down on a range of Chinese businesses, including telecom equipment makers Huawei and ZTE and messaging app WeChat, over worries that they would enable Chinese authorities to get U.S. user data. Republican and Democratic lawmakers have also raised concerns about censorship and children's privacy.</p>  <p>TikTok denies that it has shared user data with the Chinese government or that it would do so if asked. The company says it has not censored videos at the request of Chinese authorities and insists it is not a national-security threat.</p>  <p><em><strong>WATCH |&nbsp;China slams U.S. over TikTok sale remarks:</strong></em></p>  <p><span><span><span></span><span>A Chinese state media outlet is calling the U.S. 'a rogue country.'&nbsp;The rebuke follows comments by President Donald Trump about Microsoft's interest in buying the popular Chinese video-sharing app.<!-- --> <!-- -->5:00</span></span></span></p>  <p><a href="http://cbc.ca/1.5697649">TikTok has sued to stop the ban</a>, but not the sale order. The sale situation has been complicated by several factors, including Trump's repeated demands that the U.S. government should get a "cut" of any deal, a stipulation and role for the president that experts say is unprecedented.</p>  <p>In addition, the Chinese government in late August involved itself in the process by unveiling new regulations that restrict exports of technology that appear to include the system TikTok uses to choose which videos to spool up to its users. That means ByteDance would have to obtain a licence from China to export any restricted technologies to a foreign company.</p>  <p>The deal had come together rapidly after the administration ramped up its threats against TikTok this summer, despite TikTok's efforts to put distance between its app and its Chinese ownership. It installed former top Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its American CEO, but he resigned in August after just a few months on the job, saying the "political environment has sharply changed."</p>  <h2>Oracle bid 'doesn't make any sense'</h2>  <p>Both Microsoft and Oracle are known more for their business software offerings than for those intended for consumers.</p>  <p>Oracle primarily makes database software. It competes with tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon that provide cloud services as well as business-software specialists like Salesforce.</p>  <p>Some analysts see Oracle's interest in a consumer business as misguided. Oracle should focus on enterprise-market acquisitions and not invest in a consumer app like TikTok that doesn't fit with the rest of its business, said Jefferies analyst Brent Thill, who compares the idea to Delta Airlines buying a motorcycle company. "It doesn't make any sense," he said.</p>  <p><span><figure><div><p><img alt="" srcset="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5722719.1600044519!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_300/china-bytedance-tiktok-oracle.JPG 300w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5722719.1600044519!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_460/china-bytedance-tiktok-oracle.JPG 460w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5722719.1600044519!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_620/china-bytedance-tiktok-oracle.JPG 620w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5722719.1600044519!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/china-bytedance-tiktok-oracle.JPG 780w,https://i.cbc.ca/1.5722719.1600044519!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_1180/china-bytedance-tiktok-oracle.JPG 1180w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 300px,(max-width: 460px) 460px,(max-width: 620px) 620px,(max-width: 780px) 780px,(max-width: 1180px) 1180px" src="https://i.cbc.ca/1.5722719.1600044519!/fileImage/httpImage/image.JPG_gen/derivatives/original_780/china-bytedance-tiktok-oracle.JPG"></p></div><figcaption>Some analysts see Oracle's interest in a consumer business as misguided.<!-- --> <!-- -->(Tom Brenner/Reuters)</figcaption></figure></span></p>  <p>Thill suggested that TikTok competitors like Facebook and Snapchat should be "cheering on Oracle" as a buyer, because Oracle wouldn't "add a lot of value to the app."</p>  <p>Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison is unusual among tech executives for his public support of President Donald Trump, hosting a fundraiser for him in February at his Rancho Mirage, California, estate. The company also hired a former top aide to Vice-President Mike Pence; its CEO, Safra Catz, also served on Trump's transition team.</p>  <p>The president said on Aug. 18 that Oracle was "a great company" that "could handle" buying TikTok. He declined to state his preference between Oracle and Microsoft as buyers.</p></span></p></div></div>]]>

<p data-line="2">A few weeks ago, the Australian Consumer and Competition Commission (ACCC) published draft legislation for a&nbsp;<a title="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/digital-platforms/news-media-bargaining-code" href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/digital-platforms/news-media-bargaining-code" data-href="https://www.accc.gov.au/focus-areas/digital-platforms/news-media-bargaining-code">mandatory news media bargaining code</a>&nbsp;and there has been quite a kerfuffle since.</p>
<p data-line="5">The actual details are nuanced, complex, and boring, so rather than talk about them, nearly everyone is fixated on proxy issues that, while related, mostly miss the point. But, it means people can spend their time grinding their favourite axes instead, and that’s both easier and more fun.</p>
<p data-line="10">Most commentary is like this, so it’s not a surprise.</p>
<p data-line="12">I’ve rewritten this article a bunch of times, and decided not to bother posting it at least three times, but some people wanted to read a longer form version of my short rants about the situation, so I figured I might at well post it. If nothing else it means I’ll have receipts I can point to if it turns out I’m right.</p>
<p data-line="18">This is a long read. It’s over 5500 words, so grab a coffee and strap yourself in as we explore the seedy sub-strata of this sordid saga.</p>
<h2 id="some-background-reading" data-line="21">Some Background Reading</h2>
<p data-line="23">The journalists talking about this issue in Australia are, largely, about as well informed about it as they are any other complex issue, which is to say not at all. This is also not a surprise, but the Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect is alive and well.</p>
<p data-line="28">There are some journalists who cover this beat that know it better than others, but even they can’t track the details of what’s going on across the wide array of media, technology, politics, and business that are all wrapped up in this issue. An integrated view requires too much specialist knowledge, coupled with the ability to step back and view it as a whole, as well as the time to actually do that. There just aren’t that many people who are both good at this and also willing to accept journalist-level wages to write about it.</p>
<p data-line="36">That’s why most of the coverage is he-said, she-said,&nbsp;<a title="http://archive.pressthink.org/2003/09/18/jennings.html" href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2003/09/18/jennings.html" data-href="http://archive.pressthink.org/2003/09/18/jennings.html">view-from-nowhere</a>&nbsp;pieces, or&nbsp;<a title="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-30/rosen---why-political-coverage-is-broken/2862328" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-30/rosen---why-political-coverage-is-broken/2862328" data-href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-08-30/rosen---why-political-coverage-is-broken/2862328">“who’s winning” horse race nonsense</a>. They’re easy to write and easier still to churn out day after relentless day. I’ve not seen much that looks into the detail while keeping the context in mind and employing some good-old joined-up thinking.</p>
<p data-line="42">If you want to understand this issue, or any complex issue for that matter, you’ll need to take in a range of information from multiple sources, viewed critically to adjust for the writer’s and outlet’s biases, and you’ll gradually build up a multi-faceted view of the whole complex thing. This is made extra hard in today’s media landscape because so very much of it is working to actively mislead you.</p>
<p data-line="49">We have left the information age and entered the propaganda age.</p>
<p data-line="51">Here are some things I’ve read on the issue that I think are worth your time and will help you to understand what I say here:</p>

<p data-line="66">Some of what I think about this is probably wrong, too, and I can’t shake the feeling that I’m missing some important details that I should have noticed.</p>

<p data-line="71">The mediocre middle managers who run (and I use the term loosely) Australia’s incumbent media organisations have been doing what Australian managers usually do when they’re not busily awarding themselves inflated remuneration packages: lobbying the government for subsidies instead of figuring out how to run a profitable business.</p>
<p data-line="77">This has been the case since at least the 1960s when&nbsp;<em>The Lucky Country</em>&nbsp;stated</p>
<blockquote data-line="79">
<p data-line="79"><em>Australia is a lucky country run mainly by second rate people who share its luck. It lives on other people’s ideas, and, although its ordinary people are adaptable, most of its leaders (in all fields) so lack curiosity about the events that surround them that they are often taken by surprise.</em></p>

<p data-line="89">These businesses are welded to the idea that the only way they can make money is by selling advertising. It’s a bit of an odd business decision when you look at the landscape they’ve been operating in for the past, oh, 25 years or so.</p>
<p data-line="93">Globally, the&nbsp;<em>traditional</em>&nbsp;news business has been in decline ever since the Internet decoupled classified ads from news and lowered the barrier to entry for competitors. Newspapers were extremely slow to put their content online, even as blogging exploded as a thing. I remember because I was there, watching it happen and boggling at the incredibly poor strategic thinking in real time.</p>

<p data-line="101">Google AdWords and blogs completely upended the market for all kinds of written media. People seem to have forgotten just how massive the change was from what came before it. Given AdWords was introduced in 2000, a lot of people don’t have direct experience of what it was like, so that partly explains the lack of knowledge.</p>
<p data-line="106">Essentially, a huge number of people realized they could make money via advertising if they built an audience, and thanks to the Internet that became really easy to do. You didn’t need to&nbsp;<a title="https://www.smh.com.au/business/landmark-printing-press-site-to-be-sold-20120618-20k8g.html" href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/landmark-printing-press-site-to-be-sold-20120618-20k8g.html" data-href="https://www.smh.com.au/business/landmark-printing-press-site-to-be-sold-20120618-20k8g.html">build a huge printing plant</a>&nbsp;to print anything, and you didn’t need a complex system of distribution to get your writing in front of your readers, you just put it online.</p>
<p data-line="112">So that’s what people did, and a lot of them made quite a nice living out of it. An entirely new ecosystem sprang up around it. Suddenly, traditional (very profitable, and socially powerful) news media businesses had a huge amount of competition that didn’t exist before. And this is before you factor in the sheer volume of&nbsp;<em>other</em>&nbsp;Internet things that sprang up; Games, commercial websites, eCommerce; A huge number of things other than news that people might be paying attention to, and places an advertiser might want to put an ad or three.</p>
<p data-line="120">Now, while younger folks don’t remember any of this, mostly because they hadn’t been born yet, the ancient white men who run the traditional news media businesses very much&nbsp;<em>do</em>&nbsp;remember, so keep that in mind for later on.</p>
<p data-line="124">For a long time, the online advertising product was also vastly better than the offline version it replaced, both for buyers of ads, and consumers of ads. Commercial Search used to be called the Yellow Pages (remember them?) which was a physical book you paid to be in and was only updated once a year and you had to manually thumb through it to find anything. Now you just search and click and it’s much easier (though far from perfect, which we’ll get to later). You can buy ads for your tiny e-commerce business without once interacting with a high-pressure salesperson trying to pressure you into a bigger ad buy, and it’s cheaper to boot.</p>
<p data-line="134">With all these new places to show people ads, that’s where the ad spend went. There’s still value in advertising in newspapers, just as there is in advertising on radio and TV, but people spend a&nbsp;<em>lot</em>more time on the Internet (and Facebook and YouTube) now than they do reading newspapers. But that’s simply because people have&nbsp;<em>always</em>&nbsp;spent more time doing things other than reading newspapers.</p>
<p data-line="140">You also have to remember that marketing people, by and large, aren’t very bright. They’ve been frothing about the&nbsp;<a title="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2017/03/predicted-death-broadcast-tv-then-have-i-got-news-you" href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2017/03/predicted-death-broadcast-tv-then-have-i-got-news-you" data-href="https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/tv-radio/2017/03/predicted-death-broadcast-tv-then-have-i-got-news-you">death of television</a>&nbsp;for many years. Radio still exists. Books still exist. It’s just that there are&nbsp;<em>also</em>&nbsp;new things for people to do that didn’t exist before. Computer games is a massive industry now,&nbsp;<a title="https://www.statista.com/statistics/292460/video-game-consumer-market-value-worldwide-platform/" href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/292460/video-game-consumer-market-value-worldwide-platform/" data-href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/292460/video-game-consumer-market-value-worldwide-platform/">worth over USD 30 billion a year</a>. Advertisers try to put ads where they think people will see them, so why would they continue to buy ads they think most people simply won’t see? All the time, apparently, because there are&nbsp;<a title="https://www.emarketer.com/content/digital-ad-fraud-2020" href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/digital-ad-fraud-2020" data-href="https://www.emarketer.com/content/digital-ad-fraud-2020">breathtaking levels of fraud in the digital ad market</a>&nbsp;but, despite this fraud, online advertising&nbsp;<em>does</em>&nbsp;work, just not quite in the way stupid marketers believe it does. Stupid marketers still spend a lot of money on ads, because advertising works on them too.</p>
<p data-line="144">The competitive response from the news media came late and&nbsp;<a title="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-03/where-did-fairfax-go-wrong/8494042" href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-03/where-did-fairfax-go-wrong/8494042" data-href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-05-03/where-did-fairfax-go-wrong/8494042">wasn’t informed by any real strategy</a>. It was purely reactionary, and when you do this you’re letting your strategy get defined by the people you’re competing with. There was no real situational awareness, little understanding of the shifting climatic patterns affecting the landscape, and thus no ability to see the forest for the trees.</p>
<p data-line="149">That this approach would be an utter failure was obvious very early on, but the&nbsp;<a title="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-dec-02-la-fi-news-google2-2009dec02-story.html" href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-dec-02-la-fi-news-google2-2009dec02-story.html" data-href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-dec-02-la-fi-news-google2-2009dec02-story.html">arrogant old people running things didn’t want to hear it</a>&nbsp;and now we’ve got two decades of proof of how wrong they were. This has only deepened their resentment.</p>
<p data-line="153">At any point they could have changed to a different business model that didn’t rely on an ever-dwindling source of advertising revenue to pay for news.</p>
<p data-line="156">But they didn’t.</p>

</header><p>
I was mystified when I first came across the <a href="http://www.ioccc.org/2018/bellard/hint.html">“Most Inflationary”</a> winning
<a href="http://www.ioccc.org/2018/bellard/">entry</a> in the 2018 <a href="https://www.ioccc.org/">IOCCC</a>.  Written by the <a href="https://bellard.org/">incredibly prolific</a> Fabrice
Bellard, this tiny program with just 4KB of source code emitted a
128×128 resolution version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenna#Criticism">(in)famous</a> Lena test image.  Voodoo!
The IOCCC judges wrote “We could understand some of the arithmetic but none
of the magic.”  I was determined to figure out the magic and inspired by
<a href="https://fabiensanglard.net/">Fabien Sanglard</a> to try to write up how it works.
</p>

<p>
Using the program is straightforward enough, and both the source and the
details of running it can be found on its IOCCC page.  I used GCC to
compile it and piped the output directly to ImageMagick to view it:
</p>

<div>
<pre>gcc -O3 -o prog prog.c
./prog | display -                        # Show embedded image
./prog d &lt; vintage_cars.bin | display -   # Show an external image
</pre>
</div>

<p>
Running it with no arguments like the first case will decompress the
embedded data and produce the following image (zoomed for detail):
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/image.png" alt="image.png">

</figure>

<p>
Admittedly, this has a fair number of compression artifacts, but it’s still
pretty darned impressive for 2439 bytes of image data and 1544 bytes of
source code for the decompressor.
</p>

<p>
So let’s see how it works.  This will be a deep dive and by far my longest
post yet (I’ve erred on the side of too much detail), so make
yourself comfortable!  From here on in, I’m going to show the pieces of the
original program juxtaposed with the corresponding pieces from my
deobfuscated version.  When I mention line numbers, I’ll be referring to
the later unless noted otherwise.  I’ll typically use italicized numbers in
parenthesis to denote these.
</p>

<p>
For my version I have expanded the lone macro (used to compact <code>for</code>
loops), reformated the source, and renamed the variables.  The only
structural changes that I have made are from updating to modern style
function headers and pushing declarations down to be as local in scope as
possible (C99 style).  In one case, I gave a variable different names when
pushing it down into two blocks where it had been reused in different ways.

We’ll start at the end of the program with the <code>main()</code> function and then
work our way backwards to the beginning; we’ll essentially go from top to
bottom in terms of control flow.  Here’s the <code>main()</code> function:

</pre>
</div>

<p>
The image is basically encoded in two distinct layers.  The lower level
uses a lossless <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_encoding">entropy encoding</a> scheme that stores only single bits and
unsigned integers.  We’ll see this in detail later.  For now, it’s enough
to know that the first line (<i>230</i>) checks for an argument to determine
whether to expect the image on standard input or to decompress the image
from an internal string.  The data is stored slightly differently in the
two modes and the related value here doubles as a flag.  The second line
(<i>231</i>) then primes the pump for the decoding this bitstream.  (However,
this turns out to be superfluous as it would have been called later
anyway.)
</p>

<p>
At the higher level, the first thing to be decoded (<i>232–236</i>) is a small
header comprised of four integers.  The first of these stores the image
width as a power of two.  Due to a fixed-size array used to store the
decompressed image, the width is limited to 1024.  The second integer
stores how many lines shorter the image height is compared to the width.
This will be zero for square images but means that only square or landscape
oriented images are possible.  The next two lines decode a pair of
parameters related to the image quality.  Higher numbers here give greater
compression at the expense of image quality.  The lowest legal values for
each are 1 and should produce near lossless results.  For the built-in Lena
image, the four values in this header are 7, 0, 41, and 82, respectively.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-org4f12528">
<h2 id="org4f12528">PPM Output</h2>
<div id="text-org4f12528">
<p>
The decoded image is written to standard output in the form of a PPM file.
This is a <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/doc/ppm.html">wonderfully simple format</a> for writing that consist of a small
header indicating the image type, resolution, and maximum color value.  A
single <code>printf()</code> suffices for this (<i>238</i>).  Following this, the image
data itself is simply a series of unsigned bytes in interleaved RGB order
for each pixel and the pixels in left-to-right, top-to-bottom order
(<i>245–247</i>).  Because of the lossy format, the decompressed RGB values may
fall outside the 0 to 255 range, so a small helper function is used to
clamp and then write them:
</p>

<div>
<pre><span>109: </span><span>K</span>(b){
<span>110: </span>putchar(b&lt;0?0:b&gt;255?255:b);
<span>111: </span>}
</pre>

<div>
<pre><span>223: </span><span>int</span> <span>write_byte_clamped</span>( <span>int</span> <span>byte</span> )
<span>224: </span>{
<span>225: </span>    putchar( byte &lt; 0 ? 0 : byte &gt; 255 ? 255 : byte );
<span>226: </span>}
</pre>

<div id="outline-container-orgf3b7761">
<h2 id="orgf3b7761">YCgCo Color Space</h2>
<div id="text-orgf3b7761">
<p>
The compressed image data is not actually encoded using the usual RGB color
space, though of course it outputs this at the end.  Instead, it uses the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCgCo">YCgCo</a> color space.  This is easily transformed back to RGB (<i>244–247</i>) but
has some nice properties where image compression is concerned.  Notably,
it decorrelates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luma_(video)">luma</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrominance">chroma</a> data.
</p>

<p>
To see this, lets look at the just the Y (luma) color channel of the
built-in image.  We can do this by zeroing out the Cg (green–magenta) and
Co (orange–blue) chroma channels before transforming back to RGB:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/y.png" alt="y.png">

</figure>

<p>
Note how the result is simply the image in greyscale.
</p>

<p>
We can also look at the Cg channel in isolation by setting the Y values in
all pixels to 128 and the Co values in all pixels to zero.  This will show
us how the Cg data looks added to a neutral grey image:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/cg.png" alt="cg.png">

</figure>

<p>
And we can do likewise to view the Co channel in isolation by setting the Y
values to 128 and the Cg values to zero:
</p>


<figure>
<img src="http://eastfarthing.com/blog/2020-09-14-decoder/co.png" alt="co.png">

</figure>

<p>
Hopefully it is clear now why this transform is useful: the majority of the
actual image detail is contained in the Y channel with only a little bit in
the Cg and Co channels.  Moreover, the human eye is more sensitive to
luminance than chrominance so by separating these out the encoder can
compress them with different degrees of lossiness.  This is why there are
not one but two image quality factors (<i>235–236</i>).
</p>

<p>
Many lossy image and video codecs, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG#Downsampling">JPEG</a>, offer an option called
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling">chroma subsampling</a>.  When used, the luminance channel is typically stored
at full resolution while the chrominance channels are downscaled and stored
as a lower resolution image by the encoder, then upscaled by the decoder.
The tiny image decoder doesn’t bother with this.  Instead, the encoded
images just crank up the lossiness factor for the chrominance channels
(which JPEG images usually do too).
</p>

<p>
It’s also worth noting (<i>241–243</i>) that the decoder decompresses
the Y, Cg, and Co channels to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_(computer_graphics)">planar format</a> in memory before writing the
transformed RGB values in the PPM-required <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Packed_pixel">interleaved</a> form.

<h2 id="orgdf2665b">Quadtree Traversal</h2>
<div id="text-orgdf2665b">
<p>
The actual extraction of the image to these planes in memory occurs
completely within the function called at line 237.  This is the main
routine for the higher level decoding of the image and is by far the
largest function in the program:

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/2cc5b5dcbba58e6a8ab6be0fc5ba3f4135fc9844/bc970/assets/img/2020/fruta-swiftui/fruta-crash.png"></p><p>Apple released SwiftUI last year, and it’s been an exciting and wild ride. With iOS 14, a lot of the rough edges have been smoothed out — is SwiftUI finally ready for production?</p><h2 id="fruta-sample-app">Fruta Sample App</h2><p>Let’s look at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/app_clips/fruta_building_a_feature-rich_app_with_swiftui">Apple’s Fruta example</a>, a cross-platform feature-rich app that’s built completely in SwiftUI. It’s great that Apple is finally releasing a more complex application for this year’s cycle.</p><p>I took a look when Big Sur beta 1 came out, and it was pretty unpolished:</p><div><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Been clicking around for a minute with Apple's new Fruta SwiftUI sample. </p><p>Things jump around wildly, fav' doesn't work, and it crashes once you open a second window. I understand it's b1, but looking at how SwiftUI went last year I doubt this will all be fixed. <a href="https://t.co/zGRRYswRde">pic.twitter.com/zGRRYswRde</a></p></div>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1277623561604214784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 29, 2020</a></blockquote></div><p>Since then, there have been many betas, and we’re nearing the end of the cycle, with the GM expected in October. So it’s time to look at Fruta again. And indeed, the SwiftUI team did a great job fixing the various issues: The toolbar is pretty reliable, the sidebar no longer jumps out, multiple windows works… however, <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305054121523916806?s=21">views are still sometimes misaligned</a>, and it’s still fairly easy to make it crash on both <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305051342596177921?s=21">macOS (FB8682269)</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305052083989684224?s=21">iOS 14b8 (FB8682290)</a>.</p><h2 id="swiftui-attributegraph-crashes">SwiftUI AttributeGraph Crashes</h2><p>Most SwiftUI crashes are a result of either a diffing issue in AttributeGraph, or a bug with one of the bindings to the platform controls (AppKit or UIKit). Whenever you see <code>AG::Graph</code> in the stack trace, that’s SwiftUI’s AttributeGraph (written in C++), which takes over representing the view hierarchy and diffing. Crashes there are usually in this form:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre> Fruta[3607:1466511] [error] precondition failure: invalid size for indirect attribute: 25 vs 24
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Googling for this error reveals that there are <a href="https://github.com/fermoya/SwiftUIPager/issues/60">a</a> <a href="https://developer.apple.com/forums/thread/129171">lot</a> <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58304009/how-to-debug-precondition-failure-in-xcode">of</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwiftUI/comments/fosrbf/precondition_failure_invalid_input_index/">similar</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1258762457805455361">problems</a>. People sometimes do find workarounds via wrapping views into other views or changing the hierarchy. But mostly, we’re powerless, and this is something Apple needs to fix in its framework. Since SwiftUI ships as part of the OS, end users need to update their devices to get these fixes.</p><h2 id="platform-binding-crashes">Platform-Binding Crashes</h2><p>SwiftUI uses many components from AppKit and UIKit, which is a much better strategy than reinventing the wheel. These components are stateful and are synced with custom manager classes that perform the state diffing. These wrappers can cause issues, and as they’re written in Swift, there aren’t many possibilities to fix issues from the outside (unlike with swizzling in the earlier days).</p><p>Example: Removing a favorited item while it’s selected crashes in the AppKit binding that syncs the SwiftUI state with <code>NSTableView</code> (FB8684522).</p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Removing a favorite crashes the app immediately. <a href="https://t.co/i5wiMJr4XX">pic.twitter.com/i5wiMJr4XX</a></p>— Peter Steinberger (@steipete) <a href="https://twitter.com/steipete/status/1305075451711369216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 13, 2020</a></blockquote><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

This feels sluggish, not to mention it’s significantly longer than even most websites — that load data via the network — need. Fruta has everything local. What’s so slow here? Let’s look at Instruments!</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/46551951d369616ff89d71678a98813dfcd2d94b/97d03/assets/img/2020/fruta-swiftui/instruments.png" alt=""></p><ul><li>Of the 10 seconds captured, 30 percent of them are used for the various retain/release and malloc calls in Swift and Objective-C.</li><li><code>NSAttributedString</code> shows up often in stack traces, which hints that text layout seems especially expensive.</li><li>The AttributeGraph SwiftUI layout engine seems to create a lot of throwaway objects.

For example, <code>AppKitToolbarCoordinator</code> adds a toolbar item, which triggers <code>NSHostingView.preferencesDidChange()</code>, causing everything to lay itself out once again, even though the toolbar size doesn’t change.</li></ul><p>The good news is there seem to be a lot of potential future optimizations possible to make this fast. Alternatively, there’s always the possibility of <a href="https://twitter.com/noahsark769/status/1304938866999046144?s=21">dropping out of SwiftUI for performance critical parts</a>.</p><p>This isn’t unique to Fruta. I’ve been taking a look at <a href="https://twitter.com/Dimillian">@Dimillian’s</a> RedditOS app, which is built with SwiftUI on macOS. He <a href="https://twitter.com/Dimillian/status/1301802048824979456">stopped development</a> because it’s so slow that it’s not shippable. I did some debugging with an earlier version of Big Sur where the app still somewhat worked:</p><div><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The AppKit port of SwiftUI is... not very efficient.

I’m currently working on making our <a href="http://pspdfkit.com/">PDF SDK for iOS</a> easier to use with SwiftUI, and we’ll replace the settings/about screen of <a href="https://pdfviewer.io/">PDF Viewer</a> with a SwiftUI version.</p><p>I personally wouldn’t yet go all-in on SwiftUI for production apps, although the crash rate is likely manageable and Apple is actively improving things with every release. Remember that SwiftUI ships with the OS, not with your app, so any bug fixes will only help if your users update the OS.</p><p>Other ports are not so great. AppKit seems particularly troublesome, but I’ve also heard of big issues with tvOS. If you need to deploy your app to the Mac, use Catalyst, which is a much more stable binding and feels really good with Big Sur’s native mode, where content is no longer scaled.</p><p>If you’re curious about SwiftUI, <strong>please don’t let this dampen your enthusiasm</strong>. It’s extremely fun to write, it’s clearly the future at Apple, and all these issues will surely be resolved within a few years.</p></div></div>]]>

September 14, 2020 | https://mljar.com/blog/automl-as-easy-as-mljar/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mljar.com/blog/automl-as-easy-as-mljar/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>If there has been an open-source library that has made me an avid machine learning practitioner and won the battle of the AutoMLs hands down it has to be MlJar. I simply can’t stop eulogizing this library because it has helped overcome my deficiency in the field of coding and programming but at the same time automating the predictive modeling flow with very little user involvement. I have taken it for a spin in a few Hackathons and am not overtly surprised to find it amongst the top performers. It saves a lot of time as you do not need Data Preprocessing and feature Engineering before feeding the dataset to the model.</p>

<p>Automated machine learning (AutoML) has the potential to increase the productivity of data scientists significantly and believe me it does. AutoML services aim to automate some or all steps of the machine learning process which includes: Data Preprocessing, Feature Engineering, Feature Extraction, Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameters Optimization.</p>

<p>It does all the legwork on the dataset before fitting the model on to it. Without extrapolating my thoughts further about the simplicity and efficiency of mljar I outline this tutorial to show the ease-of-use and how best results can be achieved with a minimalistic approach and a few lines of code.</p>

<p>The first step is to install the library using:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>pip install mljar-supervised
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After importing the necessary libraries like pandas, numpy and sklearn metrics you import AutoML using:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>supervised.automl</span> <span>import</span> <span>AutoML</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then read in the train and test files:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>h_train</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>'/PATH TO THE FILE'</span><span>)</span>
<span>h_test</span> <span>=</span> <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>read_csv</span><span>(</span><span>'/PATH TO THE FILE'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Define <code>X</code> &amp; <code>y</code> as follows:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>X</span> <span>=</span> <span>h_train</span><span>.</span><span>drop</span><span>(</span><span>"target"</span><span>,</span> <span>axis</span> <span>=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>
<span>y</span> <span>=</span> <span>h_train</span><span>.</span><span>target</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Split the train dataset as under:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>X_train</span><span>,</span> <span>X_test</span><span>,</span> <span>y_train</span><span>,</span> <span>y_test</span> <span>=</span> <span>train_test_split</span><span>(</span>
    <span>pd</span><span>.</span><span>DataFrame</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>),</span>
    <span>y</span><span>,</span>
    <span>test_size</span><span>=</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span>   
    <span>random_state</span><span>=</span><span>123</span><span>,</span>   
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Train models with AutoML:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>automl</span> <span>=</span> <span>AutoML</span><span>(</span><span>mode</span><span>=</span><span>"Compete"</span><span>)</span>
<span>automl</span><span>.</span><span>fit</span><span>(</span><span>X_train</span><span>,</span> <span>y_train</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Irrespective of your prediction task you create the object and then fit it on your training dataset. What do you do next? Put your feet up &amp; let your hair down. It begins to spin and spit out tons of information beginning with identification of type of classification (binary, multiclass) or regression, evaluation metric, what algorithms it will use, stacking, ensemble and the steps it is going to follow before the training is complete.</p>

<p>Then compute the prediction on the test set and upload the resulting submission and get a pleasant surprise to find yourself among the top performers of any competition.</p>

<p>No hyperparameter tuning required. The optimization process is done by default. Ensemble of top performing models will be created and used for prediction. What more could you ask for?</p>

<p>In order to demonstrate the predictive prowess of mljar I took it for a ride and used the Data Scientists salary prediction dataset.
I used H2O’s Automl, AutoGluon and TPOT on the same dataset. Despite the HPO steps being offered by the various libraries I could not get them to come even close to the score achieved by mljar.</p>

<p>You can choose the various algorithms and thus have control of the features at the same time which means you are not at the mercy of the AutoML but instead in control of the parameters which you can further tweak whenever required. For example with regard to the aforementioned dataset I used the following code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>automl</span> <span>=</span> <span>AutoML</span><span>(</span>
    <span>algorithms</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>"Random Forest"</span><span>,</span> 
                <span>"Neural Network"</span><span>,</span>
                <span>"Linear"</span><span>,</span>
                <span>"Xgboost"</span><span>,</span>
                <span>"Random Forest"</span><span>,</span>
                <span>"LightGBM"</span><span>],</span>
     <span>total_time_limit</span><span>=</span><span>100</span><span>,</span>
     <span>explain_level</span><span>=</span><span>0</span><span>,</span>
     <span>mode</span><span>=</span><span>"Perform"</span>                 
<span>)</span>
<span>automl</span><span>.</span><span>fit</span><span>(</span><span>X</span><span>,</span> <span>y</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can play with <code>total_time_limit</code> &amp; <code>mode</code> depending on your requirements. Please refer to the <a href="https://supervised.mljar.com/features/modes/">documentation</a>. 
I leave it to you, to try the various AutoMLs and find how mljar makes it easy to select ML algorithms, their parameter settings to improve the accuracy and ability to turn any given data into actionable insights.</p>

<p>For centuries, thinking and solving advanced problems have been the proper thing for a man and distinguished him from other beings. Already in antiquity, the capabilities of the human mind were defined as originating from an order other than the material world. The modern era, the philosophical foundations of which was laid by René Descartes, turned out to be a triumphant moment for the human mind. He made the body and mind two completely separate and independent substances, and made man the only being on Earth in which the body as an extended thing and the soul as a thinking thing are combined.</p>



<p>The consequences of making the ability to think a mere human trait, often based on theological arguments, are clear to this day. Even in the face of the reflections on other minds that come with new discoveries of the cognitive abilities of other animals, many make an effort to maintain the hegemony of the human mind. Even so, our privileged position is becoming shakier and shakier. While comparing ourselves with other animals, we can still come up with more and more sublime arguments for our greater participation in thinking, the spectacular successes of machines, such as the famous victory of the Deep Blue chess game with the master Garry Kasparov, seem to more and more often embarrass us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Machines replace humans not only in physical activities, as animals and less advanced technical tools used to do, but also in what so far was only human power – predicting the effects of actions, making key decisions, recognising phenomena, and reacting to not on the basis of acquired knowledge. Self-learning algorithms write movie scripts, paint pictures, translate languages, make jokes, and diagnose cancer. It’s not uncommon for us at Samurai Technology to use these and many other applications of machine learning to solve challenging problems. But can we say that the actions of the algorithms are based on thinking? </p>



<p>As early as the 1950s, Alan Turing argued that if a machine would be able to use human language enough to deceive us that we were dealing with a human being, we would be able to consider it as thinking. Although the machines of today are tested for intelligence using the Turing test, this criterion has also gathered crowds of critics. One of them is the American philosopher of mind, John Searle, whose counterargument is presented by a thought experiment known as the Chinese room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Imagine, says Searle, that you don’t speak or read any Chinese dialect, but end up in a room where you have access to a set of Chinese rules. By using the instructions, you are able to trick a native Chinese speaker into talking to someone who also knows Chinese. If the computer had followed the same instructions, it would have passed the Turing test. However, according to Searle, there is no question of thinking in this case. Even though based on the instructions, it would have been possible to simulate a Chinese speaker, neither about the human nor the computer in the room, we could not say that their actions were based on the understanding of the Chinese language.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As Searle says, a computer is by definition a&nbsp;<em>symbol manipulating device</em>. Any process that can be described formally can, therefore, be simulated by a digital computer. However, according to the philosopher, manipulating symbols does not imply having mental states, which, according to him, are necessary for us to be able to talk about thinking. In the case of computers, we can only talk about their use of syntax, while the human mind is also characterized by semantics (some content). A machine can pass the Turing test, Searle says, but cannot know that it has passed anything. People and other organisms with a nervous system, apart from using rules, understand meanings – they can interpret the context of specific situations and what this context means for them.</p>



<p>According to Searle, minds are the products of biological brains, and the decisive factor in the existence of cognitive processes is the consciousness they produce. The philosopher argues at this point with various views that consciousness is only a computational tool in the brain or that nothing can be said about it due to its subjective nature. Although we do not yet have a complete understanding of how the mind works, Searle argues that we must accept common-sense facts about consciousness and distinguish its characteristics as follows – it is irreducible, all its states are qualitative and subjective, its areas are unified (we are aware of all things at once, not separately), and it also manifests itself causally in our behavior.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The belief that creating a program capable of performing computationally advanced operations is also the creation of some consciousness is an illusion to which, according to Searle, we succumb. Machines merely simulate the processes taking place in the human mind. We may as well simulate a downpour, but no one will think then that this simulation will actually get us wet, says the philosopher.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to Searle, consciousness is therefore a necessary condition for thinking, and its origin is biological and cannot be mapped even by a suitably complex program. However, it should be remembered that the Chinese room argument is only the beginning of a discussion on the capabilities of computers that have been going on for several decades. Supporters of strong Artificial Intelligence (Strong AI) predict that in the next decade the machine will finally pass the Turing test. Some forecasts also predict that by 2045 there will be machines smarter/more intelligent than people. However, it is certain that we do not yet know everything about the capabilities of our own minds or their digital counterparts.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>BEM CSS stands for Block Element Modifier, which is a CSS methodology to help you write maintainable CSS.</p>
<p>Here's BEM's <a target="_blank" href="http://getbem.com/">official website</a> but keep reading for a brief overview.</p>
<h2 id="bem-basics">BEM Basics</h2>
<p>BEM takes a <strong>component-based</strong> approach to CSS development. It has some strict rules about inheritance and how to write your CSS selectors.</p>
<h3 id="rules-for-inheritance">Rules for Inheritance</h3>
<p>To follow BEM properly, you <strong>should not use inherited CSS</strong> styles in order to style your components. </p>
<p>Some CSS properties are inheritable like font- and table-related properties, but most are not (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/propidx.html">more info</a>).</p>
<p>In order to follow this rule, you should <strong>set inherited properties explicitly</strong>, where applicable. So, for example, if you are building a card component but the whole card has a smaller font size, all text elements should have their font sizes specified explicitly rather than inheriting the smaller font size from the parent.</p>
<p>This rule exists in order to prevent bugs that can occur due to the cascading nature of CSS, i.e. when inheritable styles are added or removed.</p>
<h3 id="rules-for-selectors">Rules for Selectors</h3>
<p>The most important rule is that you <strong>should not nest your selectors</strong>. The reason for not nesting your selectors is so that you do not have specificity wars. </p>
<p>What's a specificity war, you ask? Remember when you tried to apply a CSS style and it didn't work? And then you had to go digging in the dev console to find out why? Sometimes it was because you specified your style before the style that was applied, but more often than not it was because the style was declared with a combination of classes and HTML element selectors, which resulted in a higher level of specificity. </p>
<p>Some of the most popular CSS frameworks (like Twitter Bootstrap, Material UI, Semantic UI) have this problem, which is why it can be cumbersome to use them when working with an actual UI designer.</p>
<p>The following selector does not obey BEM for multiple reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>because it nests selectors</li>
<li>because it uses an element selector <code>h2</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the bad stuff you <strong>should not</strong> copy:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>.page</span> <span>h1</span> {
  <span>font-size</span>: <span>2.5rem</span>;
}

<span>.page</span> <span>h2</span> {
  <span>font-size</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The following is how you can do the same thing using BEM.</p>
<pre><code>
<span>.page__title</span> {
  <span>font-size</span>: <span>2.5rem</span>;
}

<span>.page__subtitle</span> {
  <span>font-size</span>: <span>2rem</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>You'll notice some underscores there, more on that later. For this, see the <strong>Element</strong> section.</p>
<p>Following the selector rule in BEM means you can end up with more verbose HTML because it would require you to add a corresponding CSS class to everything you want to style. This can make tables more verbose, for example, but it means that in the event you need to have a table that's styled differently, you won't have to have any CSS specificity wars.</p>
<h3 id="anatomy-of-bem">Anatomy of BEM</h3>
<p>Essentially, the BEM syntax looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>.block__element--modifier</span>
</code></pre><h4 id="b-block">B – Block</h4>
<p>Blocks are the main component. If you've worked with React or Vue, you can break up your components the same way in your CSS.</p>
<p>You can also nest blocks inside of other blocks, if needed, but this is generally avoided.</p>
<p>A block can be as simple as a single HTML element, like a button, or it can be as complex as a set of them, like a card with an image, subtitle, excerpt, and a button.</p>
<p>Here is a simple block:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"btn"</span>&gt;</span>
  Click me
<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>Here is a more complex block, which could be a card view for a blog where a single card describes a single blog post:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"card"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>h3</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"card__title"</span>&gt;</span>
    How do I use BEM CSS?
  <span>&lt;/<span>h3</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>div</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"card__excerpt"</span>&gt;</span>
    BEM CSS stands for Block Element Modifier, which is a 
    CSS methodology to help you write maintainable CSS.
  <span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;<span>a</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"btn btn--secondary"</span> <span>href</span>=<span>"/path/to/blog/post"</span>&gt;</span>
    Read More
  <span>&lt;/<span>a</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>div</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the following are blocks:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>card</code></li>
<li><code>btn</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="e-element">E – Element</h4>
<p>A block can contain elements, but doesn't have to.</p>
<p>Though you can nest blocks inside of other blocks, you can only nest elements inside of blocks and you cannot nest elements inside of other elements. This is to maintain a flat CSS structure.</p>
<p>In the above card HTML, the following are elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>card__excerpt</code></li>
<li><code>card__title</code></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="m-modifiers">M – Modifiers</h4>
<p>Modifiers are used to modify either blocks or elements. They are used to demonstrate state or variants. </p>
<p>They are used <strong>in addition to</strong> block and element classes, <strong>not in place of</strong> them.</p>
<p>Possible states:</p>
<ul>
<li>active</li>
<li>disabled</li>
</ul>
<p>Possible variants, e.g. for button variants:</p>
<ul>
<li>primary </li>
<li>secondary</li>
<li>small</li>
</ul>
<p>In the above card HTML, the following are modifiers:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>btn--secondary</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Here is how you would style buttons using BEM:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"btn btn--primary"</span>&gt;</span>
  Click me!
<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"btn btn--primary btn--disabled"</span>&gt;</span>
  Nope, can't touch this!
<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>The modifier modifies only the relevant part that needs to be modified. If you had a button that was blue by default and grey when it was disabled, then you would only change the background colour:</p>
<pre><code><span>.btn</span> {
  <span>padding</span>: <span>10px</span> <span>20px</span>;
  <span>font-size</span>: <span>1rem</span>;
}

<span>.btn--primary</span> {
  <span>background</span>: blue;
  <span>color</span>: white;
}

<span>.btn--secondary</span> {
  <span>background</span>: green;
  <span>color</span>: white;
}

<span>.btn--disabled</span> {
  <span>background</span>: grey;
  <span>color</span>: white;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Generally, I list my state modifiers after my theme modifiers. To avoid ambiguity or any specificity or inheritance issues, if a modifier needs to override another modifier, I will explicitly set all properties, e.g. <code>background</code> and <code>color</code> in this case.</p>
<h5 id="combining-modifiers"><strong>Combining modifiers</strong></h5>
<p>Combining modifiers can be a bit tricky, and it seems like everyone on the internet has their own opinion for how to do this. Many of the posts I've found have produced barely-legible CSS. </p>
<p>Given that our primary button is blue, and our secondary button is green, let's assume that the designer said that the background for a disabled primary button should be dark blue, and the disabled secondary button should be dark green. Not only that, but disabled buttons should be at 50% opacity.</p>
<p>Here's an example mockup:</p>
<p><img src="https://tinaciousdesign.imfast.io/2020/09/button-example.png" alt="Mockup of primary and secondary buttons. The first row is the default style, the second row is the disabled state where the background is darker and the buttons are transparent"></p>
<h6 id="option-1-break-the-specificity-rule"><strong>Option 1: Break the specificity rule</strong></h6>
<p>We can still keep the same HTML:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"btn btn--primary btn--disabled"</span>&gt;</span>
  Nope!
<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>As for the CSS, this is where it can get complicated. It may make sense to skip strict BEM rules and do something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>.btn--primary</span><span>.btn--disabled</span> {
  <span>background</span>: darkGreen;
  <span>color</span>: white;
  <span>opacity</span>: <span>0.5</span>;
}

<span>.btn--secondary</span><span>.btn--disabled</span> {
  <span>background</span>: darkGreen;
  <span>color</span>: white;
  <span>opacity</span>: <span>0.5</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This technically breaks the specificity rule, which means that the disabled- and variant-related classes are combined as a single selector, making them more specific than other selectors.</p>
<h6 id="option-2-write-a-joined-modifier"><strong>Option 2: Write a joined modifier</strong></h6>
<p>Instead of having a single <code>--disabled</code> modifier, you can have one for each variant you need to override. </p>
<p>The HTML could look like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;<span>button</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"btn btn--primary--disabled"</span>&gt;</span>
  Nope!
<span>&lt;/<span>button</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>And the CSS like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>.btn--primary</span> {
  <span>background</span>: green;
  <span>color</span>: white;
}

<span>.btn--primary--disabled</span> {
  <span>background</span>: darkGreen;
  <span>color</span>: white;
  <span>opacity</span>: <span>0.5</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Doing this won't require you to break any rules, but it may add some complexity when writing your modifiers.</p>
<p>When you use only one modifier class for each style, you don't need to worry about the order that you declare your classes in the HTML. Unfortunately, with this approach, you'll need to remember which order your modifiers are written in, or duplicate the order.</p>
<p>That means you need to remember that you put <code>--disabled</code> after <code>--primary</code>, and not vice-versa, or you'll have to duplicate the CSS with the flipped version:</p>
<pre><code><span>.btn--primary</span> {
  <span>background</span>: green;
  <span>color</span>: white;
}

<span>.btn--primary--disabled</span>,
<span>.btn--disabled--primary</span> {
  <span>background</span>: darkGreen;
  <span>color</span>: white;
  <span>opacity</span>: <span>0.5</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>That's not so bad with just 2 but if we added a third, you can see how this could exponentially get out of hand. This is why I, personally, would probably break the selector rule.</p>

<p>Let's assume you have a coffee menu design that the designer gave you.</p>
<p><img src="https://tinaciousdesign.imfast.io/2020/09/coffee-menu-example.png" alt="Coffee menu mock-up of a table with a brown border, coffees for sale, and their prices"></p>
<p>Here is an example of non-BEM HTML:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>&lt;<span>table</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>thead</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>th</span>&gt;</span>Coffee<span>&lt;/<span>th</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>th</span>&gt;</span>Price<span>&lt;/<span>th</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>thead</span>&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;<span>tbody</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span>&gt;</span>Americano<span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span>&gt;</span>$3.50<span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span>&gt;</span>Long Black<span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span>&gt;</span>$3.50<span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span>&gt;</span>Latte<span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span>&gt;</span>$4.50<span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span>&gt;</span>Pour-over<span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span>&gt;</span>$6.00<span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>tbody</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/<span>table</span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre>
<p>With the non-BEM version, we could've styled the table like this, but it would've made assumptions about all tables. This is a common problem when using a CSS framework that provides a lot of opinionated styles for you:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>table</span> {
  <span>border</span>: <span>4px</span> solid brown;
}

<span>table</span> <span>th</span> {
  <span>font-weight</span>: <span>700</span>;
}

<span>table</span> <span>td</span> {
  <span>padding</span>: <span>8px</span>;
  <span>font-style</span>: italic;
}

<span>table</span> <span>td</span><span>:last-child</span> {
  <span>font-weight</span>: <span>700</span>;
  <span>font-style</span>: normal; 
}
</code></pre>
<p>The CSS is nice and short and this works perfectly fine if we have only one table style, but as soon as we have different table styles, things start to get crazy.</p>
<p>Also, it's not very legible why the styles are like that:</p>
<ul>
<li>why is the last child bold?</li>
<li>why does the last child have their font style modified to normal, which is the default? </li>
</ul>
<p>Here's the same example using BEM:</p>
<pre><code>
<span>&lt;<span>table</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"coffee-menu"</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;<span>thead</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>th</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"coffee-menu__heading"</span>&gt;</span>Coffee<span>&lt;/<span>th</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>th</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"coffee-menu__heading"</span>&gt;</span>Price<span>&lt;/<span>th</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/<span>thead</span>&gt;</span>

  <span>&lt;<span>tbody</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"coffee-menu__cell coffee-menu__cell--item"</span>&gt;</span>
        Americano
      <span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"coffee-menu__cell coffee-menu__cell--price"</span>&gt;</span>
        $3.50
      <span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"coffee-menu__cell coffee-menu__cell--item"</span>&gt;</span>
        Long Black
      <span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"coffee-menu__cell coffee-menu__cell--price"</span>&gt;</span>
        $3.50
      <span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"coffee-menu__cell coffee-menu__cell--item"</span>&gt;</span>
        Latte
      <span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"coffee-menu__cell coffee-menu__cell--price"</span>&gt;</span>
        $4.50
      <span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;<span>tr</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"coffee-menu__cell coffee-menu__cell--item"</span>&gt;</span>
        Pour-over
      <span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;<span>td</span> <span>class</span>=<span>"coffee-menu__cell coffee-menu__cell--price"</span>&gt;</span>
        $6.00
      <span>&lt;/<span>td</span>&gt;</span>

    <p>Author: <a href="https://twitter.com/orange_8361" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Orange Tsai</a></p><p>This is a cross-post blog from <a href="https://devco.re/" target="_blank">DEVCORE</a>.&nbsp;<a href="https://devco.re/blog/2020/09/12/how-I-hacked-Facebook-again-unauthenticated-RCE-on-MobileIron-MDM/" target="_blank">ä¸­æ–‡ç‰ˆè«‹å�ƒé–±é€™è£¡</a></p>
    <p>Hi, it’s a long time since my last article. This new post is about my research this March, which talks about how I found vulnerabilities on a leading Mobile Device Management product and bypassed several limitations to achieve
        unauthenticated RCE. All the vulnerabilities have been reported to the vendor and got fixed in June. After that, we kept monitoring large corporations to track the overall fixing progress and then found that Facebook didn’t keep up
        with the patch for more than 2 weeks, so we dropped a shell on Facebook and reported to their Bug Bounty program!</p>
    <p>This research is also presented at <a href="http://hitcon.org/2020" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HITCON 2020</a>. You can check the slides <a href="https://hitcon.org/2020/slides/How%20I%20Hacked%20Facebook%20Again!.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">HERE</a></p>
    
    <p>
        As a Red Teamer, we are always looking for new paths to infiltrate the corporate network from outside. Just like
        <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-19/briefings/schedule/#infiltrating-corporate-intranet-like-nsa---pre-auth-rce-on-leading-ssl-vpns-15545" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our research in Black Hat USA last year</a>, we
        demonstrated how leading SSL VPNs could be hacked and become your Virtual “Public” Network! SSL VPN is trusted to be secure and considered the only way to your private network. But, what if your trusted appliances are insecure?
    </p>
    <p>Based on this scenario, we would like to explore new attack surfaces on enterprise security, and we get interested in MDM, so this is the article for that!</p>
    <h2 id="What-is-MDM">
        <a href="#What-is-MDM" title="What-is-MDM"><i></i></a>What is MDM?
    </h2>
    <p>
        Mobile Device Management, also known as MDM, is an asset assessment system that makes the employees’ <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bring_your_own_device" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BYOD</a> more manageable for
        enterprises. It was proposed in 2012 in response to the increasing number of tablets and mobile devices. MDM can guarantee that the devices are running under the corporate policy and in a trusted environment. Enterprise could manage
        assets, install certificates, deploy applications and even lock/wipe devices remotely to prevent data leakage as well.
    </p>
    <p>UEM (Unified Endpoint Management) is a newer term relevant to MDM which has a broader definition for managed devices. Following we use MDM to represent similar products!</p>
    <h2 id="Our-target">
        <a href="#Our-target" title="Our-target"><i></i></a>Our target
    </h2>
    <p>
        MDM, as a centralized system, can manage and control all employees’ devices. It is undoubtedly an ideal asset assessment system for a growing company. Besides, MDM must be reachable publicly to synchronize devices all over the
        world. A centralized and public-exposing appliance, what could be more appealing to hackers?
    </p>
    <p>
        Therefore, we have seen hackers and APT groups abusing MDM these years! Such as phishing victims to make MDM a C&amp;C server of their mobile devices, or even compromising the corporate exposed MDM server to push malicious Trojans
        to all devices. You can read the report <a href="https://blogs.cisco.com/security/talos/malicious-mdm-lets-hide-this-app" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Malicious MDM: Let’s Hide This App</a> by Cisco Talos team and
        <a href="https://research.checkpoint.com/2020/mobile-as-attack-vector-using-mdm/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">First seen in the wild - Malware uses Corporate MDM as attack vector</a> by CheckPoint CPR team for more details!
    </p>
    <p>
        From previous cases, we know that MDM is a solid target for hackers, and we would like to do research on it. There are several MDM solutions, even famous companies such as Microsoft, IBM and Apple have their own MDM solution. Which
        one should we start with?
    </p>
    <p>We have listed known MDM solutions and scanned corresponding patterns all over the Internet. We found that the most prevalent MDMs are VMware AirWatch and MobileIron!</p>
    <p>
        So, why did we choose MobileIron as our target? According to their official website, more than 20,000 enterprises chose MobileIron as their MDM solution, and most of our customers are using that as well. We also know Facebook has
        exposed the MobileIron server <a href="https://devco.re/blog/2016/04/21/how-I-hacked-facebook-and-found-someones-backdoor-script-eng-ver/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">since 2016</a>. We have analyzed Fortune Global 500 as well,
        and found more than 15% using and exposing their MobileIron server to the public! Due to above reasons, it became our main target!
    </p>
    <h2 id="Where-to-Start">
        <a href="#Where-to-Start" title="Where-to-Start"><i></i></a>Where to Start
    </h2>
    <p>
        From <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-13968/Mobileiron.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">past vulnerabilities</a>, we learned there aren’t too many researchers diving into MobileIron. Perhaps the
        attack vector is still unknown. But we suspect the main reason is that the firmware is too hard to obtain. When researching an appliance, turning a pure BlackBox testing into GrayBox, or WhiteBox testing is vital. We spent lots of
        time searching for all kinds of information on the Internet, and ended up with an RPM package. This RPM file is supposed to be the developer’s testing package. The file is just sitting on a listable WebRoot and indexed by Google
        Search.
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-70mzbF-4-tA/X1tweaR9zdI/AAAAAAAAEoM/j_8g-DNrJIQ3or4RXKhDALrL3sGOKA-4QCLcBGAsYHQ/s2002/%25E5%259C%2596%25E7%2589%25871.png"><img data-original-height="1127" data-original-width="2002" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-70mzbF-4-tA/X1tweaR9zdI/AAAAAAAAEoM/j_8g-DNrJIQ3or4RXKhDALrL3sGOKA-4QCLcBGAsYHQ/s16000/%25E5%259C%2596%25E7%2589%25871.png"></a></p><p>Anyway, we got a file to research. The released date of the file is in early 2018. It seems a little bit old but still better than nothing!</p>
    <p><em>P.S. We have informed MobileIron and the sensitive files has been removed now.</em></p>
    <h2 id="Finding-Vulnerabilities">
        <a href="#Finding-Vulnerabilities" title="Finding-Vulnerabilities"><i></i></a>Finding Vulnerabilities
    </h2>
    <p>After a painful time solving the dependency hell, we set the testing package up finally. The component is based on Java and exposed three ports:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>443 - the user enrollment interface</li>
        <li>8443 - the appliance management interface</li>
        <li>9997 - the MobileIron device synchronization protocol (MI Protocol)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All opened ports are TLS-encrypted. Apache is in the front of the web part and proxies all connections to backend, a Tomcat with Spring MVC inside.</p>
    <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSlR3MzoZMY/X1twbXCAloI/AAAAAAAAEoQ/sS1PFa4Z0IcB9X8_ewQ52eCtJpdVsDVMwCPcBGAYYCw/s2048/2020-09-06_230414.png"><img data-original-height="1152" data-original-width="2048" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VSlR3MzoZMY/X1twbXCAloI/AAAAAAAAEoQ/sS1PFa4Z0IcB9X8_ewQ52eCtJpdVsDVMwCPcBGAYYCw/s16000/2020-09-06_230414.png"></a></p><p>Due to the Spring MVC, it’s hard to find traditional vulnerabilities like SQL Injection or XSS from a single view. Therefore, examining the logic and architecture is our goal this time!</p>
    <p>
        Talking about the vulnerability, the root cause is straightforward. Tomcat exposed a Web Service that deserializes user input with Hessian format. However, this doesn’t mean we can do everything! The main effort of this article is
        to solve that, so please see the exploitation below.
    </p>
    <p>Although we know the Web Service deserializes the user input, we can not trigger it. The endpoint is located on both:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>User enrollment interface - <code>https://mobileiron/mifs/services/</code></li>
        <li>Management interface - <code>https://mobileiron:8443/mics/services/</code></li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We can only touch the deserialization through the management interface because the user interface blocks the Web Service access. It’s a critical hit for us because most enterprises won’t expose their management interface to the
        Internet, and a management-only vulnerability is not useful to us so that we have to try harder. :(
    </p>
    <p>Scrutinizing the architecture, we found Apache blocks our access through Rewrite Rules. It looks good, right?</p>
    <pre><code><span><span>RewriteRule</span></span> ^/mifs/services/(.*)$ https://<span>%{SERVER_NAME}</span>:8443/mifs/services/<span>$1</span><span> [R=307,L]</span>
<span><span>RewriteRule</span></span> ^/mifs/services<span> [F]</span>
</code></pre>
    <p>MobileIron relied on Apache Rewrite Rules to block all the access to Web Service. It’s in the front of a reverse-proxy architecture, and the backend is a Java-based web server.</p>
    <p>Have you recalled something?</p>
    
    <p>
        Yes, the <a href="https://blog.orange.tw/2018/08/how-i-chained-4-bugs-features-into-rce-on-amazon.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Breaking Parser Logic</a>! It’s the reverse proxy attack surface I
        <a href="https://github.com/orangetw/My-CTF-Web-Challenges#blackbox" rel="noopener" target="_blank">proposed in 2015</a>, and presented at
        <a href="https://www.blackhat.com/us-18/briefings.html#breaking-parser-logic-take-your-path-normalization-off-and-pop-0days-out" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Black Hat USA 2018</a>. This technique leverage the inconsistency
        between the Apache and Tomcat to bypass the ACL control and reaccess the Web Service. BTW, this excellent technique is also applied to the recently

    </h2>
    <p>OK, now we have access to the deserialization wherever it’s on enrollment interface or management interface. Let’s go back to exploitations!</p>
    <p>
        <a href="https://github.com/mbechler" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moritz Bechler</a> has an awesome research which summarized the Hessian deserialization vulnerability on his whitepaper,
        <a href="https://www.github.com/mbechler/marshalsec/blob/master/marshalsec.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Java Unmarshaller Security</a>. From the
        <a href="https://github.com/mbechler/marshalsec" rel="noopener" target="_blank">marshalsec</a> source code, we learn the Hessian deserialization triggers the <code>equals()</code> and <code>hashcode()</code> while reconstructing a
        <code>HashMap</code>. It could also trigger the <code>toString()</code> through the <code>XString</code>, and the known exploit gadgets so far are:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Apache XBean</li>
        <li>Caucho Resin</li>
        <li>Spring AOP</li>
        <li>ROME EqualsBean/ToStringBean</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In our environment, we could only trigger the Spring AOP gadget chain and get a JNDI Injection.</p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th></th>
                <th>Name</th>
                <th>Effect</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>x</td>
                <td>Apache XBean</td>
                <td>JNDI Injection</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>x</td>
                <td>Caucho Resin</td>
                <td>JNDI Injection</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><strong>√</strong></td>
                <td><strong>Spring AOP</strong></td>
                <td><strong>JNDI Injection</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>x</td>
                <td>ROME EqualsBean</td>
                <td>RCE</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    <p>
        Once we have a JNDI Injection, the rest parts of exploitations are easy! We can just leverage <a href="https://twitter.com/pwntester" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alvaro MuÃ±oz</a> and
        <a href="https://twitter.com/olekmirosh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oleksandr Mirosh</a>’s work,

        Black Hat USA 2016 to get the code execution… Is that true?
    </p>
    <p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q8Id1BEFXmQ/X1twcKOk3sI/AAAAAAAAEoc/CB4R9pn0gh4oXhPWvRw040yNtct1NFEywCPcBGAYYCw/s1818/fefewfe.png"><img data-original-height="663" data-original-width="1818" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-q8Id1BEFXmQ/X1twcKOk3sI/AAAAAAAAEoc/CB4R9pn0gh4oXhPWvRw040yNtct1NFEywCPcBGAYYCw/s16000/fefewfe.png"></a></p>
    <p>
        Since <a href="https://twitter.com/pwntester" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Alvaro MuÃ±oz</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/olekmirosh" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Oleksandr Mirosh</a> introduced this on Black Hat, we could
        say that this technique helps countless security researchers and brings Java deserialization vulnerability into a new era. However, Java finally mitigated the last JNDI/LDAP puzzle in
        <a href="https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u181-relnotes.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">October 2018</a>. After that, all java version higher than 8u181, 7u191, and 6u201 can no longer get code execution through
        JNDI remote URL-Class loading. Therefore, if we exploit the Hessian deserialization on the latest MobileIron, we must face this problem!
    </p>
    <p>
        Java changed the default value of <code>com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase</code> to <code>False</code> to prevent attackers from downloading remote URL-Class to get code executions. But only this has been prohibited. We can
        still manipulate the JNDI and redirect the Naming Reference to a local Java Class!
    </p>
    <p>
        The concept is a little bit similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Return-Oriented Programming</a>, utilizing a local existing Java Class to do further
        exploitations. You can refer to the article <a href="https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/exploiting-jndi-injections-java" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Exploiting JNDI Injections in Java</a> by
        <a href="https://twitter.com/artsploit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Michael Stepankin</a> in early 2019 for details. It describes the attack on POST-JNDI exploitations and how to abuse the Tomcat’s <code>BeanFactory</code> to
        populate the <code>ELProcessor</code> gadget to get code execution. Based on this concept, researcher <a href="https://github.com/welk1n" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Welkin</a> also provides another <code>ParseClass</code> gadget
        on Groovy. As described in <a href="https://www.cnblogs.com/Welk1n/p/11066397.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">his (Chinese) article</a>:

    <section>
      <p>Have you ever noticed how many words used in software engineering come from, well, engineering? For any software project, you have architects, developers, project managers and designers, dealing with infrastructure, hardware, programs and frameworks. Listening to a project conversation without context could fool you into thinking that they’re talking about building houses, not software. But what if, as <a href="https://medium.com/coaching-notes/youre-not-managing-a-team-of-software-engineers-you-re-managing-a-team-of-writers-b263d3a10cc7">pointed out</a> by executive coach Joe Dunn, you were managing a team of writers, not engineers?</p><p>When you think about it, it makes sense, right? First of all, software engineers write code. Like writers, their activities can be summarised in three main creative phases: impregnation, structuration and writing/rewriting. Sometimes what they have to write is very straightforward, like the 100th episode of a legal drama TV show. Sometimes it is very creative with a lot of unknowns, like a screenplay. Finally, both groups have to abide by deadlines and business imperatives.</p><p><strong>If software engineers are like writers, wouldn’t there be some lessons to learn from the writing world?</strong> With over 200 TV shows produced per year, the TV business could be the closest equivalent to the technology world (obviously not counting the show Silicon Valley which is about tech startups 😅). TV shows raise multi-million dollar budgets, they have to release episodes (<em>features</em>) under tight deadlines, they pay close attention to viewers ratings (<em>analytics</em>), and they’re, of course, trying to generate outsized returns for their investors.</p><figure><img src="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/09/image-2.png 600w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/09/image-2.png 1000w, https://www.tlt21.com/content/images/2020/09/image-2.png 1296w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Christopher Patey - The Hollywood Reporter</figcaption></figure><p>In television, the equivalent of a technology leader would be the executive producer. Also called showrunners, executive producers are responsible for making a budget for the season and episodes, liaising with the studio and, most importantly, managing the writers.

<p>Brian Eno created a <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=brian%20eno%20oblique%20strategies">collection of strategies</a> to help artists break creative block. We can do something similar for programmers stuck on problems. Eno's strategies were designed to be drawn at random. The strategies here can be drawn at random, perhaps via <a href="https://atom.io/packages/oblique-strategies">script</a>, but have a sort order, to make them easier to search.</p>

<h2>Experienced Approaches</h2>

<p> <prompt>Look for a hack</prompt>. Can you short-circuit a complex algorithm? Can you short-circuit a complex requirement? Probably you could build a hacky PageRank without knowing anything at all about linear algebra. What kind of shortcuts did you look for when you were first learning to program? If you've forgotten that feeling, set for yourself an impossible task some weekend. Get as much of it done as you can solely by cutting corners.

</p><p>Hacks often become excellent long-term solutions. You can't build on top of a hacked area, but the assumption is you may never have to. A hack is an inexpensive attempt to keep momentum. 

</p><p> <prompt>Look for a good enough approximation</prompt>. Relax the problem wherever possible. Remove any inessential requirements you can find. Seemingly inconsequential or unrelated relaxations have a way of giving you exactly the leverage you need to solve the problem at hand. The practice of "eventual consistency" in database design is a good illustration of this technique. The technique has a long reach. Sometimes you can make restrictions elsewhere that filter back to your problem.

</p><p>Don't shy away from informal solutions like hacks and approximations if the formal solution is heavy work. It is better to save yourself the effort than to appease your sense of order. The world resists elegant solutions, in places.

</p><p> <prompt>Have faith in sound-looking abstractions</prompt>. Novel combinations of known high-level strategies almost always work. Trust that you'll be able to work out the details after fitting the parts together. If the parts do fit, there'll be fewer details to handle than if you solved the problem with primitive techniques. An example of this would be using regexes to lex tokens. There's no guarantee to the newcomer that using regexes won't lead to an inescapable problem, and yet, with a little mortar, regexes work great.

</p><p> <prompt>Forget about optimizing your code</prompt>. Most of the time unoptimized code is fine. It's also a lot easier to write. </p><p>Say you have to create New File.txt in a directory without overwriting any existing New Files. Don't spend a lot of time figuring out the—fairly complicated—first available name algorithm. Simply append a number to the end of New File to get New File (1). Then check and increment until the name is available. This method will work for a long time, and it degrades gracefully. If it ever becomes a problem you can go back and fix it. One caveat: for a company with enough users, optimizations may be necessary from the start. Check usage data to make a determination.

</p><p>If you can't break the habit of chasing optimizations, then do what I do. Leave a comment like POTENTIAL_OPTIMIZATION_POINT with a description of how to go about your optimization. This cures my urge to optimize. Having done this for a while, I find I go back and act on maybe 1 in 20.

</p><p> <prompt>Solve the problem directly</prompt>. Pierce right to the center. If the problem reduces to a simple combination of known mathematical objects, then a direct mathematical approach may be the best way to solve it. 

</p><p>Reddit needs to rank stories based on votes and time. Various mathematical expressions will solve this: complicated expressions involving exponential decay, and so on. They use a relatively "simple" one involving a logarithm. (In fact almost any formula will work. See the above remark on PageRank.) I don't show the formula here but it is clear and easy to follow with some investment. </p><p>You can envision that, instead of arriving at such a closed formula, your team produces a substantially longer and more convoluted algorithm, which creates maintenance headaches of its own. A direct math solution can be much less accessible and yet still solve its problem as efficiently. In these cases fight for the direct solution...if it's really the true way. In the long run the math way is the right choice even if not everybody feels comfortable about it. It cuts the knot.

</p><p>Direct solutions are not always the right way to go about things. One misuse in particular we might call "the lazy man's load": 

</p><blockquote>
LAZY MAN'S LOAD. Lazy people frequently take up more than they can safely carry, to save the trouble of coming a second time.

</blockquote>

<p>In this context we take it to mean that the problem is solved directly in order to avoid theory building. This is not the only misapplication.

</p><p> <prompt>Feats are fragile</prompt>. How complicated is the solution you have? Is it mercilessly detailed, though correct, and you can prove the problem admits nothing less complicated? Chances are what you have, while correct, is too fragile to use, and you must resolve to accept a more limited formulation of the problem. (It is easier to identify these situations when they have happened to you several times.) The trickier a solution is, the smaller the pool of people able to maintain it. And for the people who could maintain it, who would want to? Even Google, with its many brilliant programmers, admits defeat on such problems from time to time.


</p><p> <prompt>Board up rabbit holes</prompt>. Boarding over a rabbit hole always involves some sacrifice of functionality. So start by figuring out what you can sacrifice and how much of it. Board up rabbit holes even if you plan to go back in later. It's cheap. 

</p><p> <prompt>Build the theory of the problem</prompt>. The opposite of solving the problem directly. This is exactly the same as what schools of mathematicians do. Most companies take this approach already without knowing the parallel. Simplify the problem in layers like an onion.

</p><blockquote>
Results will ripen on the tree that he is patiently gardening, and fall off at the right time of their own juicy weight.

</blockquote>

<p>Radix sort uses a series of filters of lesser and lesser coarseness. Sorting piles of stones into big and small piles, then recursing, is similar. These methods can be like lengthening a lever, you go a longer distance but do less work at any given point. That's the way you want to think about solving your problem.

</p><p>Taken too far, the theory building approach creates cruft. It can also be a form of procrastination. Its twin is the direct solution.

</p><p> <prompt>Shear off a layer</prompt>. Many problems have separable layers. Parsing can be reduced to a series of passes. This a subsection of theory building but worthy of its own mention.

</p><p> <prompt>Get red and green right before mixing yellow</prompt>. If you have to combine two separates pieces into some bigger conglomeration, it can be tempting to build the entire thing in one go. The reasoning, and it is naive reasoning, is that building everything together saves time—the hope is to avoid rebuilding pieces that don't fit. Two important facts make this reasoning wrong. The first is that the added complexity of building everything at once slows down the completion of every part. This drags down the overall completion rate. The second is that solving the same problem twice doesn't take twice as long. Solving the same problem again is so much faster that it is essentially free. (Try it with a book of puzzles.) The "now it's easy" phenomenon is why mathematicians call everything they already know trivial. 

</p><p> <prompt>A blink lasts 300 milliseconds</prompt>. For most computing applications this is an eternity. If your application depends on interaction, then take full advantage of any anticipated delays. A command-line interpreter returns output to a human only a line at a time, so it doesn't matter how slow the parser is. Even the worst strategies will produce execution times orders of magnitude below the measurable perception limit. 
</p><p>Bad parsing takes less than a millisecond and cannot be perceived. What this means is that all time spent on optimizing the compiler for this case is absolutely wasted.

</p><p>Delays are often based on different thresholds of human perception. For websites this is maybe 50ms, for video games maybe 1ms. Mobile apps are somewhere in the middle.

</p><p> <prompt>Zoom in</prompt>. If a tricky piece is causing issues, focus on it exclusively—come back to it the next day if necessary. Let it take up the whole frame.

</p><p> <prompt>Add constraints</prompt>. Artificial limits turn exhausting problems into simple ones. A user may need five shipping addresses. They don't need one million.

</p><p> <prompt>Mark it WONTFIX</prompt>. The best solution to any problem is to avoid having to solve it in the first place. This is one of your most important tools. All the work you cut is energy saved. Pure gain. If you can't immediately think of a reason not to do something, postpone work on it as long as you can while you try to find a reason. Is it possible to just drop the task? Will your world explode? If not, you probably can. A lot of work is wasted. 


</p><h2>Innocent Approaches</h2>

<p> <prompt>Verify your fears, explicitly</prompt>. Are you stuck because you're worried something will run too slow, and you don't know how to get around it? Verify that the case actually runs slow. It might not. The problem may not exist at all. Don't allow yourself to create a ridge of inflatable mountains.

</p><p> <prompt>Keep calm</prompt>. If your fears are real, don't panic. Terrible problems often have simple solutions. What looms large one moment may be only a few lines of code the next. 

</p><blockquote>
If you see ten troubles coming down the road, you can be sure that nine will run into the ditch before they reach you.

</blockquote>

<p> <prompt>Take a closer look</prompt>. When was the last time you looked concretely at the abstract thing you're working with? Add more debugging output. Gather more data.

</p><p> <prompt>Is it the bug you think it is?</prompt> "Something else" that's broken can make something that works look broken. Or make something broken more broken.

</p><p> <prompt>Is it a typo?</prompt> The wrong variable name in otherwise working code can trigger a hunt far from where the problem is.

</p><p> <prompt>Stop and think</prompt>. Many problems need to be solved on paper first.

</p><p> <prompt>If you lack motivation, find the most interesting thing in the …</prompt></p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>I'm now a user of Vim, not classical Vi (partly because of windows)</h2>

	<p><small>September 13, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>In the past I've written entries (such as <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/ViAndVimAndMe">this one</a>)
where I said that I was pretty much a Vi user, not really a Vim user,
because I almost entirely stuck to Vi features. In a comment on <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/VimNotUsingFeatures">my
entry on not using and exploring Vim features</a>,
rjc reinforced this, saying that I seemed to be using vi instead of
vim (and that there was nothing wrong with this). For a long time I
thought this way myself, but these days this is not true any more.
These days I really want Vim, not classical Vi.</p>

<p>The clear break point where I became a Vim user instead of a Vi
user was when I started internalizing and heavily using Vim's
<a href="https://vimhelp.org/quickref.txt.html#Q_wi">(multi-)window commands</a>
(<a href="https://vimhelp.org/usr_08.txt.html#usr_08.txt">also</a>). I started
this as far back as 2016 (as signalled by <a href="https://utcc.utoronto.ca/~cks/space/blog/unix/VimMotionCmdsToRemember">this entry</a>), but it took a while before I really had
the window commands sink in and habits regarding them become routine
(like using '<code>vi -o</code>' on most occasions when I'm editing multiple
files). I'm not completely fluid with Vim windows and I certainly
haven't mastered all the commands, but at this point I definitely
don't want to go back to not having them available.</p>

<p>(In my old vi days, editing multiple files was always a pain point
where I would start reaching for another editor. I just really want
to see more than one file on a screen at once in my usual editing
style. Sometimes I want to see more than one spot in a file at the
same time, too, especially when coding.)</p>

<p>I also very much want Vim's unlimited undo and redo, instead of a
limited size undo. There are a bunch of reasons for this, but one
of them is certainly that the Vi command set makes it rather easy
to accidentally do a second edit operation as you're twitching
around before you realize that you actually want to undo the first
one. This is especially the case if your edit operation was an
accident (where you hit the wrong keys by mistake or didn't realize
that you weren't in insert mode), or if you've developed the habit
of reflexively reflowing your current paragraph any time you pause
in writing.</p>

<p>(There are probably other vim features I've become accustomed to
without realizing it or without realizing that they're Vim features,
not basic Vi features. Everywhere I use 'vi', it's really Vim.)</p>

<p>Although I'm now unapologetically using vim, my vimrc continues to
be pretty minimal and is mostly dedicated to turning things off and
setting sensible (ie modern) defaults, instead of old vi defaults.
I'm unlikely to ever try to turn my vim into a superintelligent
editor for reasons beyond the scope of this entry.</p>

<p>(I do use one Vim plugin in some of my vim setups, Aristotle
Pagaltzis' <a href="https://github.com/ap/vim-buftabline/">vim-buftabline</a>.
I would probably be more enthused about it if I edited lots of files
at once in my vim sessions, but usually I don't edit more than a
couple at once.)</p>

<p>Why Should I Care?</p>



<p>Applications, even databases come and go, but data is the most important part of the story. Usually, data is the purpose of the system exists in the first place. That’s why we should consider a database system not only as a black box to hold our data, but also a tool to verify and guard it against corruptions.</p>



<p>This is achieved with a help of robust and well-thought database design. Of course, business logic is coded in the application layer and it makes sure data is in a proper format before arriving at the database. But who guarantees that a network failure or a bug will not allow corrupted “guests”? Also, the application layer is not the only “door” to the database. We can have import scripts, maintenance scripts, and mere mortal DBAs and developers interacting with it. Having preventive measures at a very low level ensures our data is always checked before stored.</p>



<p>Having robust, reliable data also helps with development and testing. Setting a column as a Not Null excludes many test scenarios assuming the emptiness of that column and also simplifies code freeing developers to check value [nearly] every time before accessing it.</p>



<p>Having stressed the importance of good database design, let’s have a look at the tools at our disposal to achieve it.</p>



<p>Normalization</p>

<p>This is of no doubt the first rule of good design. We are not going to delve into normalization rules here, just want to emphasize it’s importance. A good piece of reading about the topic could be&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/troubleshoot/access/database-normalization-description" rel="noreferrer noopener">this article.</a></p>



<p>Data Types</p>



<p>Defining proper types for attributes is another thing that needs attention. This will not only improve the performance of the database but also validate the data before storing it. So we should keep numeric data in “integer”, “numeric” fields. Timestamps in “timestamp”, “timestamptz” fields. Booleans in “bit”, “char(1)” or “boolean” (whichever RDBMS supports) fields, etc.</p>



<p>Dates deserve a specific mention. If a Date attribute is supposed to have only the date part (OrderDate, ReleaseDate) use a type without a time portion (“date”). If you need to keep only the time (StartTime, EndTime) use a suitable time type. If you don’t need precision specify it as zero (“time(0)”). The problem with dates having a time portion is that you always have to cut off the time part to display only the date and make sure not to display yesterday or tomorrow when you format it in a different timezone than your database. Dates with time portion also may cause problems with subtracting and addition when hopping over daylight change dates.</p>

<p>Constraints</p>



<p>Constraints are our main topic of discussion today. They are what keeps invalid data out and ensures the robustness of it. Let’s look at them one by one.</p>



<p>Not Null Constraint</p>



<p>If business rules state that attribute should always be present, make it Not Null without hesitating. Good candidates to be Not Null are fields like Id, Name, AddedDate, IsActive, State, CategoryId (if all items should have a category), ItemCount, Price, and many others. Usually, these attributes play important roles in business logic. Other optional informative fields may still be Null.</p>



<p>But be careful not overusing Not Null constraint for attributes that CAN BE Null. For example, a long-running Task always has a StartTimestamp (Not Null), but EndTimestamp is updated only when the task finishes (Null). Or another classic example: Employee table has ManagerId, but not all employees have a manager. Don’t be tempted to make ManagerId Not Null and insert “0” or “-1” for employees that don’t have a manager. This will lead to other problems down the way when we will be adding Foreign Key constraints.</p>



<p>Unique Constraint</p>



<p>Again, depending on business rules, some attributes (or combinations of attributes) should be unique, such as Id, PinNumber, BookId and AuthorId, OrderNo, etc. These attributes should be made unique by adding Unique constraints. One more note: you may use Unique Index to achieve the same effect, but adding constraint is a better approach. Because when you add a Unique constraint a non-unique index is created automatically. So if for some reason you would have to temporarily disable/enable the constraint it’d be very easy. In the case of a unique index, you would have to drop/recreate the index which is an expensive operation in terms of performance degradation and time.</p>



<p>Primary Key</p>



<p>Not Null and Unique constraints together make up a Primary Key. Columns like Id or ObjectId quickly come to mind when we think of primary keys. But primary keys can also be composite, like BookId and AuthorId. The dilemma here is whether to have a separate Id column as a primary key, or make a composite primary key of them both? Having a separate Id column is usually a better method as it makes your joins cleaner and also allows easily add another column to a unique combination. However, having a separate primary key (Id) doesn’t free us from the need to add a Unique constraint to BookId and AuthorId columns.</p>



<p>Check Constraint</p>



<p>Check constraints allow us to define valid values/ranges for data. Perfect candidates for check constraints are Percent (between 0 and 100), State (0, 1, 2), Price, Amount, Total (greater than or equal to 0), PinNumber (fixed length), etc. Again don’t try to code business logic into check constraints. I remember a case when adding a Check constraint “greater than or equal to zero” to the AccountBalance column saved us from accidental over-drawing balances.</p>



<p>Default Constraint</p>



<p>Default constraints are also important. They allow us to add new Not Null columns to existing tables and make the “older” API to be compatible with the new structure until all parties are upgraded (though after complete upgrade default constraint should be removed).</p>



<p>One thing to remember here. Don’t code business logic into a Default constraint. For example function “now()” can be a good fit (though not always) as a default value for a Timestamp field in a Log table, but not for an OrderDate field in an Orders table. You may be tempted to omit OrderDate in inserts, relying on a default constraint and this means spreading your business logic down to the database level. Also at some point business may decide to assign OrderDate only after it has been approved and because the Default constraint is buried deep into the database it will not be obvious when we make changes to the code in the application layer.</p>



<p>Foreign Key Constraint</p>



<p>Foreign Key constraint is the king of the relational database design. Together with Primary Keys, Foreign Keys ensure data consistency at the inter-table level. Normalization rules tell us when to extract data into its table and reference it with Foreign keys. Here we will focus on subtle nuances, like OnDelete and OnUpdate rules.</p>



<figure><img data-attachment-id="208" data-permalink="https://relinx.io/untitled/" data-orig-file="https://relinxapp.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/untitled.png" data-orig-size="1062,232" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="untitled" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://relinxapp.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/untitled.png?w=300" data-large-file="https://relinxapp.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/untitled.png?w=750" src="https://relinxapp.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/untitled.png?w=1024" alt="" srcset="https://relinxapp.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/untitled.png?w=1024 1024w, https://relinxapp.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/untitled.png?w=150 150w, https://relinxapp.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/untitled.png?w=300 300w, https://relinxapp.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/untitled.png?w=768 768w, https://relinxapp.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/untitled.png 1062w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"><figcaption>Foreign Key editor dialog in DBeaver</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s start with the easy part: OnUpdate. Foreign keys reference primary keys and they are rarely (if ever) changed. So the OnUpdate rule is not very popular, but it makes sense to set it to Cascade, as sometimes we may have to update the primary keys of some rows (usually after migration). This way database will allow us to make the update and new ids will be propagated to the child tables.</p>



<p>OnDelete rule is a bit more complicated. Depending on the database we have options NoAction, Restrict, SetNull, SetDefault, and Cascade. So which one to choose?</p>



<p>NoAction is usually selected for keys referencing lookups or entities that can exist without referencing entity. For example, Products -&gt; Categories, Books -&gt; Authors, etc. Restrict in most cases is the same as NoAction, though for some databases there’re subtle <a href="https://www.vertabelo.com/blog/on-delete-restrict-vs-on-delete-no-action/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">differences</a>.</p>



<p>On the other hand, Cascade is selected when child records can not exist without their parent. In Book and Author example, when a book is removed we should remove records from the BookAuthor table too. Other examples: OrderDetails -&gt; Orders, PostComments -&gt; Posts etc. Here some of you may disagree that the database should not automatically remove child rows, they should be removed by the application layer. Depending on business logic, yes, that’s true. But sometimes “unimportant” child deletions can be delegated to the database.</p>



<p>SetNull is rarely used. For example, the Foreign key between Employee.ManagerId and Employee.Id can be Set Null. When a manager is removed (if ever) his subordinates become orphans. Obviously, this rule should be selected only if the column is nullable.</p>



<p>SetDefault is the rarest among his counterparts. It sets the column to its default value when the parent record is removed. Because foreign keys reference primary keys we can hardly imagine a hard-coded default value for a field with a foreign key. But anyway this option exists in case we need it.</p>



<p>Indexes</p>



<p>Indexes are an important part of good database design, but a bit off-topic for our discussion, as they do little to protect our data (except for unique indexes). One underwater rock to be aware of: some RDBMS systems (e.g. Oracle) will automatically create an index on foreign key creation and we don’t have to worry about that. Others (e.g. MS SQL Server) will not and we have to add indexes ourselves.</p>



<p>Conclusion</p>



<p>A well-thought design can save us many hours of coding, testing, and troubleshooting. Writing queries and reports against a well-designed database is a pleasure. Publishing and migrating that data to a new system is also very easy.</p>



<p>Opinions presented in this article are the result of many years dealing with various database systems. Some may be suitable for your case and some even contrary. So don’t take them for granted.</p>



<p>Happy coding!</p>

<p>By Mike Davis</p>



<p>En route to Vegas and 20 minutes away from the state line, there is an exit from I-15 to a two-lane blacktop called Cima Road. It’s the unassuming portal to one of North America’s most magical forests: countless miles of old-growth Joshua trees mantling a field of small Pleistocene volcanoes known as Cima Dome. The monarchs of the forest are 45 feet high and 1,000 years old. In mid-August an estimated 1.3 million of these astonishing giant yuccas perished in the lightning-ignited Dome Fire. &nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not the first time that the Eastern Mojave Desert has burned, a megafire in 2005 scorched 1 million acres of desert, but it spared the Dome, the heart of the forest. Desert plants, unlike California oaks and chaparral, are not fire-adapted, so their recovery is an open question. The invasion of an alien bunch grass, known as Red Brome, has created a flammable understory to the Joshuas and transformed the Mojave into a fire ecology. (Invasive cheatgrass has played this role in the Great Basin for decades.) More frequent fires will accelerate vegetation change and ultimately threaten the existence of the trees.</p>



<p>Our burning deserts are regional expressions of a global trend. A world set on fire by climate change has unleashed a dangerous transformation of plant ecology, and thus faunal populations, from the Arctic to Patagonia, Montana to Mongolia. &nbsp;California is a paradigmatic example of such a vicious circle, where extreme heat leads to extreme fires that prevent natural rejuvenation and accelerate the conversion of iconic landscapes into depauperate grasslands and treeless mountain slopes.</p>



<p>At the beginning of this century, water planners and fire authorities were primarily focused on the threat of multi-year droughts caused by intensified La Niña episodes and stubbornly persistent high pressure domes—both of which could be attributed to anthropogenic warming.</p>



<p>Their worst fears were realized in the great drought of the last decade, the biggest in perhaps 500 years, which led to the death of millions of oaks and pines, which then provided fuel for the fire-storms in 2018 and 2019.</p>



<p>These recent catastrophes, however, have forced scientists to recognize a new phenomenon, the &nbsp;“hot drought.” Even in years with average 20th-century rainfall, extreme summer heat—our new normal—is producing massive water loss through evaporation in reservoirs and plant communities. A wet winter and early spring may mesmerize us with extravagant displays of flowering plants, but they also produce bumper crops of grasses and weeds that are then baked in our furnace summers to become fire starter when the devil winds return.</p>



<p>Residential development in high and extreme fire-danger areas, where a majority of new housing in the state has been constructed over the past twenty years, has also promoted the botanical counter-revolution as the thinning of forests and the clearing of chapparal opens new pathways for pyromaniacal black mustards and bromes. Weeds plus dead or drought-stressed trees is the shorthand formula for megafire.</p>



<p>Mediterranean vegetation (California west of the Sierras and south of Klamaths) has co-evolved with fire, and indeed oaks and most chaparral plants require episodic fire to reproduce. But routine extreme fire in Greece, Spain, Australia and California is now over-riding Holocene adaptations and producing irreversible changes in the biota. The only real constraint on future wildfire is available fuel mass. More areas will become like the Malibu Coast where fire burns in the same sector every decade or two as dictated by the 8-12 years required for coastal sage scrub to mature.</p>



<p>In the late 1940s the ruins of Berlin became a laboratory where natural scientists studied plant succession in the wake of three years of incessant fire bombing. The expectation was that the original vegetation of the region—oak woodlands and their shrubs—would soon reestablish itself. To their horror this was not the case. Instead escaped exotics, most of them alien to Germany, established themselves as the new dominants.</p>



<p>The botanists continued their studies until the last bomb sites were cleared in the 1980s. The persistence of this dead-zone vegetation and the failure of the plants of the Pomeranian woodlands to reestablish themselves prompted a debate about “Nature II.” The contention was that the extreme heat of incendiaries and the pulverization of brick structures had created a new soil type that invited colonization by plants such as the “tree of heaven” (<em>Ailanthus</em>) that had evolved on the moraines of Pleistocene ice sheets. An all-out nuclear war, they warned, might reproduce these conditions on a vast scale.</p>



<p>Fire in the Anthropocene has become the physical equivalent of endless nuclear war. In the aftermath of Victoria’s Black Saturday fires in early 2009, Australian scientists calculated that their released energy equaled the explosion of 1,500 Hiroshima-sized bombs. The current firestorms in the Pacific states are many times larger, and we should compare their destructive power to the mega-tonnage of hundreds of hydrogen bombs.</p>



<p>A new, profoundly sinister nature is rapidly emerging from our fire rubble at the expense of landscapes we once considered sacred. Our imaginations can barely encompass the speed or scale of the catastrophe. Gone California, gone.</p>

  <p>A while ago, the camera on my phone started acting up: opening it would show an image for a couple seconds but then go black. Simultaneously, when I turned my wireless headphones on there would be a couple seconds of sidetone (hearing through your own microphone) before it cut to the expected silence.</p>

<p>I promptly got a new phone and the old one was sent to forensics.</p>

<p>A little while after that, my stereo receiver started randomly losing its internet connection, causing streaming from Spotify to break. If I reset it to factory settings – and retrained the room calibration, speaker configuration, etc – it would come back, but within a week it would decide to give up on internet connectivity once again.</p>

<p>All of this was both frustrating and unnerving. We’ve become inured to the poor reliability and security of modern electronics – they are simply too complicated – and one thing I’ve had a hard time reconciling is my feeling that we <em>have</em> to do better with the reality that most things do not experience a strong economic pressure to do so. It is extraordinarily expensive to develop avionics software and other similar safety-critical things, and this is a sign to me both that the fundamental toolchain is broken and that most consumers simply don’t care. Even after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_of_Personnel_Management_data_breach">OPM hack</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_National_Committee_cyber_attacks">DNC cyberattacks</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2017_Equifax_data_breach">Equifax breach</a>, and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Pictures_hack">Sony Pictures hack</a> still no one has developed any good firewalls I would actually trust with my life. They are all too complex, composed of millions of lines of unproven code written by humans.</p>

<p>Fundamentally, I see the problem as being the fact that the space of things a system <em>can</em> do being a tiny subset of things the systems is <em>physically capable</em> of doing.</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>There is no meaningful difference between buggy software and insecure software – security vulnerabilities are just bugs used for a malicious intent. In order to build truly secure systems, we must shrink the space of things the machine is capable of doing to things we want it to do and formally prove this.</p>

<p>It is enormously difficult to formally verify a program of any meaningful size. One common approach – used by some autopilots, among other things – is to write a model DSL and a small code generator that is feasible to formally verify, and then use that to generate the much larger source code of the actual program, which by extension is verified. This is a good idea and I’d love to see things like this used more widely.</p>

<p>Another approach is to use a language with lots of safety features like strong algebraic typing, immutable memory and no dynamic allocation. These are often functional languages and can go a long way towards making it so that if it compiles, it’s probably correct.</p>

<p>Ultimately you also need awareness of the hardware you are running on: no one was talking about speculative execution attacks five years ago, but now they’re just one example of practical attacks stemming from complex hardware performance optimizations.</p>

<p>I’m a big fan of <a href="https://sel4.systems/">SeL4</a> and especially its verified <a href="https://riscv.org/2020/06/sel4-is-verified-on-risc-v/">RISCV implementation</a>. Yes, RISCV made some microarchitecture trade-offs that are somewhat academically pure at a cost to practicality, but for something like a brain implant you definitely want to prioritize making the intended-behavior and possible-behavior bubbles as close to equal as possible.</p>

<p>The cryptocurrency world also feels these issues acutely: bugs in smart contracts quickly become large financial losses. Long term, I think the investments they are making into formal verification could be one of their largest contributions back to the broader ecosystem.</p>

<p>These problems are all things Neuralink is going to have to invest in over time in order to ensure that the implants are reliable and secure. We will probably need to go way beyond traditional guidelines like MISRA and develop more powerful formal verification tools and code generation for verified hardware, but I think that’s only the tip of the iceberg towards systems that I’d really trust to put in my brain and connect to an increasingly hostile internet. There definitely needs to be much greater investment in these kinds of things, and hopefully an ecosystem develops that explores many possible approaches in parallel.</p>

    <p>First, I want to make it clear that I’m not accusing the compositor of true evil, which I define roughly as deliberately causing suffering. There’s unfortunately too much of that in the world. I mean it in the more metaphorical sense that it causes serious problems and forces other parts of the system to be more complex to work around its limitations.</p>

<p>I will also outline a better design that might be implemented in the future, as well as some possibilities for how applications can deal with the current situation. But first, to understand better how we got into this mess, we’ll look a bit into the past.</p>

<h2 id="8-bit-systems-video-processing-engines">8-bit systems: video processing engines</h2>

<p>Early home computers and video games had 8-bit CPUs and only a few kilobytes of RAM. Some computers, like the Apple II, allocated some of the RAM as a frame buffer and used the CPU to fill it, but this approach is quite limiting. So designers of most other systems of the time got creative - in particular, they augmented the CPU with a graphics processing engine. This engine did a fair amount of processing during <em>scanout,</em> in other words on the fly as the system generated a video signal.</p>

<p>The details of these early graphics processors varied, but most were a combination of four basic operations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Indirect lookup of tile images (also useful for text).</li>
  <li>Expansion of low bit depth pixels into more colors through a palette.</li>
  <li>Control over the offset in video memory to read (for scrolling effects).</li>
  <li>Overlay of small graphic elements (sprites).</li>
</ul>

<p>The combination of even a modest CPU and one of these video processing engines led to a creative explosion of games, with a unique aesthetic formed from the primitives provided by the video chip: colorful scrolling backgrounds formed from tiles, with the player avatar and other characters overlaid, also moving dynamically. One of the most popular (and best documented) such chips is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_VIC-II">C64 VIC-II</a>, and of course the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picture_Processing_Unit">NES PPU</a> is another classic example. People still create software for these beloved systems, learning from tutorials such as <a href="https://dustlayer.com/vic-ii/2013/4/22/when-visibility-matters">VIC-II for beginners</a>.</p>

<p>While the constraints of the hardware served as artistic inspiration for a diverse and impressive corpus of games, they also limited the kind of visual expression that was possible. For example, any attempt at 3D was primitive at best (though there were driving games that did impressive attempts, using the scrolling and color palette mechanisms to simulate a moving roadway).</p>

<p>The most ambitious games and demos agressively poked at the hardware, “racing the beam” to dynamically manipulate the registers in the video chip, unlocking more colors and other graphical effects that no doubt were not even anticipated by the original designers of the hardware.</p>

<p>Also worth mentioning as an extreme example is the Atari 2600, which had all of 20 bits (that’s right, two and a half bytes) devoted to what might be considered a frame buffer. Basically all graphical effects needed to be implemented by racing the beam. Fortunately, the programmer could make use of the deterministic cycle counts for instructions on the 6502 microprocessor, so that writes to the video registers would happen with timing considerably finer than one scan line. Even so, it requires some <a href="https://gist.github.com/anonymous/67b32347d5ca97d21a4c9e69a3b1a1a3">fairly tricky code</a> to even display the <a href="https://8bitworkshop.com/v3.6.0/embed.html?p=vcs&amp;r=TFpHAAAQAAAAAR1Ufls8AQMFDBJ42KIAiqjKmkjQ%2B6kOhQKFAErQ%2Ba2EAgyGCanGhQaFB6kAhQipGIUKDI%2BiJYUCytD7hgGgB4YNhg6GD4UCBADqEg%2BFEIURhQKI0PugEKIMeQ2FDrki8YUPuVXxhRu5ZfGFBLkz8YUNuUTxhQ4MFww%2BytDYuQAMSxEMCwyk6uoFDhyI0LKgOAUERgzH%2B6kChQGpIYUCjZYCBQOXTAvwABIeEgb8rFz4wPwE9BIDBPwAAPCgUPAw8ADwEgMA8AAAwMDAgADAQBIFwAUJNGwAqAULRDcSIRIR%2FxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh8SHxIfEh4SHBIIAPAA8A%3D%3D">Recurse Center logo</a> in all three colors.</p>

<p>An important aspect of all these systems, even those as underpowered as the Atari 2600, is that latency was <em>very</em> low. A well coded game might process the inputs during the vertical blanking interval, updating scroll and sprite coordinates (just a few register pokes), so they apply to the next frame being scanned out - latency under 16ms. Similar math applies to the latency of typing, which is why the Apple IIe <a href="https://danluu.com/input-lag/">scores so well</a> on latency tests compared to modern computers.</p>

<h2 id="16-and-32-bit-home-computers-cpu--framebuffer">16 and 32 bit home computers: CPU + framebuffer</h2>

<p>Through the late 80s, while arcade games continued to evolve their graphics hardware, the IBM PC became ascendant as a home computer. From its roots as a “business” computer, its CPU performance and RAM grew dramatically, but video output was generally a framebuffer with almost none of the capabilities listed above. Even so, display resolutions and bit depths improved (VGA was 640x480 with 16 colors per pixel). A reasonably powerful CPU, especially in the hands of an expert coder, can produce rather impressive graphics. An example is Microsoft Flight Simulator, which had 3D graphics, fully drawn in software.</p>

<p>Another landmark release was the original Doom, released in 1993, which also was entirely software-rendered graphics, complete with lighting and textures.</p>

<p>The rendering of UI and 2D graphics continued to evolve during this time as well, with proportional spaced fonts becoming the standard, and <a href="http://www.truetype-typography.com/ttalias.htm">antialiased font rendering</a> slowly becoming standard as well during the 90s. (Likely the <a href="https://telcontar.net/Misc/GUI/RISCOS/#text">Acorn Archimedes</a> was the first to ship with antialiased text rendering, around 1992)</p>

<h2 id="multiple-windows-and-process-separation">Multiple windows and process separation</h2>

<p>A trend at the same time was the ability to run multiple applications, each with their own window. While the idea had been around for a while, it burst on to the scene with the Macintosh, and the rest of the world caught up shortly after.</p>

<p>Early implementations did <em>not</em> have “preemptive multitasking,” or what we would call process separation. Applications, even when running in windowed mode, wrote directly into the framebuffer. The platform basically provided a library for applications to keep track of visible regions, so they wouldn’t paint in regions where the window was occluded. Related, when an occluding window went away, the system would notify the application it needed to repaint (WM_PAINT on Windows), and, because computers were slow and this took a while, the “damage region” was visible for a bit (this is explained and animated in Jasper St. Pierre’s <a href="https://magcius.github.io/xplain/article/x-basics.html">X Window System Basics</a> article).</p>

<p>In this early version of windowing GUI, latency wasn’t seriously affected. Some things were slower because resolution and bit depth was going up, and of course text needed to be rendered into bitmaps (more computationally expensive with antialiasing), but a well-written application could still be quite responsive.</p>

<p>However, running without process separation was a serious problem, if for no other reason than the fact that a misbehaving application could corrupt the entire system; consumer desktop systems were seriously behind the Unix/X11 ecosystem in this regard. System crashes were extremely common in the days of pre-X Mac OS, and pre-NT Windows (though Windows 95 had a limited form of process separation in that the display server bounded the window’s drawing area). Certainly in the Unix tradition, applications would run in their own process, with some kind of client-server protocol to combine the presentation of the multiple applications together. The X System (aka X11) came to dominate in Unix, but before that there were many other proposals, notably <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">Blit</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blit_(computer_terminal)">NeWS</a>. Also common to the Unix tradition, these would commonly run across a network.</p>

<h2 id="apples-aqua-compositor">Apple’s Aqua compositor</h2>

<p>When <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mac_OS_X_10.0">OS X</a> (now macOS) first shipped in 2001, it was visually striking in a number of ways. Notably for this discussion, the contents of windows were blended with full alpha transparency and soft shadows. At the heart of this was a <em>compositor.</em> Applications did not draw directly to the screen, but to off-screen buffers which were then composited using a special process, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz_Compositor">Quartz Compositor</a>.</p>

<p>In the first version, all the drawing and compositing was done in software. Since machines at the time weren’t particularly powerful, performance was bad. According to a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2011/05/mac-os-x-revisited/2/">retrospective review</a>, “in its initial incarnation, Aqua was unbearably slow and a huge resource hog.”</p>

<p>Even so, things improved. By 10.2 (Jaguar) in August 2002, Quartz Extreme did the compositing in the GPU, finally making performance comparable to pre-compositor designs.</p>

<p>While there have been changes (discussed in some detail below), Quartz Compositor is fundamentally the modern compositor design used today. Microsoft Vista adopted a similar design with <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dwm/dwm-overview">DWM</a>, first in Vista, and made non-optional by Windows 8. Also, while I consider Aqua the first real <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compositing_window_manager">compositor</a> in the modern sense, there were important predecessors, notably the Amiga. Jasper St. Pierre points out that Windows 2000 had a limited compositor, known as <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/window-features#layered-windows">“layered windows”</a>, where certain windows could be redirected offscreen.</p>

<h2 id="doing-more-in-the-compositor">Doing more in the compositor</h2>

<p>Using the GPU to just bitblt window contents is using a tiny fraction of its capabilities. In the compositing process, it could be fading in and out alpha transparency, sliding subwindows around, and applying other effects without costing much at all in performance (the GPU is already reading all the pixels from the offscreen buffers and writing to the display surface). The only trick is exposing these capabilities to the application.</p>

<p>On the Apple side, this was driven by iOS and its heavy reliance on <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/quartzcore">Core Animation</a>. The idea is that “layers” can be drawn using relatively slow software rendering, then scrolling and many other effects can be done smoothly at 60fps by compositing these layers in the GPU.</p>

<p>Core Animation was also made available in Mac OS 10.5 (Leopard). The corresponding Windows version was <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/directcomp/directcomposition-portal">DirectComposition</a>, introduced in Windows 8 and a core feature of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metro_(design_language)">Metro</a> design language (which was not very popular at the time).</p>

<p>These features have made the compositor more integral to modern GUI software, though there is a range of how aggressively applications make use of compositor feature.</p>

<h2 id="where-does-the-latency-come-from">Where does the latency come from?</h2>

<p>I talk a lot about latency, but let’s understand why introducing the compositor fundamentally adds so much of it. Some of this is also discussed in the blog post <a href="http://www.lofibucket.com/articles/dwm_latency.html">Desktop compositing latency is real and it annoys me</a> (also see <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15747650">HN discussion</a>).</p>

<p>The amount of time needed to render a frame of content varies. If the goal is smooth 60fps (as I think it should be!) then …</p></div></article></div></div></div>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/aliens.jpg" width="200px">Stretching it a bit thin so forgive my “silly” typo, and let’s mention <code>alignas</code> (which when squinting hard enough you might just read as <code>aliens</code>) and its kin. The <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/alignas"><code>alignas</code> keyword specifier</a> was introduced in C++11. It specifies the <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/object#Alignment">alignment requirement</a> of a type or an object.</p>

<p><em>Every object type has the property called alignment requirement, which is an integer value (of type <code>std::size_t</code> and always a power of 2) representing the number of bytes between successive addresses at which objects of this type can be allocated. The alignment requirement of a type can be queried with <code>alignof</code> or <code>std::alignment_of</code>. The pointer alignment function <code>std::align</code> can be used to obtain a suitably-aligned pointer within some buffer, and <code>std::aligned_storage</code> can be used to obtain suitably-aligned storage. Each object type imposes its alignment requirement on every object of that type; stricter alignment (with larger alignment requirement) can be requested using <code>alignas</code>. In order to satisfy alignment requirements of all non-static members of a class, padding may be inserted after some of its members.</em></p>

<h3 id="-demons">👹 Demons</h3>
<p><em>“Permissible undefined behavior ranges from ignoring the situation completely with unpredictable results, to having <strong>demons</strong> fly out of your nose.”<br>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/demon.jpg" width="200px"> The most notorious and infamous of all is probably the Nasal Demon of <strong>Undefined Behavior</strong>.<br>
With its ancient origins in the C language, it predates many of the other members of this list. Nevertheless, it is still an ever present threat and terror to the unsuspecting journeyman.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/ub">short</a>, <em>Undefined Behavior (UB)</em> renders the <em>entire</em> program meaningless if certain rules of the language are violated.</p>

<p>A lot has been written about UB. <a href="https://twitter.com/johnregehr">John Regehr</a> has a facinating <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/213">series on UB</a> and an <a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1520">update on Undefined Behavior in 2017</a> too.

<p>That is, the compiled program executes <code>rm -rf /</code> even though the original program never calls <code>EraseAll()</code>! However, Clang is allowed to do this since the function pointer <code>Do</code> is initialized to <code>0</code> as it is a static variable, and calling <code>0</code> invokes undefined behavior – but it may seem strange that the compiler chooses to generate this code. It does, however, follow naturally from how compilers analyze programs…</p>

<h3 id="-dll-hell">👿 DLL Hell</h3>
<p><em>“There is no greater sorrow then to recall our times of joy in wretchedness.”<br>
― Dante Alighieri, Inferno</em></p>

<div><p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/hell.jpg" width="200px"> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DLL_Hell">DLL Hell</a> is a term for the complications that arise when working with dynamic link libraries (DLLs) used with Microsoft Windows operating systems.<br>
DLL Hell can manifest itself in many different ways in which applications do not launch or work correctly. Like Dante’s Inferno <a href="http://historylists.org/art/9-circles-of-hell-dantes-inferno.html">Circles of Hell</a>, DLL Hell is the Windows ecosystem-specific form of the general concept <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_hell">Dependency Hell</a>.</p></div>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/duckula.jpg" width="200px"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing"><em>Duck typing</em></a> is an application of <em>The Duck Test</em> in type safety.<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_test"><em>The Duck Test</em></a> is a form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abductive_reasoning"><em>abductive reasoning</em></a>.<br>
This is its usual expression:</p>

<p><em>If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck.</em></p>

<div><p>“Classic” Duck Typing requires that type checking be deferred to runtime and is mostly relevant to dynamically typed languages (unlike C++). However, templates or generic functions or methods apply the duck test in a <em>static</em> typing context.  </p><p>

In fact, one of the main reasons for C++ Concepts (if/when) they finally land, is to bring a more disciplined approach to template type specification and … well..</p></div>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/ufo.jpg" width="200px">C++20 may see the invasion of a new operator into the language:<br>
<strong>The &lt;=&gt; Spaceship Operator!</strong><br>
This is a single, 3-way comparison, <code>&lt;=&gt;</code> operator, that once defined allows the compiler to automatically generate all other comparison operators: <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>!=</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>. It provides a consistent interface and support for partial ordering and other goodies.</p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/shadow.jpg" width="200px"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_shadowing">Variable shadowing</a> occurs when a variable declared within a certain scope (e.g a block, a function) has the same name as a variable declared in an outer scope. The outer variable is said to be shadowed by the inner variable, while the inner identifier is said to mask the outer identifier. This can lead to confusion, as it may be unclear which variable subsequent uses of the shadowed variable name refer to, which depends on the name resolution rules of the language. In each scope, the same name or identifier may refer to a different variable with a completely different type.<br>
Variable shadowing is by no means limited to C++.</p>

<p><img src="http://videocortex.io/assets/Halloween/terminator.jpg" width="200px">C++ provides surprisingly numerous ways for a program to terminate. These include both normal and unexpected termination.<br>
When writing robust software and libraries, it is important to be be aware of the various ways your code might abruptly end. Similarly, many of these conditions might occur at module-boundaries such as DLLs.<br>
Amongst the standard C++ program terminators we find: multiple flavors of <code>std::exit()</code>, <code>std::abort()</code>, <code>std::terminate()</code>, <code>std::signal()</code> and <code>std::raise()</code>.</p>

<p><em>Remove the uncertainty of landing a tech job</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1965/1*5xfPSnQSMO15rfdGM8g95g.jpeg" alt="Image for post"></figure>



<p id="e8ac">If you’re here, you want to land a technical role, but you’re not sure what to do next. Do you get a specific certification? What tools or software do you need to pick up? You want to know you can land an incredible job that pays well, allows you to learn, and stand among fellow techies. Yet, you’re uncertain right now and unsure if your technical skills are at the level companies want. The last thing you want is for a hiring manager to look at your resume and immediately toss it out. Even worse, he might laugh at how bad your technical skills are.</p>



<p id="8fac">Right now you’re most likely dealing with impostor syndrome, uncertainty, and a bit of intimidation-that’s okay. The path to learning a technical skill is difficult and laborious. But it’ll be worth it. Here’s something else you need to know:</p>



<blockquote><p>Your self-doubt and uncertainty aren’t “part of the journey”, they also convey you know you have more to learn, you’re humble, and you’re open to constructive criticism. Your self-doubt and uncertainty indicate forthcoming success.</p></blockquote>



<p id="1729">Right now, your greatest obstacle is overcoming impostor syndrome. The rest of this article unpacks how to gain more experience, but those tips will sound like fluff if you aren’t able to effectively manage your self-doubt.</p>



<p id="aabf">You’re hard work speaks for itself. You’ve mulled through and completed several programming courses, you’ve become a regular on Stack Overflow, and you’re genuinely interested in building a technical skill set. You are willing to do whatever it takes to land that technical role.</p>



<p id="92b4">Here are two questions to ask yourself if you want to know you’re headed in the right direction:</p>



<ul><li>Have you solved problems outside of your learning context?</li><li>Can you communicate what you’re learning in the simplest of terms?</li></ul>



<p id="8a9f">Results don’t lie. You’re on the right path if you’re producing results outside of a tutorial and you feel comfortable talking through your subject matter.</p>







<p id="bfe6">You’ve put in the hard work and you’re ready to land your first technical job offer. The only foreseeable problem is that you have zero years of technical experience. Here are three practical ways to overcome the “0 years of experience” obstacle, garner interviews, and land your first technical job:</p>



<h2 id="6a19">Create Your Own Role</h2>



<p id="85c8">I want you to think about all the hard work you’ve put in thus far. You’ve internalized syntax by completing courses, you’ve increased critical thinking and business acumen by solving real and interesting problems, and you can speak to a diverse number of stakeholders because you understand your subject matter. The hard work you’ve done up to this point&nbsp;<em>has</em>&nbsp;been a job, but no one has paid you for your work. But that’s about to change.</p>



<p id="77d9">I encourage you to try something. Go to your LinkedIn and add a new experience. Use the job title of the role you’re trying to land (i.e. Analyst, Data Analyst, Software Engineer, etc…) and use the company name “Various”. For the description, this is where you show a bit of creativity. As you think about the last year, what have you done? If you completed a project, what did you produce and what were the results? As you complete your description, it’s important you use keywords that represent what you’ve worked on and relevant to the job you want. The reason is that the keywords will increase your profile’s visibility to companies and tell recruiters you’ve done serious work that will translate to the role they’re looking to hire for. If you get stuck or need an example to reference, check out my LinkedIn profile&nbsp;<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/daniel-chae11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>



<h2 id="5abb">Find a Temporary Contract Role</h2>



<p id="811c">Temporary contract roles are one of the most overlooked means of gaining experience. Many companies don’t have enough work or resources to hire a full-time software engineer, analyst, or data scientist so they look to hire a short-term contractor. I encourage you to use this to your advantage. Contract roles are perfect for people who want to gain experience because companies who hire for contract roles have very specific end goals in mind. As a result, you will work on very valuable and high-impact projects with clear deliverables. The best part? You also get paid.</p>



<p id="ed3f">If you’re interested in a contract role, visit LinkedIn, Indeed, or ZipRecruiter and look for roles listed as “temporary”, “six month contract”, “contractor”, or “temp”. You’ll find many contract listings mention the contract can turn into a full-time position. Either way, when the contract ends, you will walk away with valuable experience.</p>



<h2 id="d684">Pay Me, Dustin Moskovitz-Style</h2>



<p id="6e88">When “the” Facebook started out, Dustin Moskovitz was one of the company’s first employees and didn’t get paid. He worked completely for free. During the start of Facebook, he picked up PHP and hustled his way towards adding value to “the” Facebook. Moskovitz defined the meaning of “sweat equity”. Now he’s a multi-millionaire.</p>



<p id="6f6f">In a world that worships the full-time salary, benefits, and perks, we forget about the quintessential startup staple: the unpaid hustle. Would you be willing to work for free if your unpaid work meant invaluable experience?</p>

  <p><em>As always, this post reflects my own opinions, and not anyone else’s. I have made every effort to be factual, but corrections are welcome.</em></p>
<p>A preview <a href="https://github.com/snes9xgit/snes9x/issues/586#issuecomment-552733913">build</a> of the Snes9x emulator is now available for macOS Catalina. This build is missing many features, but is capable of opening games, playing them with keyboard or gamepad, and freezing and defrosting game states. This post will explain how the Mac port of Snes9x got to this point and outline how it might develop in the future.</p>
<p>Snes9x is an emulator with a long history. First released in 1998, (according to Wikipedia) a Mac port was created by John Stiles and released the same year. This port was PowerPC native, and used the Macintosh Toolbox API. In 2000, it was updated to use the Carbon API, allowing it to run on classic MacOS, as well as OS X. From 2001 to 2011, a developer calling themselves “zones”, with contributions from others, continued to update it and add features. Thanks to their work, it made the transition to Intel Macs, where it continued to work until the release of macOS Catalina.</p>
<p>The Carbon API was created by Apple to be a transitional API, allowing applications written using the Macintosh Toolbox API to run on both classic MacOS and OS X. It shared many similarities to the Macintosh Toolbox, making it easy to transition applications to OS X. The intention was to allow developers time to gradually port their code to OS X’s native Cocoa API. Because developers could use Cocoa and Carbon in the same app, Apple hoped that developers would replace parts of their code piecemeal, like a software ship of Theseus.</p>
<p>Despite a massive engineering investment by Apple, this approach often did not work well. Although Carbon was intended to be a transitionary technology, many classic MacOS apps made use of functionality present in Carbon that was not available in Cocoa until years later. Because of this, some developers were choosing Carbon for their new apps even after OS X had already supplanted classic MacOS. Cocoa and Carbon also approached solving certain problems in philosophically incompatible ways, making it difficult or impossible for some apps to adopt the piecemeal strategy. Even apps that wanted to introduce Cocoa gradually had to wait a few years for their userbase to migrate to OS X.</p>
<p>When this approach worked well, it was often for single-platform native Mac software. Cross-platform software often remained on Carbon for much longer. This is partly due to the fact that the Carbon API was more similar to the Win32 API, both in structure and philosophy, than Cocoa was, and that Carbon software was written in the same language, C++, as most major apps on Windows at the time. Cocoa was written in Objective-C, which is still almost exclusively used on Apple platforms.</p>
<p>Snes9x, being cross-platform, was no exception to this rule. Emulators and games often need complete control over the application’s main loop, something which Carbon provides, but which has historically been difficult with Cocoa. It has become easier to write games and emulators in Cocoa over the years, but when zones left in 2011, things were just beginning to improve in that area.</p>
<p>Because the transition was taking so long, many developers felt no urgency to move to Cocoa, even into the early 2010s. Microsoft Office 2011 (released in late 2010) was a Carbon product. Photoshop made the transition to Cocoa in 2010, but much of the Adobe Creative Suite was still Carbon. Even Apple’s own cross-platform app, iTunes, was also using Carbon. Because of widespread belief that Apple invested so much in Carbon for the sake of these three software packages, some believed that Carbon would become a permanent fixture of OS X. It was true that Apple had announced in 2007 that Carbon would not be ported to 64-bit, despite promising to do so in 2006, but it had also been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2007/06/just-the-facts-maam-64-bit-carbon/">reported</a> that this was  more of a marketing decision than a technical one. After all, most of Carbon had already been ported to 64-bit, and this was present in public releases of OS X. It was assumed Apple had the rest of it ported internally, and it was possible they would reverse their decision for 64-bit Microsoft Office. Even if Apple stayed the course and deprecated Carbon, there was so much Carbon software out there that they would have to give plenty of warning before they removed it.</p>
<p>As it turned out, Apple announced that they were deprecating Carbon in 2012, and did not remove it until 2019 with macOS Catalina. This was plenty of time for a Cocoa rewrite of Snes9x, but zones had already stepped away from the project, and during that time, little work was done on the Mac port.</p>
<p>This is not a criticism of zones or the other developers who volunteered their time to work on Snes9x. Like many emulators, Snes9x is an open-source project that relies on the work of volunteers, who come and go as they gain and lose interest in the project. There have been other periods in Snes9x’s history that the Mac version went years without substantial updates, and the project was unlucky that no one was interested in a Cocoa rewrite during this period.</p>
<p>I began working on Snes9x earlier this year because I wanted to add a debugger to the Mac port. For the past few years, I have become interested in SNES homebrew development. I grew up with the SNES, and I wanted to prove to myself that I was capable of writing a complete game in assembly, the way developers did back then. It’s pure vanity on my part, but I want to prove to myself that I could have succeeded as a programmer on older hardware. In retrospect, it probably would have been more efficient to do homebrew development on Windows, where there are already tools available.</p>
<p>Since Snes9x was still a 32-bit app on macOS, I knew my first task would be to update it to 64-bit. I’d worked on other 32-to-64 bit transitions in the past, but what I didn’t realize when I volunteered to update it was that Snes9x was still using Carbon. Part of me wanted to give up right there, knowing that it would be a large undertaking to rewrite the app using Cocoa, but as far as I knew, no one else was lining up to do the work, and when I thought about it, a Mac without Snes9x didn’t sit right with me. Snes9x has been on the Mac for 21 years, since the early days of the emulator. As strange as it sounds, I’m nostalgic for the emulator, not just for the old games, but for the software itself.</p>
<p>After spending many evening and weekend hours working on the Carbon port over the summer and fall, ignoring my homebrew ambitions in the process, I finally got to the point where the emulator can play games on Catalina. However, the Mac port of Snes9x acquired many features over its 13 years of active development, and there was no way I was going to be able to re-implement them all in a few months in my spare time. As a result, the port contains about as many features as the first Mac release I know of, version 0.95, from 1998. Seeing all those features vanish feels really bad.</p>
<p>While I would like to restore the Mac port of Snes9x to its former glory, it’s a large undertaking, and I’m not sure it’s worth the time. Many of Snes9x’s features are niche or outdated, and I’m not sure anyone even uses them anymore. For example, is the music box useful when there are dedicated SPC players? Similarly, while the netplay feature works, it’s never been great. Something like Steam’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/remoteplay/">Remote Play</a> feature might work better on modern Macs.</p>
<p>But without more features, I don’t see what role the Mac port of Snes9x has in the modern Mac emulation landscape. Although the Mac has a larger userbase than ever before, a much smaller percentage are interested in emulation, especially for an older system like the SNES, and that audience may be better served by other emulators.</p>
<p><a href="https://openemu.org/">OpenEmu</a> is more polished and easier to use. It’s been better maintained these last 8 years, and it even has an Snes9x core. It’s designed to be easy for people to pick and play games quickly, which is what most emulator users want in the first place.</p>
<p>On the other end of the spectrum, there’s <a href="https://bsnes.byuu.org/">bsnes</a>. Aside from having the most accurate SNES emulation available today, bsnes has most of the features that Snes9x has and OpenEmu doesn’t, like a cheat finder and movie recording/replay. These features are great for enthusiasts, speedrunners, and homebrew developers. And while bsnes does not look or feel native on macOS, it works well enough.</p>
<p>To be fair, Snes9x contains features that bsnes does not, like 8-player support and the ability to toggle graphics layers. However, there’s an argument to be made that I should instead be working on adding a debugger and other homebrew features to bsnes rather than porting Snes9x.</p>
<p>And yet, I can’t shake the feeling that Snes9x should be on the Mac. So many great Mac applications have been lost over the years, and it would be a shame to add Snes9x to that list after such a long run. Although its emulation may not be as accurate as bsnes’s, its hardware requirements are much more modest. It can run well on models such as the MacBook Air and the base 13-inch MacBook Pro, which have difficulty running bsnes. It also uses much less battery power on all MacBooks. The SNES homebrew community is so small that it would be a shame to turn away potential developers because they are using lower-powered Mac hardware. I would also like to use a more pleasant, Mac-like interface, even if it’s not as polished as OpenEmu.</p>
<p>But honestly, I don’t know if I’ll have the time to complete the work. I would like to restore the other input peripherals, (e.g. SNES mouse, Super Scope) cheat functionality, and recording, as well as add a debugger, but that’s not just a lot of coding work, it’s also a lot of design work. Take, for example, the keyboard settings screen. Here’s what the screen looks like in the latest Carbon version of Snes9x.</p>

<p>There are a lot of things I like about this design. It’s visual, and it enforces a 1-to-one mapping of keys to inputs. It won’t allow you …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Tesla CEO Musk once again attracted media attention. His brain-computer tech Neuralink technology began to implant chips in a live pig.</p>
<p>Before that, I once proposed my own whimsical idea to my friends: people might be able to live forever. This immortality does not refer to the superhuman creatures in science fiction movies, but to the information technology to copy all human brain information into computers. I am not the only one who thinks like this. The British drama "Black Mirror" and the American drama "Uploading Freshmen" had written this idea into their plots.</p>
<p>Imagine what kind of experience it would be like if your memory and behavior are completely digitized, become part of the computer's code and you, strictly speaking, your copy lives in a virtual world forever. Let's not consider ethics for now, at least this virtual person can indeed do creative work 24 hours a day, which is currently irreplaceable by robots that only repeat tasks.</p>
<p>The biggest advantage of this kind of virtual technology is that human intelligence can continue accelerating iterative evolution without any reservation. As long as the iteration time is long enough, super civilization may be born.</p>
<p>This virtual person may also die unexpectedly, because any code has bugs.</p>
<p>特斯拉的 CEO 马斯克又一次引起媒体的关注。他的脑机技术开始把芯片植入猪的大脑。</p>
<p>在这之前，我曾经跟身边的人提出自己的奇思妙想：人或许能够永生。这种永生不是指科幻电影里的那种超人类生物，而是借助信息科技，把人的大脑信息写入电脑里。这并不是只有我一个人这样想，英剧《黑镜》和美剧《上载新生》早已经把这个想法写进剧情里。</p>
<p>试想一下，自己的记忆和行为完全数字化，并且你(严格来说是你的副本)成为电脑的代码的一部分而永远活在一个虚拟世界里，那将会是一种什么样的体验。暂且先不考虑伦理道德，至少这个虚拟人确实可以24 小时不间断地去做创造性的工作，这是目前只会重复劳动的机器人所无法替代的。</p>
<p>这种虚拟技术的最大好处是，人的智能可以毫无保留地延续下去，并且加速迭代进化，只要迭代的时间足够长，就可能诞生超级文明。</p>
<p>这个虚拟人也可能会意外死亡，因为任何代码都有 bug。</p>

September 13, 2020 | https://digitalbunker.dev/2020/09/13/understanding-gaussian-blurs/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://digitalbunker.dev/2020/09/13/understanding-gaussian-blurs/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<p>Let’s take a detailed look at the implementation behind Gaussian blurs. It’s the image processing algorithm that enables image manipulations like this:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.researchgate.net/publication/337080453/figure/fig5/AS:822588544647171@1573131800889/different-levels-of-Gaussian-Blur.jpg?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="different levels of Gaussian Blur | Download Scientific Diagram" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.researchgate.net/publication/337080453/figure/fig5/AS:822588544647171@1573131800889/different-levels-of-Gaussian-Blur.jpg?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>We’ll start by reviewing Gaussian distributions and image convolution – the driving forces behind Gaussian blurs. Then, we’ll implement our own Gaussian blur algorithm from scratch with Swift.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>If you haven’t already read my article about <a href="https://digitalbunker.dev/2020/08/28/how-does-edge-detection-work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">edge detection in images</a>, I’d recommend you read that first. It’ll help establish a foundation around convolution and the fundamentals of image processing.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<h2>Convolution</h2>
<p>In simple terms, convolution is simply the process of taking a small matrix called the kernel and running it over all the pixels in an image. At every pixel, we’ll perform some math operation involving the values in the convolution matrix and the values of a pixel and its surroundings to determine the value for a pixel in the output image. </p>
<div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/09348c5368/a55b1477-4f79-4221-8aa1-ab3ae9f01f89.png?w=1200&amp;ssl=1" alt="Blurring an Image | Apple Developer Documentation" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/docs-assets.developer.apple.com/published/09348c5368/a55b1477-4f79-4221-8aa1-ab3ae9f01f89.png?w=1200&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Image Convolution</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>By changing the values in the kernel, we can change the effect on the image – blurring, sharpening, edge detection, noise reduction, etc. </p>
<blockquote><p>Convolution will be clearer once we see an example.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Gaussian Distributions</h2>
<p>Next, let’s turn to the Gaussian part of the Gaussian blur. Gaussian blur is simply a method of blurring an image through the use of a Gaussian function. </p>
<blockquote><p>You may have heard the term Gaussian before in reference to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaussian distribution (a.k.a. normal distribution)</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Below, you’ll see a 2D Gaussian distribution. Notice that there is a peak in the center and the curve flattens out as you move towards the edges.&nbsp;</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/Q73cvNltSuV3L-IDuHO5FsvGLk75aMiO7r0XQq0eQlEdIybmgzxkafvlIUs8kjVzgga2O1kGjKINOOfVAwyJp5xWL_Dns0QKBp2jNVdrCVfiuGOztLyROPG1qOgjApO4U5l-8q8b" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>Imagine that this distribution is superimposed over a group of pixels in an image. It should be apparent looking at this graph, that if we took a weighted average of the pixel’s values and the height of the curve at that point, the pixels in the center of the group would contribute most significantly to the resulting value. This is, in essence, how Gaussian blur works.</p>
<blockquote><p>TLDR: A Gaussian blur is applied by convolving the image with a Gaussian function. </p></blockquote>
<p>In English, this means that we’ll take the Gaussian function and we’ll generate an <code>n x m</code> matrix. Using this matrix and the height of the Gaussian distribution at that pixel location, we’ll compute new RGB values for the blurred image.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>To start off, we’ll need the Gaussian function in two dimensions:&nbsp;</p>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/k3HBCpKjbajv6jtn47G4AiRSe7EaFJkdAE2tzyhk7Ka8a05Bn0ZUHROsvOQC9iY8GPu8nCit45OOE0bybFW1kzaJp23TDxoKZHnVTinkMs3jkslLIXC1vmk4UalsnoMRnItqQl0v" alt="" width="284" height="78" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>The values from this function will create the convolution matrix / kernel that we’ll apply to every pixel in the original image. The kernel is typically quite small – the larger it is the more computation we have to do at every pixel.&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>x</code> and <code>y</code> specify the delta from the center pixel (0, 0). For example, if the selected radius for the kernel was 3, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> would range from -3 to 3 (inclusive).&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><code>σ</code></em> – the standard deviation – influences how significantly the center pixel’s neighboring pixels affect the computations result.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><p>Technically, in a Gaussian function, because it extends infinitely, you could argue that you’d need to consider every pixel in the image to get the “correct” blur effect, but in practice pixels beyond 3<em>σ</em> have very little impact on the resulting values.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>We’re almost ready to start the implementation. </p>
<p>We’ll need to create a separate output image. We can’t modify the source image directly because changing the pixel values will mess up the math for the adjacent pixel’s computation in the next iteration. </p>
<p>Finally, we need to consider how we’ll handle the edges. If we were looking at the very first pixel in an image, the kernel would extend beyond the bounds of the image. As a result, implementations will commonly ignore the outer most set of pixels, duplicate the edge, or wrap the image around. </p>
<p>In our case, for ease of implementation, we’ll ignore it pixels on the edges.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let’s start with implementing the Gaussian function.&nbsp;The first task is to identify reasonable values for <code>x</code>, <code>y</code>, and <em><code>σ</code>. </em></p>
<p>While the kernel can technically be an arbitrary size, we should scale <em><code>σ</code> </em>in proportion to the kernel size. If we have a large kernel radius, but a small sigma, then all of the new pixels we’re introducing with our larger radius aren’t really affecting the computation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s an example of a large kernel radius, but a small sigma:&nbsp;</p>

<p>As opposed to Sigma 5, Kernel 111:</p>

<h2><strong>Code</strong></h2>
<p>To finish our implementation, we’ll also need to normalize the values in our kernel. Otherwise the image will become darker as the values will sum to slightly less than 1. Finally, we’ll need to make sure that the size of the kernel is odd to ensure that there is an actual center pixel.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The code below is by no means the fastest and favors clarity over brevity: </p>
<p>Here’s the full implementation in Swift:</p>

<p>Here are some of the results on a photo I captured amidst Yosemite’s fires last weekend: </p>

                <div><h4>Download Description:</h4>
                    <p>A major issue today is the centralized collection, maintenance, storage, and analysis of log and event data across a multitude of cloud systems and services, or even across disparate cloud providers and on-premise systems. With providers now offering a seemingly endless variety of monitoring solutions, obtaining a “single pane of glass” to consolidate analysis for all of your data can be quite challenging. However, leveraging Netizen's customized and fully managed hosted ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) based SIEM solutions, you can solve these issues with enterprise-grade functionality at a fraction of the cost (and complexity) of other products.</p>

<p>In this white paper, we show you how to accomplish all of this. Also available to enhance ELK's SIEM implementation and maintenance options is Netizen's fully-managed ELK hosting and support packages. Netizen's customized ELK-based products also include cutting-edge Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) features which are especially useful in highly complex environments.</p>

Our objective of evacuating 72 oil workers who were in Libya and desperately heading for the Algerian border was time critical.Â&nbsp; Gadaffi loyalists were in hot pursuit of them, either to kill them or more probably take them and use them as hostages, so how did it all come about?</p><p>It was late February and I was back at the Embassy in Algiers. I had just returned from Cairo where I was part of the UK consular team evacuating British residents. It was a pretty chaotic couple of weeks but we managed to get everybody out who reached Cairo.</p><p>It was the same in Tunisia a couple of weeks earlier. Again, we managed to get those UK citizens who wished to be evacuated out in a more timely and orderly fashion</p><p>Meanwhile, back in Algiers we were closely monitoring the situation that was developing in Libya. On 27 February, the UK mounted a military mission involving Royal Air Force (RAF) Hercules and Special Air Service (SAS) soldiers that flew into the Libyan desert and managed to evacuate 150 oil workers.</p><p>However, it was well known that a large number of foreign oil workers were still stranded in the south and west of the country.</p><p>The Ambassador immediately contacted London who agreed that we should try to mount an evacuation operation. This one would be a consular led mission as opposed to a military one and we had to move fast.</p><p>The latest intelligence we had on the oil workers was that they were heading for the Libyan town of Ghadames which lies on the Libyan/Algerian border.</p><p>It was decided that I would lead the mission and would be accompanied by Mustapha, one of our Embassy drivers who would act as interpreter, the British Defence Attache (a Colonel) and an armed Royal Military Policeman (RMP), one of the Ambassadorâ€™s close protection team.</p><p>The reason for the military presence would be their ability, using their special communications equipment, to liaise with UK military back in London for intelligence updates. I then visited the Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get their approval for the trip and to ask for accompanying security en-route.</p><p>For this mission, we had decided to drive.</p><p>It was a considerable distance, some 1300 Kms from Algiers to our proposed base of operations in the town of In-Amenas through the Atlas mountains and snaking through the northern Sahara desert. In addition, some of the provinces we would traverse were known to have active AQIM (Al Qaeda in the Maghreb) cells.</p><p>The Algerians agreed to provide security escorts for the whole of our trip and they did a wonderful job of looking after us the whole time.</p><div id="gallery-2"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/mydiplomaticlifethetruestories/100_0228_2/#main"><img width="292" height="219" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/100_0228_2.jpg?fit=292%2C219&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-2-1442" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/100_0228_2.jpg?fit=292%2C219&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-2-1442"> Libya</figcaption></figure><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/oil-workers-rescued-from-libya-just-in-time/img_0038/#main"><img width="500" height="375" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-2-1451" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0038.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-2-1451"> Route marker in the Sahara</figcaption></figure></div><p>Therefore it was with some trepidation we set off. The security situation and the areas we would have to travel through, even with our escorts was still a matter of concern. The time passed slowly as we drove through the Atlas mountains until finally we emerged from the mountains onto the desert plains.</p><p>By now it was late in the evening and dark as we reached the town of Ouargia where we spent the night.</p><p>The next morning at dawn, we set off for In-Amenas. Our aim was to head for the Sonatrach (the largest oil and gas company in Algeria who had agreed to help us) compound in the town, which would be our base for the duration of the operation.</p><p>Having arrived there and getting settled in, the Colonel contacted London who informed him that the oil workers had reached Ghadames, but the Libyan border guards would not let them cross the border until I had provided them with the official paperwork.</p><p>Further troubling news was that although Ghadames was in a Berber area,which had been actively anti-Gadaffi for years, pro-Gadaffi forces and militia were reported to be heading for the town in some force.

The spokesman for the group said they would not come across and leave their non-EU colleagues behind.</p><p>So instead of 16 evacuees we now had 72, a major consular headache.

To add to the urgency, I also received a call from the Colonel to say that we had to get the oil workers out within the next 24 hours as pro-Gadaffi forces were at that very moment nearing Ghadames. Time was critical.</p><p>So before dawn next morning we set off with my escort plus two coaches for Deb-Deb.</p><p>We arrived at lunchtime and I immediately got to work with the local Libyan and Algerian border officials to get clearance to bring the oil workers across the border.</p><p>After what seemed like an eternity, paperwork was signed off and permissions were granted from both sides and the guys finally crossed over into Algerian territory.</p><p>I was not prepared to hang about, so everyone was unceremoniously bundled onto the coaches and picking up the Colonel and the RMP we left Debdeb for In-Anemas.</p><p>After spending the night at the Sonatrach compound, the party headed for In-Anemas airport as I had been called from our Embassy in Algiers on reaching In-Amenas to say that the German parent company had chartered a flight for midday the next day.</p><div id="gallery-4"><figure><p><a href="https://www.mydiplomaticlife.com/oil-workers-rescued-from-libya-just-in-time/img_0019/#main"><img width="500" height="375" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" alt="My Diplomatic Life" aria-describedby="gallery-4-1454" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?w=500&amp;ssl=1 500w, https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w" data-lazy-sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.mydiplomaticlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0019.jpg?fit=500%2C375&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP/yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7 "></a></p><figcaption id="gallery-4-1454"> Oil Workers at In-Amenas airport prior to their flight out to Frankfurt</figcaption></figure></div><p>After the formalities of customs, we all assembled in the departure lounge for a farewell photograph prior to the party boarding their flight to Frankfurt and then finally they were gone.</p><p>So it was with a sense of relief that we set off on the long 1300 Kms return journey back to Algiers.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
<p>Anyone with any programming experience understands that computers are deterministic machines. If you provide the same input, you’ll always get the same output. That’s why having computers generate something by chance is trickier than it may seem.</p>
<p>Computers use random numbers for everything from cryptography to gambling, generative algorithms, video games, and more. However, computers are inherently incapable of being random. Instead, programmers rely on pseudorandom number generators (PRNGs). These are simply a category of algorithms that programmatically generate new random numbers from a given starting value called the seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These algorithms are not without their own limitations. Since the random numbers are programmatically generated, if someone were able to identify the seed value and the PRNG algorithm you were using, they’d be able to predict the next random number in the sequence. This would allow an attacker to break encryption, predict the next playing card in a sequence, cheat in a video game, etc. </p>
<p>Despite this concern, PRNGs are extremely useful in situations involving modeling and simulations as it allows you to “replay” a series of random events by initializing your random number generator with the same seed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In situations where the randomness of the random numbers is critical, we use a “true” random number generator (TRNGs). Unlike PRNGs that have an arbitrary seed value, TRNGs pick a seed value from their environment / external data. </p>
<p>Here are a few potential options:</p>
<ul><li>Mouse movements</li><li>Fan noise</li><li>Atmospheric pressure</li><li>Number of microseconds since the last whole second</li></ul>
<p>We just need to pick a seed that an attacker wouldn’t be able to predict. This seed value will then be passed into an algorithm, similar to PRNGs, that will generate a random number to use.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The use case will generally dictate whether a PRNG will suffice or if a “true” RNG is needed. Regardless, it’s important to understand the practical differences between both approaches. </p>
<p>PRNGs are faster than TRNGs and their determinism is extremely useful in cases where you want to replay a series of “random” events. Additionally, some PRNGs are periodic in nature, but modern PRNGs with the right initialization parameters have a period long enough that it’s not a major concern. Conversely, TRNGs are slower than PRNGs, are non-deterministic, and are not periodic.</p>
<h2>Linear Congruential Generator</h2>
<p>Let’s take a look at implementing a simple PRNG. We’ll implement a variant called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">linear congruential generator</a> (LCG) algorithm. LCG was previously one of the most commonly used and studied PRNGs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">more info</a>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here’s the recurrence relation for LCG:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/iNcDHvHA6BvD1fpYntUkZ-11dzW6EYoW5dHv7mMhPZhDNo5fJaIMZXUh7SmZq0AoobvHxg7K5MMvqoWav7ee0xHase0fhAjWmNWoW7RcT5GzAao1jVwtGY11q2yL6iuvWiYFgyHS" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_congruential_generator">Wikipedia page on LCG</a> documents a few commonly used values for modulus, multiplier, and increment. There’s no consensus on the best values to use hence the differing values across implementations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>We have to be mindful of what values we use for these parameters. Choosing the wrong values can create a period that is too short which would render our random number generator useless. </p>
<p>In the image below, you can see that small changes to our parameters can greatly impact the period length.</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/FVum2kuYt4oMYjOdzHx2txpQH0NgheDDSUSxyQJamzGbZgPcUALt3Mmv4H-BElodwXwTzcLaqicG8IdsPFAgolV4DK8NkZXtghDQ_hX6MyMsxU_irWeOxR1ijaoYgecOU3fbuPbQ" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<h2>Implementation</h2>
<p>For our implementation, we’ll use the values documented in previous standards of the C languages (C90/C99/ANSI C,&nbsp; and C11).&nbsp;</p>
<p><code>a = 1103515245</code></p>
<p><code>m = 2³¹</code></p>
<p><code>c = 12345</code></p>
<blockquote><p>Whatever PRNG algorithm you choose should result in a uniform distribution of random numbers and a sufficiently long period.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>
<p>Here’s a simple implementation in Swift:</p>

<h2>Simulating Dice Rolls</h2>
<p>Let’s say you wanted to simulate a dice roll. </p>
<p>It might seem reasonable to change the modulus to 6, but this would create a period far too short to be usable. We need to stick with well-chosen and tested values for our parameters. </p>

<p>Instead, using the approach in the code above, we can simulate 40,000 dice rolls:</p>
<div><figure><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/uVT2lMlmWHcYIio5WmgkMMXz9nkkA_P4lzIVWeyVETxasCDn5s_5qQWgBh5FAvfPDwHipyMaqHWmb_lOp_J7oOXiRdxo_3lywqvrIo4Ky40QoDUYIrJ15w5mC6B9XWVLWvyySRWr" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>Dice Value: 40,000 Roll Simulations</p>
<blockquote><p>Looking at the results, we can see that it is indeed a uniform distribution of values.</p></blockquote>
<h2>Generating Random Numbers In A Range</h2>
<p>Next, let’s consider generating random numbers that fall in a range. Again, we shouldn’t change our parameters without fully understanding how it affects the period. </p>
<p>Instead, we should map our PRNG’s results to values in our desired range.&nbsp;</p>

<div><figure><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/A2h_s4Z_eN-qGkjEZabgPwWpOjMmIDdD9fQlYcdM344voNTlxPIvammtm6RRXJ6aDgG83h67zZYf4E4olN7jz5VRiIK10D_XeRTf0whcfHLZhn8Q9142vJBZU9Ma40DIvFVw7FdU" alt="" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>
<p>After a million simulations across the specified range [30, 80)</p>
<h2>Further Reading</h2>
<p>If you’re interested in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators">more modern PRNG</a>, I’d recommend exploring the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mersenne_Twister">Mersenne-Twister</a> approach. It’s currently the most popular PRNG algorithm and currently used in Python (numpy), Ruby, PHP, R, and C++.&nbsp;This was meant to be a high-level introduction into this topic. If you’re interested in learning more about this topic, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_random_number_generators#Pseudorandom_number_generators_(PRNGs)">here a few other PRNGs to consider. </a> </p>

    <p><img src="https://matej.laitl.cz/images/2020-09-13-bench-rust-kotlin-microservices/cover.png" alt="illustration">
Back in spring 2020 at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>,
we were looking to replace our <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework">Spring</a>-<a href="https://tomcat.apache.org/">Tomcat</a>
duo by a more lightweight framework to power our future Kotlin microservices.
We did some detailed (at times philosophical) theoretical comparisons that I much enjoyed,
but these cannot substitute a hands-on experience.
We decided to implement proof-of-concept microservices using the most viable frameworks,
stressing them in a benchmark along the way.
While <strong>Kotlin</strong> was the main language,
I saw this as an opportunity to have some fun at home and test (my proficiency with) <strong>Rust</strong>,
which is touted for being fast.
I ended up stress-testing Kotlinâ€™s <a href="https://www.http4k.org/"><strong>Http4k</strong></a>, <a href="https://ktor.io/"><strong>Ktor</strong></a>,
and Rustâ€™s <a href="https://actix.rs/"><strong>Actix</strong> Web</a>, read on to see how they fared.</p>

<p><em>Feel free to <a href="#the-results">jump to the results</a> and read the background later, if youâ€™re impatient.</em></p>

<h2 id="on-techempower-framework-benchmarks">On TechEmpower Framework Benchmarks</h2>

<p>Why not just refer to excellent <a href="https://www.techempower.com/benchmarks/">TechEmpower Benchmarks (TEB)</a>?</p>

<p>A very valid question to ask. A couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Submitted TEB implementations tend to be rather optimised.
We wanted to measure such a code style that we would normally write:
one striving to be simple/idiomatic/readable,
but finished promptly and not extensively profiled.
On the other hand, we wanted to include production-grade API error handling
(correct HTTP codes and JSON error messages listing problems of individual parameters etc.),
request logging, and OpenAPI (Swagger) spec generation.</li>
  <li>Besides high-water req/s performance and associated latencies,
we wanted to capture more operational characteristics like memory usage, CPU usage and efficiency,
along the lifetime of a microservice instance.</li>
  <li>In production, we run our microservices in a rather high-density Kubernetes cluster,
where every instance has to be CPU- and memory-constrained.
We wanted to simulate this environment
and check whether we can use trending â€œserverlessâ€� offerings for new services.</li>
  <li>Our data store, Elasticsearch, differs from ones included in TEB,
and we were curious how synchronous vs. asynchronous flavours of the Elasticsearch client compare.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-service">The Service</h2>

<p>For a description of the service to implement &amp; benchmark,
<a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/api-spec.md">see its API Spec document available in the locations-rs repository</a>.</p>

<p>We benchmark its simplest <code>/city/v1/get</code> endpoint,
whose work is to look up a <code>city</code> document by id in Elasticsearch,
look up associated <code>region</code> document,
and render response JSON.
It uses internal in-memory cache for regions (there is just tens of them),
but no cache for much more numerous cities.</p>

<p>To reduce bandwidth when fetching documents from Elasticsearch,
all implementations instruct it to strip (at least) the largest property <code>geometry</code>.
This property is only used in Elasticsearch-side filtering, not by the microservice.
I believe the stripping significantly strains Elasticsearch
(or rather transfers the strain from the microservice to it).</p>

<h2 id="the-benchmark">The Benchmark</h2>

<h3 id="recipe">Recipe</h3>

<p>The benchmark consists of multiple identical â€œrunsâ€� for each Dockerised implementation spawned
by <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/bench-3-impls.py">bench-3-impls.py</a>.
The runs are named after the implementation and their ordinal number,
thus <code>rs-actix-1</code> is the first run of the Rust (Actix) implementation,
and <code>kt-ktor-3</code> is the third run of Kotlin (Ktor) implementation.</p>

<p>Each run simulates the first couple of minutes of the microservice instance using <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/test-image.py">test-image.py</a>.
Steps of one run:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Docker container is started, measuring the time until the service starts responding,</li>
  <li>a suite of HTTP checks is made ensuring correct responses and error handling behaviour,</li>
  <li>HTTP load is generated using <a href="https://github.com/wg/wrk">wrk</a>
in a series of 10-second long steps with increasing concurrent connection count;
the metrics are collected from <code>wrk</code> and Docker API after each step:
    <ul>
      <li>first 5 steps use just one concurrent connection, acting as a warm-up,</li>
      <li>each of the next 11 steps doubles concurrent connection count, i.e. continuing with 2, 4,
8, â€¦, 1024, 2048.<sup id="fnref:conn-count" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:conn-count">1</a></sup></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Finally, all runs are plotted using the awesome <a href="http://www.pygal.org/">Pygal</a> library
in <a href="https://github.com/strohel/locations-rs/blob/master/render-tests.py">render-tests.py</a>.
Different runs of a single implementation use the same colour,
allowing for visual inspection of the variance between them.</p>

<h3 id="runtime-environment">Runtime Environment</h3>

<p>Docker is told to constrain resources available to the microservice containers,
a practice usual in typical Kubernetes clusters.</p>

<p>The CPU is limited to 1.5 CPU-units using an equivalent of the <code>--cpus=1.5</code> Docker option.
This means that even though the instance has access to all 4 CPU cores of the machine,
it can use only 15 CPU-seconds (out of theoretical 40 CPU-seconds) in each 10-wall-clock-second step.
The value of 1.5 was chosen small enough to ensure the tested microservice is the actual bottle-neck during the benchmark,
and large enough to assert frameworks make proper use of multiple CPU cores.</p>

<p>Memory is limited to 512 MiB. I argue that anything beyond 512 MiB should not be called a <em>micro</em>service.</p>

<p>The two JVM-hosted Kotlin implementations run in OpenJDK 11,
with <code>-XX:MaxRAMPercentage=75</code> as the sole option.
It should allow JVM to allocate up to 75% of available 512 MiB memory to Java heap.</p>

<h3 id="hardware">Hardware</h3>

<p>The benchmarks run on 2 Virtual Machines in Google Cloud Platform (GCP) Compute Engine
located in the same zone.</p>

<ul>
  <li>1st VM, <code>n2d-highcpu-4</code> machine type (4 AMD Epyc <em>Rome</em> vCPUs, 4 GB memory):
    <ul>
      <li>Runs the benchmarked microservice in a Docker container <em>and</em> the <code>wrk</code> load generator.</li>
      <li>As the container is limited to 1.5 CPU and <code>wrk</code> takes less than leftover 2.5 CPUs,

<p>We also initially implemented a Kotlin proof-of-concept in <a href="https://vertx.io/">Vert.x</a>,
but it turned out none of the team members was keen on the programming paradigm this framework suggested
(which may be a subjective matter), so we hadnâ€™t proceeded further with it.</p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-locations-kt-http4k">The Story of <code>locations-kt-http4k</code></h3>

<p>Http4k Locations service was written by <a href="https://buhvi.co/">@<strong>goodhoko</strong></a> at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>.
It became the production implementation at GoOut
and is thus most complete along with extras like Swagger serving.</p>

<p>Http4k <a href="https://www.http4k.org/guide/modules/servers/">allows one to select from several server backends</a>,
so we first need to do a qualification benchmark and select the best performing engine to be fair.</p>

<p>See <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-http4k-server-engines-pub/bench-results.html"><strong>Kttp4k server engine results on a dedicated page</strong></a>.
Line labels on the graph correspond to <a href="https://gitlab.com/gooutopensource/locations-kt-http4k/-/tags">tags in the locations-kt-http4k repository</a>.</p>

<p>One nice side-effect of this benchmarking was that
I have <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/141#issuecomment-679330954">discovered a cause</a>
of the <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/141"><strong>Netty</strong> backend performance issue</a>,
and <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/pull/480">@<strong>daviddenton</strong> was quick to fix it</a>.
The <code>netty-updfix-*</code> graphs, which exhibit some nice latency characteristics, already contain the fix.
It was later released in http4k v3.259.0 (be sure to upgrade if you use this backend).</p>

<p><strong>Apache HttpCore</strong> version 4.4, labelled as <code>apache4-*</code>, was most CPU-efficient backend
and achieved shared first place in peak req/s performance.
However, it tends to draw too much memory as the number of concurrent connections grows,
and is out-of-memory-killed once their number reaches (extreme) 1024.
Apache HttpCore version 5.0 (<code>apache-*</code>) and a variant with lowered socket backlog (<code>apache-q100-*</code>)
suffer from the same problem.
I have <a href="https://github.com/http4k/http4k/issues/481">opened an issue</a> to see if thatâ€™s a bug or not,
insights welcome.
Meanwhile, I would recommend different http4k backends for services not shielded by load balancers.</p>

<p>The winner of this qualification round is the <strong>Undertow</strong> backend
(<code>undertow-*</code> for v3.163.0 and <code>undertow-upd-*</code> for v3.258.0),
which shares the first place in high-water req/s performance,
but also brings good all-round results in the rest of the metrics,
especially memory consumption under load.</p>

<p>The <strong>Jetty</strong> backend (<code>jetty-*</code>) slightly but consistently lags behind other production engines
in most metrics.
For completeness, I have also included the <strong>SunHttp</strong> backend that is intended for development only,
which the benchmarks confirm.</p>

<p><em>Update: Http4k author <a href="https://gitlab.com/gooutopensource/locations-kt-http4k/-/issues/1">has pointed out that OpenAPI generation through Contracts API may incur some performance penalty</a>.
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-http4k-contractless/bench-results.html"><strong>Benchmarks confirm that removing the Contracts layer indeed increases performance</strong></a>, shifting Http4k closer to Ktor.
Graphs below reflect the original version with Contracts (OpenAPI support).</em></p>

<p>Ktor variant was also written by <a href="https://buhvi.co/">@<strong>goodhoko</strong></a> at <a href="https://goout.net/">GoOut</a>,
I later tweaked the <code>/city/v1/get</code> endpoint for functional parity with other implementations.
It remains the least complete implementation with just this single endpoint.</p>

<p>It uses <a href="https://github.com/jillesvangurp/es-kotlin-wrapper-client">es-kotlin-wrapper-client</a> to wrap
<a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/client/java-rest/current/java-rest-high-getting-started-asynchronous-usage.html">intrinsic async API of the Elasticsearch client</a>
into Kotlin coroutines.</p>

<p>Ktor also allows for pluggable HTTP server engines which I benchmarked.
See <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-ktor-server-engines/bench-results.html"><strong>Ktor server engine benchmarks page</strong></a>.</p>

<p>The pattern is similar here with <strong>Netty</strong> being more efficient and performant than <strong>Jetty</strong>,
thus qualified as Ktorâ€™s engine of choice for the main benchmark.</p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-locations-rs">The story of <code>locations-rs</code></h3>

<p>I wrote the Rust clone in my free time, closely following the development of <code>locations-kt-http4k</code>.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/iqq8k9/announcing_actixweb_v30/">Actix Web 3.0 was <em>just</em> released</a>
and I was eager to compare how it fares against v2.0 performance-wise.
<a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/strohel-pub/bench-actix-versions/bench-results.html"><strong>The one-to-one benchmark shows v3.0 is at least on par with v2.0</strong></a>.
I think thatâ€™s good news given that v3.0 …</p></div></div>
