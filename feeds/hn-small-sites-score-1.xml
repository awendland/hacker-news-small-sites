<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="post-content">
    <div id="blogpost">
        <p>As this is the end of the year, itâ€™s a great chance to remind yourself: how did we get here?</p>

<p>Let me beginn with a flashback to 2019. As a company, weâ€™re focussed on optimising remaining useful live of industrial assets through clever use of Machine Learning for predictive analysis, root-cause analysis and other forms of reasoning. We managed to secure a few big projects and very promising POCs, and across the board we were able to show good results. One of our projects even got government funding, providing a nice runway going forward.</p>

<p>We got the traditionally lengthy sales cycles with many leading industry players started, and we even hired our first full-time employee.</p>

<p>All was set up for first commercial success of our approach and our â€œasset optimisation platformâ€� in 2020.</p>

<p>Then the pandemic hit. Within a few weeks, all our sales leads fizzled away - millions of euros in deal sizes, disappeared in thin air. By March, we were looking at an empty sales funnel.</p>

<p>We had find a new path. We took stock, and we acted entrepreneurial.</p>

<h2 id="a-look-at-what-weve-got">A look at what weâ€™ve got</h2>

<p>Taking stock of what we actually had, in terms of intellectual property, was a great recap of our journey so far <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDfxoKmc8qc">(if youâ€™re interested, check out a talk I recently gave on what we learned about ML pipelines)</a>. To summarise, we had to our name:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A great team (experienced ML engineers, Ops expertise and a good entrepreneurial fit)</li>
  <li>A purpose-built tech stack for reproducible ML pipelines</li>
  <li>Experience running small and large projects</li>
  <li>A good network of other startups and developers in ML-related positions across the globe</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="talking-to-people">Talking to people</h2>

<p>We saw the economic effects of the pandemic very early - at least from an european perspective. After taking close stock, we had to understand how (and if) Machine Learning would continue to play a role for our leads and network. Taking a page out of the great UX researchers Iâ€™ve had the chance to work with over my career, we decided to do user interviews. Lo and behold, after doing ~30 early interviews, a picture emerged.</p>

<p>Teams engaged in ML projects lost significant chunks of time on unrepeatable projects as well as managing dysfunctional franken-infrastructures. Teams not yet engaged in ML feared it to be a black hole for time and effort to build up a reliable tech stack for getting experiments into production, as existing systems would need integration at many stages of the ML lifecycle.</p>

<p>An interesting side-fact became clear to us, too: there was a lot of scepticism towards ML-based SaaS products, but a lot of trust towards dev-tooling.</p>

<p>More importantly, however - we had solved exactly the problems our interviewees faced for ourselves. We were sitting on something commercially relevant, and we were looking at a great opportunity.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-your-market-part-one">Understanding your market, part one</h2>

<p>With this new-found confirmation we set out to transform our tech-stack from internal-facing supportive tooling to an actual product. Looking at the market, a split was noticeable.</p>

<p>On the one side, open-source tooling like Kubeflow and MLFlow was solving aspects of the MLOps problem space, but posed significant investments to the teams we were talking to in our interviews. Tooling was either missing the point of Data Scientists, or alienated product leads and DevOps teams with convoluted, messy or badly documented paths from experiment to production.</p>

<p>On the other side were very expensive commercial solutions, attempting to solve large chunks of the ML lifecycle with proprietary offerings.</p>

<h2 id="commercial-first">Commercial-first</h2>

<p>Given the layout of the MLOps market, we spotted an opportunity to flip the proverbial table. Donâ€™t get me wrong, weâ€™re not radical geniuses, we much rather are interested observers of entrepreneurial trends. Given the success of Stripe, Segment and others, this constellation of players screamed â€œtransactional business modelâ€� to us. A managed MLOps platform to train models easily in various public clouds, at linearly scaling prices, based on actual usage, not arbitrary license models or per-seat, and at a fraction of the going rates.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-market-part-two">Understanding the market, part two</h2>

<p>By now we know: Our hypothesis, teams are just waiting for a managed MLOps solution with usage-based pricing and reproducible pipelines as focus, was off. This was not immediately clear to us, of course.</p>

<p>One of our smartest plays saved us in the end - we never stopped doing user interviews. We demoâ€™ed our product status quo multiple times per week, we had two soft-launches and continuously engaged with the community on conferences, reddit, slack - you name it.</p>

<p>And people loved our take on MLOps. Our vision resonated deeply. All model trainings are guaranteed to be reproducible, tracking is deeply baked-in, integrations to popular tooling are easy and extensible - these are the key concerns of the teams we were talking to.</p>

<p>However, it would have been ludicrous to switch their tech-stacks to a commercial solution. No, if we wanted to drive adoption and actually have an impact on how the world dealt with MLOps, we had to give these teams the option to adopt our vision in their projects on their own terms. We had to open-source.</p>

<p>As Iâ€™ve written in the past, <a href="http://blog.maiot.io/open-source">we are huge proponents of open-source software</a>. Large parts of our own tooling would be possible without the work of open-source giants, on whose shoulders we can stand.</p>

<h2 id="the-jury-is-still-out">The jury is still out</h2>

<p>As of writing this, the jury is still out if weâ€™re leaving the dent in the universe that we want to leave behind. But, and this is a hugely rewarding feeling, we have all the right indications that we nailed it this time. Weâ€™ve breached 200 GitHub stars in less than a week of going public, weâ€™ve been on the front page of Hackernews, weâ€™ve been trending on GitHub, and ZenML is racing to 1000 <code>pip install</code>â€™s.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re running ML projects, or just personally got curious, head over to <a href="https://github.com/maiot-io/zenml">ZenMLâ€™s GitHub page</a> and get started with reproducible Machine Learning!</p>

                <div>
                                                                                <p><img src="https://neilzone.co.uk/content/images/20201227164320-Screenshot%202020-12-27%20at%2016.42.25.png" alt="Screenshot of webpage showing AHEM email service"></p>

<p>I've run my own mailserver for years now, with a <em>catch-all</em> on some domains.</p>

<p>This means that, whenever a shop or service asks for my email address, I can give them a unique address, specific to them, without needing to configure anything.</p>

<p>This has a number of uses, but the main ones for me are:</p>

<ul>
<li>if their system is compromised, my email address is of no use for credential stuffing attacks (since it is used only for that one site/service)</li>
<li>if I get spam from which I cannot unsubscribe, I can kill that email address without disrupting anything else</li>
<li>if they leak or sell my email address, and someone else uses it, I can tell</li>
</ul>

<p>One thing this setup does not do well, though, is deal with the situation in which I want a disposable email address: an email address which exists long enough to receive one email.</p>

<p>That's because, once I've given someone their unique address, they can continue sending to it, and it will continue to funnel their email into my mailbox, until I take action to stop them.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I want — well, am forced — to give over an email address just to access something. (For example, I wanted to download a cycle map from Sustrans the other day, and they insisted on having an email address, which is nonsensical as they just emailed me a link to a PDF on their website. Why not just hyperlink the PDFs from the website, and skip the hassle?! (Spoiler: probably some kind of tracking.).)</p>

<p>In that kind of situation, I want a system for disposable email addresses, which exist only for a very short period of time, and which do not clog up my mailbox.</p>



<p>There are loads of services which offer this, some free and some paid, and, to date, I've just used one of those. Since I've not used them for anything private, it didn't matter too much to me that someone else can see the content of the email.</p>

<p>Indeed, if you are looking for privacy from "hiding in a crowd", using a third party service is probably <em>preferable</em> to hosting your own service.</p>

<p>However, that trade-off was acceptable to me, and since I prefer to host my own tools, having my own setup seemed like a useful thing to have, if it was relatively easy to do.</p>

<p>And it was.</p>

<p>Relatively.</p>



<p>It took me about 30 minutes to get a disposable email server running using <a href="https://github.com/o4oren/Ad-Hoc-Email-Server">AHEM</a>.</p>

<p>The instructions on github sort of worked, and I can't tell if the bits which did not work out of the box are because of my lack of familiarity with node.js, or incomplete / no longer accurate instructions. Let's assume it's my ignorance!</p>

<p>I had a bit of a fight with angular, to make the project build, and I solved the error message by forcibly installing a particular version of it. Not ideal, but it worked.</p>

<p>After that, it built with some warnings but no more errors.</p>



<p>Since it's an email service, you need to set an MX record for the domain you want to use, pointing to a record pointing to the IP address on which you're running AHEM.</p>

<p>I chose a sub-domain of my normal domain. I'm using it for both the email addresses, and also for accessing the web server (via nginx).</p>

<p>AHEM can support multiple email domains, so if I wanted to do the same for one of Sandra's domains, it would be a simple case of adding the domain to AHEM's .env file.</p>



<p>I can understand why people do it, but it bugs me all the same: why use static files hosted by a third party CDN, rather than just hosting them yourself?</p>

<p>Out of the box, AHEM uses some JavaScript resources hosted on Cloudflare. I used wget to download the scripts, and then replaced the references in index.html with localhost references instead.</p>

<p>Bingo.</p>



<p>By default, it runs on localhost:3000. Fine for testing, but not what I wanted permanently.</p>

<p>Since I had nginx on the server already, reverse-proxying to give a web interface over port 80, using the same sub-domain as for the email address itself (although anything else would work too; they are not connected) was easy.</p>

<p>It also meant that it was trivial (using certbot) to pop a TLS certifcate on the proxy, giving me TLS over 443. Even though the web interface will be firewalled off and accessible only without our private network, I'd prefer to have TLS in place anyway.</p>

<p>I'm not sure why, but the basic config was 404'ing traffic to /socket.io/, so I added a specific <em>Location</em> section for that:</p>

<pre><code>location /socket.io/ {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;       
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
    proxy_set_header Connection "Upgrade";
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
}
</code></pre>



<p>I'm not that familiar with node.js, so there might be a better way of doing this, but I was struggling to keep it running when I closed my ssh connection.</p>

<p>I could just run it as a background process (by appending &amp; to the command), but I installed  pm2:</p>

<pre><code>npm install pm2 -g
</code></pre>

<p>and then ran it using:</p>

<pre><code>pm2 start ahem.js
</code></pre>



<p>Now, I have a simple to use, self-hosted, web page, which lets me generate random email addresses to paste into webforms when I want a disposable address.</p>

<p>I need to refresh the page to check if an email has arrived, but that's fine. I should check if there's something I've not configured correctly, as I'd have thought it would refresh periodically, if nothing fancier existed to show an email when it arrives.</p>

<p>Email are deleted automatically when they are 24 hours old; again, this is something configurable via .env, but that seems fine as a default.</p>



<p>A couple of weeks ago, AHEM <a href="https://github.com/o4oren/Ad-Hoc-Email-Server/pull/41/commits/4c4bc7fb34a056ff47abc96d32c066023d7c7e37">changed its licence</a> from an in-house job to Apache 2.0.</p>

<p>This is a good decision, IMHO, but still needs to be reflected in the AHEM interface, since this says that it's only "available for personal and internal use".</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><div><div><div><div><p>Maybe you are looking for a job you can do from home because you are tired of your daily commute or because you want to spend more time with your family. Maybe you want to travel a bit more and that’s why you are looking for a location-independent position. No matter what your reason is, online jobs are more popular than ever before. Check out the best remote job sites to find an online job you can do anywhere and anytime.</p><h2><span id="How_Important_Are_Online_Jobs"></span>How Important Are Online Jobs?<span></span></h2><p>Before we jump right into the list, let’s have a look at some facts and numbers.</p><p>40% of the entire American workforce will be doing <a href="https://www.officevibe.com/blog/11-incredible-coworking-statistics-infographic" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freelance work in 2020</a>. There are estimations, that <a href="https://levels.io/future-of-digital-nomads/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">by the year 2035 there will be 1 billion digital nomads</a> on this planet. That means that remote jobs will become more and more important. People are realizing, that the location-independent lifestyle has many advantages. The Digital Nomad Survey from 2016 shows, what people like most about this lifestyle:</p><ul><li>It gives them a better work/life balance than office work.</li><li>85% of all digital nomads feel happier with this lifestyle.</li><li>They are less stressed when they do telecommuting work.</li><li>They also enjoy schedule flexibility, the fact that they can work from home and don’t have to commute anymore.</li></ul><p>The industry has taken note of that, too. By the end of 2017, more than <a href="http://www.deskmag.com/en/the-complete-2017-coworking-forecast-more-than-one-million-people-work-from-14000-coworking-spaces-s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">14,000 coworking spaces</a> will be in operation around the world, providing location-independent professionals an alternative working environment.</p><p>Moreover, remote job sites are booming and new websites dedicated to online jobs are appearing on a regular basis. These websites show not only open positions for<strong> freelancers</strong>, but also for people who seek to work in a <strong>permanent contract</strong> with a company, but on a remote basis.</p><p>Some of these websites are free to use, but you have to pay a certain fee once you close a deal or a certain percentage of the agreed payment. Other websites charge you to search for jobs, but you don’t have to pay anything once you close a contract. Very few are entirely free to use.</p><p>The following list includes the most popular remote job sites out there. Have a look around and find the platform that works best for you.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4-1024x682.jpg" alt="Remote Job Sites, Digital Nomad, Online Job, Make Money Online, Location-Independent Job, Job Search, Hire Remote Worker, Freelancer" width="515" height="343" srcset="https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4.jpg 1024w, https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 515px) 100vw, 515px" data-old-src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20515%20343'%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-lazy-srcset="https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4.jpg 1024w, https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4-768x512.jpg 768w" data-lazy-src="https://www.digitalnomadsoul.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Remote-Job-Sites-4-1024x682.jpg"></p><h2><span id="The_Best_Remote_Job_Sites"></span>The Best Remote Job Sites<span></span></h2><h3><span id="FlexJobs"></span>FlexJobs<span></span></h3><p><a href="http://flexjobsrocks.go2cloud.org/aff_c?offer_id=1&amp;aff_id=1722" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Flexjobs </a>is focused on part-time, full-time and flexible remote jobs and has more than 100 job categories.&nbsp; All jobs are hand-screened so you can be sure it’s not a scam.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>After talking to machine learning and infrastructure engineers at major Internet companies across the US, Europe, and China, I noticed two groups of companies. One group has made significant investments (hundreds of millions of dollars) into infrastructure to allow real-time machine learning and has already seen returns on their investments. Another group still wonders if there’s value in real-time ML.</p>

<p>There seems to be little consensus on what real-time ML means, and there hasn’t been a lot of in-depth discussion on how it’s done in the industry. In this post, I want to share what I’ve learned after talking to about a dozen companies that are doing it.</p>

<p>There are two levels of real-time machine learning that I’ll go over in this post.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Level 1: Your ML system makes predictions in real-time (online predictions).</li>
  <li>Level 2: Your system can incorporate new data and update your model in real-time (online learning).</li>
</ul>

<p>I use “model” to refer to the machine learning model and “system” to refer to the infrastructure around it, including data pipeline and monitoring systems.</p>

<h2 id="online_predictions">Level 1: Online predictions - your system can make predictions in real-time</h2>
<p><em><b>Real-time</b> here is defined to be in the order of milliseconds to seconds.</em></p>

<h3 id="online_predictions_use_cases">Use cases</h3>
<p>Latency matters, especially for user-facing applications. In 2009, Google’s experiments demonstrated that <a href="https://services.google.com/fh/files/blogs/google_delayexp.pdf">increasing web search latency 100 to 400 ms reduces the daily number of searches per user by 0.2% to 0.6%</a>. In 2019, <a href="https://blog.acolyer.org/2019/10/07/150-successful-machine-learning-models/">Booking.com found that an increase of 30% in latency cost about 0.5% in conversion rates — “a relevant cost for our business.”</a></p>

<p>No matter how great your ML models are, if they take just milliseconds too long to make predictions, users are going to click on something else.</p>

<h4 id="problems_batch_predictions">Problems with batch predictions</h4>
<p>One non-solution is to avoid making predictions online. You can generate predictions in batch offline, store them (e.g. in SQL tables), and pull out pre-computed predictions when needed.</p>

<p>This can work when the input space is finite – you know exactly how many possible inputs to make predictions for. One example is when you need to generate movie recommendations for your users – you know exactly how many users there are. So you predict a set of recommendations for each user periodically, such as every few hours.</p>

<p>To make their user input space finite, many apps make their users choose from categories instead of entering wild queries. For example, if you go to TripAdvisor, you first have to pick a predefined metropolis area instead of being able to enter just any location.</p>

<p>This approach has many limitations. TripAdvisor results are okay within their predefined categories, such as <b>“Restaurants”</b> in <b>“San Francisco”</b>, but are pretty bad when you try to enter wild queries like <b>“high rating Thai restaurants in Hayes Valley”</b>.</p>

<img alt="MLOps over time" src="https://huyenchip.com/assets/pics/real-time-ml/1_tripadvisor.png">
</figure>
</center>

<p>Limitations caused by batch predictions exist even in more technologically progressive companies like Netflix. Say, you’ve been watching a lot of horrors lately, so when you first log into Netflix, horror movies dominate recommendations. But you’re feeling bright today so you search “comedy” and start browsing the comedy category. Netflix should learn and show you more comedy in your list of their recommendations, right? But it can’t update the list until the next time batch recommendations are generated.</p>

<p>In the two examples above, batch predictions lead to decreases in user experience (which is tightly coupled with user engagement/retention), not catastrophic failures. Other examples are ad ranking, Twitter’s trending hashtag ranking, Facebook’s newsfeed ranking, estimating time of arrival, etc.</p>

<p>There are also many applications that, without online predictions, would lead to catastrophic failures or just wouldn’t work. Examples include high frequency trading, autonomous vehicles, voice assistants, unlocking your phones using face/fingerprints, fall detection for elderly care, fraud detection, etc. Being able to detect a fraudulent transaction that happened 3 hours ago is still better than not detecting it at all, but being able to detect it in real-time can prevent it from going through.</p>

<p>Switching from batch predictions to real-time predictions allows you to use dynamic features to make more relevant predictions. Static features are information that changes slowly or rarely – age, gender, job, neighborhood, etc. Dynamic features are features based on what’s happening right now – what you’re watching, what you’ve just liked, etc. Knowing a user’s interests right now will allow your systems to make recommendations much more relevant to them.</p>

<h3 id="online_predictions_solutions">Solutions</h3>
<p>For your system to be able to make online predictions, it has to have two components:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Fast inference: model that can make predictions in the order of milliseconds</li>
  <li>Real-time pipeline: a pipeline that can process data, input it into model, and return a prediction in real-time</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="fast_inference">Fast inference</h4>
<p>When a model is too big and taking too long to make predictions, there are three approaches:</p>

<p><b>1. Make models faster (inference optimization)</b></p>

<p>E.g. fusing operations, distributing computations, memory footprint optimization, writing high performance kernels targeting specific hardwares, etc.</p>

<p><b>2. Make models smaller (model compression)</b></p>

<p>Originally, this family of technique is to make models smaller to make them fit on edge devices. Making models smaller often makes them run faster. The most common, general technique for model compression is quantization, e.g. using 16-bit floats (half precision) or 8-bit integers (fixed-point) instead of 32-bit floats (full precision) to represent your model weights. In the extreme case, some have attempted 1-bit representation (binary weight neural networks), e.g. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.00363">BinaryConnect</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05279">Xnor-Net</a>. The authors of Xnor-Net spun off Xnor.ai, a startup focused on model compression which was <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2020/exclusive-apple-acquires-xnor-ai-edge-ai-spin-paul-allens-ai2-price-200m-range/">acquired by Apple for a reported $200M</a>.</p>

<p>Another popular technique is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02531">knowledge distillation</a> – a small model (student) is trained to mimic a larger model or an ensemble of models (teacher). Even though the student is often trained with a pre-trained teacher, both may also be trained at the same time. One example of a distilled network used in production is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.01108"><strong>DistilBERT</strong></a>, which reduces the size of a BERT model by 40%, while retaining 97% of its language understanding capabilities and being 60% faster.</p>

<p>Other techniques include pruning (finding parameters least useful to predictions and setting them to 0) and low-rank factorization (replacing the over-parametric convolution filters with compact blocks to both reduce the number of parameters and increase speed). See <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.09282">A Survey of Model Compression and Acceleration for Deep Neural Networks</a></strong> (Cheng et al.. 2017) for a detailed analysis.</p>

<p>The number of research papers on model compression is growing. Off-the-shelf utilities are proliferating. Awesome Open Source has a list of <a href="https://awesomeopensource.com/projects/model-compression"><strong>The Top 40 Model Compression Open Source Projects</strong></a>.</p>

<p><b>3. Make hardware faster</b></p>

<p>This is another research area that is booming. Big companies and startups alike are in a race to develop hardware that allows large ML models to do inference, even training, faster both on the cloud and especially on devices. IDC forecasts that by 2020, the combination of edge and mobile devices doing inferencing will <a href="https://www.arm.com/-/media/global/solutions/artificial-intelligence/ai-ml-on-cpu-whitepaper.pdf?revision=17a2b30b-0f5a-4a42-8681-3d9f3f94e513">total 3.7 billion units, with a further 116 million units doing training</a>.</p>

<h4 id="stream_pipeline">Real-time pipeline</h4>
<p>Suppose you have a ride sharing app and want to detect fraudulent transactions e.g. payments using stolen credit cards. When the true credit owner discovers unauthorized payments, they’ll dispute with their bank and you’ll have to refund the charges. To maximize profits, fraudsters might call multiple rides either in succession or from multiple accounts. In 2019, merchants estimate fraudulent transactions account for an average of <a href="https://network.americanexpress.com/globalnetwork/dam/jcr:09c34553-b4a2-43ca-bf3e-47cbc911ea51/American%20Express%202019%20Digital%20Payments%20Survey_Insights%20Paper.pdf">27% of their annual online sales</a>. The longer it takes for you to detect the stolen credit card, the more money you’ll lose.</p>

<p>To detect whether a transaction is fraudulent, looking at that transaction alone isn’t enough. You need to at least look into the recent history of the user involved in that transaction, their recent trips and activities in-app, the credit card’s recent transactions, and other transactions happening around the same time.</p>

<p>To quickly access these types of information, you want to keep as much of them in-memory as possible. Every time an event you care about happens – a user choosing a location, booking a trip, contacting a driver, canceling a trip, adding a credit card, removing a credit card, etc. – information about that event goes into your in-memory storage. It stays there for as long as they are useful (usually in order of days) then either goes into permanent storage (e.g. S3) or is discarded. The most common tool for this is <a href="https://github.com/apache/kafka">Apache Kafka</a>, with alternatives such as Amazon Kinesis. Kafka is a stream storage: it stores data as it streams.</p>

<p>Streaming data is different from static data – data that already exists somewhere in its entirety, such as CSV files. When reading from CSV files, you know when the job is finished. Streams of data never finish.</p>

<p>Once you’ve had a way to manage streaming data, you want to extract features to input into your ML models. On top of features from streaming data, you might also need features from static data (when was this account created, what’s the user’s rating, etc.). You need a tool that allows you to process streaming data as well as static data and join …</p></div></div>

These systems glow with a fantastic magenta light — from LEDs that are specially tuned to provide optimal light for photosynthesis — often with stacked trays of plants, one on top of the other. Some of this technology is new, especially the LEDs, although pot growers have used tools like this for years.</p><p id="db29">Some of the more notable efforts to build indoor “farms” include <a href="http://www.freightfarms.com/" rel="noopener">Freight Farms</a> in Boston. And there is a group at MIT that is trying to create new high-tech platforms for growing food inside, including “<a href="http://openag.media.mit.edu/hardware/" rel="noopener">food computers</a>”. These folks are very smart, and have done a lot to perfect the technology.</p><p id="47bb">At first blush, these “farms” sound great. Why not <em>completely</em> eliminate food miles, and grow food right next to restaurants, cafeterias, or supermarkets? And why not grow crops inside closed systems, where water can be recycled, and pests can (in theory) be managed without chemicals.</p><p id="d5c4">It sounds great, doesn’t it? But there are many challenges.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="6ba8"><span>F</span><strong>irst, Vertical Farms Cost a Fortune</strong></p><p id="5f2b">But there are costs to these farms. <em>Huge</em> costs.</p><p id="f0bc">First, these systems are <em>really</em> expensive to build. The shipping container systems developed by <a href="http://www.freightfarms.com/faq/" rel="noopener">Freight Farms</a>, for example, cost between $82,000 and $85,000 <em>per container</em> — an astonishing sum for a box that just grows greens and herbs. Just one container costs as much as 10 entire acres of prime American farmland — which is a far better investment, both in terms of food production and future economic value. Just remember: farmland has the benefit of generally <em>appreciating</em> in <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuarogers/2014/09/23/dirt-cheap-investors-are-plowing-into-farmland-heres-why" rel="noopener">value over time</a>, whereas a big metal box is likely to only decrease in value.</p><p id="24cf">Second, food produced this way is <em>very</em> expensive. For example, the Wall Street Journal <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/are-shipping-containers-the-future-of-farming-1465393797" rel="noopener">reports</a> that mini-lettuces grown by Green Line Growers costs more than <em>twice</em> as much as organic lettuce available in most stores. And this is typical for other indoor growers around the country: it’s very, very expensive, even compared to organic food. Instead of making food <em>more</em>available, especially to poorer families on limited budgets, these indoor crops are only available to the affluent. It might be fine for gourmet lettuce, or fancy greens for expensive restaurants, but regular folks may find it out of reach.</p><p id="e121">Finally, indoor farms use <em>a lot</em> of energy and materials to operate. The container farms from Freight Farms, for example, use about <a href="http://www.freightfarms.com/faq/" rel="noopener">80 kilowatt-hours of electricity a day</a> to power the lights and pumps. That’s nearly 2–3 times as much electricity as a typical (and still very inefficient) American home, or about 8 times the electricity used by an average San Francisco apartment. And on the average American electrical grid, this translates to emitting <em>44,000 pounds of CO2 per container per year</em>, from electricity alone, not counting any additional heating costs. This is <em>vastly</em> more than the emissions it would take to ship the food from someplace else.</p><p id="0e49">And none of it is necessary.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="1017"><span>B</span><strong>ut, Wait, Can’t Indoor Farms Use Renewable Energy?</strong></p><p id="5bbd">Proponents of indoor techno-farms often say that they can offset the enormous sums of electricity they use, by powering them with renewable energy — especially solar panels — to make the whole thing carbon neutral.</p><p id="5b5d">But just stop and think about this for a second.</p><p id="5f6a">These indoor “farms” would use solar panels to harvest naturally occurring sunlight, and convert it into electricity, so that they can power…<em>artificial sunlight</em>? In other words<em>, </em>they’re<em> trying to use the sun to replace the sun.</em></p><p id="0a0f">But we don’t need to replace the sun. Of all of the things we should worry about in agriculture, the availability of free sunlight is not one of them. Any system that seeks to replace the sun to grow food is probably a bad idea.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="e3d3"><span>B</span><strong>esides, “Food Miles” Aren’t a Big Climate Problem</strong></p><p id="29a5">Sometimes we hear that vertical farms help the environment by reducing “food miles” — the distance food items travel from farm to table — and thereby reduce fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p id="0f7a">This sounds logical, but it turns out to be a red herring.</p><p id="c2ec">Strange as it might seem, local food typically uses about the same amount of energy — per pound — to transport as food grown far away. Why? Short answer: volume and method of transport. A larger food operator can ship food more efficiently — even if it travels longer distances — because of the gigantic volumes they work in. Plus, ships, trains, and even large trucks driving on Interstate highways use less fuel, per pound per mile, than small trucks driving around town.</p><p id="a654">Plus it turns out that “food miles” aren’t a very big source of CO2 emissions anyway, whether they’re local or not. In fact, they pale in comparison to emissions from deforestation, methane from cattle and rice fields, and nitrous oxide from over-fertilized fields. And local food systems — especially organic farms that use fewer fertilizers, and grass fed beef that sequesters carbon in the soil — can reduce these more critical emissions. At the end of the day, local food systems are generally better for the environment, including greenhouse gas emissions. Just don’t worry about emissions from food miles too much.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="6153"><span>A</span><strong>nd These Vertical “Farms” Can’t Grow Much</strong></p><p id="1ac1">A further problem with indoor farms is that a lot of crops could never develop properly in these artificial conditions. While LED lights provide the light needed for <em>photosynthesis</em> to occur, they don’t provide the proper mix of light and heat to trigger plant development stages — like those that tell plants when to put on fruit or seed. Moreover, a lot of crops need a bit of wind to develop tall, strong stalks, needed later when they are carrying heavy loads before harvest. As a result, indoor farms are severely limited, and have a hard time growing things besides simple greens.</p><p id="71b1">Indoor farms might be able to provide some <em>garnish</em> and <em>salads</em> to the world, but forget about them as a means of growing much other <em>food</em>.</p></div></div></section><section><div><div><p id="003c"><strong>A Better Way?</strong></p><p id="bf8f">I’m not the only critic of indoor, high-tech, energy-intensive agriculture. Other authors are starting to point out the problems with these systems too (read very good critiques <a href="http://www.salon.com/2016/02/17/enough_with_the_vertical_farming_partner/" rel="noopener">here</a>, <a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/2012/12/11/the-vertical-farming-scam/" rel="noopener">here</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/apr/10/indoor-farming-makes-no-economic-environmental-sense" rel="noopener">here</a>, and <a href="http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2014/02/indoor-urban-farms-called-wasteful-pie-sky" rel="noopener">here</a>).</p><p id="02f4">While I appreciate the enthusiasm and innovation put into developing indoor farms, I think these efforts are, at the end of the day, counterproductive.</p><p id="8dea">Instead, I think we should use the same investment of dollars, incredible technology, and amazing brains to solve other agricultural problems — like developing new methods for drip irrigation, better grazing systems that lock up soil carbon, and ways of recycling on-farm nutrients. Organic farming and high-precision agriculture are doing promising things, and need more help. We also need innovation and capital to help other parts of the food system, especially in tackling food waste, and getting people to shift their diets towards more sustainable directions.</p><p id="9534">An interconnected network of good farms —real farms that provide nutritious food, with social and environmental benefits to their communities — is the kind of innovation we really need.</p></div></div></section><section><div><p id="b135">NOTE: parts of this piece were adapted from an earlier blog article of mine called <em>“Local Food is Great, But Can It Go Too Far?”</em></p></div></section><section><div><div><p id="68aa"><em>Dr. </em><a href="http://globalecoguy.org/" rel="noopener"><em>Jonathan Foley</em></a><em> (@</em><a href="http://twitter.com/@globalecoguy" rel="noopener"><em>GlobalEcoGuy</em></a><em>) is a climate &amp; environmental scientist, writer, and speaker.

		<p><em>How to create a sharp mesh from a function without even trying</em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.boristhebrave.com/2018/04/15/marching-cubes-tutorial/">part 1</a> and <a href="https://www.boristhebrave.com/2018/04/15/marching-cubes-3d-tutorial/">part 2</a> of the series, we looked at the Marching Cubes algorithm, and how it can turn any function into a grid based mesh. In this article we’ll look at some of the shortcomings and how we can do better.</p>
<div><!-- Font Awesome -->
<p>
Marching Cubes is easy to implement, and therefore ubiquitous. But it has a number of problems:</p></div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Complexity</p>
<p>Even though you only need process one cube at a time, Marching Cubes ends up pretty complicated as there are a lot of different possible cases to consider.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/mc_18_cases_small.png"><br>
</figure>
</li><li>
<p>Ambiguity</p>
<p>Some cases in Marching Cubes cannot be obviously resolved one way or another. In 2d, if you have two opposing corners, it’s impossible to say if they are meant to be joined or not.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/mc_ambig.svg" alt="Figure 4"><br>
</figure>
<p>In 3d, the problem is even worse, as inconsistent choices can leave you with a leaky mesh. We had to write extra code to deal with that in <a href="https://www.boristhebrave.com/2018/04/15/marching-cubes-3d-tutorial/">part 2</a>.</p>
</li><li>
Marching Cubes cannot do sharp edges and corners
<p>Here’s a square approximated with Marching Cubes.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/mc_square.svg" alt="Figure 5"><br>
</figure>
<p>The corners have been sliced off. Adaptivity cannot help here – Marching Squares always creates straight lines on the interior of any cell, which is where the target square corner happens to lie.
</p></li></ol>
<p>So, what do do next?</p>

<h2>Enter Dual Contouring</h2>
<p><strong>Brevity Alert:</strong> This tutorial covers concepts and ideas more than methods and code. If you are more interested in the implementation, make sure you check out the python implementation (<a href="https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/dual_contour_2d.py">2d&nbsp;<span></span></a>, <a href="https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/dual_contour_3d.py">3d&nbsp;<span></span></a>), which contains commented example code with all the nitty gritty.</p>
<p>Dual Contouring solves these problems, and is more extensible to boot. The trade off is we need to know even more information about \( f(x) \), the function determining what is solid and what is not. Not only do we need to know the value of \( f(x) \), we also need to know the gradient \( f'(x) \). That extra information will improve the adaptivity from marching cubes.</p>
<p>Dual Contouring works by placing a single vertex in each cell, and then “joining the dots” to form the full mesh. Dots are joined across every edge that has a sign change, just like in marching cubes.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_tee_comparison.svg"><br>
</figure>
<p><strong>Aside:</strong><br>
The “dual” in the name comes from the fact that cells in the grid becomes vertices in the mesh, which relates to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_graph"><strong>dual graph</strong></a>
</p>
<p>Unlike Marching Cubes, we cannot evaluate cells independently. We must consider adjacent ones to “join the dots” and find the full mesh. But in fact, it’s a lot <a href="https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/dual_contour_3d.py#L57">simpler algorithm&nbsp;<span></span></a> than Marching Cubes because there are not a lot of distinct cases. You simply find every edge with a sign change, and connect the vertices for the cells adjacent to that edge.</p>
<h2>Getting the gradient</h2>
<p>In our simple example of a 2d circle of radius 2.5, \( f \) is defined as:</p>
<p>\[ f(x, y) = 2.5 – \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \]</p>
<p>(in other words, 2.5 minus the distance from the origin)</p>
<p>With a bit of calculus, we can compute the gradient:</p>
<p>\[ f'(x, y) = \text{Vec2}\left(\frac{-x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}, \frac{-y}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}} \right) \]</p>
<p>The gradient is pair of numbers for every point, indicating how much the function changes when moving along the x-axis or y-axis.</p>
<p>But you don’t need complicated maths to get the gradient function. You can just measure the change in \( f \) when \( x \) and \( y \) are perturbed by a small amount \( d \).</p>
<p>\[ f'(x, y) \approx \text{Vec2}\left(\frac{f(x+d, y) – f(x-d, y)}{2d}, \frac{f(x, y+d) – f(x, y-d)}{2d} \right) \]</p>
<p>This works for any sufficiently smooth \( f \), providing you pick \( d \) small enough. In practice, even functions with sharp points are sufficiently smooth, as you don’t need evaluate the gradient near the sharp parts for it to work. <a href="https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/dual_contour_2d.py#L95">Link to code <span></span></a>.</p>
<h2>Adaptivity</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve just got the same sort of stepped look that Marching Cubes had. We need to add some adaptivity. For Marching Cubes, we chose where along the edge put a vertex. Now we have a free choice of anywhere in the interior of the cell.</p>
<p>We want to choose the point that is most consistent with the information provided to us, i.e. the evaluation of \( f(x) \) and its gradient. Note that we’ve sampled the gradient along the edges, not at the corners.</p>

</figure>
<p>By picking the illustrated point, we ensure that the output faces from this cell conform as well as possible to the normals:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_example.svg"><br>
</figure>
<p>In practice, not all the normals around the cell are going to agree. We need to pick the point of best fit. I discuss how to handle picking that point in a <a href="#picking">later section</a>.</p>
<h2>Going 3d</h2>
<p>The 2d and 3d cases aren’t really that different. A cell is now a cube, not a square. And we are outputting faces, not edges. But that’s it. The routine for picking a single point per cell is the same. And we still find edges with a sign change, and then connect the points of adjacent cells, but now that is 4 cells, giving us a 4-sided polygon:</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_single_face.png"><figcaption>The face associated with a single edge. It has a point in every adjacent cell.</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>Dual contouring has a more natural look and flow to it than marching cubes, as you can see in this sphere constructed with it:</p>

<figure id="render_container"></figure>

<p>In 3d, this procedure is robust enough to pick points running along the edge of a sharp feature, and to pick out corners where they occur.</p>

    </a><br>
</figure>

<h2>Choosing a vertex location</h2>
<p>One major problem I glossed over before is how to choose the point location when the normals don’t point to a consistent location.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_inconsistent.png"><br>
</figure>
<p>The problem is even worse in 3d when there are likely to be a lot of normals.</p>
<p>The way to solve this is to pick the point that is mutually the best for all the normals.</p>
<p>First, for each normal, we assign a penalty to locations further away from ideal. Then we sum up all the penalty functions, which will give an ellipse shaped penalty. Finally, we pick the point with the lowest penalty.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_valley.png"><br>
</figure>
<p>Mathematically, the individual penalty functions are the square of the distance from the ideal line for that normal. The sum of all those squared terms is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic_function">quadratic function</a>, so the total penalty function is called the <strong>QEF</strong> (quadratic error function). Finding the minimal point of a quadratic function is a standard routine available in most matrix libraries.<br>
In my <a href="https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/qef.py#L57">python implementation <span></span></a>, I use <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/generated/numpy.linalg.lstsq.html">numpy’s lstsq</a> function.</p>
<h2>Problems</h2>
<h3>Colinear normals</h3>
<p>Most tutorials would stop here but it’s a dirty secret that solving the QEF as described in the original Dual Contouring paper doesn’t actually work very well.</p>
<p>If you solve the QEF, you can find the point that is most consistent with the normals of the function. But there’s <strong>no actual guarantee that the resulting point is inside the cell</strong>.</p>
<p>In fact, it’s quite common for it not to be if you have large flat surfaces. In that case all the sampled normals are the same or very close, as in this diagram.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_colinear.svg"><br>
</figure>
<p>I’ve seen a lot of advice dealing with this particular problem. Several people have given up on using the gradient information, instead taking the center of the cell, or average of the boundary positions. This is called Surface Nets, and it at least has simplicity going for it.</p>
<p>But what I’d recommend based on my own experiments is the combination of two techniques.</p>
<h4>Technique 1: Constrained QEF solving</h4>
<p>Recall we were finding the cell point by finding the point that minimized the value of a given function, called the QEF. With some small changes, we can find the minimizing point <em>within</em> the cell.</p>
<h4>Technique 2: Biasing the QEF</h4>
<p>We can add any quadratic function  we like to the QEF and we get another quadratic function which is still solvable. So I add a quadratic which has a minimal point in the center of the cell.<br>
This has the effect of pulling the solution of the overall QEF towards the center.<br>
In fact, it has a stronger effect when the normals are colinear and likely to give screwy results, while it barely affects the positions for the good case.</p>
<p>Using both techniques is somewhat redundant, but I think it gives the best visual results.</p>
<p>Better details on both techniques are demonstrated <a href="https://github.com/BorisTheBrave/mc-dc/blob/a165b326849d8814fb03c963ad33a9faf6cc6dea/qef.py#L87">in the code <span></span></a>.</p>
<h3>Self interesctions</h3>
<p>Another dual contouring annoyance is it can sometimes generate a 3d surface that intersects itself. For most uses, this is completely ignorable, so I have not addressed it.</p>
<p>There is a paper discussing how to deal with it: <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~taoju/research/interfree_paper_final.pdf">“Intersection-free Contouring on An Octree Grid” Ju and Udeshi 2006</a></p>
<h3>Manifolds</h3>
<p>While a dual contouring mesh is always water tight, it’s not always a well defined surface. As there’s only one point per cell, if two surfaces pass through a cell, they will share it. This is called a “non-manifold” mesh, and it can mess with some texturing algorithms. This issue is common if you have solids that are thinner than the cell size, or multiple objects nearly touching each other.</p>
<figure>
    <img src="https://www.boristhebrave.com/content/2018/04/dc_nonmanifold.svg"><br>
</figure>
<p>Handling these cases is a substantial extension on basic Dual Contouring. If you need this feature I recommend having a look at <a href="https://github.com/Lin20/isosurface">this Dual Contouring implementation</a> or <a href="http://faculty.cs.tamu.edu/schaefer/research/dualsimp_tvcg.pdf">this paper</a></p>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<p>Because of the relative simplicity of the meshing process, Dual Contouring is much easier to extend to cell layouts other than the standard grid used above. Most commonly, you can run it on an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree">octtree</a> to have varying sizes of cells precisely where you need the detail. The rough idea is identical – pick a point per cell using sampled normals, then for each edge showing a sign change find the adjacent 4 cells and combine their vertices into a face. With an octree, you can recurse to find those edges, and the adjacent cells. Matt Keeter has a <a href="https://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/contours/">detailed tutorial</a> on what to do.</p>
<p>Another neat extension is that all you need for Dual Contouring is a measure of what is inside / outside, and corresponding normals. Though I’ve assumed you have a function for this, you can also derive the same information from another mesh. This allows you to “remesh”, i.e. generate a clean set of vertices and faces that cleans up the original mesh. For example, Blender’s <a href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/de/dev/modeling/modifiers/generate/remesh.html">remesh modifier</a>.</p>
<p>Well, that’s all I’ve got time for. Let me know in the comments if you found it useful, or if there’s anything else you’d like me to explain.</p>

    <p>We’re rebranding PrestoSQL as Trino. The software and the community you have come to love and depend on aren’t 
going anywhere, we are simply renaming. <strong>Trino is the new name for PrestoSQL</strong>, the project supported by the founders 
and creators of Presto® along with the major contributors – just under a shiny new name. And now you can find us here:</p>

<ul>
  <li>GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino">https://github.com/trinodb/trino</a>. Please give it a <a href="https://github.com/trinodb/trino/blob/master/.github/star.png">star</a>!</li>

</ul>

<p>If you want to learn why we’re doing this, read on…</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In 2012, Dain, David and Martin joined the Facebook data infrastructure team. Together with Eric Hwang, we created 
Presto® to address the problems of low latency interactive analytics over Facebook’s massive Hadoop data warehouse. 
One of our non-negotiable conditions was for Presto® to be an open source project. Open source is in our DNA - we had 
all used and participated in open source projects to various degrees in the past, and we recognized the power of open 
communities and developers coming together to build successful software that can stand the test of time.</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/team.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>Over the next six years, we worked hard to build a healthy open source community and ecosystem around the project. We 
worked with developers and users all over the world and welcomed them into the Presto® community. Presto® was on a path 
of increasing growth and success, in large part because of the contributions from developers across many fields and all 
over the world.</p>

<p>Unfortunately in 2018, it became clear that Facebook management wanted to have tighter control over the project and its 
future. This culminated with their decision to grant Facebook developers commit rights on the project without any prior 
experience in Presto®. We strongly believe that this kind of decision is not compatible with having a healthy, open 
community. Moreover, they made this decision by fiat without engaging the Presto® community. As a matter of principle, 
we had no choice but to leave Facebook in order to focus on making sure Presto® continued to be a successful project 
with an open, collaborative and independent community. In reality, the choice was easy.</p>

<p>We started the Presto Software Foundation in January 2019 as an independent entity to oversee the development of the 
software and community, continuing the meritocratic system that had been in place over the previous 6 years. The community 
quickly consolidated under this new home. We intentionally stayed unemployed over the next 10 months to focus on expanding 
and strengthening the community by working directly with major users and contributors, as well as reaching out to a wider 
group of users and developers across the globe. This resulted in new use cases and an injection of energy, making the 
project more vibrant than ever before as even more new users and developers became engaged. But, don’t take our word for 
it, let the data speak for itself:</p>

<p><img src="https://trino.io/assets/blog/trino-announcement/commits.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Months after this consolidation, Facebook decided to create a competing community using The Linux Foundation®. As a first 
action, Facebook applied for a trademark on Presto®. This was a surprising, norm-breaking move because up until that point, 
the Presto® name had been used without constraints by commercial and non-commercial products for over 6 years. In September 
of 2019, Facebook established the Presto Foundation at The Linux Foundation®, and immediately began working to enforce this 
new trademark. We spent the better part of the last year trying to agree to terms with Facebook and The Linux Foundation 
that would not negatively impact the community, but unfortunately we were unable to do so. The end result is that we must 
now change the name in a short period of time, with little ability to minimize user disruption.</p>

<p>On a personal note, and as the founders who named the project Presto® in the first place, this is an incredibly sad and 
disappointing turn of events. And while we will always have fondness for the name Presto®, we have come to accept that a 
name is just a name. To be frank, we’re tired of this endless distraction, and we intend to focus on what matters most 
and what we are best at doing – building high quality software everyone can rely on and fostering a healthy community 
of users and developers that build it and support it. We’re not going anywhere – we’re the same people, the same amazing 
software, under a new name: Trino.</p>

<p><strong>If you love this project, you already love Trino. ❤️</strong></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As noted few days ago, I decided to give OpenSUSE another chance. This time, for at least a month, and then give it my final judgement. I’ll likely write about motivation for going on this journey down the road, but for now, this is update on what has been weird for me on OpenSUSE side of things and the things that got on my nerves in this past few days.</p>



<p>In previous article I didn’t mention that in fact I went for the OpenSUSE Tumbleweed with KDE Plasma desktop. Consequently in this article you might notice that some issues are OpenSUSE annoyances, while others are KDE ones. I’ll try to elaborate each point as I go along and it should be pretty clear which one is which. </p>



<h2>KDE Wallet</h2>



<p>After the first login, when connecting to a WiFi, I got prompted to set up KDE Wallet. Default selection would suggest I should use GPG based encryption, but instead of going through some preliminary configuration (getting my Yubikey setup etc.) I decided to go for a blowfish based encryption. </p>



<p>I entered the same password I use for my user login in the KDE Wallet setup process in hope that Wallet will be automatically unlocked at login.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, next time I rebooted the machine, system prompted me for the Wallet password. Very user friendly… NOT! </p>



<p>After short investigation I noticed that package required for that functionality is not installed by default, so I promptly solved that</p>



<pre><code>sudo zypper in pam_kwallet</code></pre>



<p>This made everything work as expected, but it puzzles me why this is not provided by default. If I’m not mistaken, Arch pulls pam_kwalletd by default, as a dependency of KDE Wallet package, so let’s say OpenSUSE could try to be a bit more user-friendly in that regard.</p>



<h2>WiFi connection time</h2>



<p>While on the topic of WiFi I’ve observed one peculiar thing; that even after setting up pam_kwallet, WiFi connection took some time for initial handshake. After each boot, or resume from sleep, I would say it takes around 10 seconds for WiFi connection to be re-established. </p>



<p>Perhaps I am a bit too spoiled by the Fedora’s lightning speed. And perhaps this is KDE doing something weird. But both GNOME and KDE use NetworkManager underneath, so I guess there should theoretically be no difference between OpenSUSE KDE and Fedora GNOME, but that’s just in theory.</p>



<p><strong>Update</strong> – 2020-12-28: I tried to enable the option called “All users may connect to this network” in network settings in hope that will speed up (connect to wifi before the login), but unfortunately issue persists. </p>



<h2>Disk encryption</h2>



<p>As any sensible person, carrying laptop around in my backpack, I encrypt my whole disk using LUKS. Just in case device gets stolen or lost or whatever.</p>



<p>Due to the way how OpenSUSE has decided to implement the encryption on EFI based systems, each time I boot the system, I get prompted for a password… twice… </p>



<p>This is easily solve-able and is even described in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Encrypted_root_file_system" data-type="URL" data-id="https://en.opensuse.org/SDB:Encrypted_root_file_system" target="_blank">OpenSUSE Wiki article</a>. </p>



<p>Regardless, first one prompted by EFI is ugly as hell, while the second one is the nice one. Not sure how Fedora does it but I am used to their “flickerless boot” so much that I consider everything else “an regression”.</p>



<h2>Boot speed</h2>



<p>Oh, and also, that decryption process seems to be quite slow on my Ryzen CPU based laptop for some reason. I would bet it takes more than shown in the following excerpt from <code>systemd-analyze</code>. But that may just be an “perceived slowness” or something like that.</p>



<pre><code>ivan@swift3:~&gt; systemd-analyze blame | head -5
7.367s dracut-initqueue.service                                                              
6.836s systemd-cryptsetup@cr_nvme.service
 934ms dracut-pre-udev.service                                                               
 690ms display-manager.service                                                               
 601ms firewalld.service      </code></pre>



<p>As you can see, almost 15 second is spent in that initial phase, and I’d bet it takes another 20 or so after entering my password in EFI prompt. Anyhow, analyze command still shows quite concerning numbers on a laptop that boots other distributions (Arch, Fedora, Ubuntu…) in few seconds</p>



<pre><code>Startup finished in 5.125s (firmware) + 30.053s (loader) + 1.752s (kernel) + 9.070s (initrd) + 2.130s (userspace) = 48.132s 
graphical.target reached after 2.121s in userspace
</code></pre>



<h2>Screen backlight</h2>



<p>For some reason, backlight of the screen is not remembered across the reboots. Each time the system boots it starts with 0% which is quite dim. </p>



<pre><code>ivan@swift3:~&gt; sudo systemctl status systemd-backlight@backlight\:amdgpu_bl0.service 
● systemd-backlight@backlight:amdgpu_bl0.service - Load/Save Screen Backlight Brightness of backlight:amdgpu_bl0
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/systemd-backlight@.service; static)
     Active: active (exited) since Sun 2020-12-27 20:04:46 CET; 22min ago

Dec 27 20:04:46 swift3 systemd[1]: Finished Load/Save Screen Backlight Brightness of backlight:amdgpu_bl0.</code></pre>



<p>And although it says 10 is saved brightness, I’m not sure if that’s correct. Primarily as I don’t know what the unit of measurement is. If it’s percentage, then, it’s clearly a lie. This may be the issue with the GPU I have, but since it’s not latest Vega graphics, I’d hope that all things would be polished by now in recent kernel such as on the one Tumbleweed ships. Needless to say, this works fine on other distributions… </p>



<h2>Emacs</h2>



<p>One peculiar thing I’ve observed is that emacs package is already pre-installed, I guess due to some group selected while performing network install. I was very glad to see that. In order to get the GUI version though, you have to install separate package (<code>emacs-x11</code>), but that’s just fine.</p>



<h2>Package (un)install</h2>



<p>I was playing a bit with i3 window manager in combination with KDE, and that package pulled in few dependencies. Unfortunately, when removing the package those aren’t cleaned up automatically</p>



<pre><code>ivan@swift3:~&gt; sudo zypper remove i3
Reading installed packages...
Resolving package dependencies...

The following package is going to be REMOVED:
  i3

1 package to remove.
After the operation, 1.7 MiB will be freed.</code></pre>



<p>There’s a handy switch for the zypper command to clean those up (<code>-u</code>) but it seems it doesn’t work after you already uninstalled the package, so I, naturally, went through this charade: </p>



<pre><code>ivan@swift3:~&gt; sudo zypper remove -u
Too few arguments.
At least one package name is required.

ivan@swift3:~&gt; sudo zypper remove -u i3
Reading installed packages...
'i3' not found in package names. Trying capabilities.
No provider of 'i3' found.
Resolving package dependencies...

Nothing to do.


ivan@swift3:~&gt; sudo zypper in i3
Loading repository data...
Reading installed packages...
Resolving package dependencies...

The following NEW package is going to be installed:
  i3

1 new package to install.
Overall download size: 953.7 KiB. Already cached: 0 B. After the operation, additional 1.7 MiB will be used.

ivan@swift3:~&gt; sudo zypper remove -u i3
Reading installed packages...
Resolving package dependencies...

The following 16 packages are going to be REMOVED:
  dmenu i3 i3lock i3status libconfuse2 libev4 libstartup-notification-1-0 libxcb-xrm0 perl-AnyEvent perl-AnyEvent-I3 perl-common-sense perl-Guard
  perl-JSON perl-JSON-XS perl-Task-Weaken perl-Types-Serialiser

16 packages to remove.
After the operation, 3.9 MiB will be freed.</code></pre>



<h2>Conclusions</h2>



<p>So far I’ve noticed some things that OpenSUSE decides to do a bit differently, and even some rough edges as you can see, but I’ll continue my exploration and be open-minded. </p>



<p>Some things are really frustrating while others require a bit more playing to resolve them. In any case, if those were solved for me by the distribution maintainers, I’d be much happier with the distribution. </p>

    <p>Bloom filters are a data structure which allows you to test whether an element exists in a set, with lower memory usage and better access times than other hash table implementations. It is probabilistic, and while it can guarantee negative matches, there is a slight chance it returns a false positive match. Through clever mathematical assumptions, we can produce constraints to minimise the chance of a false positive.</p>

<h2 id="description">Description</h2>

<p>Let there be a set of elements $N$, and we wish to store each element $e \in N$ in the set $F$. To do this, we introduce the set $K$ which has $k$ number of hash functions which hash the same element to <em>different</em> values.</p>

<p>In the following example, elements $x$ and $y$ are hashed by $k = 3$ hash functions.</p>

<p><img src="http://andybui01.github.io/images/bloom-filter/figure1.png" width="200"></p>

<p>Next, we introduce the bit array $M$ which has $m$ bits. This bit array is the underlying data structure that represents $F$, and we say an element $e$ is in $F$ if all of its corresponding bits (after hashing) in the bit array are set.</p>

<p>In the following image, $x$ is in $F$ hence all of its hashed bits within $M$ are set. Only one of $y$â€™s hashed bits are set so it is not in $F$. $x$ and $y$ are also sharing a bit at $M[4]$.</p>

<p><img src="http://andybui01.github.io/images/bloom-filter/figure2.png" width="400"></p>

<p>As we hash more elements from $N$, more bits are set to 1 in $M$ and eventually we get a <em>false positive</em> when testing set membership. This occurs when all of an elementâ€™s bits are set, although it was never inserted.</p>

<p>Consider the following scenario: $x$ and $y$ are in $F$, $z$ is not. However, $z$â€™s hashed bits are all set, giving the (false) impression that $z$ is in $F$.</p>

<p><img src="http://andybui01.github.io/images/bloom-filter/figure3.png" width="500"></p>

<p>Once an element is placed in $F$, it will remain there, as flipping bits to remove an element introduces the possibility of false negatives. We will show that there exists optimal parameters, $k$ hash functions and $m$ length bit array, to lower the false positive rate $\epsilon$.</p>



<h2 id="proof">Proof</h2>
<p>Note: This section is pretty math heavy, if you just want to look at the cool tables and graphs then you can skip ahead to <a href="#implementation-and-benchmarks">here</a>.</p>

<p>$\newcommand{\pbrac}[1]{\left(#1\right)}$
$\newcommand{\sbrac}[1]{\left[#1\right]}$</p>

<h3 id="first-attempt">First attempt</h3>
<p>Assume that a hash function in $K$ maps to each array position with <em>equal probability</em>. The probability that a bit is not set by a hash function during the insertion of an element is:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    1 - \frac{1}{m}.
\end{align}</p>

<p>The probability that every hash function in $K$ leaves a certain bit at 0 will be</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right)^k \approx \ e^{-k/m}.
\end{align}</p>

<p>Thus, after inserting $n$ elements, the probability that a bit is <em>still</em> 0 is</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right)^{kn} \approx \ e^{-kn/m} \ = \ p,
\end{align}</p>

<p>and the probability that a bit is 1 after $n$ insertions is</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \left( 1 - \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right]^{kn} \right) \approx \left( 1 - p \right).
\end{align}</p>

<p>Next, we test set membership for an element NOT in the set. Following $n$ insertions, each bit in the array has a chance of being set to 1 with the probability above. The probability that $k$ bits are set to 1, which would lead to a false positive result for set membership, is often referred to as the error/false positive rate:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \epsilon = \left( 1 - \left[ 1 - \frac{1}{m} \right]^{kn} \right)^k \approx \left( 1 - p \right)^k.
\end{align}</p>

<p>There exists a major problem with this analysis, however. At the start we made an assumption that all bits would be set randomly and independently. <strong>This is not correct</strong> as we have established that <em>all</em> our hash functions in $K$ will not hash an element to the same array position. For example, if we have hashed an element $m-1$ times into $m-1$ different positions, then the remaining $1$ bit in the array is guaranteed to be chosen, if we wish to retain an even spread of hashed values. Concretely, the $k$ bit array positions for each element are in fact <em>dependent</em>.</p>

<h3 id="another-try-using-poisson-approximations">Another try using Poisson approximations</h3>

<p>Consider a â€œballs and binsâ€� scenario where each throw of a ball into a bin is equivalent to hashing an element to an array position.</p>

<p>We have the following 2 cases:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Exact case:</strong> $n$ balls are thrown into $m$ bins independently and uniformly at random</li>
  <li><strong>Poisson case:</strong> number of balls in each bin are taken to be independent Poisson random variables with an expected value</li>
</ul>

<p>Weâ€™ll be using the following corollaries from the book <em>â€œProbability and computing: randomization and probabilistic techniques in algorithms and data analysisâ€�</em> by Mitzenmacher and Upfal.</p>

<p><strong>Corollary 4.6:</strong> Let $X_1,â€¦,X_n$ be independent Poisson trials such that $P(X_i = 1) = p_i$. Let $X = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{ and } \mu = E(X)$. For $0 &lt; \delta &lt; 1$. [p. 71]
\begin{align}
    P\left(\left|X - \mu\right| \geq \delta \mu\right) \leq 2\exp{\left(-\frac{\mu\delta^2}{3}\right)}
\end{align}</p>

<p><strong>Corollary 5.9:</strong> any event that takes place with probability $p$ in the Poisson case takes place with probability at most $p e \sqrt{n}$ in the exact case. [p. 109]</p>

<p>Each bin corresponds to an array position and thus a bit being set to 0 is equivalent to an empty bin in our scenario. The fraction of bits being set to 0 after $n$ insertions is therefore equivalent to the fraction of empty bins after $kn$ balls have been thrown into $m$ bins.</p>

<p>We define $X$ as the number of empty bins after the balls have been thrown into $n$ bins, such that</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    X =&amp; \ \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i, \\
    \text{where } X_i =&amp; \
    \begin{cases}
        1 &amp; \text{if bin is empty} \\
        0 &amp; \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>then we can define</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    p' =&amp; \ \left( 1 - \frac{1}{m}\right)^{kn}, \\
    E(X) =&amp; \ mp'.
\end{align}\]

</p><p>In the Poisson case, each bin can be thought of as an independent Poisson random variable with expected value $pâ€™$. Therefore, we can apply \textbf{corollary 4.6} and $E(X) = \ mpâ€™$ to obtain the following:</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    P\left( \left| X - mpâ€™\right| \geq \delta mpâ€™\right) \ \leq&amp; \ 2\exp{\left(-\frac{mpâ€™\delta^2}{3}\right)}
\end{align}
Let $\delta \ = \ \beta / pâ€™, \ $choose small$ \ \beta$
\begin{align}
    \therefore \ P\left( \left| X - mpâ€™\right| \geq \beta m\right) \ \leq&amp; \ 2\exp{\left(-\frac{m\beta^2}{3pâ€™}\right)}
\end{align}</p>

<p>We then apply <strong>corollary 5.9</strong> to obtain</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    P\left( \left| X - mp'\right| \geq \beta m\right) \ \leq&amp; \ 2e\sqrt{kn} \exp{\left(-\frac{m\beta^2}{3p'}\right)}\\
    \leq&amp; \ 0.000001 \ \text{when $m$ sufficiently large.}
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Essentially, taking the probability of an event using a Poisson approximation for all of the bins and multiplying it by $e\sqrt{kn}$ gives an upper bound for the probability of the event when $kn$ balls are thrown into $m$ bins (the exact case where events are independent).</p>

<p>This result tells us that when $m$ is sufficiently large, the fraction of empty bins $X/m$ is <em>very</em> close to $pâ€™$. And since $pâ€™ \approx p$ we can use $p$ to continue predicting actual performance.</p>

<h3 id="optimal-k">Optimal <em>k</em></h3>

<p>The false positive rate is $\epsilon = (1-p)^k$ and we look for a $k$ that minimizes $\epsilon$. Rearranging $\epsilon$ gives us</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    \epsilon \ =&amp; \ \pbrac{1-p}^k \\
    =&amp; \ \exp{\pbrac{\ln{\pbrac{\sbrac{1-p}^k}}}} \\
    =&amp; \ \exp{\pbrac{k\ln{\pbrac{\sbrac{1-p}}}}} \\
    =&amp; \ \exp{\pbrac{k\ln{\pbrac{\sbrac{1-e^{-kn/m}}}}}}.
\end{align}\]

</p><p>If we let $g = k\ln{\pbrac{1-e^{-kn/m}}}$ so that $\epsilon = e^g$, then minimizing the false positive $\epsilon$ is equivalent to minimizing $g$ with respect to $k$. We have</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    \frac{dg}{dk}\ =&amp; \ \ln \left(1-e^{-\frac{nk}{m}}\right)+\frac{kn \cdot e^{-\frac{nk}{m}}}{m\left(1-e^{-\frac{nk}{m}}\right)}.
\end{align}</p>

<p>Solving this derivative when it is 0 and finding the global minimum gives us</p>

<p>\begin{align}
    k = \frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}.
\end{align}</p>

<h3 id="optimal-m">Optimal <em>m</em></h3>
<p>To find an optimal length for our bit-array we substitute $k = \frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}$ into our false positive equation and get</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
    \epsilon \ =&amp; \ \pbrac{1-e^{-\ln 2}}^{\frac{m}{n}\ln 2} \\
    \ln\epsilon \ =&amp; \ \frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}\ln\pbrac{1-e^{-\ln 2}} \\
    =&amp; \ \frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}\ln{\frac{1}{2}} \\
    =&amp; \ -\frac{m}{n}\ln\pbrac{2}^2 \\
    \therefore m \ =&amp; \ \frac{-n\ln\epsilon}{\ln\pbrac{2}^2}.
\end{align}\]

</p><p>This effectively leaves $\epsilon$ as the only unknown variable left. However, when we consider the Bloom filter in a practical context, we will most likely have a false positive rate in mind, and can treat it as a constant.</p>



<h2 id="implementation-and-benchmarks">Implementation and benchmarks</h2>

<h3 id="overview">Overview</h3>
<p>We will be comparing the Bloom filter against 4 popular and efficient implementations of hash tables:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Google Dense Hash Set</li>
  <li>Google Sparse Hash Set</li>
  <li>TSL Robin Set</li>
  <li>STD Unordered Set</li>
</ul>

<p>Implementations were compared based on time performance (insert, read) and memory performance (inserts). Currently, only small strings (15 characters) and medium strings (50 characters) are used for input, with up to $n = 3\times10^6$ elements for each test. Each test was performed 5 times for each implementation and an average-of-5 was used in the final table/graph. The false positive rate is set to 0.01.</p>

<p>Benchmarking was done using gccâ€™s C++ compiler and the following command was run to compile: g++ -Iinclude -std=c++11 -O3. In addition, the tests were performed on a computer with the following specs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>AMD Ryzen 5 2600 3.4GHz 6 core</li>
  <li>8GB DDR4-2666 CL19</li>
</ul>

<p>The tests were run with the false positive rate $\epsilon = 0.01$</p>



<h3 id="insert-small-string-15-bytes">Insert small string (15 bytes)</h3>

<p>Before the test, we generate a vector of $n$ small strings and then insert each string as an entry into the sets, measuring the performance of said insert operation. The Bloom filterâ€™s only overhead during insertion is setting bits to 1.</p>

<p><img src="http://andybui01.github.io/images/bloom-filter/insert_small_string.png" width="700"></p>



<h3 id="read-small-string-15-bytes">Read small string (15 bytes)</h3>

<p>Before the test, we generate a vector of $n$ small strings and pre-load the strings into the hash tables. We then traverse the same vector of small strings, testing set membership and timing said read operation.</p>

						<p>In a review <a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/full/10.1289/EHP7171">published in Environmental Health Perspectives</a>, Microplastics (MPs) are laid out as a serious problem in the marine environment as well as human food consumption.</p><p>The study analyzed 69 experiments across mollusks, crustaceans, fish and echinodermata. The data show that seafood is a major cause of human exposure to MPs. Levels of MP contamination vary significantly in different phylum of organisms. </p><p>Microplastics are tiny pieces of any kind of plastic found in the environment less than 5mm long according to NOAA and the European Chemicals Agency.

In name alone they are contradictory; so many of the statements aren’t obviously true, but are instead slogans or inflammatory rhetoric. The phrases aren’t copyrighted by the artist. The typography, layout, format are recognizable but basic.</p><p>I like a lot of the truisms that draw a contrast. This one, for example: “It’s better to be naive than jaded.” Are these things even in opposition? Can one be both, or neither? It’s better for who?</p><p>It rumbles around like a koan in my mind.</p><p>I’m not old, but I’m old enough to have done a lot of things a few times: jobs, relationships, places. I’ve started to be tempted to draw conclusions from these experiences. Some things work, others don’t. By avoiding the improbable paths and going with what works, what fits the patterns in history, I’ll learn from history.</p><p>We have a saying for that, from <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/George_Santayana#Vol._I,_Reason_in_Common_Sense">George Santayana</a>: “Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it.” But our memory is post-Gutenberg and post-Internet, and I think we can say that a lot of history is cyclical by nature, not just because of our carelessness.</p><p>I am struck by how many big, intimidating things I did when I was younger, simply because I didn’t know to be intimidated by them and I had time and privilege. How many of those projects would I embark on now, knowing that to <em>really</em> finish might be impossible?</p><p>Conversely, I look back on ideas and projects that seemed infeasible a few years ago or that have been tried a hundred times without success. But then someone, unaware of history, tries for the hundred and first time, and it works. If they were scholars of history, they’d know about the failures, how people more talented and resourced than them had tried. They would avoid the idea altogether.</p><p>But ideas don’t live in a vacuum - they exist in a changing world, in which culture, technology, and trends change how well they’ll work. How much do those things matter? At least a bit. At the extreme of that opinion lies <a href="http://crnano.org/interview.kurzweil.htm">Ray Kurzweil</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I quickly realized that timing is the critical factor in the success of inventions. Most technology projects fail not because the technology doesn’t work, but because the timing is wrong – not all of the enabling factors are at play where they are needed.</p></blockquote><p>When I work now, when I write or create, I often feel like I know more of the map than I knew before. Failure dims some paths, success lights up others, leading me one way or another. Failure is jadedness, success might be knowledge.</p><p>But I think we need to make a conscious effort to realize: every time is different. Even if you put the same effort in and make the same decisions, the world, the people in it, and you, have all changed. What worked before, might not work now. The idea that failed before, well - maybe its day has come.</p></div></div>]]>

								<p>I have a Ph.D. in Women’s Studies, but I’m not woke anymore. I write under a pseudonym because, if my colleagues were to find out about my criticisms of this field, I would be unable to find any employment in academia. That someone who critiques the axioms of a field of study feels compelled to write under an assumed name tells you everything you need to know about the authoritarianism underpinning this ideology. I no longer believe that the fundamental ideas of Women’s Studies, and of Critical Social Justice more generally, describe reality; they are at best partial explanations—hyperbolic ideology, not fact-based analysis. I have seen this ideology up close and seen how it consumes and even destroys people, while dehumanizing anyone who dissents.</p>
<p>I’m sad to say it, but I believe that Critical Social Justice ideology—if not beaten in the war of ideas—will destroy the liberal foundation of American society. By liberal I mean principles including, but not limited to, constitutional republican government, equality under the law, due process, a commitment to reason and science, individual liberty, and freedom—of speech, of the press, and of religion. Because Critical Social Justice ideology is now the dominant paradigm in American academia, it has flowed into all other major societal institutions, the media, and even corporations. Far from being counter-cultural, Critical Social Justice ideology is now the cultural mainstream. A diverse spectrum of liberals, libertarians, conservatives, and all others who, to put it bluntly, want the American constitution to continue to serve as the basis for our society have to team up to prevent this ideology from destroying our country.</p>
<p>I became “woke” around 2003, so I have nearly two decades of experience with Critical Social Justice ideology. As the oldest daughter in a working-class family with six kids, neither of my parents had a college degree, although my mom had taken some community college classes. My high school teachers emphasized the importance of going to college. While I wasn’t sure what opportunities a college education would bring, I decided that it would best to attend, given the urgency with which all the teachers and guidance counselors discussed college as a necessity. I was a good, not great, student, who scored highly very highly on the verbal component of standardized tests. I loved literature and writing, so I figured that I’d get a bachelor’s degree in English literature, then maybe find a job as an administrative assistant and write in my free time. For a seventeen year-old girl who wasn’t especially ambitious, it seemed like a decent plan. At least it was better, I thought, than continuing to work part-time as a waitress. And through a combination of scholarships and part-time work, I realized that I’d be able to complete a bachelor’s degree without incurring any debt.</p>
<p>When I began attending college classes in 2000, I registered for a Western civilization course and fell in love with the Greek and Roman classics, so I continued to take additional courses of this type. The twentieth-century Western civilization course was taught by a very personable and funny women’s studies professor. I don’t think it is widely understood that first-generation college students, in general, don’t know the politics behind who becomes university professors. I naively assumed that professors are among the smartest people in the country, and I had no idea that the professoriate is heavily slanted to the ideological left. I now understand that Critical Social Justice professors are evangelists for their faith and the university is their mission field. Their goal is to take young students—inexperienced, eager to succeed—unmoor them from any faith tradition they might have, even if it’s just American civics, and replace that with Critical Social Justice ideology. And, for the most part, these professors succeed. They are, on the whole, likable people—energetic, personable, and caring.</p>
<p>My first encounters with Critical Social Justice came during the feminism unit of this course, which included works by Simone de Beauvoir, Betty Friedan, Angela Davis, bell hooks, and Shulamith Firestone, among others. I was interested in learning about feminism, but Firestone’s argument to eliminate the biological family alarmed me, as I hoped to have both a career and children someday. Also, I didn’t believe Firestone’s argument that motherhood is inherently oppressive. From witnessing my mom’s own experiences with having six kids, I knew that she wasn’t oppressed. It was a choice she freely made because she loved children and felt that taking care of them, in spite of the difficulties, was rewarding. In spite of my reservations about Firestone’s book, I became interested in learning more about feminism and began to check out more women’s studies books from the library. As a young university student, encountering Critical Social Justice ideas felt intoxicating, like stumbling onto a portal into a new world. I felt like a detective, with my newly developing <a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-critical-consciousness/"><span>critical consciousness</span></a> understanding society for the first time—all the oppression, the sexism, racism, the evils of capitalism, and so on. It felt righteous, like I was part of a counter-cultural movement, a vanguard helping to bend the arc of the moral universe toward justice.</p>
<p>The women’s studies professor, sensing that she had an acolyte, encouraged my interest in becoming more involved in advocacy for women. Over the summer, I worked as an intern at a feminist nonprofit and met a lot of people on the radical left, including anarchists. Around this time, I attended a few protests for various causes, but after a couple of years with this ideology as my guiding framework, I grew exhausted by feeling constant anger. I became tired of focusing on all the injustices of the world, not on what I had to be grateful for. It was a miserable, resentment-based life, and I felt helpless to solve the world’s problems.</p>
<p>My foray into radical politics ended around the time I started a master’s program in creative writing. I focused on reading literature and my colleagues’ works, which were complex and nuanced, not ideologically motivated in the slightest degree. After finishing my master’s degree, I taught writing as a college lecturer for a couple of years, then decided to apply for Ph.D. programs in hopes that having a doctorate would increase my pay. One of the most galling forms of hypocrisy I’ve experienced is that leftist professors claim a commitment to “social justice,” yet the academic departments they run employ large numbers of underpaid adjunct instructors who are closed out of the high pay and job security of the tenured radicals.</p>
<p>When I began my Ph.D. program in 2013 at a highly ranked university, I began to see that something about my new colleagues was different from what I remembered about my colleagues just a few years earlier. At first, I chalked this up to the fact that I was a handful of years older than most of the students, many of whom had recently completed their undergraduate degrees. They seemed angry, self-righteous, and determined, lacking the intellectual humility that I had admired so much in the friends I’d made in my master’s program. I now realize that these students were “woke.” Having spent the past couple of years teaching writing to working-class students, I hadn’t been exposed to Critical Social Justice ideology in some time, and I was surprised to see the inroads it had made in the decade since I’d first encountered it.</p>
<p>I realized that Critical Social Justice was no longer a fringe intellectual field of study, but a real force that was reshaping the university. Early on in my program, I recall a panic about racism at the university, and many students issued social media demands of the administration to increase minority enrollment. While I fully support that goal, I feel that such efforts are best advanced through mentoring and guiding promising young students beginning in elementary school, not waiting until they reach adulthood and then attempting to force equal outcomes. Around this time, I became extremely disturbed when, while serving on a committee that gave writing awards, I was attacked by other committee members for judging on merit, for not taking into account skin color or gender.</p>
<p>Yet I don’t think I fully understand the authoritarian aspects of woke ideology until after Trump won the 2016 election. In late 2016 and early 2017, I witnessed shocking behavior from my colleagues, who began attacking Republicans, white people, conservatives, and Christians as oppressors. They attacked free speech, saying that some people did not deserve a platform because they were engaging in “<a href="https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-hate-speech/"><span>hate speech</span></a>.” I argued that there isn’t a clear definition of what constitutes hate speech; and that the constitution protects all speech, save for incitement to imminent lawless action. For saying this, I was attacked as stupid, a bad person, a “right-winger.” Early in Trump’s administration, one of my colleagues said that political violence was justified as a response to his “evil” policies. While I’m no fan of Trump, I oppose violence—a basic principle I thought that all Americans shared. It was in this context that I became disillusioned with the ideology in which I had been immersed for years.</p>
<p>I decided to seek out and try to understand other points of view, so I read books by authors to whom I had never been exposed, such as F.A. Hayek, Ronald Bork, Jonathan Haidt, Thomas Sowell, and others. I began to read and listen to conservative, classically liberal, and libertarian thinkers—people whose ideas I had never encountered in all my years of so-called “higher” education. I listened with an open mind, and I didn’t see any hatred from these thinkers. On the contrary, I discovered carefully reasoned, evidence-based arguments that had much greater explanatory abilities …</p></section></div></div></div>

<p>
  Cosmopolitan makes C a build-once run-anywhere language, similar to
  Java, except it doesn't require interpreters or virtual machines be
  installed beforehand. Cosmo provides the same portability benefits as
  high-level languages like Go and Rust, but it doesn't invent a new
  language and you won't need to configure a CI system to build separate
  binaries for each operating system. What Cosmopolitan focuses on is
  fixing C by decoupling it from platforms, so it can be pleasant to use
  for writing small unix programs that are easily distributed to a much
  broader audience.

  The above command fixes GCC so it outputs portable binaries that will
  run on every Linux distro in addition to Mac OS X, Windows NT,
  FreeBSD, and OpenBSD too. For details on how this works, please read
  the <a title="Actually Portable Executable" href="https://justine.lol/ape.html">αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε</a> blog post. This
  novel binary format is also optional: conventional ELF binaries can be
  compiled too by removing the <code>-Wl,--oformat=binary</code> flag.

</p><p>
  Your program will also boot on bare metal too. In other words, you've
  written a normal textbook C program, and thanks to Cosmopolitan's
  low-level linker magic, you've effectively created your own operating
  system which happens to run on all the existing ones as well. Now
  that's something no one's done before.

</p><h3>Performance</h3>

<p>
  Cosmopolitan has been optimized by hand for excellent performance on
  modern desktops and servers. Compared with glibc, you should expect
  Cosmopolitan to be almost as fast, but with an order of a magnitude
  tinier code size. Compared with Musl or Newlib, you can expect that
  Cosmopolitan will generally go much faster, while having roughly the
  same code size, if not tinier.

</p><p>
  In the case of the most important libc function, memcpy(),
  Cosmopolitan outperformed every other open source library tested. The
  chart below shows how quickly memory is transferred depending on the
  size of the copy. Since it's log scale, each grid square represents a
  2x difference in performance. What makes Cosmopolitan so fast here is
  it uses uses several different memory copying strategies. For small
  sizes it uses an indirect branch with overlapping moves; for medium
  sizes it uses simd vectors, and for large copies it uses nontemporal
  hints which prevent cache thrash. Other libraries usually fall short
  because they use a one-size-fits-all strategy. For example, Newlib
  goes 10x slower for the optimal block size (half L1 cache) because it
  always does nontemporal moves.

</p><p>
  <a href="https://justine.lol/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png">
    <img width="960" height="540" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/cosmopolitan/memcpy.png" alt="memcpy() performance for varying n values"></a>

</p><h3>Trickle-Down Performance</h3>

<p>
  Performing the best on benchmarks isn't enough. Cosmopolitan also uses
  a second technique that the above benchmark doesn't measure, which we
  call "trickle-down performance". For an example of how that works,
  consider the following common fact about C which is often overlooked.
  External function calls such as the following:

</p><pre>memcpy(foo, bar, n);
</pre>

<p>
  Are roughly equivalent to the following assembly, which leads
  compilers to assume that most cpu state is clobbered:

</p><pre><span>asm volatile</span>(<span>"call memcpy"</span>
             : <span>"=a"</span>(rax), <span>"=D"</span>(rdi), <span>"=S"</span>(rsi), <span>"=d"</span>(rdx)
             : <span>"1"</span>(foo), <span>"2"</span>(bar), <span>"3"</span>(n)
             : <span>"rcx"</span>, <span>"r8"</span>, <span>"r9"</span>, <span>"r10"</span>, <span>"r11"</span>, <span>"memory"</span>, <span>"cc"</span>,
               <span>"xmm0"</span>, <span>"xmm1"</span>, <span>"xmm2"</span>, <span>"xmm3"</span>, <span>"xmm4"</span>, <span>"xmm5"</span>, <span>"xmm6"</span>);
</pre>

<p>
  In other words the compiler assumes that, in calling the function,
  fifteen separate registers and all memory will be overwritten. See
  the <a href="https://www.uclibc.org/docs/psABI-x86_64.pdf">System V
  ABI</a> for further details. This can be problematic for
  frequently-called functions such as memcpy, since it inhibits many
  optimizations and it tosses a wrench in the compiler register
  allocation algorithm, thus causing stack spillage which further
  degrades performance while bloating the output binary size.

</p><p>
  So what Cosmopolitan does for memcpy() and many other
  frequently-called core library leaf functions, is defining a simple
  macro wrapper, which tells the compiler the correct subset of the abi
  that's actually needed, e.g.

</p><pre><span>#define</span> memcpy(DEST, SRC, N) ({       \
  void *Dest = (DEST);                \
  void *Src = (SRC);                  \
  size_t Size = (N);                  \
  <span>asm</span>(<span>"call memcpy"</span>                   \
      : <span>"=m"</span>(*(<span>char</span>(*)[Size])(Dest))  \
      : <span>"D"</span>(Dest), <span>"S"</span>(Src), <span>"d"</span>(n),  \
        <span>"m"</span>(*(<span>char</span>(*)[Size])(Src))    \
      : <span>"rcx"</span>, <span>"xmm3"</span>, <span>"xmm4"</span>, <span>"cc"</span>); \
    Dest;                             \
  })
</pre>

<p>
  What this means, is that Cosmopolitan memcpy() is not simply fast, it
  also makes unrelated code in the functions that call it faster too as
  a side-effect. When this technique was first implemented for memcpy()
  alone, many of the functions in the Cosmopolitan codebase had their
  generated code size reduced by a third.

</p><p>
  For an example of one such function, consider <code>strlcpy</code>,
  which is the BSD way of saying <code>strcpy</code>:

</p><pre><span>/**
 * Copies string, the BSD way.
 *
 * <span>@param</span> d is buffer which needn't be initialized
 * <span>@param</span> s is a NUL-terminated string
 * <span>@param</span> n is byte capacity of d
 * <span>@return</span> strlen(s)
 * <span>@note</span> d and s can't overlap
 * <span>@note</span> we prefer memccpy()
 */</span>
<span>size_t</span> strlcpy(<span>char</span> *d, <span>const</span> <span>char</span> *s, <span>size_t</span> n) {
  <span>size_t</span> slen, actual;
  slen = strlen(s);
  if (n) {
    actual = MIN(n - 1, slen);
    memcpy(d, s, actual);
    d[actual] = <span>'\0'</span>;
  }
  <span>return</span> slen;
}
</pre>

<p>
  If we compile our <code>strlcpy</code> function, then here's the
  assembly code that the compiler outputs:

<p>
  That's a huge improvement in generated code size. The above two
  compiles used the same gcc flags and no changes to the code needed to
  be made. All that changed was we used cosmopolitan.h (instead of the
  platform c library string.h) which contains ABI specialization macros
  for <code>memcpy</code> and <code>strlen</code>. It's a great example
  of how merely choosing a better C library can systemically eliminate
  bloat throughout your entire codebase.

<p>I've been meaning to get around to setting up a blog for a long time. In the past, I've gotten as far as getting halfway through trying out different static site generators before getting depressed about my lack of frontend design chops and given up. </p>
<p>The perfect storm finally came: </p>
<ol>
<li>I took <strong>two weeks off</strong>. After recharging my batteries for a few days, I was ready for a little side project. </li>
<li>I recently discovered <a href="https://obsidian.md/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Obsidian</a>, which is a dope AF note-taking app. </li>
<li>I've tried a decent number of static site generators to build documentation for various projects and wanted to take a deeper dive into <a href="https://gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Gatsby</a>. </li>
<li>I recently discovered <a href="https://pipedream.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Pipedream</a> and wanted to use it for something. </li>
</ol>
<p>I wanted to see if i could use Obsidian as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_management_system" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">content management system (CMS)</a> for a tech blog and Pipedream to automate tweeting out new blog posts. </p>

<h2 id="obsidian"><a href="#obsidian" aria-label="obsidian permalink"></a>Obsidian</h2>
<p>I'll keep this short.  Maybe a future blog post will talk about Obsidian in a lot more detail. For now, let me just say that I've tried to get into taking notes for... a long time. I could never do it in college. I struggle to do it for work. I've always found that taking notes takes away from my ability to absorb the content in the moment and make meaningful contributions. </p>
<p>Obsidian was the first app that actually made me <strong>want</strong> to take notes. The general idea is that all your notes are written in markdown. Jumping around is super easy with <code>CMD + O</code> (which also will create pages for you if they don't exist).  Linking between pages to build connections is really easy as can be with a syntax like <code>[[this]]</code>. Obsidian builds a visual graph of the relationships between pages (I'm a sucker for graphs). And finally, you can build templates and insert them with <code>CMD + T</code>. Templates dramatically simplified the boiler plate needed to capture who's attending a meeting, agenda, the date, etc. </p>
<p>Long story short, try it out.  (Or don't, whatever.)  I'm a fan and thought that maybe if I can use it as the interface for writing blog posts that I might <em>actually</em> write some. </p>
<h3 id="automated-backups"><a href="#automated-backups" aria-label="automated backups permalink"></a>Automated Backups</h3>
<p>Obsidian has some 3rd-party plugins that do nifty things.  One of these plugins is called <a href="https://github.com/denolehov/obsidian-git" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Obsidian Git</a> which can automatically backup your notes to a Git repository.</p>
<p>I figured that had to be a way to fetch markdown content from a remote github repository and use it as a content source for Gatsby. There was.</p>
<h3 id="defining-post-information"><a href="#defining-post-information" aria-label="defining post information permalink"></a>Defining Post Information</h3>
<p>Blog post information is defined through the markdown frontmatter.  For example, the frontmatter for this blog post: </p>
<div data-language="yaml"><pre><code><span>---</span>
<span>title</span><span>:</span> The buzzword.engineering Tech Stack
<span>date</span><span>:</span> <span>"12/26/2020"</span>
<span>publish</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>
<span>template</span><span>:</span> <span>"post"</span>
<span>slug</span><span>:</span> blog<span>-</span>tech<span>-</span>stack
<span>description</span><span>:</span> <span>"I finally got around to putting a blog together that uses Obsidian, Gatsby, and automates tweeting out new posts with Pipedream."</span>
<span>---</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="gatsby"><a href="#gatsby" aria-label="gatsby permalink"></a>Gatsby</h2>
<p>I think it's important to start here by saying that I'm <strong>not</strong> a frontend developer. Well, let's rephrase that. I'm writing a blog post that has Gatsby in it.  So it's probably more accurate to say that I'm a <em>very</em> junior frontend developer. </p>
<p>My mental model for Gatsby so far is that it's a framework for building static site generators. There might be a couple frontend purists or gatsby enthusiasts out there who take issue with that definition, please let me know if you've got a better one down in the comments. </p>
<p>There are two main components of Gatsby that drew me to it: </p>
<ol>
<li>It uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">React</a>, which is a lot more powerful to me over something like <a href="https://handlebarsjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">handlebars</a> or go-based html templating. </li>
<li>Gatsby is extensible with a rich plugin ecosystem that contribute to a shared <a href="https://graphql.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GraphQL</a> data layer. When developing your site, you can query the data layer to fetch content for particular pages/components.</li>
</ol>
<p>I like React and I think Gatsby's extensibility framework and GraphQL data layer is <strong>brilliant</strong>. </p>
<h3 id="the-starter"><a href="#the-starter" aria-label="the starter permalink"></a>The Starter</h3>
<p>Another great thing about Gatsby is their concept of Starters. For this blog, I kicked things off with the <a href="https://github.com/alxshelepenok/gatsby-starter-lumen" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">gatsby-starter-lumen</a>. </p>
<h3 id="fetching-content"><a href="#fetching-content" aria-label="fetching content permalink"></a>Fetching Content</h3>
<p>The first thing I had to customize was content sources. The Lumen starter fetches content from the same repository as the blog itself. Thankfully, there's a Gatsby plugin called <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-source-git" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>gatsby-source-git</code></a> that allows you to fetch content from a remote Git repository. </p>
<p>During development, I wanted to be able to fetch content from the local copy of the Obsidian backup repository. Gatsby plugins are done by exporting a javascript object from a file called <code>gatsby-config.js</code>.  </p>
<p>Here, I toggle between using the <code>gatsby-source-git</code> plugin and the [<code>gatsby-source-filesystem</code>] based on whether a <code>GATSBY_PREVIEW</code> environment variable is set. </p>
<div data-language="js"><pre><code><span>if</span><span>(</span>process<span>.</span>env<span>.</span><span>GATSBY_PREVIEW</span> <span>==</span> <span>"true"</span><span>)</span><span>{</span>

<p>Comments on blog posts are made possible through a nifty tool called <a href="https://utteranc.es/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">utteranc.es</a>. It's a GitHub Application that uses GitHub Issue threads per blog post to track comments. </p>
<h3 id="post-filtering"><a href="#post-filtering" aria-label="post filtering permalink"></a>Post Filtering</h3>
<p>In the spirit of premature optimization, I wanted to integrate a way to filter blog posts with fuzzy-searching. To accomplish this, I integrated <a href="https://fusejs.io/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Fuse.js</a> and added a new <code>Filter</code> component to the blog. </p>
<p>Most of the logic for how this was accomplished can be seen in the <a href="https://github.com/steven-terrana/steven-terrana.github.io/blob/main/src/templates/index-template.js" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Index Template</a>.</p>

<p>With the site actually working how I wanted it to, I got to focus on the side of things I'm actually good at: digital duct tape. The goal is for changes in markdown content in the Obsidian backup repository to trigger a deployment of the site and if there is a new blog post, to send out a tweet letting you all know about it. </p>
<h3 id="step-1-github-action-on-the-obsidian-backup-repo"><a href="#step-1-github-action-on-the-obsidian-backup-repo" aria-label="step 1 github action on the obsidian backup repo permalink"></a>Step 1: GitHub Action on the Obsidian Backup Repo</h3>
<p>First things first, the content repository needs to trigger a deployment of the site. The easiest way I could think to accomplish this would be to a GitHub Action on the blog post repository that does the build/deploy logic. </p>
<p>This meant that I needed a way to invoke a GitHub Action on one repository as part of the execution of an Action on another repository. This is where the <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#repository_dispatch" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><code>repository_dispatch</code></a> event comes in handy. Basically, it means that you can use the GitHub API to trigger an Action. </p>
<p>Here's what the GitHub Action workflow looks like for the obsidian repository: </p>
<div data-language="yaml"><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> Trigger Build
<span>on</span><span>:</span>
  
  <span>push</span><span>:</span>
    <span>branches</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span> main <span>]</span>

<p>Sweet. Now commits to the Obsidian backup repository will trigger actions on the blog repository. </p>
<p>The next step was to automate the build and deployment steps using a GitHub Action on the blog repository. Here's what that action looks like: </p>
<div data-language="yaml"><pre><code><span>name</span><span>:</span> Build and Publish

          <span>force_orphan</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span>  </code></pre></div>
<p>This blog is hosted using GitHub Pages, so you'll notice a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>I add a custom <code>CNAME</code> file to the <code>public</code> directory so that GitHub Pages knows the custom domain for this blog.  (I should definitely incorporate this into an inherit part of the build of the site using the <code>onPostBuild</code> Gatsby Node API method or something). </li>
<li>I use the <code>peaceiris/actions-gh-pages</code> action to publish the site. </li>
</ol>
<p>All in all, this was a pretty painless setup. </p>
<h3 id="step-3-automating-tweets"><a href="#step-3-automating-tweets" aria-label="step 3 automating tweets permalink"></a>Step 3: Automating Tweets</h3>
<p>So at this point, we've got content changes automatically getting deployed to GitHub Pages. The whole process takes about <strong>three minutes</strong> from commit to publish. </p>
<p>The last piece was to automate letting all of you know about the whatever new insightful thing I had to say! </p>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: If you want to win at HORSE, it’s generally a much better strategy to attempt high percentage shots. It almost never makes sense to shoot crazy half-court shots or behind-the-back shots. As a general rule of thumb, never attempt shots that you can’t shoot at &gt;50%.</p>

<hr>

<p><br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variations_of_basketball#H-O-R-S-E">HORSE</a> is a popular basketball shooting game. The main choice a HORSE player must make is which spots on the basketball court to attempt shots from. What’s the best strategy to win at HORSE?</p>

</ul>

<h3 id="game-rules">Game rules</h3>
<p>The version of HORSE I’m analysing here involves two players. In the beginning, it’s Player 1’s turn. The player whose turn it is will be called “C”, and the other player will be called “O”.</p>
<ol>
  <li>C picks a spot on the basketball court and attempts a shot.
    <ul>
      <li>If C misses the shot, it is O’s turn, and we go back to 1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If C makes the shot, O must now attempt the same shot.
    <ul>
      <li>If O makes the shot, C’s turn continues, and we go back to 1.</li>
      <li>If O misses the shot, they get a letter. C’s turn continues, and we go back to 1.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Once any player has gotten 5 letters, ie HORSE, they lose the game.</li>
</ol>

<p>On Player 2’s turn, Player 1 has no real strategy - they must simply try their best to make the shots that Player 2 makes. The only strategy a player can control is which shots they attempt when it’s their turn.</p>

<h3 id="expected-number-of-turns">Expected number of turns</h3>

<h4 id="deriving-the-formula">Deriving the formula</h4>

<p>Let us calculate the optimal shot on Player 1’s turn. Note that a “turn” lasts as long as the player whose turn it is does not miss their shot. We will assume that Player 1 will shoot the same optimal shot each time it is their turn. Let \(p_1\) be the probability that Player 1 makes this shot, \(p_2\) be the probability that Player 2 makes the same shot, and \(e_N\) be the expected number of turns for Player 1 to win \(N\) letters.</p>

<p>If Player 1 misses the shot, the expected number of turns going forward is \(1 + e_N\), since Player 1 has used up the current turn, and must restart in the same position next turn. If Player 1 makes the shot, and Player 2 misses the shot, the expected number of turns is \(e_{N-1}\), since the turn continues with one less letter to win. Finally, if Player 1 and Player 2 both make the shot, the expected number of turns is simply \(e_N\). Putting these together, we have</p><p>

\[\begin{equation}
e_N = (1 - p_1) (1 + e_N) + p_1 (1 - p_2) e_{N - 1} + p_1 p_2 e_N
\end{equation}\]

</p><p>Re-arranging and expanding for \(e_{N-1},e_{N-2}\ldots e_0\), we get</p><p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
e_N - e_{N - 1} &amp;= \frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1 - p_2)} \\
\vdots \\
e_1 - e_0 &amp;= \frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1 - p_2)}
\end{eqnarray}\]

</p><p>\(e_0\) must be \(1\), since \(p_1=1, p_2=0 \implies e_1=1\). Adding the equations above and re-arranging, we get</p><p>

\[e_N = 1 + N\frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1 - p_2)}\]

</p><p>For the game of HORSE, \(N=5\), and so the expected number of turns to win HORSE is</p><p>

\[e_5 = 1 + 5\frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1 - p_2)} \tag{1} \label{eq:one}\]

</p><p>Our goal is to minimize \(e_5\). \(e_5\) increases with the inverse of the quantities \(\frac{p_1}{1 - p_1}\) and \((1 - p_2)\). Since the former grows much faster than the latter, we can intuit that increasing \(p_1\) is a lot more important than decreasing \(p_2\).</p>

<h4 id="visualizing-the-expected-number-of-turns">Visualizing the expected number of turns</h4>

<p>Since this is a function of two variables, we can visualize it with a contour plot.</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/formula.png" alt="Contour plot of function"></p>

<p>As the color gets darker, the expected number of turns decreases, ie we’re more likely to win. As we would expect, the plot gets darker for higher values of \(p_1\) and lower values of \(p_2\), ie to the right and bottom of the plot. What’s interesting to note is that the contour lines are “squeezed” more toward the right than the bottom, indicating that a high \(p_1\) has a stronger effect than a low \(p_2\). For example, if \(p_2=0\) and \(p_1=0.2\), \(\eqref{eq:one}\) gives us \(e_5=21\), whereas if \(p_1=1\) and \(p_2=0.8\) we get \(e_5=1\).</p>

<h4 id="verification-via-simulation">Verification via simulation</h4>

<p>Another way to calculate \(e_5\) empirically is to simulate \(G\) games for each value of \(p_1\) and \(p_2\), and then average the number of turns the game takes to finish over all the games. Doing this with \(G=1000\), I get this plot:</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/simulation.png" alt="Contour plot of simulation"></p>

<p>which matches the previous plot. The squiggles are due to randomness.</p>

<h3 id="analyzing-some-special-cases">Analyzing some special cases</h3>

<p>In reality, \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) tend to be related to one another, since shots that are harder for one player tend to be harder for the other player as well.</p>

<p>Let us analyse some special cases, corresponding to the straight lines in the following plot.</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/straight_lines.png" alt="Contour plot with straight lines"></p>

<h4 id="both-players-are-equally-good-shooters">Both players are equally good shooters</h4>
<p>This corresponds to the red line above. Here, \(p_1 = p_2\), and \(\eqref{eq:one}\) simplifies to</p><p>

\[e_5 = 1 + \frac{5}{p_1}\]

</p><p>To minimize this, we should pick shots with a \(p_1\) as high as possible. For example, if we keep making layups at a probability of \(0.9\) each, we’d expect the game to be over in less than \(7\) turns.</p>

<h4 id="player-1-is-a-slightly-better-shooter-than-player-2">Player 1 is a slightly better shooter than Player 2</h4>

<p>Let’s say Player 1 always shoots 10% better than Player 2 for any shot. That is, \(p_2 = min(p_1 - 0.1, 0)\) (yellow line above), and when \(p1&gt;0.1\), \(\eqref{eq:one}\) simplifies to</p><p>

\[e_5 = 1 + 5 \frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (1.1 - p_1)}\]

</p><p>In the range \(p_1 \in [0, 1]\), this function looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/player_1_better.png" alt="Player 1 better"></p>

<p>It is minimized at \(p_1=1\), where \(e_5=1\), that is, the game ends in one turn. Again, Player 1 wants to pick their highest probability shot.</p>

<h4 id="player-2-is-a-slightly-better-shooter-than-player-1">Player 2 is a slightly better shooter than Player 1</h4>

<p>Here, we set \(p_2 = p_1 + 0.1\) (orange line above), which gives us for \(p_1 &lt; 0.9\)</p><p>

\[e_5 = 1 + 5 \frac{1 - p_1}{p_1 (0.9 - p_1)}\]

</p><p>In the range \(p_1 \in [0, 1]\), this function looks like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://rishicomplex.github.io/assets/player_1_worse.png" alt="Player 1 worse"></p>

<p>Interestingly, we cannot simply maximize \(p_1\) here, because once \(p_2\) gets closer to \(1\), we can never win. However, the optimal \(p_1\) is still pretty high, at around \(p_1=0.684\), giving \(e_5=11.7\). If Player 2 (for whom \(e_5\) looks like the previous section) shoots shots at \(p_2&lt;0.4\) (eg three-point shots), they will lose the game, despite being a better shooter.</p>

<h3 id="real-world-strategies">Real world strategies</h3>

<p>In the real world, winning is not the only objective. You don’t want the game to take indefinitely long, and you’d be ridiculed if you kept taking layups. You also have no concrete way to estimate \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) (unless you’ve been playing an opponent for a long time and are keeping a tab on their shooting percentages), and so have to rely on intuition. Some general points to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You’re generally better off taking high percentage shots, even if you’re much better at a low-percentage shot than an opponent. As an example, let’s say you’ve been practicing half-court shots all year, and you can shoot a half court shot at an impressive 20% (\(p_1=0.2\)). You’re sure your opponent can’t shoot that shot if you make it (\(p_2=0\)). Your expected number of turns to win is still \(e_5=21\). Compare that to you shooting a 60% shot which your opponent can also make at 60% (eg a free throw), which lets you win in \(e_5=9.3\) turns. This is more than twice as good as the half court shot! This is because if you and your opponent both make the shot, it’s still your turn. Whereas if you miss your shot by attempting a low percentage shot, your turn is over. You can always win the game in 6-7 turns simply by taking layups at the same percentage as your opponent (assuming \(p_1\) of 0.8-0.9). If we set \(p_2=0\), and solve for \(e_5=7\), we get \(p_1 = 0.45\). That is, even if your opponent can’t make the shot you make at all, there’s generally no point in taking shots that have \(p_1 &lt; 0.45\) - you’re better off shooting layups.</li>
  <li>If you can guess \(p_1\) and \(p_2\) for a bunch of candidate shots, plug them into \(\eqref{eq:one}\) to figure out which shots are your best bet to win.</li>
  <li>Instead of practicing low percentage shots (like behind the backboard arc shots), practice your high percentage shots (like free throws or left handed layups) instead. If you and your opponent can both make a behind the backboard arc shot at 10%, and you practice to push yourself to 20%, you still go from winning in 51 turns to 23 turns. Compare that with converting your free throw from 60% to 70% - that pushes your expected turns from 9.3 to 6.4.</li>
  <li>Find novel-looking high percentage shots so that you can use an effective strategy while not getting ridiculed for just attempting layups. Examples are left handed close up shots, floaters, bank shots.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d also recommend playing HORSE with modified rules, eg</p>
<ul>
  <li>No shots from inside the paint.</li>
  <li>No repeated shots from the same spot in a turn.</li>
  <li>If both players make three shots in a row, it’s Player 2’s turn.</li>
</ul>

<p>This should reduce the effectiveness of the layup strategy and make the game more fun.</p>

    <p>To celebrate the publication of our <em>MuZero</em> paper in <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03051-4">Nature</a>, I've written a high level description of the <em>MuZero</em> algorithm. My focus here is to give you an intuitive understanding and general overview of the algorithm; for the full details please read the <a href="http://www.furidamu.org/publications/">paper</a>. Please also see our <a href="https://deepmind.com/blog/article/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules">official DeepMind blog post</a>, it has great animated versions of the figures!</p>
<p>MuZero is a very exciting step forward - it requires no special knowledge of game rules or environment dynamics, instead learning a model of the environment for itself and using this model to plan. Even though it uses such a learned model, MuZero preserves the full planning performance of AlphaZero - opening the door to applying it to many real world problems!</p>
<h2>It's all just statistics</h2>
<p><em>MuZero</em> is a machine learning algorithm, so naturally the first thing to understand is how it uses neural networks. From AlphaGo and AlphaZero, it inherited the use of policy and value networks<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>:</p>
<p><img alt="Schematic illustration of value and policy network mapping from a Go board to a value resp. policy estimate" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/value_policy_net.jpg"></p>
<p>Both the policy and the value have a very intuitive meaning:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The policy, written $p(s, a)$, is a probability distribution over all actions $a$ that can be taken in state $s$. It estimates which action is likely to be the optimal action. The policy is similar to the first guess for a good move that a human player has when quickly glancing at a game.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The value $v(s)$ estimates the probability of winning from the current state $s$: averaging over all possible future possibilities, weighted by how likely they are, in what fraction of them would the current player win?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these networks on their own is already very powerful: If you only have a policy network, you could simply always play the move it predicts as most likely and end up with a very decent player. Similarly, given only a value network, you could always choose the move with the highest value. However, combining both estimates leads to even better results.</p>
<h2>Planning to Win</h2>
<p>Similar to <em>AlphaGo</em> and <em>AlphaZero</em> before it, <em>MuZero</em> uses Monte Carlo Tree Search<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, short MCTS, to aggregate neural network predictions and choose actions to apply to the environment.</p>
<p>MCTS is an iterative, best-first tree search procedure. Best-first means expansion of the search tree is guided by the value estimates in the search tree. Compared to classic methods such as breadth-first (expand the entire tree up to a fixed depth before searching deeper) or depth-first (consecutively expand each possible path until the end of the game before trying the next), best-first search can take advantage of heuristic estimates (such as neural networks) to find promising solutions even in very large search spaces.</p>
<p>MCTS has three main phases: simulation, expansion and backpropagation. By repeatedly executing these phases, MCTS incrementally builds a search tree over future action sequences one node at a time. In this tree, each node is a future state, while the edges between nodes represent actions leading from one state to the next.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the details, let me introduce a schematic representation of such a search tree, including the neural network predictions made by <em>MuZero</em>:</p>
<p><img alt="diagram of the muzero search tree, and the use of representation, dynamics and prediction function" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/search_tree.jpg"></p>
<p>Circles represent nodes of the tree, which correspond to states in the environment. Lines represent actions, leading from one state to the next. The tree is rooted at the top, at the current state of the environment - represented by a schematic Go board. We will cover the details of representation, prediction and dynamics functions in a later section.</p>
<p><strong>Simulation</strong> always starts at the root of the tree (light blue circle at the top of the figure), the current position in the environment or game. At each node (state $s$), it uses a scoring function $U(s, a)$ to compare different actions $a$ and chose the most promising one. The scoring function used in <em>MuZero</em> would combine a prior estimate $p(s, a)$ with the value estimate for $v(s')$:</p>
<p>$$
U(s, a) = v(s') + c \cdot p(s, a)
$$</p>
<p>where $c$ is a scaling factor<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3">3</a></sup> that ensures that the influence of the prior diminishes as our value estimate becomes more accurate.</p>
<p>Each time an action is selected, we increment its associated visit count $n(s, a)$, for use in the UCB scaling factor $c$ and for later action selection.</p>
<p>Simulation proceeds down the tree until it reaches a leaf that has not yet been expanded; at this point the neural network is used to evaluate the node. Evaluation results (prior and value estimates) are stored in the node.</p>
<p><strong>Expansion</strong>: Once a node has reached a certain number of evaluations, it is marked as "expanded". Being expanded means that children can be added to a node; this allows the search to proceed deeper. In <em>MuZero</em>, the expansion threshold is 1, i.e. every node is expanded immediately after it is evaluated for the first time. Higher expansion thresholds can be useful to collect more reliable statistics<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4">4</a></sup> before searching deeper.</p>
<p><strong>Backpropagation</strong>: Finally, the value estimate from the neural network evaluation is propagated back up the search tree; each node keeps a running mean of all value estimates below it. This averaging process is what allows the UCB formula to make increasingly accurate decisions over time, and so ensures that the MCTS will eventually converge to the best move.</p>
<h2>Intermediate Rewards</h2>
<p>The astute reader may have noticed that the figure above also includes the prediction of a quantity $r$. Some domains, such as board games, only provide feedback at the end of an episode (e.g. a win/loss result); they can be modeled purely through value estimates. Other domains however provide more frequent feedback, in the general case a reward $r$ is observed after every transition from one state to the next.</p>
<p>Directly modeling this reward through a neural network prediction and using it in the search is advantageous. It only requires a slight modification to the UCB formula:</p>
<p>$$
U(s, a) = r(s, a) + \gamma \cdot v(s') + c \cdot p(s, a)
$$</p>
<p>where $r(s, a)$ is the reward observed in transitioning from state $s$ by choosing action $a$, and $\gamma$ is a discount factor that describes how much we care about future rewards.</p>
<p>Since in general rewards can have arbitrary scale, we further normalize the combined reward/value estimate to lie in the interval $[0, 1]$ before combining it with the prior:</p>
<p>$$
U(s, a) = \frac{r(s, a) + \gamma \cdot v(s') - q_{min}}{q_{max} - q_{min}} + c \cdot p(s, a)
$$</p>
<p>where $q_{min}$ and $q_{max}$ are the minimum and maximum $r(s, a) + \gamma \cdot v(s')$ estimates observed across the search tree.</p>
<h2>Episode Generation</h2>
<p>The MCTS procedure described above can be applied repeatedly to play entire episodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Run a search in the current state $s_t$ of the environment.</li>
<li>Select an action $a_{t+1}$ according to the statistics $\pi_t$ of the search.</li>
<li>Apply the action to the environment to advance to the next state $s_{t+1}$ and observe reward $u_{t+1}$.</li>
<li>Repeat until the environment terminates.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="generation of episodes by running MCTS in each state, selecting an action and advancing the environment" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/episode_generation.jpg"></p>
<p>Action selection can either be greedy - select the action with the most visits - or exploratory: sample action $a$ proportional to its visit count $n(s, a)$, potentially after applying some temperature $t$ to control the degree of exploration:</p>
<p>$$
p(a) = {\left( \frac{n(s, a)}{\sum_b n(s, b)} \right)}^{1/t}
$$</p>
<p>For $t = 0$, we recover greedy action selection; $t = \inf$ is equivalent to sampling actions uniformly.</p>
<h2>Training</h2>
<p>Now that we know how to run MCTS to select actions, interact with the environment and generate episodes, we can turn towards training the <em>MuZero</em> model.</p>
<p>We start by sampling a trajectory and a position within it from our dataset, then we unroll the <em>MuZero</em> model alongside the trajectory:</p>
<p><img alt="training unrolls the muzero model along the trajectory" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/training.jpg"></p>
<p>You can see the three parts of the <em>MuZero</em> algorithm in action:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <strong>representation</strong> function $h$ maps from a set of observations (the schematic Go board) to the hidden state $s$ used by the neural network</li>
<li>the <strong>dynamics</strong> function $g$ maps from a state $s_t$ to the next state $s_{t+1}$ based on an action $a_{t+1}$. It also estimates the reward $r_t$ observed in this transition. This is what allows the learned model to be rolled forward inside the search.</li>
<li>the <strong>prediction</strong> function $f$ makes estimates for policy $p_t$ and value $v_t$ based on a state $s_t$. These are the estimates used by the UCB formula and aggregated in the MCTS.</li>
</ul>
<p>The observations and actions used as input to the network are taken from this trajectory; similarly the prediction targets for policy, value and reward are the ones stored with the trajectory when it was generated.</p>
<p>You can see this alignment between episode generation (<strong>B</strong>) and training (<strong>C</strong>) even more clearly in the full figure:</p>
<p><img alt="the three previous figures in a single picture" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/full_algorithm.jpg"></p>
<p>Specifically, the training losses for the three quantities estimated by <em>MuZero</em> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>policy</strong>: cross-entropy between MCTS visit count statistics and policy logits from the prediction function.</li>
<li><strong>value</strong>: cross-entropy or mean squared error between discounted sum of N rewards + stored search value or target network estimate and value from the prediction function<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5">5</a></sup>.</li>
<li><strong>reward</strong>: cross-entropy between reward observed in the trajectory and dynamics function estimate.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Reanalyse</h2>
<p>Having examined the core <em>MuZero</em> training, we are ready to take a look at the technique that allows us to leverage the search to achieve massive data-efficiency improvements: Reanalyse.</p>
<p>In the course of normal training, we generate many trajectories (interactions with the environment) and store them in our replay buffer for training. Can we get more mileage out of this data?</p>
<p><img alt="sequence of states representing an episode" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/trajectory.jpg"></p>
<p>Unfortunately, since this is stored data, we cannot change the states, actions or received rewards - this would require resetting the environment to an arbitrary state and continuing from there. Possible in The Matrix, but not in the real world.</p>
<p>Luckily, it turns out that we don't need to - using existing inputs with fresh, improved labels is enough for continued learning. Thanks to <em>MuZero</em>'s learned model and the MCTS, this is exactly what we can do:</p>
<p><img alt="sequence of states with new MCTS trees at each state" src="http://www.furidamu.org/images/2020-12-22-muzero-intuition/reanalyse.jpg"></p>
<p>We keep the saved trajectory (observations, actions and rewards) as is and instead only re-run the MCTS. This generates fresh search statistics, providing us with new targets for the policy and value …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I chose five personal websites out of the thirty or so I visit regularly and tried to understand what it is about them that utterly captures me.</p>
<p>Whether or not it is obvious to you, I have stolen many things from the following websites. Be it design tweaks, post ideas, or even turns of phrase. These websites are incredible and you should consume them.</p>
<p>Good artists borrow, great artists <del>steal</del> use the inspect tool.</p>

<p>I have been following Justin Duke’s writing for close to two years. His older page is now <a href="https://jmduke.com/">depreciated</a> and he posts to <em>arcana dot computer</em>, an <a href="https://github.com/jmduke/arcana.computer">open source</a> website filled with catalogs and footnotes and light-touch design. The main framework is Jekyll, with dynamic content powered by Airtable. The <a href="https://arcana.computer/miscellany/this-site.html">About</a> page of Justin’s website explains the development/design/ideas behind the website in rich detail. So in this section I’ll instead focus on how I <em>feel</em> about the website.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/b8e7b3aa62f5210ac62bb4003ff06458/0f09e/arcana.computer.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

    </span></p>
<p>My philosophy towards personal websites matches Justin’s. He writes:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Lastly, if there’s anything I can convince you of: you should build a personal site, you should obsess over it, you should meticulously document it, and you should have quite a bit of fun doing so. (It’s worth it.)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The content throughout these pages is personal and reads true. Although it’s not a journal as such, as I read through the notes and reviews I get a secret feeling that I’m looking somewhere I shouldn’t be — like peeking in a hidden diary.</p>
<p>Justin writes about capturing his <a href="https://arcana.computer/catalogs/media-diet">media diet</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This started out as a lazy compulsion, but I’ve grown rather found of this habit over time. “You are what you eat”, and all that — I’ve realized that paying more attention to how I’m spending my consumptive time has made me more focused on consuming what I’m interested in, and not simply what’s easiest.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He talks about reviewing older sections of his media diet and how it helps him recollect that time in his life — “suddenly I am taken back to my old apartment on Capitol Hill, and my three weeks of funemployment before Stripe”. When coming across old words that I have written, I’ve also experienced this almost-olfactory flashback of thoughts.</p>

<p>Overall, I am impressed with the breadth and depth of content on Justin’s website, as well as how he’s made Airtable work for him. I also like that sections are marked as in-progress. I like the personal structure to it. His methods for working on this website are similar to the goals of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Now_Foundation">Long Now</a> and that gels with me.</p>

<p>Paul Stamatiou writes long form articles about his life and technology. If someone has a curiosity about a subject that he has covered (e.g. <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/made-on-an-ipad-pro/">creating with the iPad Pro</a>, or <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/building-a-windows-10-lightroom-photo-editing-pc/">building a lightroom PC</a>) I wouldn’t hesitate linking one of his articles to them — perhaps without even reading it — because of the consistent high quality I have come to expect.</p>
<p><span>
      <a href="https://healeycodes.com/static/ed6bc43b992468145fd897cc2925f6fd/e9985/paulstamatiou.com.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener">

    </span></p>
<p>However, this quality comes with a cost, as he describes in <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/writing-more/">Writing more</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’m going to try something different and write more short-form posts here.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Over the years my focus has been increasing the quality of my articles. They’ve ended up becoming increasingly time-consuming to create.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although these articles (which for now he seems to have dubbed “briefs”) are shorter and less researched than his other writing they read as complete entries to me. On another website, by another person, they would be complete blog posts.</p>
<p>The more things I write, the more hesitant I am to actually publish. So the way he talks about blogging in <em>Writing more</em> resonates with me:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to get back to what blogging felt like when I started in 2005. Back when posting a few sentences and publishing it within the same computing session was so easy and fun. Where expectations were low and it didn’t have to be perfect.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He has written 1210 posts since 2005. My first thought goes to the build times of such a website! In 2011, he migrated from <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/how-to-wordpress-to-jekyll/">Wordpress to Jekyll</a>. This year he <a href="https://twitter.com/Stammy/status/1307347164599922689">tweeted</a> that he’s looking at moving again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>really, really want to migrate my jekyll blog to Hugo + Netlify but I have so many weird jekyll hacks and collections and templates/includes that I’m sure the migration would take months of spare time.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>probably faster to build a new site from the ground up, new CSS and all</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also this year, he was interviewed about his work (he’s a designer at Twitter) and about his blog on <a href="https://www.thundernerds.io/2019/10/writing-a-blog-and-working-at-twitter-with-paul-stamatiou/">Thunder Nerds</a>. (More people should be interviewed about their technology blogs please.)</p>
<p>Paul is a photographer who generates fantastic photo sets and write ups with little animated maps of the location. His <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/photos/">photos</a>, and the way they are arranged, is truly fantastic. He has of course written <a href="https://paulstamatiou.com/photos/gear/">thousands of words</a> about his camera gear.</p>

<p>Martin Tournoij is the creator of <a href="https://www.goatcounter.com/">Goat Counter</a> and has posts dating back to 2013. His personal website is Jekyll-based and <a href="https://github.com/arp242/arp242.net">open source</a>. I usually run into his writing on <a href="https://lobste.rs/">lobste.rs</a> (a computing-focused community).</p>

<p>I like the one-page layout of the landing page. There’s a list of posts and projects, a picture, and a link to his CV. My favorite post of his is <a href="https://www.arp242.net/personal-analytics.html">Analytics on personal websites</a> — where he argues in part for vanity statistics:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>As for “vanity stats” or “stats to stroke your ego”: I think that’s actually a valid use case as well. After you spent quite a bit of your spare time writing an article it’s just nice to know people are actually reading it. There’s nothing wrong with being validated – it’s a basic psychological need and I’m not a fan of casually dismissing it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on, he wrestles with the fact that since he’s the creator of an analytics tool, he doesn’t want this website to turn into an advertising channel for it.</p>
<p>Martin doesn’t shy away from controversial subjects on his blog. He writes about freedom and democracy, he pushes for empathy towards those he disagrees with. He writes without restraint which is admirable in itself.</p>
<p>He uses his own CSS template (<a href="https://github.com/arp242/hello-css">arp242/hello-css</a>) which is worth a look. If you’ll allow me to use a vague statement, his website has a unique visual readability to it.</p>

<p>Joel Califa’s website has whimsy. It doesn’t take itself seriously.</p>

<p>Clicking this button makes text spawn and fly away and fade (the snippets are things from the old web like: <code>&lt;i&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;frameset&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;marquee&gt;</code>, etc). There’s an illustration of his head that hides away when you hover near. The writing in the section headers frizzles with energy.</p>
<p>Joel’s website successfully serves as both a work portfolio and a design blog. His <em>Work</em> page describes itself as a “A sample of text-heavy case studies for patient visitors.” The design blog has “Low frequency, high quality design articles.”</p>
<p>My favorite post is <a href="http://joelcalifa.com/blog/tiny-wins/">Tiny Wins</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I recently shipped two things at GitHub that had an impact beyond my wildest dreams.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Where he discusses the work involved in designing dynamic favicons for the Pull Request page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Now browser tabs will always show a PR’s current build status.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As well as adding an arrow that signals which branch your changes are “flowing” into:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Before releasing this, people would regularly confuse which branch would be merged into which.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He writes with authentic authority. He covers subjects that seem so obvious after you read them. Like in <a href="http://joelcalifa.com/blog/revisiting-visited/">Revisiting :Visited</a>, where research, the web specification, and its practical uses, are combined:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Nielsen study summed this up nicely over ten years ago, “People get lost and move in circles when websites use the same link color for visited and new destinations. To reduce navigational confusion, select different colors for the two types of links.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Can’t we, as an industry, get behind that reasoning? A “visited” link isn’t that far off from a “read” email. They both provide the user with the tacit understanding of where they’ve been.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Joel exists in the wonderful space between technology and design where he is addressing problems that directly relate to me. For example, his website is the first place I read <a href="http://joelcalifa.com/blog/unsolicited-dating-advice/">a serious defense</a> of the <code>month/day/year</code> date ordering system.</p>
<p>It fills me with joy that I have only read half of his content.</p>

<p>Rasmus Andersson has the prettiest website in this list. An elegant three-column layout that perfectly scales to the browser’s width — dropping to two columns then one column. When a page is selected from the top right menu, the background changes to a rich color and shifts the menu up or down. With a wide enough browser, gray bars frame the website on either side.</p>

<p>Rasmus is the creator of the <a href="https://rsms.me/inter/">Inter</a> font and uses it to great effect with bold hover colors.</p>

<p>Even his <a href="https://rsms.me/bad-url">404 page</a> is sharp.</p>
<p>After looking around more, I found a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tag that includes <a href="https://rsms.me/res/main.js">main.js</a>, a debug tool that must have been used to develop the grid layout (which I think is based on <a href="https://rsms.me/raster/">rsms/raster</a>). Pressing alt+D or alt+G overlays a system of boxes and dots.</p>

<p>Rasmus’s last post was in 2017 — <a href="https://rsms.me/wasm-intro">Introduction to WebAssembly</a> — but it’s one that I revisit often as it’s a clear and detailed explanation of the technology.</p>
<p>His use of the right arrow symbol (U+2192) as well as the rounded hover effect on titles (e.g. “Projects” and “Thoughts and ideas”) is something that I closely copied for my own website as it is just too perfect.</p>
<p>Like Paul Stamatiou, Rasmus has hundreds of articles and has been blogging for a long time – almost two decades. The earlier posts are more likely to be reblogs, quotes, links, and small thoughts. The kind of things that Twitter is now used for.</p>
<p>Unlike Twitter, the permanence of these small thoughts is poetic. Here, in 2002, a new font is announced next to something like a diary entry without a paragraph break in between:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I’ve completed a new typeface. It’s a sweet little thing called Hovden Stitch. Yes your guess was correct. It looks like stitches, cross-stitches to be precise. Go get it for your mac or pc right here. Yesterday I hung out on a free festival here in Trollhättan. Laurel Music was great. Paola sucked. Laurel Music is playing …</p></blockquote></section></div>

When you create an Ingress object, the GKE Ingress controller creates a Google Cloud HTTP(S) load balancer and configures it according to the information in the Ingress and its associated Services.</p> <p>This article describes how to setup Ingress for External HTTP(S) Load Balancing, install cert-manager certificate provisioner and setup up a Let’s Encrypt certificate. This was written based on GKE <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/release-notes-stable#february_11_2020">v1.14.10-gke.17</a>, <a href="https://cert-manager.io/">cert-manager</a> v0.13 and <a href="https://helm.sh/">Helm</a> v3.</p> <h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/creating-a-cluster">A GKE Kubernetes cluster</a></li> <li><a href="https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/">Helm</a></li> <li><a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/">Kubectl</a></li> <li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/ip-addresses/reserve-static-external-ip-address">A global static IP</a> with <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/tutorials/configuring-domain-name-static-ip#step_4_configure_your_domain_name_records">DNS configured</a> for your domain for example, as example.your-domain.com. Regional IP addresses do not work with GKE Ingress.</li> </ul> <p>Note that a Service exposed through an Ingress must respond to health checks from the load balancer. According to the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/ingress#health_checks">docs</a>, your app must either serve a response with an HTTP 200 status to GET requests on the / path, or you can configure an HTTP readiness probe, serving a response with an HTTP 200 status to GET requests on the path specified by the readiness probe.</p> <h2 id="create-a-deployment">Create a deployment</h2> <p>Here is an example of a sample deployment manifest.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>apiVersion</span><span>:</span> <span>apps/v1</span>

It always felt….off to me.</p><p>Mobile-first, which is a design approach that involves starting with the mobile version of a website before the desktop version, is a great idea in theory.&nbsp;</p><p>The problem comes when it meets reality.</p><p>There are countless stories of developers who, upon hearing about (and even learning how to design with) a mobile first approach, ultimately ended up reverting back to, and starting with the desktop versions of their sites.</p><p>According to a <a target="_blank" title="https://twitter.com/KevinJPowell/status/1244427032957784066" href="https://twitter.com/KevinJPowell/status/1244427032957784066">survey</a> conducted by Kevin Powell (a GREAT frontend tutorial maker), the majority (61.5%) of developers prefer to start with the desktop first:</p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/gkrvHBiXR3ON7pcIkwSG" alt="Screenshot 2020-12-27 at 22.39.13.png" title="Screenshot 2020-12-27 at 22.39.13.png" width="597" height="413"></p><p><em><strong>(this after almost 8 years of the mobile-first approach being championed almost exclusively)</strong></em></p><p>This is a sentiment that I have also found to be true on many message boards and online discussions that I’ve seen around responsive web design.</p><p>It is interesting that despite this clear evidence that the majority of developers simply do not inherently want to design websites with a mobile-first approach, the idea is still being championed as the preferred methodology.</p><p>Let’s explore why this is.</p><h2>Why Mobile-First is often championed</h2><p>There are two main reasons why the mobile-first approach is often touted as the best approach to take for developing a responsive website:</p><p>	<strong>1.	Better UX, at every screen size </strong></p><p>The first is that it provides a better user experience at every screen size, because it best optimizes for the smaller screen sizes as well as the larger ones. The argument is that it does this by focusing on only the most important elements of the layout, as that is all that can fit on the smaller mobile screens. And that this focused approach ‘scales up’.</p><p>The trouble with this is that it simply does not seem to hold up to scrutiny.&nbsp;</p><p>What actually seems to end up happening with mobile-first is that the overall site just becomes less creative in general.&nbsp;</p><p>Most mobile sites (and their subsequent desktop sites) end up simply looking the same as every other website out there.</p><p>We’ll see why this is the case shortly (the diagram at the top of this post will give you an idea).</p><p>	<strong>2.	Better organized (and easier to create) CSS </strong></p><p>The second reason why mobile-first is often regarded as the best way to develop a responsive website is that on most sites, the ‘default’ CSS styles (i.e. the styles that are written outside of the scope of media queries) are often the ones that are aimed at the smaller, mobile screen sizes.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Typical CSS file organization for a responsive website:</strong></p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/output=format:png/resize=height:748,width:996/sPcNpTKARkKzOUO3KzZ4" alt="typical-css-responsive-file.png" title="typical-css-responsive-file.png" width="996" height="748"></p><p>Because the typical CSS workflow of a responsive website is to add the media query related styles after the fact (because media queries are supposed to be at the bottom of the page, as mentioned above), starting with what would be your ‘default’ styles, which would be your mobile styles, seems to make more sense.</p><p>We will also shortly see why this is not exactly correct.</p><p>Let’s dive into the key reasons why, despite these two decent arguments in favor of a mobile-first approach to responsive web design, it still is not the best way to approach it.</p><h2>Why mobile-first is good in theory but bad in practice</h2><h3>You are optimizing for the sub-optimal experience</h3><p>The mobile experience <em>is</em> sub-optimal. This is not a point that is really debated. The entire point of a mobile version of a site is to deliver a lesser, but still somewhat effective version of the optimal desktop experience.</p><p>The problem with optimizing for the mobile experience, is that it does not make the overall experience optimal. It only scales up sub-optimality. The compromises that start on the mobile experience ultimately become compromises on the desktop end.</p><p><strong>It only degrades the desktop experience.</strong></p><p>The desktop site is the ‘real’ site in most cases, <a target="_blank" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/d7nj58/how_do_you_deal_with_mobile_first_and/" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/d7nj58/how_do_you_deal_with_mobile_first_and/">most clients</a> expect to see a desktop site first.</p><p>Desktop-first focuses on the design problem that people actually care about, while mobile-first focuses on the CSS organization problem, which only developers do.</p><p>Instead of starting with the sub-optimal experience (that helps the developer), it’s much better overall to optimize for the optimal experience (that helps the user) and then scale down.</p><h3>It’s an unnatural way to design</h3><p>Because design is an intuitive process fundamentally, any design approach that requires you to have to ‘get over yourself’ is probably a bad idea.</p><p>Design is basically a process of guiding the user, by developing an interface based on what guides <em>you</em>, naturally.</p><p>For this to be effective, context is key, and being able to maximally utilize the scope of experience that the user has, gives you more ‘surface area’ with which to appropriately meet the context and guide the user.</p><p>For this reason, It’s better to start at the ‘largest’ possible context for this.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, for a professional sports match. What has a better chance of delivering the ‘fullest’, more complete experience to you?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The actual, ‘bigger’, more natural, live game:</strong></p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/p5ESEubnQNKm7eEPdLmR" alt="man-290186_1920.jpg" title="man-290186_1920.jpg" width="1920" height="1275"></p><p><strong>Or the TV experience?</strong></p><p><img src="https://media.graphcms.com/qUwYVApRW22XXnKOCOqd" alt="soccer-3496510_1920.jpg" title="soccer-3496510_1920.jpg" width="1920" height="1280"></p><p><em><strong>What should be optimized for first to deliver the best final result in both cases?</strong></em></p><p>The Desktop experience encompasses what is essential information within a mobile context. Mobile does not necessarily have what is essential to a desktop context.</p><p>This is why desktop-first <a target="_blank" title="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/cy1xuk/do_you_feel_like_desktop_web_dev_is_fun_and/" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/cy1xuk/do_you_feel_like_desktop_web_dev_is_fun_and/">seems to feel more natural</a> to most developers. It’s just enough constraint for the task of navigating a website, but not too much.</p><p>Leaving an ideal amount of room for creativity. Which mobile-first kills.</p><h3>Mobile-first kills creativity</h3><p>With mobile-first, there are too many unanswered questions.</p><p>Questions that should have been answered at the desktop level, ultimately never get answered.</p><p>At the desktop level, the challenges are often much bigger, and require more creativity to solve. Because the questions you need to ask at smaller screens are simply fractals (or subsets) of their larger counterparts, It’s much better to answer them first at the larger sizes, which then makes it easier to answer subsequent smaller size and mobile design questions.</p><p>With a mobile-first approach, you can fall into the trap of getting so fixated on the subsets that you fail in giving people the essence of the page. This essence is what the initial answers to the bigger design questions give you.</p><p>To get that essence, in the same way that you would have to crush grapes at scale, and then gradually go through a distillation process to finally achieve a wine. To get a mobile site that really gets to the core of a site, its best to start with the desktop version. And then gradually filter or scale down.</p><h3>Mobile-First makes design too formulaic</h3><p>Because of the degree of constraint in the mobile-first approach, and the lack of room for creativity that this engenders, developers naturally seek out tried and true patterns that they can follow.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn't a bad thing, as we all use inspiration to a degree. The issue is that, just as we’ve seen with frameworks like Bootstrap. Too much of a formulaic approach often leads to a level of sameness that literally bores everyone.</p><p>Mobile-first may be one the things contributing to the ever increasing ‘sameness’ of the web that we see nowadays.</p><p>This consequently reduces the kind of web activity that we want (such as conversions) across the board. People are simply less engaged, and tuning these websites out.</p><p>Imagine if those ever-quirky and endlessly interesting sites of the late 90’s, early 2000’s like the ones we used to find on GeoCities and Angelfire were thinking about ‘mobile first’.&nbsp;</p><p>Do you think they would have achieved the same level of uniqueness? I doubt it.</p><h2>An alternative (desktop-first) approach</h2><p>The mental shift that we should make is not desktop to mobile first.</p><p>It's not to simply squish things on the desktop either.</p><p>The correct mental shift is to say, once we have a desktop version, what do we need to resize, rearrange, or remove in order to have an optimal yet still equally informative experience on mobile?</p><p>We should be asking how we can make the mobile experience a good fractal of the desktop experience.&nbsp;</p><p>We should ask what we are trying to achieve with our desktop site, and how we can achieve (even if only a little bit) the same on smaller screens.</p><p>The way that we should design our websites should be to start with the desktop first, and then scale down with empathy, asking the big designs questions before we start to ask the smaller ones.</p><p>We should start our web design process at the bottom of the CSS file, with the desktop sized media query, instead of making those first global (mobile-first) styles.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, once we have answered our biggest design questions at the desktop level, we can scale down (and up in the code) with more media queries (in the case of the smaller sizes) and with the default global styles in the case of the absolute smallest mobile size. Taking out all but the necessary.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, this feels like the most natural approach to take.</p><p>--</p><p><em>This is an excerpt from </em><a title="https://gumroad.com/l/Debbg/z823cp8" href="https://gumroad.com/l/Debbg/z823cp8"><em>How To Debug CSS</em></a><em>.

<p>NZBgeek is a very popular community-based indexer of Usenet posts. It is run by using the Newznab Interface. NZBgeek provides paid and free services for its own users, plus so they truly have been reasonable to think about.</p>
<p>On the evening of 27 December 2020, NZBgeek announced that they got hacked and the following details of their users are breached in this hacking attack on their community website:</p>
<ol>
<li>Username</li>
<li>Encrypted passwords</li>
<li>Email Address</li>
<li>Credit Card Numbers</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="rtoc-1">How this Attack was Performed?</h3>
<p>According to the announcement post by @Dangerous_Mummy and @jeeves in their Discord server, this attack and data breach happened because the attacker installed a Keylogger on the website of NZBgeek.</p>
<p>@Dangerous_Mummy written:</p>
<blockquote><p><span tabindex="-1" role="button">@everyone</span> Geeks, it’s with a heavy heart that we must admit that we have had a breach. If you have recently used your card or payment with us we suggest changing your credentials and card info as soon as possible. We still don’t know the extent of the damage but are working to find out and give our members the details as they become available.</p></blockquote>
<p>@jeeves written:</p>
<blockquote><p>@everyone</p>
<p>Hey Geeks,</p>
<p>IMPORTANT!</p>
<p>If you have used your card with us since the 20th November 2020 please take appropriate action.<br>
This includes reporting it to your card issuer as this protects you from any unlawful charges.</p>
<p>What We Know:</p>
<p>The hackers were able to place a keylogger on the website.<br>
The hackers obtained a copy of our database which includes your username, encrypted password, email address &amp; last connected ip address.<br>
During this time we had the hard drive on our indexer fail along with an api server.<br>
PayPal data is not at risk provding you do not use the same username/password for NZBgeek.</p>
<p>Advised Actions:</p>
<p>If you use the same userame/password combination on any other website please change them.<br>
You should use 2FA/two factor authticaition with all your online accounts.</p>
<p>Current Situation:</p>
<p>We have everything offline except for the API while we have external help to investigate.<br>
Additional updates will be made here on discord, including what changes to expect moving forward.</p>
<p>Thanks,<br>
jeeves</p></blockquote>
<p>It is one of the major data breaches because the payment information is breached and is available in the hands of attackers.</p>

<h3 id="rtoc-2">What actions users should take?</h3>
<ol>
<li>If you use the same password on multiple accounts, immediately change the passwords of all your accounts</li>
<li>Contact your credit card provider and block your card to stop further unauthorized transactions</li>
<li>Use 2FA on all of your websites/accounts whenever possible.</li>

Becoming a millionaire was not discussed, nor even imagined. Yet, here we are.</p><p id="acdf">Here are a few things I’ve learned from a decade of trying to make it on the internet.</p><p id="bcf1">The low point of (one of) my first companies was being so desperate for revenue that we adapted our<em> virtual job fair</em> platform to become a virtual business directory for a small town. For $2000/yr.</p><p id="6385">There is no upside to that. We essentially became a horribly paid consultant for an industry we didn’t care about with a product that didn’t add any value.</p><p id="f2cc">Limping along for years while eating ramen and pitching a VISION isn’t success — you’ll be much worse off than if you had just worked for a startup for a few years to improve your skills and peers.</p><p id="ce0b">To truly bet on yourself while starting a company, everything you do should accelerate any of the following:</p><ul><li id="bc69">Learning new skills: sales, product management, product development, engineering, marketing, design, fundraising</li><li id="12a6">Meeting great people — not in the “I shook Mark Cuban’s hand” sense, but in the “I have 5 equally motivated people in my corner building shit that I can text about the fact that we won’t make payroll next month.”</li><li id="c5c2">Making money on your own time</li><li id="00e0">Travelling or experiencing the world through a different lens (though in 2020 you should just get a remote job)</li></ul><p id="ae33">You don’t need mentors. You don’t need investors. You need 5 friends with similar ambitions trying to figure this shit out with you.</p><p id="537b">You want people that you can call when your world is falling apart. When you want to quit. When you hate your co-founders. When you’re questioning everything. When you’ve made the money, but don’t feel good about it.</p><p id="8018">It is a weird, un-relatable world that we’re playing in. To navigate it, you need people that understand. I’m so lucky I found my people.</p><p id="1451">I don’t have great advice on how to find your people.</p><p id="c46f">Join a co-working space? Get into a startup accelerator? Join a program like <a href="https://www.beondeck.com/" rel="noopener">On Deck</a>? Message people on Twitter?</p><p id="64cd">I know many people who are much more talented than I. They’ve got better ideas, more technical skills, and are just plain smarter.</p><p id="1d7d">What they don’t have is that forcing function that compels me to launch stuff.</p><p id="7bb3">The shamelessness. The not-give-a-fuckery.</p><p id="2ae5">To not quit when I want to quit. I’m not sure that “chip on the shoulder” is all positive, but it’s probably necessary.</p><p id="aaf9">It’s a learned behaviour. I don’t come by it naturally. I hate failing. I suck at getting feedback. I’m overly sensitive. And yet, here we are.</p><p id="cccf">Every successful individual I’ve seen has taken at least 3 years to create something with some hint of product market fit.</p><p id="1a79">Dig deeper into every company that takes off overnight — it’s probably a pivot from something else, the founder’s 8th attempt, or a hail mary. The one thing that truly worked for me was about 3.5 years in.</p><p id="8fb0">That specific thing worked in month 2, but it took 3.5 years of learning to get to that point.</p><p id="2606">My original goal when starting out (Thanks Tim Ferriss!) was to <em>“build a business making 10k a month so I could work from anywhere.”</em></p><p id="b9da">I got there, and enjoyed it — lived in multiple countries, didn’t work too much, drank great wine and ate incredible steak. It wasn’t enough.</p><p id="9d82">Financially, it didn’t matter. The cash was enough, but a life of leisure isn’t a great goal for a 30 year old. I stopped growing, learning.</p><p id="0969">Ironically, that guiding goal held me back. What seemed ambitious at the time led to unambitious decisions, like first building a below average web design company. It also led to coasting when cashflow was (very) good.</p><p id="cdd3">I somehow managed to reverse engineered my version of success, but unfortunately financial success is always a moving target — especially once you have something that works.</p><p id="0d0a">What would have been a better focus is building an exceptional product, an amazing team, and continuing to grow as a leader.</p><p id="65c1">If you can solve for those things, the score (and the cash) takes care of itself.</p><p id="6a9b">That said, if your goal is to build a company that makes 10k/mo that allows you to work from anywhere — go for it, goddamnit.</p><p id="38f1">Building something from scratch is hard, and having a job will often sound very appealing.</p><p id="9e48"><em>Here’s what you need to do today, and here’s your paycheque!</em></p><p id="a7a7">Starting a company has infinite variables. At the early stages, you’re pushing a boulder up every hill you can find. You’re trying to find that one thing that gathers enough momentum to allow you to survive another day.</p><p id="664a">If you’re lucky, you’ll get to a place where you’re no longer trying to survive — you’re trying not to die. There’s a difference.</p><p id="6c93">Every day you will have an infinite to-do list, none of which is certain.Take your best guess at what the most important thing you can work on is.</p><p id="6202">Do that thing, and try to ignore everything else.</p><p id="ee2b">Don’t forget to manage your psychology along the way. At the end of the day no one cares if you fail, and it’s not that important. Have grounding forces in your life (sports, family, knitting) to help keep you sane. Try not to build your whole identity around your company.</p><p id="950c">(You won’t do any of this, but I’m hopeful this will help you realize you’re not the only one.)</p><p id="6c90">Most people who reach unheard of levels of success are probably not that much smarter than you, and they probably don’t work that much harder.</p><p id="d7fd">Granted, there are ridiculously smart driven people that operate on another level (Elon Musk, The Collisons). They’re likely going to be trillionaires.</p><p id="7870">I’ve met many people who have built $100m+ companies that are very smart and work very hard — but probably not that much harder than a Senior Engineer at Amazon. Success is a result of talent, hard work, and luck.</p><p id="3b30">If you’re smart, want to work hard, and care about building a business one day — the best place to put that energy is into creating something new.</p><p id="7ac5">You can’t get lucky if you’re not in the game.</p></div></div></section></div>]]>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>After the first unsuccessful deployment of voting machines in Germany about ten years ago, elements of electronic voting have reached elections again. Although there is now still a paper-trail, more and more essential steps, such as counting the votes, are moved into electronic systems. This change in the ballot-counting procedure took place mostly unnoticed by the public. We are two very concerned election workers who present our first-hand experience in this talk. We show that the current digital procedure is conceptually and practically flawed in terms of security. First, we give an insight into the role of computers and their interaction with humans during ballot-counting. We show that the underlying system concepts contradict IT-security best-practices. Next, we present an in-depth analysis of one ballot-counting software, deployed for the Bavarian municipal elections ("Kommunalwahlen"). We discovered several severe security vulnerabilities that allow an almost unnoticeable manipulation of local voting results. Finally, we conclude that there is an immediate need for action to re-establish election security and transparency - not only for the government but for everyone of us.</p>

<p>Elections are a key element of every democracy. However, many democratic countries in the world have to face attacks on them, be it by the government or by foreign countries. Even if ballot counting has been finished, election results are often not accepted but questioned due to alleged manipulations. All these aspects pose major threats to democracy as they try to undermine the actual and publicly perceived integrity of elections.</p>

<p>In Germany, elections are usually considered quite secure. Elections are paper-based and the subsequent ballot-counting is open to the public. The infamous introduction of electronic voting machines about ten years ago was finally stopped by the German Federal Constitutional Court. Thus, everything is human-controlled, transparent, and secure – isn’t it?</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these claims are questionable since the silent introduction of electronic vote counting. The election system in Germany is quite complex, for example in the "Kreistagswahlen" (~district elections) workers have to count up to 70 individual votes per ballot, while respecting a special rule set. This process is very labor-intensive and sufficient election workers are often hard to come by. Due to this, electronic systems were introduced that provide support during vote counting. Election workers are no longer required to fill tally sheets, count votes, and sum them up on their own. Each ballot is simply entered into a software that performs all the magic and finally emits a result.</p>

<p>This year, we volunteered again as election workers, but our trust in electronically-assisted elections has been vastly impacted. As IT-security researchers, we consider it our responsibility to share and discuss our concerns. We performed a thorough analysis of the concept and the hard- and software of the electronic vote counting system. We discovered several flaws on a conceptual and practical level, that can severely diminish the integrity of the election and makes it prone to manipulations. To underline the impact of the system’s vulnerabilities, we demonstrate an exemplary attack on an election.</p>

<p>Finally, we propose different options on how to make elections secure again. We do not consider this an entirely technical case, as there are significant legal and societal circumstances that led to the deployment of this insecure system.</p>

<p>If you follow elementary OS development, you may know that we do not write our applications on C or Python, but rather a language called <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala">Vala</a>. While it is true that a more mainstream language would lower the barrier to entry for new first-party and third-party developers, Vala has proven to be a tremendously effective tool for our needs.</p>

<p>Vala is an object-oriented programming language developed by the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.gnome.org/">GNOME Foundation</a>, which was first released in 2006. Syntax-wise, Vala looks and acts very similarly to Java or C#, which makes it easy for new contributors to leverage their knowledge and experience from other languages. Vala’s clear syntax and tight coupling with the strongly-typed GObject system promotes highly readable, expressive, and maintainable code, while preventing entire classes of crashes and bugs.</p>

<p>Since Vala compiles to C (and then into binary), we gain access to a large number of bindings for libraries written in C. This is extremely important given the number of C libraries available for the Linux desktop. All of our desktop applications are written using the <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://www.gtk.org/">GTK</a> toolkit, and many rely heavily on related GObject-based libraries, including Gee, WebKitGTK, VTE, and GStreamer. Bindings for dozens of popular GObject C libraries exist, and writing new ones is easy.</p>

<p>Before we adopted Vala, we wrote our desktop applications in Python. As both a language and a platform, Python made developing apps quick and easy. However, this ease of development came at a serious cost — performance, binding support, and maintainability became major pain points for us with Python. Worse, the slow and fragmented adoption of Python 3 over Python 2, particularly across Linux distributions, made packaging our apps and developer tools for different environments tedious and challenging. Vala’s native binaries have proven to be a better fit for us.</p>

  <figcaption>A Simple GTK Application in&nbsp;Vala</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Because Vala is developed by the same incredible folks who make GTK, integration between Vala and GTK is tight. Extending GTK with Vala has also proven successful. In fact, we’ve crafted our own set of widgets that build on and complement what GTK provides by default. This super-set of GTK, called <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/elementary/granite">Granite</a>, is at the heart of nearly every elementary application, and Vala’s excellent object-oriented inheritance system, among other sophisticated language features, have been key to our development.</p>

<p>Vala has excellent documentation, be it in the form of <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://chebizarro.gitbooks.io/the-vala-tutorial/content/">tutorials</a>, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Vala/Examples">code samples</a> or a <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://valadoc.org/">very easy-to-use API Reference</a>. So if you’re interested in <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://elementary.io/get-involved">hacking on our projects</a> (which we very much appreciate — we are always looking for new contributors!), or are planning to release fantastic third-party desktop applications for elementary OS, we can’t recommend Vala enough. Dive in!</p>

	<p><a href="https://www.plenty.ag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Plenty</a> is an ag-tech startup in San Francisco, co-founded by Nate Storey, that is reinventing farms and farming. Storey, who is also the company’s chief science officer, says the future of farms is vertical and indoors because that way, the food can grow anywhere in the world, year-round; and the future of farms employ robots and AI to continually improve the quality of growth for fruits, vegetables, and herbs. Plenty does all these things and uses 95% less water and 99% less land because of it.</p>
<p>In recent years, farmers on flat farms have been using new tools for making farming better or easier. They’re using drones and robots to improve crop maintenance, while artificial intelligence is also on the rise, with over 1,600 startups and total investments reaching tens of billions of dollars. Plenty is one of those startups. However, flat farms still use a lot of water and land, while a Plenty vertical farm can produce the same quantity of fruits and vegetables as a 720-acre flat farm, but on only 2 acres!</p>
<p>Storey said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Vertical farming exists because we want to grow the world’s capacity for fresh fruits and vegetables, and we know it’s necessary.</p></blockquote>
<p><span><iframe width="1400" height="788" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GO0fRU46ZHc?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en-GB&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
<p>Plenty’s climate-controlled indoor farm has rows of plants growing vertically, hung from the ceiling. There are sun-mimicking LED lights shining on them, <a href="https://www.intelligentliving.co/tiny-smart-robots-kill-weeds/">robots</a> that move them around, and artificial intelligence (AI) managing all the variables of water, temperature, and light, and continually learning and optimizing how to grow bigger, faster, better crops. These futuristic features ensure every plant grows perfectly year-round. The conditions are so good that the farm produces 400 times more food per acre than an outdoor flat farm.</p>

<p>Storey said:</p>
<blockquote><p>400X greater yield per acre of ground is not just an incremental improvement, and using almost two orders of magnitude less water is also critical in a time of increasing environmental stress and climate uncertainty. All of these are truly game-changers, but they’re not the only goals.</p></blockquote>
<p>Another perk of vertical farming is locally produced food. The fruits and vegetables aren’t grown 1,000 miles away or more from a city; instead, at a warehouse nearby. Meaning, many transportation miles are eliminated, which is useful for reducing millions of tons of yearly CO2 emissions and prices for consumers. Imported fruits and vegetables are more expensive, so society’s most impoverished are at an extreme nutritional disadvantage. Vertical farms could solve this problem.</p>
<p>Storey said:</p>
<blockquote><p>Supply-chain breakdowns resulting from COVID-19 and natural disruptions like this year’s California wildfires demonstrate the need for a predictable and durable supply of products can only come from vertical farming.</p></blockquote>

<p>Plenty’s farms grow non-GMO crops and don’t use herbicides or pesticides. They recycle all water used, even capturing the evaporated water in the air. The flagship farm in San Francisco is using 100% renewable energy too.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all the packaging is 100% recyclable, made of recycled plastic, and specially designed to keep the food fresh longer to reduce food waste.</p>
<p>Storey told <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2020/11/20/this-2-acre-vertical-farm-out-produces-750-acre-flat-farms/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The future will be quite remarkable. And I think the size of the global fresh fruit and vegetable industry will be multiples of what it is today.</p></blockquote>
<p>Plenty has already received $400 million in investment capital from SoftBank, former Google chairman Eric Schmidt, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos. It’s also struck a deal with Albertsons stores in California to supply 430 stores with fresh produce.</p>
<p>Ideally, the company will branch out, opening vertical farms across the country and beyond. There can never be too many places graced by better food growing with a less environmental cost.</p>
<p>Here’s a <a href="https://anchor.fm/techfirst/episodes/The-future-of-farms-is-vertical-400X-more-yield--95-less-water--99-less-space-emesrq/a-a3sf2o5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TechFirst podcast</a> about the story behind Plenty:</p>

<p>Excerpted from <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time/#resolving-the-time-paradox">Functional Programming and the Semantics of Change, State &amp; Time</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No man can ever cross the same river twice.” Because what’s a river? I mean, we love this idea of objects; like there’s this thing that changes. Right? There’s no river. Right? There’s water there at one point-in-time. And another point-in-time, there’s other water there. — Rich Hickey, <a href="https://github.com/matthiasn/talk-transcripts/blob/master/Hickey_Rich/AreWeThereYet.md">Are We There Yet</a>, quoting Heraclitus.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>From the perspective of a user, a functional program may appear stateful. Interact with <a href="https://softwarefordays.com/post/functional-programming-and-identity-state-and-time/#stateful-functional-programs">the functional ATM program above</a> and notice the program remembering previous encounters. On the one hand, this is not surprising. We included an imperative layer to remember previous states. Instead of decomposing the state of the program into distinct objects, like <code>bankAccount</code> and <code>withdrawalAmount</code>, we created a single global object, the <code>store</code>. On the other hand, focusing on the “object” portion of the program betrays an object-oriented predisposition. The imperative piece of the program is merely a construct used to facilitate a computation based asynchronously on another. One can even imagine a programming language where such a construct is built into the language itself, hiding any imperative implementation from the programmer’s view. In fact, such a language exists that compiles to JavaScript.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="fnref1">[1]</a></sup> In other words, it is syntax, not semantics. The semantics of the program better align with the semantics of a recursive, iterative function, having state <code>S</code> at a discrete step <code>i</code> — run the functional ATM program with the output of the previous run to produce the input for the next.</p>
<p>That a program with a functional, stateless and timeless core can maintain state is surprising, to say the least. Look around the room, bus, park or wherever you find yourself reading this sentence, and you will likely identify “a collection of distinct objects,” such as dogs, people, and trees, “whose behaviors may change over time.” Look around the functional ATM program, on the other hand, and there are no identifiable objects to be found. Yet, the program appears to have state just like any other object in the room.</p>
<p>However, the ostensible “paradox” dissipates when the augmentation of our conception of time extends beyond the functional program to include the rest of our physical reality.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One way to resolve this paradox is to realize that it is the user’s temporal existence that imposes state on the system. If the user could step back from the interaction and think in terms of streams of balances rather than individual transactions, the system would appear stateless — <a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> Section 3.5.5</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Instead of viewing the <em>world</em> as the sum of its objects, each reflecting its latest state as time elapses, we may also think in terms of discrete state histories. We may interpret the dog at the park as moving in discrete steps <code>S(i)</code> to <code>S(i+1)</code>, just as we interpret the state of our functional program as moving in discrete steps <code>S(i)</code> to <code>S(i+1)</code>.</p>
<p>Consider video media. To movie scenes, we may attribute the same object-oriented semantics. Character and inanimate objects shift, interact and evolve as time elapses.</p>
<video id="metavideo" poster="https://softwarefordays.com/media/metavideoposter.gif" preload="none" width="480" controls="">
    <source src="https://softwarefordays.com/media/metavideo.mp4" type="video/mp4; codecs=&quot;avc1.42E01E, mp4a.40.2&quot;">
    <img src="https://softwarefordays.com/media/metavideo.mp4" title="Your browser does not support the mp4 video codec.">
</video>
<p>While playing the above video, for example, we may conclude that “a cat is dancing.” Yet, videos are comprised of static frames stitched together in a certain sequence at discrete time intervals. Each frame corresponds to a state of the video at a moment in time and the frames, taken together, a time-denominated series of discrete states. The media chosen above is intentionally meta. The video includes a TV animation of a scene mirrored by a flip-book<sup><a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">[2]</a></sup>, showing static frames strung together at discrete time intervals, which itself is mirrored by a flip-book in “real” life, showing static frames strung together at discrete time intervals. Take another step back to notice that the above gif media (or mp4 if your browser supports html5) being played on <em>your</em> computer is comprised of static frames, strung together at discrete time intervals.</p>
<p>There is nothing stopping us from taking another step back and interpreting the real world in which your computer currently sits as static frames, strung together at discrete time intervals. We <em>may</em> attribute normal object-oriented semantics to the above gif, concluding that “a cat is dancing.” However, we may also attribute functional semantics, concluding that “a cat has arms above its head on frame fᵢ.” At a park in the real world, we may conclude that “a dog is chasing a squirrel.” However, we may also conclude that “a dog is in the running motion behind a squirrel in the running motion on frame fᵢ.” In both cases, we may identify a time-series of states instead of objects that change over time. The functional programming paradigm can be coherently applied to world and program alike.</p>
<p>With a model for discrete time in mind, it is less surprising that functional programs can appear stateful. A user of the program may be viewed as a series of states, just like the program itself. A specific series of user states, for example,</p>
<pre><code>U₀: "Open up this blog post"<br>U₁: “Select 20 option”<br>U₂: “Click withdraw”<br>...<br>U(i): Uᵢ</code></pre>
<p>directly precipitate a series of program states:</p>
<pre><code>S₀: balance:100, amount:10<br>S₁: balance:100, amount:20<br>S₂: balance:80, amount:20<br>...<br>S(i): program(Sᵢ₋₁, Eᵢ)</code></pre>
<p>In both cases, pieces of static information may be listed, one <em>after</em> another. Moreover, both lists can be plotted along the same discrete timeline <code>i</code>. User interactions come in a certain order <code>U(i)</code>, triggering a run of the program function against the result of the previous run <code>S(i-1)</code> and event data <code>E(i)</code>, in order to produce <code>S(i)</code>. Our reality can be viewed as a time-series of states, just as it can be viewed as a collection of objects. Functional programming models a time-series of states, just as as object-oriented programming models objects. When the program and world <em>alike</em> can be viewed as “streams of information that flow in the system,” (<a href="https://web.mit.edu/alexmv/6.037/sicp.pdf">SICP</a> Section 3) the world can flow into the program, and the program back into the world.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to the 23rd edition of data engineering weekly. This week's edition is a yearend special edition where we will take a more in-depth look at the trends and emerging patterns in data engineering 2020. I divided the trends into the following categories.</p><ul><li><p>Data Infrastructure</p></li><li><p>Data Architecture</p></li><li><p>Data Management</p></li></ul><p>I hope you enjoy the data engineering trends 2020, and please share your thoughts in the comments.</p><p>I know this is a long article with so many links and references. TL;DR If I had to make a top 3 prediction for 2021 and beyond, here are they.</p><ol><li><p><em><strong>Metadata management will become mainstream. The data lineage, data quality, and data discovery tools will merge into a unified data management platform.</strong></em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>Data Mesh principles will get adopted more and drive a unified data management platform.</strong></em></p></li><li><p><em><strong>Lakehouse systems like Hudi, Iceberg, Deltalake will play a significant role in shaping the data engineering architecture.</strong></em></p></li></ol><p>Now, let’s go deep into each category and see the trends and predictions. Happy reading.</p><h2><em><strong><code>Managed Data Infrastructure &amp; Serverless Computing</code></strong></em></h2><p>In 2020, We saw the cloud platforms continue adopting the open-source data infrastructure solutions—the adoption growing from AWS's EMR, Google Cloud data proc, and Azure HDInsight to the recent AWS managed Airflow.</p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/introducing-amazon-managed-workflows-for-apache-airflow-mwaa/"><code>Introducing Amazon Managed Workflows for Apache Airflow (MWAA)</code></a></p><p>Though opinions differ on cloud platforms packaging the opensource, the cloud-managed infrastructure certainly carry many advantages for the consumers to quickly adopt complex infrastructure and focus on the business problems.</p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p>The rise of serverless architecture particularly very interesting trend in data engineering. The article summarizes the serverless data ops trend</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/swlh/dawn-of-dataops-can-we-build-a-100-serverless-etl-following-ci-cd-principles-3ca587ba1ec0"><code>Dawn of DataOps: Can We Build a 100% Serverless ETL Following CI/CD Principles?</code></a></p><p>Google Cloud launched a Google Cloud Workflow as a serverless orchestration engine.</p><p><a href="https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/get-to-know-google-cloud-workflows"><code>Get to know Workflows, Google Cloud’s serverless orchestration engine</code></a></p><blockquote><p><em><code>In 2021, It is an exciting space to watch how managed data infrastructure and the rise of serverless computing merge. </code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Cloud datawarehouse</code></strong></em></h2><p>At the beginning of 2010, tightly coupled computing and storage is a strategy to run large scale data processing engines. 2019 is when the industry finally declared the old way of thinking data processing no longer working and acknowledge the cloud datawarehouse system is the way to go.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@acmurthy/hadoop-is-dead-long-live-hadoop-f22069b264ac"><code>Hadoop is Dead. Long live Hadoop.</code></a></p><p>In 2020, Snowflake's successful IPO reassured the cloud datawarehouse systems are the future. The S3 strong read-after-write consistency guarantee is a significant step in adopting object storage for the cloud datawarehouse system, if not already.</p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-update-strong-read-after-write-consistency/"><code>Amazon S3 Update – Strong Read-After-Write Consistency</code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><blockquote><p><em><code>The cloud datawarehouse system will continue to dominate and increase the adoption in 2021 and beyond. It will be interesting to watch how the cloud datawarehouse systems are tightly integrating with the data management systems.</code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Cost Optimization</code></strong></em></h2><p>The cloud datawarehouse systems and the managed data infrastructure adds pressure on optimizing the cost of operating the datawarehouse systems. Netflix writes about cost optimization strategies for its data warehouse system.</p><p><a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/byte-down-making-netflixs-data-infrastructure-cost-effective-fee7b3235032"><code>Byte Down: Making Netflix’s Data Infrastructure Cost-Effective</code></a></p><p>At the same time, the GPU accelerated workload can provide a strategic business advantage. Pinterest and NVIDIA shared how Pinterest using GPU acceleration for visual search.</p><p><a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/2020/12/16/pinterest-trains-visual-search-faster-nvidia-gpus/"><code>Pinterest Trains Visual Search Faster with Optimized Architecture on NVIDIA GPUs </code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p>I added cost optimization as a separate section since cost optimization is often an afterthought. The unpredictability of the object storage engines egress and storage cost, handling cold vs. hot data &amp; the need for specialized hardware for a specific workload will be the norm of 2021 and beyond. </p><p>Alluxio is one solution that I am aware of providing tiered data processing capabilities, though not tuned for cost optimization.</p><p><a href="https://hackernoon.com/accelerate-spark-and-hive-jobs-on-aws-s3-by-10x-with-alluxio-as-a-tiered-storage-solution-5c3s3yes"><code>Accelerate Spark and Hive Jobs on AWS S3 by 10x with Alluxio as a Tiered Storage Solution</code></a></p><blockquote><p><em><code>It will be interesting to see how data processing frameworks like Spark, Flink adopting cost optimization as the first class optimization model, cache frequently used datasets and aware of specialized workloads. </code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Lakehouse</code></strong></em></h2><p>The separation of computing and storage and the scalable object storage like S3 increased the adoption of data lake principles in early 2019. One of the challenges remains to adopt object storage on the lack of transaction guarantees. The support for ACID transactions, data versioning, auditing, indexing, caching, and query optimization are vital characteristics to build large scale data systems. </p><p>In 2020, We noticed the emerging lakehouse frameworks like DataBricks Delta Lake, Apache Hudi, and Apache Iceberg.</p><p><a href="http://cidrdb.org/cidr2021/papers/cidr2021_paper17.pdf"><code>Lakehouse: A New Generation of Open Platforms that Unify Data Warehousing and Advanced Analytics</code></a></p><p>Adobe shared its Iceberg adoption story <a href="https://medium.com/adobetech/iceberg-at-adobe-88cf1950e866"><code>Iceberg at Adobe</code></a></p><p>Uber writes about its journey with Apache Hudi, and EMR now offers Hudi part of EMR</p><p><a href="https://eng.uber.com/apache-hudi-graduation/"><code>Building a Large-scale Transactional Data Lake at Uber Using Apache Hudi</code></a></p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/big-data/apply-record-level-changes-from-relational-databases-to-amazon-s3-data-lake-using-apache-hudi-on-amazon-emr-and-aws-database-migration-service/"><code>Apply record level changes from relational databases to Amazon S3 data lake using Apache Hudi on Amazon EMR and AWS Database Migration Service</code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p><a href="https://github.com/apache/iceberg/milestone/7"><code>Icerbeg’s version 2</code></a> to support row level upsert is another interesting development to watch in 2021.</p><blockquote><p><em><code>The Lakehouse systems continue to mature and will play a major role in shaping the data engineering architecture. It will be interesting to watch how lakehouse complement or compete with the likes of Snowflake and Redshift.</code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Lambda vs. Kappa vs. Lambda-less</code></strong></em></h2><p>Managing the real-time and batch computing and providing one integrated dataset view remains the main challenge in data processing.</p><p>Pinterest writes about some of the complication of Lambda Architecture and its migration journey to the Kappa architecture</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/pinterest-visual-signals-infrastructure-evolution-from-lambda-to-kappa-architecture-f8f58b127d98"><code>Pinterest Visual Signals Infrastructure: Evolution from Lambda to Kappa Architecture</code></a></p><p>LinkedIn took an interesting approach of Lambda-Less model</p><p><a href="https://engineering.linkedin.com/blog/2020/lambda-to-lambda-less-architecture"><code>From Lambda to Lambda-less: Lessons learned</code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><blockquote><p><em><code>There is no real-time vs. batch, it is all about the window that we process, but that is easier to say than the reality. In 2021 and beyond, I hope we will have a more innovative solution in this space.</code></em></p></blockquote><p>Apache Beam is an excellent attempt to bring the model closer. The development of Spark Streaming and the recent Apache Flink’s&nbsp;<a href="https://flink.apache.org/2020/12/15/pipelined-region-sheduling.html"><code>batch computing support</code></a>&nbsp;are some of the trends to watch.</p><h2><em><strong><code>Streaming SQL Engines &amp; OLAP Engines</code></strong></em></h2><p>Real-time computing and insights are critical for many businesses. Event sourcing is a well-established design pattern, and that brings the question of the decade. Can we join streams and compute business metrics or feed everything into OLAP databases and query it?</p><p>Confluent writes about the KSQL materialization process.</p><p><a href="https://www.confluent.io/blog/how-real-time-materialized-views-work-with-ksqldb/"><code>How Real-Time Materialized Views Work with ksqlDB, Animated</code></a></p><p>Materialize writes about joins in detail</p><p><a href="https://materialize.com/joins-in-materialize/"><code>Joins in Materialize</code></a></p><p>On the OLAP engine space Druid, Click House and Pinot adding multiple OLAP features and improves the operational efficiency. Apache Pinot is an impressive OLAP engine gaining momentum in 2020. Uber shared its experience operating Apache Pinot at scale.</p><p><a href="https://eng.uber.com/operating-apache-pinot/"><code>Operating Apache Pinot @ Uber Scale</code></a></p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p>Though streaming SQL engines and OLAP engines solve similar problems, I think there is a fundamental difference. Streaming SQL engines are good for pre-defined analytics, write once, and run workloads continuously. OLAP engines are good for interactive analytics when analytical queries are unknown while building the datasets.</p><blockquote><p><em><code>In 2021 and beyond I expect tighter integration among the Streaming SQL like KSQL and OLAP engines like Pinot.</code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Data Quality &amp; Metadata Management</code></strong></em></h2><p>The poor data quality costs an estimated $3.1 trillion per year in the USA alone, equating to 16.5% of the GDP.!! The data quality is critical for developing a data pipeline, and your ML model is as efficient as the quality of the data.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@expectgreatdata/why-data-quality-is-key-to-successful-ml-ops-a18d6e373ca9"><code>Why data quality is key to successful ML Ops</code></a></p><p>We’ve seen both Microsoft and Airbnb writes about how data quality effort improved its org decision-making process.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/data-science-at-microsoft/partnering-for-data-quality-dc9123557f8b"><code>Partnering for data quality</code></a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/data-quality-at-airbnb-e582465f3ef7"><code>Data Quality at Airbnb - Part 1 — Rebuilding at Scale</code></a></p><p><a href="https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/data-quality-at-airbnb-870d03080469"><code>Data Quality at Airbnb - Part 2 — A New Gold Standard</code></a></p><p>We have seen multiple tools and systems emerged on Data Quality, and this is a pretty good summarization f the data quality ecosystem.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/memory-leak/data-quality-a-primer-f6a945915511"><code>Data Quality — A Primer</code></a></p><p> One of the most remarkable trends of 2020 in data engineering is the emerging tooling and infrastructure to manage metadata at scale. I shared some of my thoughts about the importance of metadata in the past.</p><p>In 2020, we have seen many great articles from companies across the industry that shared their data discovery and metadata management. Data Engineering Weekly dedicated a week’s edition to focus on metadata management.</p><p><a href="https://www.dataengineeringweekly.com/p/data-engineering-weekly-21-metadata"><code>Data Engineering Weekly #21: Metadata Edition</code></a></p><p>LinkedIn organized&nbsp;<a href="https://metadataday2020.splashthat.com/"><code>Metadata Day 2020 - Metaspeak Meetup</code></a>&nbsp;as an attempt to unify people working on metadata management. Datakin announced the&nbsp;<a href="https://datakin.com/2020/12/18/introducing-openlineage/"><code>Open Lineage initiative</code></a><code>&nbsp;</code>to standardize the data lineage and the discovery effects.</p><h4>2021 &amp; Beyond</h4><p>I’ve included the data quality and the metadata management in the same section for a reason. In 2020 we saw isolated solutions to solve data lineage, data quality, and data discovery. Data Pipeline is a complex inter-dependent creation process of one dataset from another. Data lineage and data quality are two tightly coupled metadata systems that power the data discovery system.</p><blockquote><p><em><code>In 2021 and beyond, I expect all three problem spaces to merge and emerge as one unified data management platform that can provide data quality, lineage, and discovery service out of the box.</code></em></p></blockquote><h2><em><strong><code>Data Mesh</code></strong></em></h2><p>In 2020, Data Mesh emerged as de-facto principles for scale data management as the organization grows.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
			
			<p>In the last few years Iâ€™ve worked or played with a bunch of MVC frameworks: <strong>Laravel</strong>, <strong>Ruby on Rails</strong>, <strong>Django</strong>, and <strong>AdonisJS</strong>.</p>

<p>With two of them (Laravel and Dango) I also have some experience in production environments. Laravel is the one I know most.</p>

<p>So, what do they all share in common? Whatâ€™s the difference between them and Express, Flask, Sinatra? This article will try to explain the philosophy around those tools.</p>



<p>The web is not only a matter of serving the right file to the user; you usually also want to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>pass arguments, values, cookies, more generally data with the request;</li>
  <li>customize the output: not only in the format (plain html, or json, or â€¦ xml if you are kink enough), but also the data in it (if you are a logged user you may want to see more things than an anonymous user; etc)</li>
  <li>handle security, that is nowadays a first class citizen</li>
  <li>handle authorization, with one of the multiple authorization schemes hat have appeared in the last few years</li>
  <li>be able to scale: in the number of concurrent users, in the size of the handled data, and in the organization of the code itself.</li>
</ul>

<p>The key point here is,<strong>people got tired of solving the same problem over and over and invented a set of tools that standardized/simplified the developerâ€™s job</strong>, allowing to focus more on the business logic than on the details.</p>

<h2 id="so-whats-this-mvc-stuff">So whatâ€™s this MVC stuff?</h2>

<p>M stands for <strong>Model</strong>, and means the data that is manipulated by the framework. In current web frameworks the Model usually corresponds to classes that map to a database (E.g. <code>Person</code> class is linked to the <code>persons</code> table).</p>

<p>V stands for <strong>View</strong> and means the way the data is presented to the user. In my small dev life Iâ€™ve seen many ways to represent this part: JSON responses for example, or plain HTML. Usually, modern MVC tools offer a template system so you can write the <em>products.html</em> page once and then inject the data to be displayed.</p>

<p>C is for <strong>Controller</strong>, the part that will do the dirty job. When a request arrives, the controller will validate the input, fetch the database, apply business rules, and pass it to the right view. Or it will trigger some other systems. <em>This is the part youâ€™ll write in some programming language</em>.</p>

<h2 id="opinionated-vs-unopinionated">Opinionated vs Unopinionated</h2>

<p>Instead of referring to MVC vs Non-MVC frameworks, I think <strong>the best classification is between <em>Opinionated</em> vs <em>Unopinionated</em></strong>. Opinionated frameworks are those that are presented in this article; they give to the dev a lot of pre-made tools with sensible defaults that will do all the heavy lifting. Sad to say, but the developerâ€™s job is sometimes just to configure these tools to make them work as needed.</p>

<p>With <em>unopinionated frameworks</em>, you are alone with a tool that handles requests and responses. You may need to write all the tools you need, and end up creating a framework yourself. An example: you may need to decide how to access the database, or handle authenticationâ€¦ In this category I see <strong>Express</strong>, <strong>Flask</strong>, <strong>Sinatra</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="the-router-in-mvc">The router in MVC</h2>

<p>Almost all the opinionated frameworks expose a functionality called <em>router</em>. Similarly to phisical routers, these pieces of software will understand the URL of a request and will route to the right controller. One can create a route for <code>/products/123</code> and the router will send this request to <code>ProductController</code> calling the appropriate function and passing the parameter <code>123</code> as argument. Isnâ€™t this lovely?</p>

<p>So when I have to debug an application I usually start from here; I try to understand where the router configuration is (usually in <code>routes.php</code> or <code>urls.py</code>), and where the route Iâ€™m interested will point, and follow it.</p>

<h2 id="the-orms">The ORMs</h2>

<p><strong>ORM</strong> stands for <em>Object Relational Mapping</em> and is a framework that allows to express sql queries using class constructs. Almost every major framework ships an ORM that is perfect for simple and sometimes elaborated queries. Basically the Model classes will extend a base class that contains all the boilerplate to read from the DB table and perform queries. For example, in Laravel:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?php

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;

class Flight extends Model
{
    //
}
</code></pre>

<p>The class <code>Model</code> is the base class that will give to <code>Flight</code> all the fancy methods, like:</p>

<pre><code>// Retrieve a model by its primary key...
$flight = Flight::find(1);

// Retrieve the first model matching the query constraints...
$flight = Flight::where('active', 1)-&gt;first();
</code></pre>

<h2 id="template-systems">Template systems</h2>

<p>Almost every MVC framework use a template system, so you can create HTML files with lower effort, even though itâ€™s nowadays very easy to just respond with JSON. Usually it only depends on what you return from the controller.</p>

<h2 id="command-line-utilities">Command line utilities</h2>

<p>Laravel has <strong>artisan</strong>, Python has <strong>manage.py</strong>, Rails has <strong>rake</strong>. These three command line utilities do <em>a lot</em>. They can:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>create and execute migrations</strong>, that are operations that will change the structure of your database. You may create a migration to add a new table or change a column., for example. You can also rollback if something doesnâ€™t go as planned. All of that without writing SQLs directly on the DB server. We use this feature on a daily basis during development.</li>
  <li>Likewise the migrations, sometimes you only want to add data in tables, like the values of a select box. This process is called <strong>seeding</strong>.</li>
  <li>Put the server on <strong>maintenance mode</strong> and resume</li>
  <li><strong>create boilerplate</strong> (models, controllers, viewsâ€¦) from command line, so that you only have to fill those generated files</li>
  <li><strong>execute tests</strong></li>
  <li><strong>create custom commands</strong>; for example, we usually create commands for operations that should be triggered by cron, or long-lasting batch commands.</li>
  <li>â€¦and much more! Every tool exposes more or less capabilities.</li>
</ul>



<p>I cannot stress out how important is documentation when using those frameworks. Itâ€™s impossible to remember all the possible commands and configurations. You end up searching through docs, and if those are well written, you donâ€™t need to pay a visit on stack overflow right away. If you write an MVC tool and it doesnâ€™t have an <em>excellent</em> documentation, with a lot of examples, it will probably not be used by anyone.</p>

<h2 id="standardization">Standardization</h2>

<p>Another thing that pays off is that, no matter whoâ€™ll work on what, all the code will look the same, and will be organized the same way. This has some value, since those kind of systems must be maintained over a span of several years, while the average dev only works only 2 years in the same company :)</p>

<h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions</h2>

<p>I hope I donâ€™t have expressed concepts that are too trivial for the average reader; these are the basic info I wish somebody told me at the time.</p>

        <h3>What is Recaf?</h3>
        <p>Recaf is an open-source Java bytecode editor that simplifies the process of editing compiled Java applications. To make things easier Recaf abstracts away much of the internal class file format. Difficult tasks such as updating stack-frames are done automatically. Along with additional features to assist in the process of editing classes, Recaf is the most feature-rich free bytecode editor available.</p>
        
        <h3>Useful Information</h3>
        <p>While Recaf makes bytecode editing a more simple process it does not mean you should dive head-first into editing compiled Java applications without understanding some basic programming concepts and the Java class file architecture. Here are some references for these topics:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Years ago, I needed to track down a specific kernel regression, and I worked out an approach to automatically bisect the kernel, leveraging a combination of git and qemu.
A few days ago, someone posted on reddit that they’d seen a massive BTRFS performance regression in the 5.10 kernel under certain circumstances, and they’d managed to track it down to a commit.  <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/kieqyu/warning_linux_510_has_a_500_to_2000_btrfs/">https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/kieqyu/warning_linux_510_has_a_500_to_2000_btrfs/</a></p>
<p>I thought it might be interesting to revisit what I’d done, and see if I could automatically track down this specific performance regression using it, and share my approach.</p>
<h2 id="bisection">Bisection?</h2>
<p>The linux kernel source code is managed via the version control software <code>git</code>, with the code stored in a repository.  Git is designed to be decentralised, so you can have a full copy of a repository locally, including each and every way it has changed.  Most changes involve multiple files being updated, after which you commit them to the repository, along with a description of what the commit is.</p>
<p>Most software builds up in complexity over time and will often soon grow to a level of complexity where it’s impossible for any one engineer to have full awareness of the consequences of their change, and sometimes what seems to be a straightforward change can have unexpected consequences elsewhere.  When you’re only dealing with a few commits between a last known good state and failure, it’s easy to quickly track down the specific source of the problem.  As that scales up, tracking down a bug can get increasingly hard.</p>
<p>The linux kernel often has several thousand commits between releases.  If you were to try to track down a regression commit by commit, it’d take a long time to do.  Ideally you’d want to narrow down in on a set of commits related to just where you see the regression, but the cause could always be by another change elsewhere.  One way you can drastically cut down a sorted list is to bisect your way through all the changes: taking the midpoint between a known good and known bad endpoint,  roughly halving the number of commits to be validated each step.  A quick example, assuming 1000 commits to start with (and rounding down for ease):   1000 -&gt; 500 -&gt; 250 -&gt; 125 -&gt; 62 -&gt; 31 -&gt; 15 -&gt; 7 -&gt; 3.  You can see that the number of commits to be checked very quickly got down to manageable chunks.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that this approach has a series of assumptions baked in to it, for example we’re assuming that one commit introduced the bug.  Just because bisecting gets you down to a specific commit, doesn’t mean that only that commit is the issue.  It should act as a good starting point for investigation, however.  About 4 years ago I spent a week bisecting a kernel manually, as a somewhat background task, trying to track down what we thought was a kernel bug. What we actually found was a piece of software was making assumptions of specific behaviour from the kernel, that is explicitly stated is not guaranteed. The tracked down commit that “caused” the issue appeared to just mark a change in some optimisation in the compiler.  Fix the assumptions and problems vanished.</p>
<p>The git tool has built in native support for bisecting commits, allow you to designate commits or tags as “good” and “bad”, and then walk you through the process.  It also supports automatic bisection, if you provide it a command that will exit with a status code of 0 for good commits, and any other status code for bad commits.</p>
<h2 id="automating-kernel-bisection">Automating kernel bisection</h2>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to come up with a way to replicate the bug using a virtual machine (VM), spun up on the machine carrying out the bisection.  Build the kernel, launch a VM that uses it, and along with some way to trigger the behaviour you’re interested in.  With the need to do this in an unattended fashion, we need to use something like QEMU to handle the VM side of things, instead of something like VirtualBox.</p>
<p>The bug in question comes with replication instructions: Extract the latest firefox sources to an empty BTRFS formatted volume.  The original reporter found the time drastically increased for the operation, regardless of where the volume was, with USB storage seeing a particularly large hit.  Presumably that indicates a lot more round trip calls to storage.</p>
<p>So to automatically bisect the kernel we’re going to need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Full kernel source code checked out via git</li>
<li>QEMU installed and ideally able to run in an accelerated fashion.  In this case I found unaccelerated to be more than 10x slower for the task at hand.</li>
<li>A way to replicate the bug and pass the right status code back.  Given we’re extracting a tarball, we’ll want a full initramfs rather than a single binary initrd (In the appendix I’ll give some proformer Go and C code that could be used as a monolithic initrd)</li>
<li>A way to make an empty BTRFS volume of sufficient size for each loop.</li>
<li>A directory to do this under.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>mkdir ~/bisecting
</code></pre><h2 id="kernel">Kernel</h2>
<p>This part is pretty straightforward.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/
git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
</code></pre><p>Let’s make sure we can build a known good kernel, with BTRFS enabled, and run it under QEMU.  The default configuration for linux kernel doesn’t have BTRFS enabled, so we’ll need to specifically enable it, and then enable the default options for it.  We’ll then take a copy of the configuration to use as a base for bisecting, before finally building the kernel ready to use, using every available core.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/linux
git checkout v5.9    # That's bbf5c979011a099af5dc76498918ed7df445635b
make defconfig
echo "CONFIG_BTRFS_FS=y" &gt;&gt; .config
make olddefconfig
cp .config ../kernelconfig
make -j $( nproc )
</code></pre><p>On the system I’m using, the QEMU binary I want is <code>qemu-system-x86_64</code>.   On RHEL8 and derivatives, it has become <code>qemu-kvm</code>, under <code>/usr/libexec</code>.  Spinning up a new VM, with 4G of ram, using KVM acceleration:</p>
<pre><code>sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -nographic -append console=ttyS0 -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage -m 4G
</code></pre><p>You should see this launch, and ultimately result in a kernel panic after a few seconds, because it was unable to mount a root fs.  That’s expected, we didn’t give it one!  Hit <code>ctrl+a</code> and then <code>x</code>, and QEMU will terminate the VM.</p>
<p>Okay, so that’s a viable kernel. Now we need to create a BTRFS volume to pass to the machine as a local drive, before we create an initramfs to drive the experiment.</p>
<h2 id="btrfs-volume">BTRFS volume</h2>
<p>This part is super simple, but we’ll need to know how big to make it.  I’m going to use the 84.0.1 sources, and find out how big they are uncompressed</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting
wget https://archive.mozilla.org/pub/firefox/releases/84.0.1/source/firefox-84.0.1.source.tar.xz
xz -l firefox-84.0.1.source.tar.xz
</code></pre><p>This returns:</p>
<pre><code>Strms  Blocks   Compressed Uncompressed  Ratio  Check   Filename
    1      12    352.8 MiB  2,203.4 MiB  0.160  CRC64   firefox-84.0.1.source.tar.xz
</code></pre><p>So we should assume at least 2.2GB of storage needed once extracted.  We’ll want to give it plenty of headroom to avoid any behavioural changes that may be triggered when the drive is nearly full.  So let’s take 10G as a reasonable starting point.   Most file systems support “sparse” files, so we won’t actually take up 10G of space, only whatever is used.  We can use <code>truncate</code> to create a sparse 10G file, and then <code>mkfs.btrfs</code> to format it</p>
<pre><code>truncate -s 10G btrfs
mkfs.btrfs btrfs
</code></pre><p>Okay, that’s the easiest bit done.  Now on to initramfs creation.</p>

<p>An initramfs is a CPIO archive, typically gzip’d, containing a simple filesystem.  We can create something suitable pretty much anywhere we like, and just package it up.</p>
<p>Let’s create the skeleton of one first:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir -p ~/bisecting/initramfs/{bin,sbin,etc,proc,sys}
</code></pre><p>At the very least we’re going to need <code>tar</code> and <code>time</code> while we experiment creating a reproduceable test, and ideally the <code>timeout</code> command for when we automate it.  The easiest way to achieve this is via busybox (<a href="https://www.busybox.net/)">https://www.busybox.net/)</a>.  We’ll need a statically compiled (entirely self contained) version of busybox for this.  On Debian derivatives, you can install the <code>busybox-static</code> package via <code>apt</code>.  Alternatively you could download the binary from Busybox direct: <a href="https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/">https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/</a>.  Verify that it is statically compiled by running <code>ldd</code> against the busybox binary.  It should report “not a dynamic executable”.  We’ll need a copy installed in the initramfs:</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/initramfs/bin
cp /path/to/busybox ./
./busybox --install .
ls
</code></pre><p>You should see from the ls output that busybox is providing a number of standard linux tools.</p>
<p>Now we’ll need a <code>init</code> script to go along with it.  We’re going to aim for fairly minimal as we’re exploring this. What we’ll ideally want is the firefox sources, and a shell prompt.</p>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/initramfs
cp ../firefox-84.0.1.source.tar.xz ./
cat &gt; init &lt;&lt; EOF
#!/bin/sh

# mount special mount points
mount -t proc proc /proc
mount -t sysfs sysfs /sys
mount -n -t tmpfs none /dev
mdev -s

# Give us a shell
sh

# Power off the machine when done
poweroff -f
EOF

chmod +x init
</code></pre><p>That gives us everything we should need, we just need to convert it in to the initramfs.</p>
<pre><code>find . | cpio -H newc -o | gzip &gt; ../initramfs.gz
</code></pre><p>We now have:</p>
<ul>
<li>a kernel</li>
<li>an initramfs</li>
<li>a BTRFS formatted file ready to be used as a file system</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s explore what we get, see if we can time extraction of the sources.</p>
<h2 id="exploring">Exploring</h2>
<pre><code>cd ~/bisecting/linux
sudo qemu-system-x86_64 -enable-kvm -nographic -append console=ttyS0 -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage -m 4G -drive format=raw,file=../btrfs -initrd ../initramfs.gz
</code></pre><p>Okay, now we have a prompt.  All being well, we also have a <code>/dev/sda</code></p>
<pre><code>/ # dmesg | grep sda
[   58.819258] dmesg (74) used greatest stack depth: 14264 bytes left

So when I took a look at a sample (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2013/11/innovations-list/309536/#list">The Atlantic</a>,  <a href="https://ocul-qu.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/fulldisplay?context=L&amp;vid=01OCUL_QU:QU_DEFAULT&amp;docid=alma9927085643405158">Kendall Haven's book</a>) there's actually a reasonable amount of overlap.</p><p>But a lot of the overlap is in the application of certain technologies rather than the discovery itself. Once Leibniz invented calculus, he didn't immediately set upon to use it and discover gravity. That remained Newton's to figure out.</p><p>So perhaps the curious fact isn't just that people managed to figure out things at the same time. But that they were looking at the same place at the same time.</p><p>That opens up the question of whether there were groups of smart people who all thought to explore similar research areas at the same time, and turns out there are! Clusters of people who looked at the same fields at the same time are everywhere! In fact when you look at innovation spreading in any era it usually follows a cluster of some sort.</p><p>I started writing about the weird fact that turn of the century Hungary was a weird place, seemingly filled with geniuses you could (but probably shouldn't) hit with a rock in any direction.</p><blockquote><p>There's a mythology about Hungarian super geniuses who were born at the turn of the 20th century, all in a suspiciously small neighbourhood, often going to similar or the same schools, and growing up with each other. John von Neumann, Paul Erdos, Leo Szilard, Edward Teller, Nicholas Kurti, Peter Lax, Nicholas Kaldor, George Soros, Andy Grove, Dennis Gabor, George Polya, the list goes on and on. They towered over fields of mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, economics, computer science, even business. There's barely a human endeavour where they did not make a large and towering difference.</p></blockquote><p>This seemed to also be true in Silicon Valley. Paypal mafia, Stanford mafia, the old school Intel mafia, never forget Bell Labs mafia. There seemed to be quite a few groups of people who somehow seemed to have all found each other and created billions of dollars through happy happenstance.</p><p>I wondered whether there was a super radiation spike, or something in the water, or whether there was a Professor Xavier hidden somewhere in there, but none of those seemed particularly credible.</p><blockquote><p>So there are three possibilities. One is that Hungary at the turn of the 20th century was hit with some sort of genius radiation causing a genetic mutation in a large fraction of the population, and hey presto, genius alert. It's unlikely, of course, but what else could explain the extraordinary co-location of such a large number of geniuses who were all so good, that they got to the top of their fields.</p><p>Another option is that they were all pretty bright, but something in the cultural zeitgeist combined with some special educational process or insight created their special abilities. Like Professor Xavier's school for gifted children, they created superheroes. The puzzle here is what made it stop. Surely if you make superheroes for a couple of decades, you don't stop. You keep going! But it doesn't feel like Hungary is particularly adept today at creating more von Neumanns.</p></blockquote><p>My conclusion then was that somehow genius clusters make each other succeed more often than they would have otherwise. Which isn't a particularly controversial thing to say, since that's what seems to happen anyway. Put smart people together, they do even smarter things. Standing on the shoulders of giants and all.</p><h2>II</h2><p>And within this group of geniuses who have all found each other and exchange ideas to cross-pollinate and create even better ones, another constraint is needed. They need to have the right toolkit and ideas in the first place. In Ancient Greece, in the absence of much scientific progress, the advances were mostly made amongst subjects that can be done solely in the mind - philosophy and mathematics.</p><p>Though we don't know the names, I imagine there would have been similar cliques in architecture in Ancient Rome, or Egypt for that matter. In the Renaissance, they could build on the knowledge that had existed on arts and architecture to sculpt Pieta or build the Pantheon. In Central Europe in the late 19th century there were pressing problems in physics and chemistry which were opening up entire vistas of knowledge.</p><p>So the requirements become larger numbers of smart people, who have the time to cogitate and work on things that go beyond their daily bread, connected in networks that enable them all to rise together, rather than just succeed individually. That still seems like something that could exist, and did exist, at multiple points in human history.</p><p>In almost any society there is an upper class which has enough smart people with enough free time and who know each other from educational and social circles, that this criterion gets filled. So there has to be something more, something that defines not just their ability to work on something, but the ability to actually make progress on something.</p><p>I could work half a century on anti-gravity with other smart people, but I wouldn't place a bet on my ability to succeed in floating serenely above the clouds. Some things are harder than just to be a function (talent, time to work, network). It also needs the variable that is feasibility of making progress.</p><p>Which means that it's not just that there was a vast sea of ignorance that the geniuses could try to work on together, each guided by their own idiosyncratic likes and viewpoints. It's that oftentimes there existed translucent and tenuous maps that showed potential routes to actually conquer these fields.</p><p>It's not that Heraclitus had a brainwave that atoms <em>could potentially</em> exist. It's that Bohr created an actual model of what that might look like, and devised experiments to get to the bottom of the matter.</p><p>Sometimes fields get to a pregnant stage where everyone gets really sure that if they just work hard enough they will uncover all sorts of things. Sometimes they're right, and other times they are not. But the feeling is still there, and it's rather unmistakeable.</p><p>Whatever the right metaphor, the scene has to be set right. Nobody could invent Instagram, as much as they might have wanted to, before people had smartphones. Nobody could invent Microsoft before people had PCs. Nobody could invent CRISPR before we understood DNA and a whole lot else besides which I don't understand well enough to explain.</p><p>Standing on the shoulders of giants is a known cliché but it also happens to be true. More importantly it happens to mean that when there are giants standing around that you can climb up on, as long as there are enough of you, many of you will be looking at the same vista at the same time.</p><p>We're not waiting for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genius_(mythology)">tutelary deity</a> to inspire us, or for genius insights to strike like never before without prior warning, but often the problems we look at are the same, and the tools we use are often similar, and the solutions we come up with naturally rhyme. As the inimitable Pratchett wrote: about Leonardo da Quirm:</p><blockquote><p>Particles of raw inspiration sleet through the universe all the time. Every once in a while one of them hits a receptive mind, which then invents DNA or the flute sonata form or a way of making light bulbs wear out in half the time. But most of them miss. Most people go through their lives without being hit by even one. Some people are even more unfortunate. They get them all.</p></blockquote><h2>III</h2><p>One highly suggestive outcome of this analysis is also that ideas are everywhere and much less exclusive than one might imagine.</p><p>When looking into this I came across a list of 7 "greatest ideas" in history. Even forgetting the biases that might have been involved and the myriad ones that didn't make it into the list, it's a good starting point. The ones identified were:</p><ul><li><p>Aristotle's Logic</p></li><li><p>Gödel's Incompleteness Theorems</p></li><li><p>Newton's Physics</p></li><li><p>Darwin's Natural Selection</p></li><li><p>Einstein's Miracle Year</p></li><li><p>Shannon's Information Theory</p></li><li><p>Tim Berners-Lee's World Wide Web</p></li></ul><p>Even within this rarified list let's see what we find:</p><ul><li><p>Godel's theorem was clearly a massive accomplishment. However in the theorems of limitations of formal systems there's Tarski's undefinability theorem and Church's proof and Turing's halting theorem, all of which revolve around the same few issues</p></li><li><p>Darwin's contemporary Alfred Wallace …</p></li></ul></div></div>

        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>This post introduces a new model for a path drawing (pen) tool, with a particular focus on font design.</p>

<p>Although this tool works much like familiar pen tools (which are based on the manipulation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">Bézier curves</a>), it is actually based on a new family of two-control-point curves, which we’ve been calling the <em>hyperbezier</em>.</p>

<p>This work is still in its early stages, and the demo below is quite barebones; my goal here is to get a simple version of this tool into the hands of designers and design-tool makers, so that more people can start to play around and evaluate it.</p>

<h4 id="contents">Contents</h4>



<h3 id="-background--motivation"><a id="background"></a> Background &amp; motivation</h3>

<p>The basis of this tool is a new mathematical model for fitting a curve to a set of points; that work was done earlier in the year by my collaborator <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/">Raph Levien</a>. For the past year or so Raph has been excitedly talking to me about about things like <em>splines</em> and <em>G2 continuity</em> and the elegance of the <em>Euler spiral</em>, and I have for the most part been smiling politely and nodding. In the last few weeks however I have started trying to implement a simple drawing app around his new model, and the excitement is catching: this new tool feels like the first I have used that is a compelling alternative to traditional Bézier-curve based drawing tools.</p>

<p>It is likely that if you have ever used a computer drawing application then you have, at some point, used a <em>pen tool</em>: a tool that allows you to place a small number of points, which are then connected with a series of curves, the exact curvature being a function of the position of the points.</p>

<p>Tools like this— which take some fixed number of points and calculate a curve based on them— are called <em>splines</em>. If you are curious about the topic (particularly in the context of interactive design tools), a very accessible overview is Raph’s <a href="https://levien.com/phd/thesis.pdf">dissertation</a>; I won’t go into too much detail here, except to say that Raph has been revisiting this subject recently, and the result is the <a href="https://github.com/linebender/spline"><em>hyperbezier spline</em></a>. Like traditional (cubic) Bézier paths, a hyperbezier path is comprised of segments, each defined by two <em>on-curve</em> and two <em>off-curve</em> (or <em>control</em>) points; the curve passes through the two on-curve points, and the curvature itself is determined by the position of the two off-curve points.</p>

<p><img id="simple-cubic" src="https://www.cmyr.net/assets/hyperbez/hyperbez-simple-cubic1.png" alt="A simple cubic Bézier"></p>
<p>A Bézier path, consisting of two segments</p>

<p>If you’re generally curious about Béziers, <a href="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/">A Primer on Béziers Curves</a> is an excellent resource. For our purposes it is enough to note that splines based on direct manipulation of Bézier control points (most pen tools) provide a high degree of control, but are difficult to use well. In particular, it can be tricky to maintain consistent curvature between adjoining segments of a path, which can lead to a ‘lumpy’ look; the following example is  contrived, but in practice consistently getting smooth feeling curves with Béziers is challenging.</p>


<p>A lumpy path. Mouseover to see the filled outline.</p>

<h3 id="-the-hyperbezier"><a id="hyperbezier"></a> The hyperbezier</h3>

<p>The core idea of the hyperbezier is the use of <em>auto-points</em>. These control points are adjusted automatically by the tool in order to maintain a smooth curve between neighbouring curve segments.</p>

<p>Let’s look at an example. With the path below you can drag points around, and double-click points to toggle their type.</p>

<p>The two green squares are <em>corner</em> points; curve segments that join at these points are allowed to change direction sharply. The two blue circles are <em>smooth</em> points; changing the curve on one side of the point can cause changes in the <em>auto</em> points (and hence the curve) on the other side.</p>

<p>The auto-points are indicated with dashed lines and terminating ‘x’s. The manual control points are indicated with solid lines, and terminating ‘o’s.</p>




<h5 id="playing-around">Playing around</h5>
<p>To get a better understanding of the spline’s behaviour, here are some things to try <em>(this requires a mouse)</em>:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>double-click the bottom point to make it smooth</em>. When this point is smooth, the auto points beside it are adjusted so that the two curve segments join smoothly.</li>
  <li><a href="#" onclick="reloadHeart();return false;">reset,</a> or double-click the bottom point to turn it back into a corner. Now <em>doubleclick the top-left smooth point</em>. Making the top-left point a corner will replace the curve between them with a straight line. Two adjacent corners with only auto-points between them will always form a straight line, because a line is maximally smooth.
    <ul>
      <li>You should notice two small ‘x’s on this line. <em>Drag one of these auto points somewhere to position it manually</em>. You will notice that the remaining auto-point is repositioned as you drag.</li>
      <li><em>Drag the other auto-point</em>. With both control points positioned manually, and with corners at either end, you have full control of this segment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<!--(TK: SIMPLIFY ME, JUST INTRODUCE AUTO POINTS)The principal goal of the hyperbezier is to make it easier to maintain consistent curvature between adjoining segments of a path. This is achieved by letting the designer choose to have certain control points positioned automatically. These *auto-points* are adjusted in response to changes in adjoining segments so as to form a [smooth][smoothness] curve.-->

<!--In addition, on-curve points can be either *smooth* points or *corners*; if a point is smooth (marked by a green circle) then any auto points on either side of that point will be adjusted to maintain curvature with the segment on the other side. If a point is a corner (marked by a blue square) then the segment on one side of the point is not influenced by the curvature on the other side.-->

<!--Moving any on-curve point can cause subtle changes to the position of multiple auto-points; the example below is interactive, and you can drag the various points around, or toggle their type. Notice how the behaviour of the auto points changes if you toggle a nearby on-curve point between smooth and corner;

<p>Some example paths, drawn in the tool.</p>

<!--. This is very much a demo; the idea is to explore the interaction model, and to get a sense for how it feels to draw with the tool, compared to the standard Bézier curves used in most pen tools. Spoiler: I think it feels *really good*. You [can play around with it yourself][hypertoy]; it is pretty rough around the edges, but it works.-->

<h4 id="-using-the-toy-pen-tool"><a id="toy-guide"></a> Using the toy pen tool</h4>

<p>The toy is very rough: you have a select and a pen tool, but there are no rulers or measurement tools, no transforms, no ability to select multiple points. The pen works much like the familiar Bézier pen:</p>

<p>General:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>V</code> key sets selection (arrow) tool, <code>P</code> key sets pen tool</li>
  <li>holding the space bar hides UI and shows filled path</li>
  <li>the current drawing is stored as part of the URL; copy this somewhere to “save”</li>
</ul>

<p>Pen tool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>click to add a line segment ending in a corner point</li>
  <li>alt + click to add an automatic curve segment ending in a smooth point</li>
  <li>click + drag to add a curve segment ending in a smooth point, with a manual control point</li>
  <li>click on a line segment to insert a point there; alt makes it a smooth point</li>
  <li>alt + click on any existing point to toggle the type of that point</li>
</ul>

<p>Select tool:</p>

<ul>
  <li>drag a control auto-point to move it, converting it to a manual point if necessary</li>
  <li>double-click will toggle an on-curve point between smooth and corner</li>
  <li>alt + click on a line segment to add two auto points</li>
  <li>deleting an off-curve point makes that curve segment into a line segment</li>
  <li>arrow keys nudge the current selection by 1 px; adding shift makes it 10px, and ctrl/cmd makes it 100px.</li>
  <li>shift + any of the above moves all of the points in the current outline (I’m sorry)</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="-next-steps"><a id="next-steps"></a> Next steps</h3>

<p>The code for the spline, including the demo, is <a href="https://github.com/linebender/spline">open source and available on github</a>.</p>

<p>The intent of this demo is twofold: firstly to test out how the curve feels to use, and to start playing around with the UX of the pen tool, and secondly to share this research with the broader community of designers and design-tool creators. Although this work is quite rough, my personal feeling is that this spline shows tremendous promise. Anecdotally, as a mere casual user of design tools, I find it <em>significantly</em> easier to make good looking curves with the hyperbezier than I do with traditional Bézier pen tools.</p>

<p>Perhaps the biggest question will be figuring out the best interaction model: what set of mouse clicks, key presses and modifiers the user issues in order to control the state of the points. This has been a challenge for other new splines; the interaction model we use with Béziers is <a href="https://youtu.be/sT8Y7o-zsVw?t=68">familiar and long-established</a>, and people (especially graphic designers) are deeply comfortable with it. The interaction model used here for the hyperbezier is intentionally designed to feel similar to these existing tools, but other interaction models may be worth exploring.</p>

<p>In the coming weeks I hope to integrating the spline into <a href="https://github.com/linebender/runebender">Runebender</a>, a font editor, which will provide a much richer editing experience and will let us better explore how well the spline is suited to real-world use. In addition, Raph intends to do a more detailed writeup of the spline itself and the associated math, which derives both from the earlier Spiro spline and the classic model of elastica under tension.</p>

<p>If you’re curious about the spline, there are more details in the <a href="https://github.com/linebender/spline">github repo</a>; if you have questions you can open an issue there, ask them in our <a href="https://xi.zulipchat.com/">zulip chat server</a> or reach out on <a href="https://twitter.com/cmyr">on twitter</a>.</p>

						<p>In patients with low socioeconomic status, heart resuscitation is heavily delayed and, according to a recent European Heart Journal report last week, victims of cardiac arrest in hospitals are less likely to recover.</p><p>Researchers analyzed data from the national Swedish cardiopulmonary resuscitation register for 24,217 cardiac arrests in Swedish hospitals between 2005 and 2018 in patients 40 and older. They collected socioeconomic data on patients from a second database and used the highest rate of education and annual income as a socioeconomic status (SES) measure.</p><p>"The good news is that for most of the cardiac arrest cases in this study, socioeconomic status didn't seem to matter." said Professor Jens Agerström of Linnaeus University in Kalmar and Växjö, Sweden, "Nevertheless, there seems to be a significant number of deaths that can still be attributed to socioeconomic factors, even when we take account of things that could affect the results such as gender, age, ethnicity, other health conditions, cause of the cardiac arrest, and the specific hospital providing the treatment."</p><p>Patients with higher SES were slightly better controlled for heart rhythm prior to cardiac arrest. This may partly explain the survival disparities. Most unrecovered combinations between patient SES and the findings studied are minimal. A disparity in SES-related survival chances of around 21 percent shouldn't be overlooked, authors say.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/ehaa954f3.png 1949w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Credit: European Heart Journal</figcaption></figure><p>The study investigated several outcomes but looking at survival for 30 days after the cardiac arrest, approximately 280 people in 1000 from a low socioeconomic background will survive; however, for patients from a high socioeconomic background approximately 320 people may survive to 30 days.</p><p>The goal of the new retrospective registry was to investigate SES inequalities in IHCA care and survival.

<p>Long-range wireless power transmission is a concept that has been a long time coming since Nikola Tesla obtained a patent for the Tesla coil over 120 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the recent decade, wireless power has become more of a familiar term, with companies such as Powerbyproxi and WiTricity leading the way with innovation in short-range wireless technology. That is, the ability to transmit electrical power over short distances (up to a few metres), primarily to charge consumer devices like mobile phones. This technology enables us to charge devices without requiring wires within short range, e.g. at home or by driving up to an electric vehicle charging station.</p>



<p>The next evolution in freeing humanity from the restrictions of where wires can go is the ability to transmit large amounts of power over large distances. Instead of charging devices, long-range wireless transmission<strong> </strong>technology<strong> </strong>will allow us to power households, communities and send large quantities of power to places where it is too hard and expensive to reach using wire infrastructure. This is the technology Emrod is working on, which will support the uptake of sustainable energy and decentralizing electric grids.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this article, we make a comparison between short-range and long-range power transmission, including the difference in technology and use cases.</p>



<p>First, let’s start with getting clear on what wireless power transmission is.</p>



<h3><strong>What is wireless power transmission?</strong></h3>



<p>Wireless power transmission is the act of delivering meaningful amounts of energy without moving or employing mass between transmitter and receiver. Electromagnetic fields convey power across space. It can replace the need for wires and batteries to provide a more convenient, mobile and safer way to provide energy.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>According to early history, Heinrich Hertz was the first to prove the existence of electromagnetic waves. Hence the name “hertz” as the unit for frequency.</em></p>



<p>The difference between short and long-range power transmission can clearly be defined by the distance across which the power is transmitted. However, what determines the capabilities of these different types of technology?</p>

<h3><strong>Short-range wireless power</strong></h3>



<p>Short-range is typically power transmission within centimetres and metres. The most common wireless power transmission technique is with Inductive Power Transfer, where power is transferred utilizing a magnetic field using inductive coupling between two coils of wire.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Examples of short-range power transmission by this definition include powering devices wirelessly within a house or building and charging electric cars using a resonant magnetic induction pad on the ground.</p>



<h3><strong>Long-range wireless power transmission</strong></h3>



<p>Long-range is typically power transmission of 100’s of metres or across kilometres. One technique of power transmission is using antennas to send electromagnetic beams, like microwaves or lasers. The limitation with using inductive coupling power transmission in long-range is that the magnetic field decays quite rapidly when the distance between the transmitter and receiver is increased. Therefore, electromagnetic beaming is more appropriate for this reason.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Long-range power transmission with antennas can be categorised into Near-Field or Far-Field. In the near-field, one can observe plane waves with very little to no beam divergence. Conversely, in the far-field there is significant beam divergence, and inverse squared decay for the power density with distance, something which is not observed in the near-field.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Emrod’s purpose, we work in the near-field to produce a collimated beam with negligible loss.&nbsp;</p>



<p><br>The use cases for long-range transmission include beaming power from space to earth, charging unmanned aerial vehicles (without requiring the UAV to return to a base for charging) and transmitting power across difficult terrain instead of using wires, which is the problem we are solving at Emrod. Learn more about the use cases for Emrod’s technology <a href="https://emrod.energy/use-cases/">here.</a></p>



<h3><strong>Why are these new developments in long-range technology significant?</strong></h3>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="576" src="https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emrod-long-range-wireless-energy-transmission.png" alt="" srcset="https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emrod-long-range-wireless-energy-transmission.png 1024w, https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emrod-long-range-wireless-energy-transmission-300x169.png 300w, https://secureservercdn.net/166.62.108.196/u1v.9ad.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Emrod-long-range-wireless-energy-transmission-768x432.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p>For energy to be useful, it needs to move from where it is generated to where it is required. Energy is similar to communication in this sense. For communication services to be useful, they must be able to transmit a message from one person to another. At the moment, our methods for generating energy are dependent on the locations that can be accessed economically using wired infrastructure (lines and pylons, and underwater cables). Many of the best places to generate renewable energy are hard to reach areas, for example high up on hills or mountains or offshore locations, where there is lots of wind, and it’s well out of the way of people.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the other hand, the people who have access to energy are dependent on the economics of connecting the household or community to a power source. Many communities and dwellings do not have reliable access to electricity because they are in remote, hard to access areas where it is not economically viable to put in and maintain power lines or cables.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By reducing the costs and ease of installing and maintaining the infrastructure that transmits power from one place to another, we can open up our access to and provision of energy.</p>



<h3><strong>Emrod’s long-range wireless technology use cases</strong></h3>



<p>At Emrod, we have developed technology that allows power to be transmitted over many kilometres.&nbsp; It is the worlds first long-range wireless power transmission technology that is commercially viable. We use passive relays to achieve power transmission over a long distance, without the losses that would otherwise make long distance transmissions inefficient and uneconomical for commercial purposes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The application of Emrod’s technology is wide-reaching, but we are primarily focused on working with energy distribution companies and organizations driving sustainable energy and decentralized grid projects.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Emrod’s wireless system can provide a cost-effective solution for the transmission of power across terrain where it is difficult to lay and maintain power lines and cables. For example across forests or waterways, to alleviate right of passage issues or reduce the ecological impact of pylons, and to provide back up systems when power lines fail, for example, outages or disaster relief.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can read more about the common use cases for Emrod’s technology on the <a href="https://emrod.energy/use-cases/">Use Cases page of our website</a>.</p>



<h3><strong>Conclusion</strong></h3>



<p>The early modern development of wireless transmission technology used magnetic induction charging pads, which required contact and careful alignment of the device, e.g. a phone. Subsequently, technology developed to charge smartphones and other devices from meters away that works like a strong WiFi. This technology has been considered long-range, in comparison to the previous wireless technology, which required the transmitting and receiving devices to be in contact with one another. We have now entered into the next era of wireless technology, which is the transmission of larger amounts of power over kilometres. It is an exciting next step towards Nikola Tesla’s vision of power everywhere.</p>

<hr>
<p>It's that time between Christmas and new year again, where you can usually find me at Leipzig's Congress Zentrum on my computer hacking away. It's chaos congress time. Given this year's pandemic, the "37c3" however, was moved to the internet and renamed to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rc3.world/">"rc3", the Remote Chaos Communication Congress</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, the iconic congress build-up started. This time around, building up didn't involve moving heavy crates of mate tea around. Instead, it meant that everyone started designing, drawing, and building their assembly maps for the "rc3.world". A <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://events.ccc.de/2020/09/04/rc3-remote-chaos-experience/">2D virtual space</a> that's supposed to replace this year's lack of physical space.</p>
<p>The rc3.world software is a fork of <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://workadventu.re/">workadventu.re</a>, a 2D game simulating a virtual work environment with avatars. Within this 2D map of the virtual congress, the organizers invited all assemblies to build their own spaces. And so, as the build-up for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtion Protocol</a> assembly began, I had an idea for a project.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/wasm-synth-screenshot.png" alt=""><figcaption><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a>, the project I launched at last year's c3</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>At last year's congress in Leipzig, I had launched <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a>, a synthesizer built in WebAssembly. Naturally, this time I was eager to take the project to the next stage. Hence, roughly a week ago, I started to work on a new project called "WASM-STREAM" - an extension to wasm-synth.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/social-dist0rtion-protocol/wasm-stream">WASM-STREAM</a> is a virtual stage for digital artists. Using WASM-STREAM, an artist can broadcast their play with wasm-synth to an internet radio stream. More importantly, though, this means that they can take the stage on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.dist0rtion.com/">Social Dist0rtion Protocol</a>'s assembly and jam away to a virtually present audience.</p>
<figure>
<img src="https://timdaub.github.io/assets/images/wasm-stream.png" alt=""><figcaption>Social Dist0rtion Protocol's dance floor in the rc3.world</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So how did I build it?</p>
<h2 id="a-first-little-demo">A First Little Demo</h2>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">wasm-synth</a> is a project that I built deliberately to showcase the power of the web. At the beginning of the year, I wrote <a href="https://timdaub.github.io/2020/02/19/wasm-synth/">a blog post</a> outlining its technical details. It's using the <code>AudioWorklet</code> and some WebAssembly-transpiled code to render audio in real-time in the user's browser.</p>
<p>Now, workadventure, the software ccc uses to run their rc3.world, is also built on the web and allows embedding audio streams. So I thought, why not take the audio generated in wasm-synth and stream it to everyone in the rc3 world.</p>
<p>In a way, it sounds like not that big of a deal to build an audio streaming client within a website. But remember that a browser's networking ability is limited. While we've come a long way from the <code>XMLRequest</code> API to <code>fetch</code>, <code>WebSocket</code> and <code>WebRTC</code>, these concepts only allow talking upstream if their authors deliberately built their upstream application for supporting them.</p>
<p>Naive as I Am, I started by deploying <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://icecast.org/">icecast2</a> to a small Hetzner instance. I configured an authorized mount point that allows a streamer to connect using client software. Then I looked for a way to stream audio directly to icecast from a browser. And found... nothing.</p>
<p>Well, I did find something. It's called <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://webcast.github.io/">webcast</a>, and it's a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">WebSocket-based subprotocol</a> that allows sending binary audio data between a client and a server. In their <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js#server">README.md</a>, the authors also mention webcast's compatibility with <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/">liquidsoap</a>, a DSL for audio stream processing.</p>
<p>So my first attempt at plugging these things together involved encoding the <code>Float32Array</code> data from the <code>AudioWorklet</code> into an mp3 stream using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/toots/shine/">libshine</a> (that has a wasm JavaScript package) and then sending it to a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.liquidsoap.info/doc-dev/harbor.html">liquidsoap "harbor"</a> via webcast. Liqidsoap would then convert the mp3 stream to ogg-vorbis, make it stereo, and forward it to the icecast server.</p>
<p>And, to my surprise, it worked. When I hit some keys on the wasm-synth, they got encoded and sent to the audio stream. With a bit of delay, I heard what I had just played. Cool!</p>
<p>Anyways, with my small little demo, I was galvanized and motivated enough to spend more time building something that would work for the congress.</p>
<h2 id="the-wasm-stream-architecture">The WASM-STREAM Architecture</h2>
<p>Ultimately, liquidsoap was not well-suited for my purpose. I also quickly realized that all I had to do was build a proxy between the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://gist.github.com/ePirat/adc3b8ba00d85b7e3870">icecast protocol</a> and the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">webcast protocol</a>. And that's what I ended up building. A small <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/webcast/webcast.js/blob/master/SPECS.md">JavaScript application</a> implementing two protocols. It listens for incoming WebSocket connections and calls icecast with a loooooonng PUT request to establish a stream.</p>
<p>WASM-STREAM itself doesn't do any encoding. It can, however, route an <code>audio/ogg</code> or an <code>audio/mpeg</code> stream from webcast to icecast. The encoding from WAV to mp3 takes place on the user's device already when the play the synthesizer.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-wasm-stream">How To Use WASM-STREAM</h2>
<p>Whether you have a ticket to rc3 or not, you can tune into the stream at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream">https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/stream</a>. It's an mp3-encoded stream, meaning it won't work in all browsers equally (Firefox works natively; Chrome et al. only support ogg/vorbis natively). If it doesn't, try a desktop application like iTunes or VLC.</p>
<p>The stream is continuously online. But if you don't hear anything then that's because nobody is currently playing the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://audio.daubenschuetz.de/assets/">WASM-SYNTH</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, you're able to "dance" on the Social Dist0rtion Protocol's assembly dance floor. The rc3 orga was nice enough to allow us streaming audio on our map. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://rc3.world/rc3/room/93840a8f-88f7-4f11-bb61-68800c4d4962/">Click here</a> to visit us directly on the rc3.world map.</p>

December 27, 2020 | https://thesephist.com/posts/lucerne/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thesephist.com/posts/lucerne/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Over the last week, I’ve been working on <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/lucerne">Lucerne</a>, a Twitter “reader” app built to fit my personal needs from Twitter. It’s been an interesting exercise in <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/tools/">building a tool around workflows</a>, so I wanted to tell you the story of how the design came to be, and what I’ve noticed using Lucerne for my daily escapades into the Twittersphere.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne.png" alt="Lucerne in action"></p>
<p>Like many of my personal tools, Lucerne is built with my <a href="https://dotink.co/">Ink programming language</a> on the backend and my <a href="https://github.com/thesephist/torus">Torus</a> UI library on the frontend. It’s made just for me at the moment, but given the interest I’ve gotten about Lucerne online, I might make a version open for anyone to use.</p>
<h2 id="designing-myself-a-better-twitter">Designing myself a better Twitter</h2>
<p>For me, Twitter serves two purposes. First, it’s a <em>learning tool</em>. There are lots of smart folks talking to each other and sharing what they’re thinking about on Twitter from software to economics to writing, and I can find on Twitter opinions or perspectives I can’t find on blogs or books. Second, it’s a <em>place for me to share whatever I’m working on</em> on my blog or on my side projects with my audience. Lucerne is designed around these two primary workflows: learning and sharing.</p>
<p>Twitter’s main user interface, the algorithmic timeline, is bad for using Twitter as a learning tool. It feels like sticking a straw into a firehouse and hoping you’ll suck out enough interesting insights to be worth the effort. I wanted a better way for me to discover and keep track of interesting conversations happening on Twitter about any topic. Twitter does provide decent tools for me to share my work online – things like scheduled tweets, analytics, notifications, and search – but they’re not in one place, so I wanted to consolidate these tools.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne-timeline.jpg" alt="A timeline view in Lucerne"></p>
<p>With these two goals in mind, I also wanted Lucerne to be a tool that could <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/ivy/">grow with me as I used it</a>, so I could mold my experience of Twitter around what I found to be most useful to me over time. More than other tools, Twitter feels organic and constantly changing. I didn’t want to have to bake in all the tools and dials I might ever want to use from the get-go. Instead, I wanted to be able to stumble into interesting use cases as I used Lucerne over time.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne-querybar.jpg" alt="Performing a search in Lucerne"></p>
<p>To make it possible to grow Lucerne as a tool gradually around my use cases like this, Lucerne is designed primarily around one important idea: <strong>filtered searches saved as “channels”</strong>. Feeding from the firehose of conversations on Twitter, a “channel” is a small filtered stream of tweets defined by a particular search query. Here are some examples of useful filters.</p>
<ul>
<li>“tweets between A and B about #topic” – <code>(from:A OR from:B) #topic</code></li>
<li>“tweets about abc.com with more than 100 likes” – <code>url:abc.com min_faves:100</code></li>
<li>“tweets by A that include images, but exclude retweets” – <code>from:A filter:images -filter:retweets</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With Lucerne, I can search for interesting conversations happening on Twitter by experimenting with these filters. When any filter seems particular useful, I can save it to check again later, by adding it to the left sidebar with a name. As I use the app, I end up curating an ever-changing personalized collection of these channels in my sidebar that provide multiple different views onto the firehose of Twitter.</p>
<p>“But Linus,” I hear you saying, “you can search and save them as timelines on Twitter’s app and Tweetdeck.” Yes, you’re right, and most of the search filters Lucerne uses are also available on Twitter. But the important thing about Lucerne isn’t just that you can search, but that <strong>playing with filters and saving the good ones is the primary user interface</strong>. On Twitter, you might search once or twice to find something useful, but you’re <em>mostly</em> interacting with a single timeline passively. With Lucerne, most of my use is exploring and adding to a curated list of filters, and exploration and consumption are one and the same activity. As I’ll explain later from my personal experience, this makes a big difference in how much I can get out of Twitter.</p>
<p>I think the most important design lessons in Lucerne is what I <em>didn’t</em> do: I could have made a list of features that I might have wanted in the beginning, and baked it all into the app. Features like “follow specific threads”, “see top tweets from a particular user”, “follow hashtags”, or “hide retweets from the timeline.” But instead of adding a million settings and toggles, I found what I would consider to be the “atoms”, the common building blocks, of all of these use cases, and baked it into the core of the app instead. All these use cases above can be performed just as easily as filtered searches, and because these filters can be saved and referenced later, Lucerne can grow around my exact use cases <em>as I continue using it</em>. I don’t have to design for all my use cases from the start. This is what I mean when I say <a href="https://thesephist.com/posts/ivy/">we need to design tools to grow with us</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to this main idea of channels, Lucerne has a few other design considerations to improve how Twitter works for me. All the engagement stats I care about are present in a single screen, so I don’t have to annoyingly load five different pages every time, but they’re out of the way of the main “timeline” view, because I don’t want them in my face all the time. There’s a small pane on the right showing me my most recent new followers, which is sometimes useful when I see someone particularly interesting and want to reach back out to them. This also saves me a few clicks every time. Lastly, I intentionally didn’t implement <em>infinite scrolling</em>, in lieu of a simple “load more” button. This makes endlessly scrolling a conscious enough action for me that I end up wasting less time scrolling through my timeline. It goes without saying, all of these experiences are also much better because I don’t serve myself ads in between my tweets. My timeline feels cleaner.</p>
<h2 id="how-im-using-lucerne">How I’m using Lucerne</h2>
<p>I reached an “MVP” stage with Lucerne a few days ago, and since then, I’ve used Lucerne more and Twitter’s website less for browsing through Twitter. Lucerne isn’t meant to be a Twitter <em>replacement</em>. Twitter’s web app is still great for writing and following threads, for example, and I don’t want to have to re-create something that’s already fine for my use. But for my two main workflows of <em>learning</em> and <em>tracking my progress</em> on Twitter, Lucerne works better for me.</p>
<p>The biggest change I’ve noticed from using the client is that it turns Twitter from a consumption experience into an exploratory experience. Instead of drinking from a firehose through a straw, the firehose feeds into an evolving castle of infinite fountains, and my job is to look around the castle for the fountains of information that seem more interesting or insightful. For the first time in a long time, I feel like I’m pulling from the firehose of Twitter instead of constantly poking straws into the stream to see what I luck out with.</p>
<p>The real fun of using Lucerne to explore Twitter isn’t just reading tweets in a timeline, but poking around in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Library_of_Babel">infinite library</a> that Twitter sometimes feels like, collecting the interesting streams of information into my pocket.</p>
<p>Here are a few use cases I stumbled into while using Lucerne that I otherwise couldn’t have.</p>
<p><strong>Following interesting threads.</strong> I often stumble into interesting threads of tweets that I want to track somehow. While using Lucerne, I ran into one tweet about <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffreylitt">@geoffreylitt</a> building a Twitter browser extension called Twemex, and another thread by <a href="https://twitter.com/TZhongg">@TZhongg</a> asking for book recommendations. Normally, I would probably just bookmark it and never check it again, but with Lucerne, I just saved filters for “replies to this tweet” as channels in my sidebar, and I’ve checked them regularly since to find interesting project updates and book recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Following an account’s tweets on a topic.</strong> <a href="https://twitter.com/Noahpinion">@Noahpinion</a> is one of those accounts that have a lot of interesting ideas to share covering a huge range of topics. Sometimes about foreign policy, sometimes about fiscal policy and economics, sometimes about China. I wanted to be able to follow “just tweets about this account on Japan”, for example, and I could do this trivially by setting up a channel <code>from:Noahpinion Japan</code>.</p>
<p><img src="https://thesephist.com/img/lucerne-usercard.jpg" alt="Lucerne looking at tweets by @devonzuegel"></p>
<p><strong>Following an aesthetic.</strong> I noticed recently that a lot of <a href="https://twitter.com/devonzuegel">@devonzuegel</a>’s tweets about urban design either contain interesting quotes from books or inspiring historical photographs. I follow her, but thought it would be nice to have a separate channel to just keep track of these. So I made a filter for <code>from:devonzuegel filter:images</code>, for “tweets containing images from @devonzuegel” which I’ve been enjoying checking once every one or two days. Through this channel, I also discovered a couple of other accounts that share photographs of urban design that I otherwise would have missed.</p>
<p><strong>“Following” high-noise accounts without following.</strong> There are a few accounts, like @naval, @david_perell, or @paulg that occasionally tweet really interesting ideas, but whom I don’t follow because there’s a lot of noise. With Lucerne, I could create channels like <code>from:david_perell -filter:replies min_faves:100</code> to “follow” the most popular tweets from these accounts without actually following them into my home timeline. I’ve found this so useful that I added a “top” button to profile cards that lets me one-click search a filter for “popular tweets from this person”, which is much more helpful than what Twitter’s web app gets you on a profile page, which are just the latest tweets they happened to have sent.</p>
<p>Over time, I think my curated list of channels is going to become an interesting index into my own interests, perspective, and information consumption habits, which I find a really cool idea. I’m excited about how Lucerne can help me use Twitter to learn and share better going forward, and I"m also curious about how I could apply this idea of “tools that grow as you use it” to other parts of my life, like the web browser or my email experience.</p>
<p>And because I know you’re asking: while I don’t think I’m going to make this current version of Lucerne open for public …</p></article></div>

        <section>
            <div><p>In the previous post titled <a href="http://blog.alexellis.io/golang-json-api-client/">"Grab JSON from an API"</a> we explored how to interact with a HTTP client and parse JSON. This post is a continuation of that theme, which covers unit testing.</p>
<p>I consider the following book as essential reference and reading for Golang, you can purchase it on Amazon: <a href="https://amzn.to/3biQrWJ">Go Programming Language, Addison-Wesley</a>. I'll cover some other recommendations at the end of the post.</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<h2 id="1testingingo">1. Testing in Go</h2>
<p>Go has a built-in testing command called <code>go test</code> and a package <code>testing</code> which combine to give a minimal but complete testing experience.</p>
<p>The standard tool-chain also includes benchmarking and statement-based code coverage similar to NCover (.NET) or Istanbul (Node.js).</p>

<h3 id="12writingtests">1.2 Writing tests</h3>
<p>Unit testing in Go is just as opinionated as any other aspect of the language like formatting or naming. The syntax deliberately avoids the use of assertions and leaves the responsibility for checking values and behaviour to the developer.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a method we want to test in the <code>main</code> package. We have defined an exported function called <code>Sum</code> which takes in two integers and adds them together.</p>
<pre><code>package main

func Sum(x int, y int) int {
    return x + y
}

func main() {
    Sum(5, 5)
}
</code></pre>
<p>We then write our test in a separate file. The test file can be in a different package (and folder) or the same one (<code>main</code>). Here's a unit test to check addition:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "testing"

func TestSum(t *testing.T) {
    total := Sum(5, 5)
    if total != 10 {
       t.Errorf("Sum was incorrect, got: %d, want: %d.", total, 10)
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Characteristics of a Golang test function:</p>
<ul>
<li>The first and only parameter needs to be <code>t *testing.T</code></li>
<li>It begins with the word Test followed by a word or phrase starting with a capital letter.</li>
<li>(usually the method under test i.e. <code>TestValidateClient</code>)</li>
<li>Calls <code>t.Error</code> or <code>t.Fail</code> to indicate a failure (I called t.Errorf to provide more details)</li>
<li><code>t.Log</code> can be used to provide non-failing debug information</li>
<li>Must be saved in a file named <code>something_test.go</code> such as: <code>addition_test.go</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If you have code and tests in the same folder then you cannot execute your program with <code>go run *.go</code>. I tend to use <code>go build</code> to create a binary and then I run that.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You may be more used to using the <code>Assert</code> keyword to perform checking, but the authors of <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Programming-Language-Addison-Wesley-Professional-Computing/dp/0134190440">The Go Programming Language</a> make some good arguments for Go's style over Assertions.</p>
<p>When using assertions:</p>
<ul>
<li>tests can feel like they're written in a different language (RSpec/Mocha for instance)</li>
<li>errors can be cryptic "assert: 0 == 1"</li>
<li>pages of stack traces can be generated</li>
<li>tests stop executing after the first assert fails - masking patterns of failure</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>There are third-party libraries that replicate the feel of RSpec or Assert. See also <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify">stretchr/testify</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Test tables</strong></p>
<p>The concept of "test tables" is a set (slice array) of test input and output values. Here is an example for the <code>Sum</code> function:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "testing"

func TestSum(t *testing.T) {
	tables := []struct {
		x int
		y int
		n int
	}{
		{1, 1, 2},
		{1, 2, 3},
		{2, 2, 4},
		{5, 2, 7},
	}

	for _, table := range tables {
		total := Sum(table.x, table.y)
		if total != table.n {
			t.Errorf("Sum of (%d+%d) was incorrect, got: %d, want: %d.", table.x, table.y, total, table.n)
		}
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>If you want to trigger the errors to break the test then alter the <code>Sum</code> function to return <code>x * y</code>.</p>
<pre><code>$ go test -v
=== RUN   TestSum
--- FAIL: TestSum (0.00s)
	table_test.go:19: Sum of (1+1) was incorrect, got: 1, want: 2.
	table_test.go:19: Sum of (1+2) was incorrect, got: 2, want: 3.
	table_test.go:19: Sum of (5+2) was incorrect, got: 10, want: 7.
FAIL
exit status 1
FAIL	github.com/alexellis/t6	0.013s
</code></pre>
<p><strong>Launching tests:</strong></p>
<p>There are two ways to launch tests for a package. These methods work for unit tests and integration tests alike.</p>
<ol>
<li>Within the same directory as the test:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>go test
</code></pre>
<p><em>This picks up any files matching packagename_test.go</em></p>
<p>or</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>By fully-qualified package name</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>go test github.com/alexellis/golangbasics1
</code></pre>
<p>You have now run a unit test in Go, for a more verbose output type in <code>go test -v</code> and you will see the PASS/FAIL result of each test including any extra logging produced by <code>t.Log</code>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between unit and integration tests is that unit tests usually isolate dependencies that communicate with network, disk etc. Unit tests normally test only one thing such as a function.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="13moreongotest">1.3 More on <code>go test</code></h2>
<p><strong>Statement coverage</strong></p>
<p>The <code>go test</code> tool has built-in code-coverage for statements. To try it with out example above type in:</p>
<pre><code>$ go test -cover
PASS
coverage: 50.0% of statements
ok  	github.com/alexellis/golangbasics1	0.009s
</code></pre>
<p>High statement coverage is better than lower or no coverage, but metrics can be misleading. We want to make sure that we're not only executing statements, but that we're verifying behaviour and output values and raising errors for discrepancies. If you delete the "if" statement from our previous test it will retain 50% test coverage but lose its usefulness in verifying the behaviour of the "Sum" method.</p>
<p><strong>Generating an HTML coverage report</strong></p>
<p>If you use the following two commands you can visualise which parts of your program have been covered by the tests and which statements are lacking:</p>
<pre><code>go test -cover -coverprofile=c.out
go tool cover -html=c.out -o coverage.html 
</code></pre>
<p>Then open coverage.html in a web-browser.</p>
<p><strong>Go doesn't ship your tests</strong></p>
<p>In addition, it may feel un-natural to leave files named <code>addition_test.go</code> in the middle of your package. Rest assured that the Go compiler and linker will not ship your test files in any binaries it produces.</p>
<p>Here is an example of finding the production vs test code in the net/http package we used in the previous Golang basics tutorial.</p>
<pre><code>$ go list -f={{.GoFiles}} net/http
[client.go cookie.go doc.go filetransport.go fs.go h2_bundle.go header.go http.go jar.go method.go request.go response.go server.go sniff.go status.go transfer.go transport.go]

$ go list -f={{.TestGoFiles}} net/http
[cookie_test.go export_test.go filetransport_test.go header_test.go http_test.go proxy_test.go range_test.go readrequest_test.go requestwrite_test.go response_test.go responsewrite_test.go transfer_test.go transport_internal_test.go]
</code></pre>
<p>For more on the basics read the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/">Golang testing docs</a>.</p>
<h3 id="14isolatingdependencies">1.4 Isolating dependencies</h3>
<p>The key factor that defines a unit test is isolation from runtime-dependencies or collaborators.</p>
<p>This is achieved in Golang through interfaces, but if you're coming from a C# or Java background, they look a little different in Go. Interfaces are implied rather than enforced which means that concrete classes don't need to know about the interface ahead of time.</p>
<p>That means we can have very small interfaces such as <a href="https://golang.org/src/io/io.go?s=4977:5022#L116">io.ReadCloser</a> which has only two methods made up of the Reader and Closer interfaces:</p>
<pre><code>        Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
</code></pre>
<p><em>Reader interface</em></p>
<pre><code>        Close() error
</code></pre>
<p><em>Closer interface</em></p>
<p>If you are designing a package to be consumed by a third-party then it makes sense to design interfaces so that others can write unit tests to isolate your package when needed.</p>
<p>An interface can be substituted in a function call. So if we wanted to test this method, we'd just have to supply a fake / test-double class that implemented the Reader interface.</p>
<pre><code>package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
)

type FakeReader struct {
}

func (FakeReader) Read(p []byte) (n int, err error) {
	// return an integer and error or nil
}

func ReadAllTheBytes(reader io.Reader) []byte {
	// read from the reader..
}

func main() {
	fakeReader := FakeReader{}
	// You could create a method called SetFakeBytes which initialises canned data.
	fakeReader.SetFakeBytes([]byte("when called, return this data"))
	bytes := ReadAllTheBytes(fakeReader)
	fmt.Printf("%d bytes read.\n", len(bytes))
}
</code></pre>
<p>Before implementing your own abstractions (as above) it is a good idea to search the Golang docs to see if there is already something you can use. In the case above we could also use the standard library in the <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/bytes/">bytes</a> package:</p>
<pre><code>    func NewReader(b []byte) *Reader
</code></pre>
<p>The Golang <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/iotest/">testing/iotest</a> package provides some Reader implementations which are slow or which cause errors to be thrown half way through reading. These are ideal for resilience testing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Golang docs: <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/testing/iotest/">testing/iotest</a></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="15workedexample">1.5 Worked example</h3>
<p>I'm going to refactor the code example from the <a href="http://blog.alexellis.io/golang-json-api-client/">previous article</a> where we found out how many astronauts were in space.</p>
<p>We'll start with the test file:</p>
<pre><code>package main

import "testing"

type testWebRequest struct {
}

func (testWebRequest) FetchBytes(url string) []byte {
	return []byte(`{"number": 2}`)
}

func TestGetAstronauts(t *testing.T) {
	amount := GetAstronauts(testWebRequest{})
	if amount != 1 {
		t.Errorf("People in space, got: %d, want: %d.", amount, 1)
	}
}
</code></pre>
<p>I have an exported method called GetAstronauts which calls into a HTTP endpoint, reads the bytes from the result and then parses this into a struct and returns the integer in the "number" property.</p>
<p>My fake / test-double in the test only returns the bare minimum of JSON needed to satisfy the test, and to begin with I had it return a different number so that I knew the test worked. It's hard to be sure whether a test that passes first time has worked.</p>
<p>Here's the application code where we run our <code>main</code> function. The <code>GetAstronauts</code> function takes an interface as its first argument allowing us to isolate and abstract away any HTTP logic from this file and its import list.</p>
<pre><code>package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"log"
)

func GetAstronauts(getWebRequest GetWebRequest) int {
	url := "http://api.open-notify.org/astros.json"
	bodyBytes := getWebRequest.FetchBytes(url)
	peopleResult := people{}
	jsonErr := json.Unmarshal(bodyBytes, &amp;peopleResult)</code></pre></div></section></article></div></div>

Directories are tables and Instances of the Content Types are rows.</p>
<p>Content Types and Instances are different from Classes and Objects in Object Oriented Programming but similiar. They are on the user level not the program level. A table is a list of rows of columns. A directory is a list of files.</p>
<p>&nbsp;So what is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization" target="_self" title="Wikipedia Database Normalization">Database Normalization</a> in this database? The tendency of file users is to put a list inside their file.&nbsp; &nbsp;A common example of this is programming languages.&nbsp; A file in most programming languages has a list of modules or methods or whatever it has.</p>
<p>You can't really do this in Plone.&nbsp; Data normalization is somewhat forced on the user because of lack of 'features' such as a list in content types.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>A data normalized, object oriented programming language would include 3 types Codes, Datas, and Inheritances.&nbsp; This data normalized language becomes almost simple to parse.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/introspectdb/" target="_self" title="IntrospectDB">Introspect DB</a>&nbsp;uses the UNIX file system with Python for the filesystem of the File Oriented Object Database.&nbsp; &nbsp;It is designed to replace Plone as a database but instead of the roughly 1 million lines in a Plone installation, IntrospectDB is only about 1000 lines of Python.&nbsp; Plone spends a lot of energy making its own file system, why not use what is already there?&nbsp;</p>

<p>They stole our future. Let's take it back.</p>

<p>Here at the end of the world, it's time to take stock. Is technology a force for good? Can it be? Was it ever? How did we end up with a world made up of "five websites, each filled with screenshots of text from the other four" (h/t Tom Eastman)? Should we worry that machine learning will take away our free will through A/B splitting and Big Five Personality Types? Where the fuck did all these Nazis come from? </p>

<p>Once upon a time, there were many chat services. AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, ICQ and others. These messengers had their own desktop clients, and developers reverse engineered their protocol to build custom applications, both open and closed source. Trillian, Audium and Pidgin were applications that let people communicate across all these messengers with one program. Over time the old protocols died, and newer chat services like Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts started storing your entire history on their servers. People started using the web interfaces and mobile apps, no longer caring about desktop programs.</p>

<p>Matrix is an open source communication protocol. It’s similar to XMPP (formerly Jabber) in the sense that anyone can set up a Matrix server and communicate to people on other Matrix servers. It’s a federated protocol, just like e-mail. Google Hangouts used to support XMPP federation, but silently removed support in 2014. Matrix supports bridging other chat services, so they can appear in a unified view. With my current setup of Matrix and appropriate bridges, I’ve combined my view of Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Telegram and native Matrix chats into one convenient user interface. The path to get to that integration was not as simple.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The dedicated server I use for <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/a-history-of-personal-and-professional-websites/">this website</a> and other self-hosted web applications, is located in Germany. Logging in to Facebook or Google’s chat system from a country I’m not currently in, can raise all sorts of security flags and lock me out of my account. For those bridges, I purchased a small virtual machine in a Chicago data center. I installed a proxy on that server, accessible only via VPN, to view both Google and Facebook, so they record the IP address I’m connecting from with my web browser. This helps minimize security lockouts. Telegram isn’t hostile to third party developers, and has an official API. It doesn’t care my bridge is connecting to it from Germany, so I host it on the dedicated server.</p>

<p>The reference Matrix server is called Synapse. It, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts">mautrix-hangouts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> bridges all have official Docker containers built by their developers. Each bridge must be able to communicate with the Synapse homeserver. Their instructions go through generating configuration and key pairs that are copied over to Synapse in order to form their authentication bridge. The bridges provide chat robots that guide you through getting OAuth tokens or cookies for those respective services.</p>

<p>The wiki for each bridge also has instructions for enabling double-puppeting, making each chat look seamless between myself and the accounts on the other side of each respective bridge. Without double-puppeting, each conversation will be in a three person group with the Matrix user, the bridge user (e.g my Google Hangouts user) and the person I’m talking to.</p>

<p>Enabling double-puppeting via the <code>curl</code> command in the bridge documentation and calling <code>login-matrix</code> on the bot, removes the creation of three person rooms. The bridged accounts will now show up as regular, two-person conversations.</p>

<p>I use the Element desktop app to connect to my matrix server, but I also have a web version of Element running from its own official Docker container in case I need to access chat from another computer. There are other clients, such as <a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage">Mirage</a> which is built using Qt and <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">Fluffychat</a> for mobile. Although I use Synapse for my homeserver, there are other servers that support the Matrix protocol that are in use and under active development.</p>

<p>Setting up all the Matrix components wasn’t too difficult, but it does require knowledge or experience with running services. It took a considerable amount of work and debugging to get each bridge operational, compounded slightly by my complex networking setup. Most people would probably just run all of this on a Raspberry Pi at home. I feel that using Matrix with bridges is still somewhat inaccessible to people who aren’t interested in development or server administration. Still, the satisfaction of having unified chat, plus one more layer of abstraction between myself and Google or Facebook, feels like it was wroth the overall effort.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p><img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" data-src=""></p><h2 id="overview">Overview</h2><p><a href="https://twitter.com/NSACyber/status/1339652646513291264">Yesterday</a> the NSA Twitter account announced that a new branch of Ghidra has been release with the long-awaited debugging capability. This will allow for single-step debugging of a program within <a href="https://hackaday.io/course/172292-introduction-to-reverse-engineering-with-ghidra">Ghidra</a> through a GDB stub or other various debug mechanisms. To celebrate this (and my being stuck at home quarantining…) I wanted to review how to build this version of Ghidra and give an example of how to use this debugger on a fun target.</p><p>This post will explain the following:</p><ul><li>How to build the latest (or any) version of Ghidra using a <a href="https://github.com/dukebarman/ghidra-builder">Docker Container</a></li><li>How to build the Ghidra Eclipse plugins</li><li>How to build a program <a href="https://github.com/SiD3W4y/GhidraGBA">loader</a> for Ghidra</li><li>Debugging a program with Ghidra using the GDB stub</li><li>Use the debugging capability to help us learn about how passwords are processed for a GBA game</li></ul><p>For this post, we’re going to be taking a look at the Game Boy Advance game Spiderman: Mysterio’s Menace. I’ve been very much inspired by all of the awesome work that <a href="https://youtu.be/VVbRe7wr3G4">stacksmashing and Liveoverflow have been doing regarding these topics</a>. This was a game that I spent a lot of time playing and it’s always fun revisiting childhood favorites from an RE perspective. The ultimate goal is to demonstrate how to properly load this ROM using a custom loader, and connect to an emulator’s GDB stub using Ghidra’s debugging features.</p><p><strong>RE Note/Tangent:</strong> When taking on a new reversing project, it’s important to try to compartmentalize goals and targets. For example, if we said we just want to <em>reverse</em> this game, that opens up endless possibilities. We could reverse engineer the collision detection, how enemy AI works, or how level maps are generated. For this post, we will pick a specific target and take a look at the password mechanism in use by this game.</p><p>I am doing all of this work on an Ubuntu 20.04 machine, with the latest updates.</p><h2 id="building-ghidra">Building Ghidra</h2><p>First things first, this debugger branch has not yet been included in an official release so we’re going to have to build it ourselves. Luckily for us <a href="https://github.com/dukebarman/ghidra-builder">dukebarman</a> has put together a docker container for us to do this, all we need to do is modify the <code>build_ghidra.sh</code> script to checkout the debugger branch, see the following line below:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
</pre></td><td><pre>git clone https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra -b debugger
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>We are also going to build the Eclipse development extensions for this version of Ghidra, this will help us later on when we build a loader and write our analysis scripts. To do this we add the following line to the <code>build_ghidra.sh</code> script:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>gradle prepDev
gradle eclipse -PeclipsePDE
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Next follow the instructions in the <code>README</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
3
4
</pre></td><td><pre>cd ghidra-builder
sudo docker-tpl/build
cd workdir
sudo ../docker-tpl/run ./build_ghidra.sh
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>This will take some time, so maybe go grab a coffee or two and come back to your freshly built Ghidra. The resulting build can be found in <code>workdir/out</code>:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>wrongbaud@wubuntu:~/blog/gba-re-gbd/ghidra-builder/workdir$ ls out/
ghidra_9.3_DEV_20201218_linux64.zip
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>Unzip this file, and you can launch Ghidra via the <code>./ghidraRun</code> script. For this post, I will unzip this into the <code>ghidra-builder/workdir</code> directory because we’re going to be using the docker container to build a Ghidra loader for this version of Ghidra. If you’re following along, your workdir directory should look like this:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1
2
</pre></td><td><pre>wrongbaud@wubuntu:~/blog/gba-re-gbd/ghidra-builder/workdir$ ls
build_ghidra.sh  ghidra  ghidra_9.3_DEV out  set_exec_flag.sh
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><h2 id="building-eclipse-plugins">Building Eclipse Plugins</h2><p>Now that we have a new version of Ghidra built, we also need to build the GhidraDev plugin for Eclipse. The eclipse projects can be found in the <code>ghidra-builder/workdir/ghidra/GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev</code> directory.</p><ol><li>Install <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/installer">Eclipse</a><ul><li>Select the Java IDE</li></ul></li><li>Install CDT, PyDev, and Plugin Development Environment<ul><li>This can be done from the Eclipse marketplace</li></ul></li><li>Import the GhidraDevFeature and GhidraDevPlugin projects<ul><li>These can be found in the <code>ghidra-builder/workdir/ghidra/GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev/</code> directory</li><li><code>File</code> -&gt; <code>Import</code> -&gt; <code>General</code> -&gt; <code>Existing Projects into Workspace</code></li><li>Add <code>ghidra-builder/workdir/ghidra/GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev</code></li><li>Select “Search for nested projects”</li><li>Import the projects!</li><li><strong>Note:</strong> you may see some build errors when these are imported, you can ignore these as you are just exporting the plugin!</li></ul></li><li>With these projects loaded, we can now <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/debugger/GhidraBuild/EclipsePlugins/GhidraDev/GhidraDevPlugin/build_README.txt">export the plugin</a><ul><li><code>File</code> -&gt; <code>Export</code></li><li><code>Plug-in Development</code> -&gt; <code>Deployable Features</code></li><li><code>ghidradev.ghidradev</code></li><li>Select an archive location for the plugin to be exported to</li><li>Click Finish!</li></ul></li></ol><p>Now we have our Ghidra plugin, built for our custom version of Ghidra that we can load via <code>Help</code>-&gt;<code>Install New Software</code>.</p><p>And with that, we have built Ghidra from the <code>debugger</code> branch, and have also built the Eclipse development extensions so we can build plugins for our new version of Ghidra!</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> I just want to take a second to outline just how incredible the <a href="https://github.com/NationalSecurityAgency/ghidra/blob/15c1f43fa51f210836cb451aff587b227dffe0a7/DevGuide.md">help docs</a> are for Ghidra. From the P-Code manuals to the instructions on building and exporting these plugins - the project is very well documented.</p><h2 id="building-the-rom-loader">Building the ROM Loader</h2><p>To properly analyze this ROM in Ghidra, we are going to need to define all of the <a href="https://problemkaputt.de/gbatek.htm#gbamemorymap">memory regions and peripherals</a> for the Game Boy Advance. Luckily for us, <a href="https://github.com/SiD3W4y/GhidraGBA">SiD3W4y</a> on GitHub has already written one.</p><p>If you are a regular reader of this blog, a <a href="https://wrongbaud.github.io/posts/writing-a-ghidra-loader/">ghidra loader</a> may be a familiar subject to you. If not, the purpose of a Ghidra loader is to set up all of the necessary memory regions, identify any debug information or symbols that may be present in the file, and provide as much information as possible about the target file. The loader that was mentioned before outlines all of the basic peripherals of the GBA and is an excellent example loader to work with, let’s start by cloning it into the <code>ghidra-builder/workdir</code> directory. We’re doing this because we’re going to use the same docker container we built Ghidra with to build this loader.</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

git clone https://github.com/SiD3W4y/GhidraGBA

dockerbot@797eb43ce05f:/files/GhidraGBA$ exit
exit
</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></p></div><p>In case the above steps are confusing, what we are doing is:</p><ol><li>Launching the docker container</li><li>Building the GhidraGBA extension, providing the path to our installation</li><li>Copying it to Ghidra’s extensions directory (so it will show up under the Install Extensions menu)</li><li>Exiting the docker container</li></ol><p>Launch Ghidra via <code>ghidraRun</code> and go to <code>File</code>-&gt; <code>Install Extensions</code>. Select the GhidraGBA loader and click <code>OK</code>. You will need to restart Ghidra for the change to take effect. Now when you load a GBA ROM you should see the following:</p><p><img data-src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/gba.png" alt="GBA" src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/gba.png"></p><p>After running the auto analysis, Ghidra seems to make a pretty quick sense of the ROM. There are a lot of functions defined and things are looking good. So the next step is to figure out some way to narrow down what we care about in this ROM image, in other words, we need to find our needle in the haystack. Let’s start by examining how the password system works in this game by entering a few passwords.</p><h2 id="analyzing-the-rom">Analyzing the Rom</h2><p>As mentioned before, our goal here is to try to understand the password system in use by this game. If we attempt to enter a password, the following screen is displayed:</p><p><img data-src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/rom-1.png" alt="ROM1" src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/rom-1.png"></p><p>Note that we have all of the consonants and no vowels and numbers “0-9”, and our passwords are only 5 characters long. This is a nice starting point for us as reverse engineers. We can use this information to help us narrow down functions of interest. For example- let’s look through the strings in the ROM and see if these values are represented in a string somewhere. If we open the strings window, <code>Window</code> -&gt; <code>Defined Strings</code>, and filter for the first 5 characters available to us as password characters we see the following:</p><p><img data-src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/strings-password-characters.png" alt="" src="https://wrongbaud.github.io/assets/img/ghidra-dbg/strings-password-characters.png"></p><p>So far so good - we only have two instances of this string in use. One is located at <code>0x804c11fc</code> and one at <code>0x84b86f0</code>. Upon examination of the first one, we see that this string gets passed to a function in the subroutine located at <code>0x8003358</code>, see below:</p><div><p><code><table><tbody><tr><td><pre>1

So the body is no longer sacrum [sacred]; it's profanum [profane]. Because people modify everything, they are losing their connection to the body, to the meat. And that's why we need to use the nudity in many situations."</blockquote><p>The Cyberpunk genre is about the philosophy of personhood and human existence as juxtaposed to and twisted against technology, set upon a backdrop of corporate dystopia.</p><p>Not only are Badowski's statements ignorant of the genre, but the way Cyberpunk 2077 handles these topics is, too.</p><p>You cannot augment your character within an inch of their life. You cannot even cut their hair after the initial character generation screen. </p><p>You cannot become a 9 foot chrome-lacquered war-machine with a car engine for a crotch. You can't swap your consciousness into something else.</p><p>Because we know other characters <em><strong>can,</strong></em> Cyberpunk 2077 offers the illusion of choice by showing it exists, but barely gives it to the player.</p><p>Speaking of barely; though you can swap voice/junk gender, this doesn't break down gender barriers meaningfully.</p><p>You cannot blur the lines of sexuality, because your romance options are very limited. Have a male voice but a female body? Many routes are off the table. However, the problem isn't so much that characters [to reflect IRL people] have certain 'equipment' preferences. That's valid.</p><p>The problem is that players <em><strong>should</strong></em> be able to have a car engine for a crotch and see how that shakes things up, for example. If it does at all. </p><p>This is the one genre that <em>most</em> benefits from a predominantly bisexual romance roster, or at the very least, it benefits from having the balls to tackle the transhumanism topic.</p><p>When corporations plaster ads inside of your eyeballs, the only thing left is the ability to transform yourself beyond limits. One of those limits is the self. </p><p>The other is grappling with what the self means when you replace it with cyberware, and what flavor of human <em>other </em>people see you as.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 does make a stance on this, and it's not as expected; too much self-reconfiguration makes you a Cyberpsycho. NPCs lose their mind if they replace too many parts.</p><p>This shows us that the "flesh as sacrum" aspect is unavoidable. </p><p>Because of all this, Cyberpunk 2077 smacks into the "barriers are moot" genre-point like V's car barrels down roads with the finesse of a bull in a china shop.</p><p>It's nothing but barriers, with the veneer of choice.</p><h2 id="cyberpunk-2077-mishandles-the-sentiency-agency-question">Cyberpunk 2077 mishandles "the sentiency/agency question"</h2><h3 id="despite-the-attention-paid-to-johnny-invading-your-shell">Despite the attention paid to Johnny invading your shell</h3><figure><img src="http://blog.constelisvoss.ml/content/images/2020/12/cyberpunk2077-1.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>Does Cyberpunk 2077 address "the sentiency/agency question"? Keanu's Johnny Silverhands invades your shell, which suggests it does, but there's a problem.</p><p>In order to analyze this, we have to talk about the results. There are 5 endings, and all of them are a flavor of "you die because your body is beyond saving", "Johnny takes over" or "go to cyberjail while Arasaka figures out how to ya yeet you." </p><p>Only two routes shake things up, and one is "commit suicide" while the other is "fuck off somewhere to solve the problem, off-screen."</p><p>The issue? There are in-game lore "outs" to suggest personhood doesn't stop at meat suits. Lizzy Wizzy's download into a synth body comes to mind; is she not a person? The game thinks so, yet Johnny robs you of agency histrionically. </p><p>What of Alt, Johnny's past love-interest and now-sentient-AI? A missed opportunity to smash barriers, and also tackle the sentiency question. Alt has lost her "soul".</p><p>There are repercussions to digitization, even if Judy's route later explains she figured out how to dabble in recorded/shared emotions, via BD devices. Even if Arasaka <em>already</em> upgraded the engram system.</p><p>It's almost as though the cast's skills/game lore never applies breakthrough tech to your problem, until it's too late.</p><p>Can players invade the darkweb and chill with the rogue AIs? Yes, but we <em>can't</em> do it to save our own Ghost, because "the flesh is sacrum".</p><p>What of Delamain's rogue AI "children"? Surprisingly, you get to tackle the sentiency angle if you complete the Epistrophy side quests. You can honor the rogue AIs' wishes and merge them with Delamain's main personality.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 pretends all this technology is in its infancy to stop the player from questioning narrative choices. What it actually does is show what's possible, but <strong>not for you</strong>.</p><p>Why can't players live in the internet? Why can't they hop into a car? Why can't they download into a synth? Why can't they merge personalities with Johnny in a truly blended version, like Motoko in the GiTS 90s film?</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077 punishes players for the very concepts the Cyberpunk genre grapples with, and the game lore suggests it <em>can</em> tackle.</p><p>Who gets to be a person even if they're inside a fucking toaster? Cars, Lizzy Wizzy, and Johnny. Not the player.</p><h2 id="and-what-of-the-punk-aspect-of-cyberpunk">And what of the Punk aspect of Cyberpunk?</h2><h3 id="well-it-s-lip-service-is-the-thing">Well, it's lip-service, is the thing</h3><figure><img src="http://blog.constelisvoss.ml/content/images/2020/12/cyberpunk2077_hand_cmyk_wide-959129cd7f84b90547ac1c88d90ec6bae3b98186.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>As stated: in the genre you have body augmentation, boundary scuttling, and transhumanism as rebellion options.

He judges your character harshly if they care about plenty of <em>other</em> rebellions. </p><p>For instance, sentient AI cars get more sympathy from Johnny than the dolls of The Clouds (who are human sex workers). That's not very Punk, Johnny.</p><p>Somehow, Takemura's plot is more on-point here, as an examination of Arasaka as child-soldier creators, and yet I don't see him staging some mass "free the kids" rebellion.</p><p>To make matters worse, you can't defy the cops; killing criminals helps the police, as a feature not a bug. In order to get the gear/money you need to progress, this is basically unavoidable.

However, his quest doesn't let you stage a rebellion against the corrupt police force.

<p><span>M</span>uharram Muhammad’ali hasn’t spoken with his family since his sister’s mobile went dead last year, but sometimes he calls his parents’ landline in Turpan, a city in the east of the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region of China. Since the coronavirus pandemic spread to Xinjiang this summer, houses in the area have been sealed up, further isolating residents who were already all but cut off from the outside world. The line is always busy, but, he reasons, the fact that it is still in service means his mother is alive and paying the bill.</p>



<p>He doesn’t have any more information than that. He knows that his father, an imam, was arrested over three years ago and charged with “picking quarrels and provoking trouble” — a catchall offense that the Chinese government applies to those it considers undesirable — and later convicted in a closed trial. He assumes his father is in jail, if he hasn’t died. That news came from his uncle, but one of the last things Muhammad’ali heard from his sister was that he, too, had been taken into police custody just over a year ago. “He is lost, and now there is no one to give me information,” he says.</p>



<p>Muhammad’ali, a soft-spoken 27-year-old who reaches for Japanese words in the rare moments when his English lets him down, left China for Tokyo two years ago. To return would mean instant incarceration, so Muhammad’ali is building a life in a new city, learning to cook Uighur food with ingredients he sources from gray-market halal butchers and marveling at the obscene prices of watermelons in Japan — fruit for which Turpan is famous.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last time he was in Turpan, he saw CCTV cameras being installed on the intersection outside his family home, another node in the network of facial recognition devices that sweep the city, perpetually recording the movements of the inhabitants. Thousands of Communist Party <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2018/05/13/china-visiting-officials-occupy-homes-muslim-region">cadres and security officials keep constant watch</a>, recording even the most mundane details of inhabitants’ lives — who they talk to, whether they use the front or the back door to leave the house, whether they have recently taken up exercise or given up smoking. Over the past three years, Uighurs have had their DNA collected, their voices recorded, and their walking gaits filmed and put on file. It all feeds into perhaps the most comprehensive dataset covering any population on earth, collected and manipulated by private technology companies working on behalf of the Chinese government.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Together, the state and these companies have built a one-way mirror around Xinjiang, giving the government an unprecedented ability to monitor and control the population, while preventing information from leaking out. Artificial intelligence scours social media and messaging apps in search of sensitive conversations. Simply speaking with a relative overseas is likely to draw the eye of the police and could lead to incarceration in one of the euphemistically named “vocational education and training centers” — internment facilities that, according to estimates by the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-rights-un/u-n-says-it-has-credible-reports-that-china-holds-million-uighurs-in-secret-camps-idUSKBN1KV1SU">U.N. Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination</a>, held upwards of a million people by 2018.</p>

<p>Cut off from their loved ones, Uighurs in exile are testing the limitations of the firewall. In Japan, Muhammad’ali stays in touch with old school friends via WeChat and Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok. They communicate in Mandarin — to use Uighur would attract attention — and in code. They are all basketball fans, so they use ciphers based on teams and players to relay information about who is still free and who has been sent to a camp <a href="https://www.aspi.org.au/report/uyghurs-sale">or transferred to a factory</a>. This doesn’t guarantee safety, but they gamble that they can stay ahead of the censors. “We can guess some keywords are monitored by machines, not by people,” Muhammad’ali says. “So we try not to say these keywords and just find other signals.”</p>



<p>Muhammad’ali and his fellow exiles meet in WeChat and WhatsApp groups, where they share and pore over leaked videos, social posts, reports from state media, and propaganda broadcasts, scanning the backgrounds for inconsistencies and absences — anything they can use to determine what is really happening back home. For the most part, they are not activists — or at least they didn’t start out as such. But frustrated with stonewalling and state propaganda, they are doing whatever they can to find out what happened to their loved ones and to relay that information to journalists and human rights organizations.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What they see is often horrifying. Although it is frequently portrayed as an all-knowing, all-seeing panopticon, the techno-state in Xinjiang is either deeply flawed or deliberately genocidal. Rather than functioning as a highly sophisticated system of predictive policing, the technology that has been deployed in Xinjiang is, in practice, a blunt instrument. It has internalized the government’s long-standing suspicion of its ethnic and religious minorities, interpreting normal behaviors as suspicious. It has automated and accelerated repression and funneled people into internment camps and crowded prisons — mass incarceration by database.</p>



<p>“The ubiquitous security, the high-tech police state is the reality, not just for the people in camps,” says Rushan Abbas, executive director of the Washington D.C.–based advocacy group Campaign for Uighurs. “Spy apps monitoring who they talk to on WeChat. QR codes in their homes scanning who’s going in and going out. Facial recognition everywhere. They are being monitored 24/7 from checkpoints to security cameras to listening devices. [The government] is using this advanced technology to collect people for the concentration camps. But even people living regular lives, like you and me, are subject to it every day. The whole Uighur identity is being criminalized.”</p>

<p><strong>For Uighurs living</strong> abroad, the first sign of an impending blackout back home emerged in late 2016. That was when the Chinese government stepped up a broad-spectrum crackdown on the Uighur population, justifying it as an anti-terror operation focused on what the government labeled Islamic extremists and separatists.</p>



<p>When the new campaign began, Mirehmet Ablet, a native of Kashgar, a city close to Xinjiang’s borders with Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan, was living in the Netherlands; his younger brother was studying in Canada. Only their older brother, Miradil, had stayed behind in Kashgar, where he visited their parents almost every day. Even as the crackdowns escalated, and more people were sent to reeducation camps, the family felt relatively safe.</p>



<p>Both of Ablet’s parents were Communist Party members. His mother was a director of a hospital and his father a director of a school. Neither were religious or politically active. They did not keep religious books in the house, one of what Chinese authorities consider the “75 signs of religious extremism” — along with giving up smoking and owning boxing gloves. Both sons living abroad were careful to keep a low profile.</p>



<p>“We could never have expected what would happen to our family,” he says.&nbsp;</p>



<p>China’s Uighurs are used to waves of repression. The region, on the country’s western fringes, has long been seen as inconvenient but strategically important. Once a pivot on the ancient Silk Road trading route connecting China to the Middle East, it was occupied by the People’s Republic of China in 1949. It has emerged as an important node in Beijing’s Belt and Road infrastructure initiative, which has sent railway lines and highways snaking west from China’s industrial south and east into Central Asia and beyond.</p>



<p>Today, many Uighurs still call the area “East Turkestan,” a reference to its Turkic culture and language, which, along with the importance of the Islamic faith, set it apart from the country’s Han Chinese core. For the Communist Party, that otherness represents a potential threat to the stability and sovereignty of the country. As in Tibet, the government encouraged Han Chinese from the east to migrate to Xinjiang and change the dominant culture. That migration continues today, and <a href="https://theasiadialogue.com/2016/03/07/spatial-results-of-the-2010-census-in-xinjiang/">the population of around 19 million people</a> is now about 46% Uighur.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Each Chinese political generation has also brought its own form of repression to Xinjiang. In the past, downward spirals of repression and resistance had tended to burn out in a few years. This time felt different.</p>



<p>In 2009, mass riots had <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/06/world/asia/06china.html">broken out in the regional capital of Ürümqi</a> — the result of a particularly brutal crackdown aimed at suppressing dissent stemmed from the 2008 Olympics. Although officially 197 Uighur and Han Chinese were killed, human rights groups believe the real death toll was far higher. The man sent to manage the fallout was Xi Jinping, the then-vice president who had already been tapped for leadership.</p>



<p>In 2016, two years after Xi’s government launched the so-called Strike Hard campaign, the first scattered reports of detention camps began to leak out of Xinjiang. On the ground, police started to seek signs of “foreign influence” — visiting the families of Uighurs living abroad, pressuring them for information, and encouraging them to summon their relatives back to China.</p>



<figure><blockquote><p>Uighurs have had their DNA collected, their voices recorded, and their walking gaits filmed and put on file. It all feeds into perhaps the most comprehensive dataset covering any population on earth.</p></blockquote></figure>



<p>By 2017, Ablet had acquired Dutch citizenship and was out of reach of the state, but his younger brother in Canada started getting messages asking him to come home. His friends warned him not to — returnees were disappearing — so instead, he sent letters from his university and workplace in Canada to show that he was behaving himself. He even mailed pictures of himself with other Chinese students to prove he was socializing with the right people.</p>

            <h2 id="post_title">Building my own HomeKit Thermostat</h2>
        

        <p>Iâ€™m pretty obsessed with controlling most of the electronics in my house from my
phone. One of the last remaining devices was the thermostat. I donâ€™t want a Nest
because it doesnâ€™t work with HomeKit, and I canâ€™t use an EcoBee because I donâ€™t
have a neutral wire. So I resolved to build my own.</p>

<p>If you are building your own thermostat, or any hardware really, and want some
help or just want to show it off, feel free to shoot me an email at mdl0394@gmail.com. 
Also I plan to continue to expand this project to have a screen and some buttons,

<h2 id="figuring-out-hot-to-turn-on-the-heat">Figuring out hot to turn on the heat</h2>

<p>So I turns out my heater runs on a really simple control protocol. There are just
two wires run from the heater to the current thermostat, when you connect them it
turns on, and when you disconnect it turns off. The only unfortunate part of it is
that the wires are 24vac, so to be safe I need to use a solid state relay for
switching.</p>

<h2 id="the-prototype">The prototype</h2>

<p>I am building this whole thing on an esp32, with a big overkill relay I got on
amazon prime. I will link the exact parts below. The current thermometer is an
old tmp102 sparkfun board I had lying around, but itâ€™s off by around 6 degrees,
so in v2 I will be replacing it with hopefully a more accurate one.</p>

<p>After wiring it all together, and taping it to my wall for a day or two, I was
satisfied with the components, and wanted to get started on prettying it up a bit.</p>



<h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>

<p>The thermostat control runs on a pretty simple state machine. I am a big fan of
drawing things out ahead of time, so I drew this diagram for myself before coding.
In C this is implemented as two enums (actions, states) and a bunch of switch case
statements.</p>

<p>It was very important to me that the thermostat worked on homekit, thankfully
there are already great homekit (hap) resources for the esp32. After some digging
I decided on this homekit package, as itâ€™s a clean port of the expressif homekit
library to arduino. There are about 15 different homekit frameworks for arduino,
so at some point I just had to choose one and start running.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/09e7eb514a6c9878988e3897b1f9377a39d331c7/9fc55/images/homekit_thermostat/homekit.jpeg" alt="Homekit screenshot showing thermostat"></p>

<p>After a whole bunch of fucking around I managed to get my esp32 to show up as a thermostat from my phone.</p>

<p>A few gotchaâ€™s that I encountered along the way: (some specific to this library, some specific to homekit)</p>

<ul>
  <li>With this HomeKit library if you want to factory reset, you have to do it <em>after</em> you initialize. Also be sure to remove the device from homekit on your phone before factory resetting the device</li>
  <li>Be sure that you have unique id and pairing codes for your device, I have another esp32 on my homekit and they kept colliding</li>
  <li>Be sure that your device cid matches with the services you are providing, otherwise you will get annoying silent failures from homekit</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="making-things-pretty">Making things pretty</h2>

<p>After getting the code into a place I liked, all that was left was to make it
look less like a bomb strapped to my living room wall. I 3d printed an enclosure,
and soldered the correct wires in the correct places. Unfortunately my board
requires constant a 5V micro-usb power source, so as of right now I have it
powered off of a huge battery pack. Maybe in vN (for very large values of N)
I will go nest style with an internal LiPo and an AC-DC converter.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> 
  <p>Consider the below code which creates a <code>SortedSet</code> using a comparator based on string length</p> 
  <div> 
   <div> 
    <pre><code data-lang="java">public class SortedSetTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SortedSet&lt;String&gt; sortedSet = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;(Comparator.comparing(String::length));
        sortedSet.addAll(Set.of("aa", "bb"));
        System.out.println(sortedSet);
    }
}</code></pre> 
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <p>The output of the above is</p> 
   
  <p>While I would expect</p> 
   
  <p>or</p> 
   
  <p>The <code>bb</code> element disappears, breaking the <code>Set</code> contract. The comparator is supposed to only sort the elements and not distinguish them from one another, which is what equals does in all the collections.</p> 
  <p>On the other hand, if I enhance the comparator to always return non-zero for unequal items like below, only then do I get the correct results.</p> 
  <div> 
   <div> 
    <pre><code data-lang="java">public class SortedSetTest {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SortedSet&lt;String&gt; sortedSet = new TreeSet&lt;&gt;(Comparator.comparing(String::length)
            .thenComparing(String::toString));
        sortedSet.addAll(Set.of("aa", "bb"));
        System.out.println(sortedSet);
    }
}</code></pre> 
   </div> 
  </div> 
  <p>The output now is <code>[aa, bb]</code> as I would expect.</p> 
  <p>The question is, why does <code>SortedSet</code> ignore the <code>equals</code> method in first place and removes an unequal object from the set?</p> 
  <p>The <code>comparator</code> method inside the <code>SortedSet</code> interface is <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html">documented</a> as follows:</p> 
  <div> 
   <blockquote>
     Returns the comparator used to order the elements in this set, or null if this set uses the natural ordering of its elements. 
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <p>The above indicates that the comparator is only used to order the elements in the set and not to distinguish them from one another, which is what <code>equals</code> is for in all the collections.</p> 
  <p>Digging into the <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/SortedSet.html">javadoc</a> further, it turns out that the above javadoc comment is incorrect, because there is another side note that contradicts it:</p> 
  <div> 
   <blockquote>
     Note that the ordering maintained by a sorted set (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if the sorted set is to correctly implement the Set interface. (See the Comparable interface or Comparator interface for a precise definition of consistent with equals.) This is so because the Set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but 
    <strong>a sorted set performs all element comparisons using its compareTo (or compare) method, so two elements that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the sorted set, equal</strong>. The behavior of a sorted set is well-defined even if its ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just 
    <strong>fails to obey the general contract of the Set</strong> interface. 
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
  <p>Note that, <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/10/docs/api/java/util/Comparator.html">by definition</a>, consistent with equals means:</p> 
  <div> 
   <blockquote>
     The ordering imposed by a comparator c on a set of elements S is said to be consistent with equals if and only if c.compare(e1, e2)==0 has the same boolean value as e1.equals(e2) for every e1 and e2 in S. 
   </blockquote> 
  </div> 
 </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>We try to run a lean operation at <a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a>, but we are suckers for great tools that improve our daily workflows, so we pay for quite a few of them each month.</p>
<p>Being small (just 3 people), the cost of switching services is almost negligible, so we try new stuff regularly and do switch when we see a clear improvement.</p>
<p>Here is a list of everything we <em>happily</em> pay for.</p>
<h3><a href="https://missiveapp.com/">Missive</a></h3>
<p><strong>$15/month ⨉ 3 = $45/month.</strong></p>
<p>Collaborative email on top of G Suite. The main thing we pay for is a comment box below each email thread. It allows us to quickly discuss emails without forwarding or copy/pasting in Slack. It also allows us to edit drafts collaboratively and have multiple team inboxes for invoices, support, and other stuff.</p>
<p>We pay for the Productive plan because of one feature: Rules. They allow us to automatically categorize emails and be more granular with notifications. </p>
<h3><a href="https://www.notion.so/product">Notion</a></h3>
<p><strong>$8/month ⨉ 3 = $24/month.</strong></p>
<p>It's our team wiki. We write memos, meeting notes, drafts for blog posts, and everything that needs to be shared async for feedback. We also used to put tasks here but recently moved to Linear (more on this below).</p>
<p>It's an amazing value, but we were close to ditching it because of how slow it has become. We still have to find something that delivers the same great feature set and flexibility while improving speed and reliability.</p>
<h3><a href="https://linear.app/">Linear</a></h3>
<p><strong>$8/month ⨉ 3 = $24/month.</strong></p>
<p>We put our tasks here. It's a newcomer, but it's so good that we have already committed to it for a year. </p>
<p>It completely revolutionized the way we work with its flexibility, speed, customizability, and great GitHub integration.</p>
<p>If you connect it to GitHub and open a pull request with a task-specific name, task and PR get linked. When the PR is merged, the task is automatically marked as done.</p>
<p>I would invest in this company if I had the chance. It's so much better than everything else I ever tried in this space.</p>
<h3><a href="https://vercel.com/">Vercel</a></h3>
<p><strong>$20/month ⨉ 3 = $60/month.</strong></p>
<p>Vercel deploys and hosts our frontends and serverless functions.</p>
<p>It's a bit pricier than we'd like, and the pricing does not really make sense. Why do we have to pay per team member instead of build minutes, bandwidth, and compute?</p>
<p>With all that being said, we love the product philosophy, simplicity, and integration with GitHub. Having automatic deploys for all commits, together with automatic task-linking to Linear for PRs, is code-review Nirvana.</p>
<h3><a href="https://savvycal.com/">SavvyCal</a></h3>
<p><strong>$12/month ⨉ 2 = $24/month.</strong></p>
<p>We use it to schedule our calls. It's a better Calendly, made by a solo indie developer that we're happy to support.</p>
<p>The product is super-intuitive, and its feature set is increasing at a great pace with features that massively improve our workflows.</p>
<h3><a href="https://plausible.io/">Plausible Analytics</a></h3>
<p><strong>$12/month.</strong></p>
<p>It's a privacy-focused website analytics tool that replaces Google Analytics.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing is how better the insights we get from it are, thanks to some great UX, despite its privacy-respecting stance.</p>
<p>No surprise, they have been <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/plausible-insights">growing like crazy</a>.</p>
<h3><a href="https://mailbrew.com/">Mailbrew</a></h3>
<p><strong>$10/month.</strong></p>
<p>We pay for this, even if we are the ones making it, to test our Stripe Integration.</p>
<p>We use Mailbrew to receive a couple of digests with dedicated Twitter Searches that keep us updated on social mentions of our product.</p>
<h3><a href="https://super.so/">Super</a></h3>
<p><strong>$12/month.</strong></p>
<p>This turns Notion documents into their own websites with a dedicated domain. We use it for our <a href="https://mailbrew.com/press">press kit</a> and <a href="https://help.mailbrew.com/">support docs</a>.  </p>

It follows a case lodged by <em>Investor Village</em>, a small financial news message board, against Facebook. The case alleges that Facebook is knowingly mis-selling advertisers on its ad targeting capabilities.</p><p>The original complaint, which you can find <a href="http://www.wohlfruchter.com/sites/default/files/doc/2020-11-18-dkt-148-amended-complaint.pdf">here</a>, cites internal Facebook emails in which employees describe Facebook's ad targeting as "crap" and "abysmal".</p><p>The most damning line, taken from an internal Facebook email, is:</p><p>“interest precision in the US is only 41%—that means more than half the time we’re showing ads to someone other than the advertisers’ intended audience. And it is even worse internationally. We don’t feel we’re meeting advertisers’ interest accuracy expectations".</p><p>The compliant goes on to compare this to the sorts of benchmarks which Facebook presents to advertisers; where they claim the Facebook Ads platform allows you to target audiences with 89% accuracy.

I suspect that most advertisers treat Facebook's targeting claims with a pinch of salt, and certainly don't expect that 100% of people within an audience will actually belong to said audience.</p><p>If this is the case though, does it really matter if Facebook isn't 100% accurate with it's targeting? Is 41% really that bad, or is it even good? The answer, I believe, is a little more complex than it first seems.</p><h2>Does accuracy really matter?</h2><p>I don't think it really makes sense to give a single answer to this question. The reasons why advertisers use a platform like Facebook Ads are many, and so to give one answer that covers all advertisers is to oversimplify the matter.</p><p>One important distinction between ways that advertisers use the platform, and which is relevant to whether accuracy matters (for them), is whether they're a <em>brand</em> or <em>direct response</em> advertiser.</p><h3>Brand advertisers</h3><p>A brand advertiser advertises to build their brand. They're not (at least directly) measuring sales that result from their ads. Instead, they're more interested in building so-called <em>brand metrics</em> (brand awareness, brand favorability, et cetera) in the minds of their target audience.</p><p>This last point, of building brand metrics amongst a target audience, is important. If you run a brand selling pet food, then your brand metrics only really matter amongst people who own pets. It doesn't matter if non-pet-owners know your brand or not; they're highly unlikely to ever give you money.</p><p>Brand advertisers are in a precarious position therefore. It's critical for them to have accurate targeting data in order to reach their target audience, but they have to rely on Facebook for this targeting data. Facebook might mis-sell brand advertisers on the ability to target a particular audience on Facebook Ads, yet the brand advertiser has no alternative but to trust Facebook.</p><p>To make matters worse, there's no real ability for the brand advertiser to validate the audience data that they're paying for. Because the brand advertiser isn't measuring the success of their advertising through direct sales, or anything that would give you a sense of how accurate Facebook's audience data really is, it's difficult for them to question the data they're given.</p><p>All of this means that brand advertisers are hurt particularly hard by inaccurate targeting data within Facebook Ads.</p><h3>Direct response advertisers</h3><p>The other main category of advertiser, and the one with which most are more familiar, is the direct response (DR) advertiser.</p><p>A DR advertiser runs ads solely for the purpose of generating a response. For the majority, this is some form of website or app-based conversion; perhaps a registration or a purchase from the advertiser's site.</p><p>Unlike with brand advertisers, DR advertisers have a tight feedback loop between spend and ROI. A DR advertiser will have their ad campaigns hooked up to their conversion event (a purchase on their site, for instance) and will only spend on ads so long as they're able to drive conversion events efficiently.</p><p>If a DR advertiser isn't able to generate conversions efficiently (i.e. where their cost per conversion is below their product's LTV), they'll simply pull spend.</p><p>In this way, the DR advertiser relies on faith in Facebook Ads to a much smaller extent than the brand advertiser. If a particular audience on Facebook Ads had horrific accuracy, the DR advertiser would likely notice this in the form of a low ROI, and simply choose to put her budget elsewhere. In this sense, low-accuracy audience data hurts DR advertisers far less than their brand counterparts.</p><h3>Auction mechanics</h3><p>The other thing to note, particularly when it comes to DR advertisers, is about how prices are set on Facebook Ads.</p><p>Prices are set using a (second price) auction, which means you effectively pay a (constantly changing) market rate to show your ads.</p><p>This auction pricing means that the cost to reach a particular audience is relative to how <em>good</em> it is deemed to be by other advertisers (where <em>good</em> essentially means <em>profitable</em>). If a particular audience on Facebook has low accuracy, then this will likely be reflected in advertisers bidding less on that audience, and prices dropping to the point where it's just as efficient to bid on that audience as a more accurate one.</p><p>In this sense, auction-based pricing tends to level out and account for differences in audience quality.</p><h2>Audiences aren't in vogue</h2><p>One last thing that's worth considering, is that most (DR) advertisers nowadays don't take a particularly audience-centric approach to advertising. Gone are the day where you'd pick out a couple of key audiences, and funnel your spend through them.</p><p>Even if Facebook's pre-packaged audience data is lousy, the machine learning that powers its delivery algorithms certainly isn't. Because these algorithms are so efficient at picking out high-value users within any audience, it often doesn't really matter what audience your start with.</p><p>As a result, it's become increasingly common for advertisers to target broader audiences (perhaps a whole country) or use lookalike targeting to effectively create their own audiences.</p><p>This trend is particularly noticeable on larger accounts, where the ads are generating so much data that it makes more sense to let the delivery algorithms run unconstrained by specific audience targeting.</p><p>In this sense, bad audience data is really more of a concern for smaller advertisers. These advertisers may not have enough data to build robust lookalikes from, or to let a campaign run wild across a whole country, and that's why they're pushed towards using Facebook's pre-packaged audiences.</p><h3>In Summary</h3><p>There are really two segments of advertiser hit hardest by Facebook pushing advertisers to bid on inaccurate audience data:</p><ul role="list"><li><strong>Brand advertisers</strong><br>If you're an advertiser that relies on the accuracy of Facebook's audience data, then of course hearing that it can be as low as 9% accurate is going to present problems.</li><li><strong>Smaller advertisers</strong><br>Advertisers who are more reliant on Facebook's pre-packaged audiences, not through their approach to advertising but simply their size, are also disproportionately affected by poor audience data.</li></ul><p>As we saw from data emerging from the 2020 Facebook ad boycott however, the segments above aren't bringing in the lion's share of Facebook's profits. Firstly, direct response advertising likely makes up a far larger chunk of revenue than brand advertising. Secondly, advertisers so small that they're wholly reliant on Facebook's audience data aren't (even in aggregate) going to be worth a huge amount to Facebook's bottom line.</p><p>In this sense, I can't see there being much incentive for Facebook to respond to this wave of criticism by upping their focus on accuracy.</p><p>‍</p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>In 1937, before a shot was even fired in Europe, Imperial Japanese forces were engaged in a long, bloody conflict in China – and it is during this period that we catch a glimpse of the atrocities that would stain the 1940s.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The event, or series of events, we are looking at today is the Japanese occupation of Nanjing, commonly referred to as the ‘Rape of Nanjing’.</p>



<p>Anyone with a modicum of knowledge on the Second World War will know of the atrocities committed by Imperial Japanese forces. Their atrocious treatment of PoW’s and civilians throughout South East Asia, Oceania and China are well documented. Several years before those times however, when Japanese forces entered Nanjing, they let loose upon the people there.</p>
<h4>Crashing dominoes&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In the weeks preceding the Japanese occuptation of Nanjing, there had been bloody fighting between Chinese forces and Imperial Japanese troops. Indeed, for several years, the Imperial Japanese Army had been involved in a tit-for-tat conflict against both Communist and nationalist Chinese forces.</p>
<p>In August 1937, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Shanghai" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Battle of Shangai</a> set into motion a series of events that would lead to disaster for Chinese forces and civilians throughout the country. The Battle of Shanghai was a visceral, bloody engagement for both sides. However, by mid-November, Imperial Japanese forces had captured and subjugated the area.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite sustaining heavy casualities after weeks of fighting, Japanese forces of the Central China Area Army and 10th Army were ordered to capture the city of Nanjing and the surrounding area. The subsequent advance prompted hysteria among Chinese civilians and military forces, with thousands of the latter desperately trying to avoid capture.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cry havoc! and let slip the dogs of war</h4>







<p>Upon entering the city, Japanese forces appear to enter a feral state, abandoning all reason and humanity and embarking on a campaign of terror, abuse and murder against the people of the old Chinese capital.</p>



<p>A truly ghastly affair, and throughout we see sadistic methods and practices by Japanese troops. Groups of individuals were buried alive, some were burned alive, and the lucky ones were simply executed en-masse.</p>



<p>Beheadings were commonplace throughout this event, and there are accounts (although hotly debated) of ‘contests’ between Japanese officers to see who could behead 100 people in the shortest time.</p>





<p>In 1937, Japanese media covered the story of Toshiaki Mukai and Tsuyoshi Noda of the Japanese 16th Division, who were both vying to reach this goal of 100 beheadings. Throughout the course of the war these two men are alleged to have murdered over 300 people between them, and upon Japan’s surrender in 1945 the officers were tried and executed for war crimes.</p>



<p>While crimes were being committed against the civilian population, scores of Chinese prisoners of war were ruthlessly executed. The execution of prisoners of war were also particularly sadistic and brutal.</p>



<p>Countless PoW’s were hanged, shot and beheaded, with many more being buried alive alongside civilians. To this day the number of Chinese PoW’s executed is still unknown.</p>

<h4>Accounts by westerners</h4>



<p>As hostilities had not yet erupted between western nations and Japan, there were a range of western civilians in the city during this event, and their accounts of the actions of Japanese soldiers are harrowing.</p>



<p>A surgeon, Robert O. Wilson, in the university hospital within the US safety zone, wrote home on several occasions detailing the events unfolding before his eyes.</p>



<p>“The slaughter of civilians is appalling. I could go on for pages telling of cases of rape and brutality almost beyond belief,” he wrote. “Two bayoneted corpses are the only survivors of seven street cleaners who were sitting in their headquarters when Japanese soldiers came in without warning and killed five of their number and wounded the two that found their way to the hospital.”</p>
<p>The Minnie Vautrin Diary detailing atrocities provides some of the most compelling and harrowing accounts of the Nanjing Massacre. Excerpts detailing what she witnessed can be found online, or the diary itself can be purchased.</p>



<p>In her diary she details the callous brutality of Japanese soldiers and, in particular, their treatment of Chinese women.</p>



<p>“A woman of almost 50 living down near San Pai Lou.&nbsp;She had three sons and two daughters-in-law. Four nights ago two soldiers came to the door at about 10pm, unable to push the door they forced their way in through a window and found themselves in Liu Lau Tai’s room.</p>





<p>“They demanded her daughters-in-law and when she refused and started to go for a military police they cut two gashes in her face and one in her heart.&nbsp;She died from these wounds.”</p>





<h4>Age old barbarism</h4>



<p>Japanese soldiers employed an age old weapon against the people of Nanjing, rape. Assault on women throughout the Nanjing Massacre were widespread and anywhere up to 20,000 women and girls were raped and brutalised.</p>







<p>John Rabe, leader of the Nanjing Safety Zone details his experiences in dealing with these cases during his time in the city.</p>



<p>“In one of the houses in the narrow street behind my garden wall, a woman was raped, and then wounded in the neck with a bayonet. I managed to get an ambulance so we can take her to Kulou Hospital.</p>





<p>“Last night up to 1,000 women and girls are said to have been raped, about 100 girls at Ginling College alone.</p>



<p>“You hear nothing but rape. If husbands or brothers intervene, they’re shot. What you hear and see on all sides is the brutality and bestiality of the Japanese soldiers.”</p>

<h4>Relenting troops</h4>



<p>In January of 1938, after several weeks of bloodletting, refugees within the safety zones were ordered to return to their homes.</p>



<p>Japanese officials claimed at the time that ‘order had been restored’ and that daily life were to continue as normal. For the people of Nanjing subjected to relentless bouts of violence, however, life would never be the same again.</p>



<p>As order was gradually restored, the frequency of attacks and atrocities did dissipate.</p>
<h4>Guilt</h4>



<p>General Iwane Matsui, leader of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, began to realise the extent of the atrocities being committed by his men in Nanjing – albeit too late.</p>



<p>Speaking of his knowledge on the atrocities being committed, he is claimed to have stated to an aide:</p>



<p>“I now realise that we have unknowingly wrought a most grievous effect on this city. When I think of the feelings and sentiments of many of my Chinese friends who have fled from Nanjing and of the future of the two countries, I cannot but feel depressed.</p>



<p>“I am very lonely and can never get in a mood to rejoice about this victory … I personally feel sorry for the tragedies to the people, but the Army must continue unless China repents.</p>



<p>“Now, in the winter, the season gives time to reflect. I offer my sympathy, with deep emotion, to a million innocent people.”</p>



<p>Although an apparent admission of guilt on his part, Matsui’s lack of action on the issue, his burying of the head in sand, simply allowed the ordeal to continue far longer than it did.</p>



<p>Matsui was recalled to Japan following the massacre and retired. Upon Japan’s surrender in 1945, he was tried by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East and is executed.</p>



<h4>Aftermath</h4>



<p>The death toll in Nanjing is debated. Contemporary Japanese statistics could be considered laughable, amounting to only several hundred dead. A range of sources estimate that anywhere between 30,000 to 300,000 people were murdered during this month-long tirade of violence.</p>
<p>Modern Chinese sources (in particular the Chinese Government) claim that these numbers range even higher and are, in fact, closer to half-a-million.</p>




<p>The Nanjing War Crimes Tribunal in 1947 stated:</p>



<p>“More than 190,000 mass slaughtered civilians and Chinese soldiers killed by machine gun by the Japanese army, whose corpses have been burned to destroy proof.</p>



<p>“Besides, we count more than 150,000 victims of barbarian acts buried by the charity organisations. We thus have a total of more than 300,000 victims.”</p>



<p>Researchers state that the death toll numbers between 40,000 and 60,000 based on a number of sources from the time, including Red Army statistics and the Nanjing Safety Zone committee.</p>



<p>Regardless of the true number of casualties, the barbarism and horrific nature of this event are beyond comprehension. The callous behaviour of Japanese soldiers is a stain on the tapestry of 20th century history, and this behaviour continued for another several years until Japanese capitulation in the wake of Hiroshima &amp; Nagasaki.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>[TL;DR: Google has gotten bad; we all know it; ideas for a startup making a better Google.]</p> <p>In 2000, Google got popular because hackers realized it was better than Lycos or Excite. This effect is happening again. Early adopters aren’t using Google anymore.</p> <p>They aren’t using DuckDuckGo either. They’re still using Google.com, but differently. To make Google usable, users are adding faux-query modifiers that to supress the “garbage Internet”.</p> <p>You see this in the typeahead logs.</p> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image6.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Products (Reddit)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image4.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Services (Reddit, Yelp)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image1.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Movies (Rotten Tomatoes)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image5.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Even code (Github)</em></center> <p>Interestingly, this doesn’t work for all categories. <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image3.png" alt=""> <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image2.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Recipes don’t have a “Reddit” equivalent</em></center> <h3 id="query-operators-mean-somethings-broken">Query Operators Mean Something’s Broken</h3> <p>More advanced users use modifiers like <code>site: filetype: intitle:</code> because adding “reddit” isn’t strict enough, as spammy websites often manipulate content to win SEO.</p> <p>How about those websites that stuff the year in the title? “Reviews UPDATED JANUARY 2020” are exploiting the fact that customers suffix queries with the year. What those people are trying to command is freshness, not a title match.</p> <p>Something’s broken, and a tiny share of Google is open for the taking. Obviously attacking incumbents head-on doesn’t work. Here are two alternative ideas for bootstrapping next-generation search:</p> <h3 id="1-boogle-a-query-reformulator">#1 Boogle, A Query Reformulator</h3> <p>Introducing Boogle, a proxy for Google that’s just Better Google Search. It’s a query expander. We predict the correct operators for your query, proxy Google’s results, and serve. For example:</p> <p><code>query("stripe.js example") -&gt; query("stripe.js example (site:github.com OR site:gitlab.com OR site:..."))</code></p> <p><code>query("is anker charger") -&gt; query("is anker charger (inurl:forum OR site:reddit.com OR ...))"</code></p> <p>Query topic modeling is a rich science with plenty of examples.</p> <p>You’d almost as fast as Google, never worse, and occasionally better. This will help build the reflex to use you instead. This approach isn’t that hard to get started with, and might work for the high-end users.</p>  <p>You could go after this vertical by vertical – build the <em>best</em> site for electric product search, for travel, for code, etc. A key question is how to build habitual recall to use your product over Google. Amazon and Airbnb both enjoy a huge amount of direct traffic. Some learnings from those:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Stellar mobile destination.</strong> Using Airbnb directly feels more fluid and fun than using Google for Airbnb.</li> <li><strong>The 90% Rule.</strong> To build reflex you need to give me what I want most of the time.** **With Prime, Amazon made it such that we stopped price comparing across other sites; Amazon would get it to us fastest, and that turns out to matter more than price. Most of the time you open Amazon.app, it satisfies.</li> <li><strong>Come for search, stay for something else.</strong> I don’t think of Airbnb or Amazon as search apps. They help me get things or book homes. You might want to your search app to be a destination for something else. This is where I think community comes in.</li> </ul> <p>Picking a vertical that <em>doesn’t</em> have strong typeahead completions[1] would help you build community around your search engine. Recipes, fitness, fashion, etc. don’t have decacorn conglomerates like Github or Reddit. That might mean it’s easier to build community around them, and put your flagship search engine on top.</p> <hr> <p>If you’re working on this kind of stuff, try out <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> or just shoot me an email – daniel@pioneer.app.</p> <hr> <p>[1] In reality I’d pick the vertical _I _love most. If you’re a guitar player start with music; a movie buff should build better Rotten Tomatos. Etc.</p> </article></div>]]>

                    <p>One of the core ideas of interaction design is to enable users to glide smoothly to their destination with as little friction as possible. To make people experience the software as an extension of their brain, and not something to continually wrestle with and domesticate.</p>

<p>Great products ask nothing from you on the first interaction. They’ll let you in and experiment without requiring anything upfront, not even your email address. Usually, until you need to save something. Hoping that, by that moment, they succeeded at demonstrating their value. That’s how removing friction, or only slightly delaying it, gives you a head start on the competition.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.petarperovic.com/assets/friction-github_delete.png" alt="Delete repository on GitHub screen">
<em>This is the exact copy I borrowed from GitHub for the title of this article. When you try to delete a repository, GitHub will force you to correctly type its name, making sure you know what you’re doing.</em></p>

<p>However, there are situations where you deliberately want to make interaction less convenient for users’ benefit. When you purposely want to make them stop and think. Typically when they’re about to perform a potentially destructive action or/and an operation that affects other people in the system. For example, to prevent them from accidentally deleting a project shared between many people and forever losing everyone’s important work. That’s where adding friction saves you from shooting yourself in the foot. As a rule of thumb, whenever there’s a potential of users harming themselves — add friction.</p>

<p>Friction is, however, often abused to deliberately confuse and exploit human anxiety when interacting with computers. Airlines’ websites will routinely scare you into buying garbage services you don’t need. Facebook will emotionally manipulate you if you try to erase it from your life. They’ll try to change your mind through the multi-page process where they’ll show you photos of the family and friends you’ll be missing as if they’d all be dead the moment you delete the account. Likewise, it’s widespread for products to complicate subscription cancellation for no reason, foolishly making users even more aggravated. These are all examples of adding friction in bad faith.</p>

<p>Physical world is also full of deliberately added friction, usually to prevent people from making dumb mistakes. Streets around schools slow down traffic with physical obstacles and flashing signals to protect little humans from deadly, fast-moving machines. Modern cars will poke you with annoying noise to fasten your seatbelt, dramatically increasing your chances of survival in case of an accident. Automatic sliding doors remove friction to increase the flow of people in high traffic, commercial buildings. Preventing the formation of queues, but also helping to maintain the temperature of the building. And so on…</p>

<p>At every point of human interaction with digital or physical interfaces, there’s friction. I find it incredibly useful to think about interaction design as adjusting friction, thus controlling the heartbeat of communication between humans and machines.</p>

<p>When we develop more than one python project, we need to configure our development environment with the dependencies of all the projects. This becomes even more complicated when there are many people on the development of the project.
To do this, you need to create a development environment that is isolated from the others. We can do this thanks to <strong>docker</strong> containers.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-project">Prepare project</h2>
<p>Let’s imagine that our project has this structure:</p>
<pre><code data-lang="console">pydk
├─── requirements.txt
└─── src
     └─── server.py
</code></pre><p>We now think that our project may depend on some external libraries, such as <strong>Flask</strong>. Let’s prepare a file called <em>requirements.txt</em> with a line inside it: <code>Flask==1.1.2</code></p>
<p>While our <em>server.py</em> application, it will be a simple Flask application like the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>from</span> <span>flask</span> <span>import</span> <span>Flask</span>
<span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>Flask</span><span>(</span><span>__name__</span><span>)</span>

<span>@server.route</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>)</span>
<span>def</span> <span>hello_docker</span><span>():</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>"Hello docker!"</span>

<span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>"__main__"</span><span>:</span>
   <span>server</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>host</span><span>=</span><span>'0.0.0.0'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Now, we can run and continue to develop this project locally, but if we had other projects with requirements that would conflict, we would break this or other projects.
So, let’s see how we can isolate this project inside a container that is the same for all the developers who are going to develop.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-dockerfile">Prepare dockerfile</h2>
<p>Now we need to create a <em>Dockerfile</em> (<code>pydk/Dockerfile</code>) that contains suitable instructions to build our container so that it can execute our python code.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span># base image</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>FROM</span><span> python:3.9</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># working directory in the container</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>WORKDIR</span><span> /pydk</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># copy the dependencies file to the working directory</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> requirements.txt .<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># install dependencies</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>RUN</span> pip install -r requirements.txt<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># copy the content of the local src directory to the working directory</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> src/ .<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span># command to run on container start</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>CMD</span> <span>[</span> <span>"python"</span><span>,</span> <span>"./server.py"</span> <span>]</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now we run the command to build our image. When docker builder kicks in, you can see all the steps we wrote in our dockerfile:</p>

That would actually be super cool and be huge for gene therapy (and I could finally give myself the giant bat wings I’ve always wanted) but this is not so. This is ordinarily impossible except if there is also a reverse transcriptase enzyme present that produces DNA from the RNA template, which is how retroviruses work. There is no such risk with any mRNA vaccine candidate. mRNA vaccines act entirely within the cytosol of the cell- they do not go near the nucleus where all the DNA is. That’s actually a major advantage of RNA-based vaccines over DNA ones.</p></blockquote></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606177725054_56388"><div>

Figure 5.23C which shows the nuclear import cycle with influenza ribonucleoproteins as an example. Nucleear localization signals are recognized by importin-α which then recruits importin-β which recruits a small GTPase called Ran. When binding GDP, Ran is able to transport the RNP across the nuclear pore complex. The complex of importins and Ran will then dissociate, and a guanine nucleotide exchange factor will exchange GDP for GTP, that allows Ran-GTP to be exported out of the nucleus. RanGAP-1 or RanBPI, 2 can then catalyze hydrolysis of GTP to GDP which allows Ran to bind another importin-β to initiate the import cycle once more. </p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606190121308_43147"><div><p>I gave this response in large part because I felt that the detailed discussion of reverse transcription, nuclear trafficking, the endocytic pathway, and the other 11 or so advanced cell biology topics that I would have to invoke to give this a rigorous answer was too complex to be of benefit to the average person wanting to know simply whether or not this is possible. However, I had a flurry of questions about “what ifs” relating to retroviruses or hepadnaviruses (hepatitis B), and I can grant that this response doesn’t address that, so here I will attempt to answer that as explicitly and with minimal complexity as I am capable. </p><p>To simplify the discussion so as to avoid having to explain the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4377075/">phases of phospholipid bilayers</a> and the molecular composition of the lipid nanoparticle as it relates to stability (discussed in <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5439223/pdf/tde-07-319.pdf">1</a>, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6383180/pdf/main.pdf">2</a>, <a href="https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1525-0016%2819%2930041-3">3</a>, <a href="https://www.cell.com/action/showPdf?pii=S1525-0016%2819%2930053-X">4</a>), I will ask readers take for granted that mRNA vaccines are endocytosed and <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/3301506.pdf">liberated</a> (<a href="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/acsami.8b21398">and this</a>) into the cytoplasm of the cell. </p><p>Firstly, for mRNA to affect your DNA, at a minimum we need to establish that it would need to gain access to the DNA in question. There are two subcellular compartments where this can be accomplished. The first is the nucleus, so let’s start with a discussion of the trafficking of cargo in the nucleus. The nucleus of the cell is an isolated compartment with pore complexes (NPCs) that impose limits on the size of the particles that can freely enter. RNA is readily transported out as transcription occurs within the nucleus but the ribosomes required to produce proteins are in the cytosol or on the rough endoplasmic reticulum. This process is mediated by several accessory proteins which you can see to your right. Note however that there isn’t any physiological circumstance in which one might need RNA from the cytosol to be transported back to the nucleus. RNA is synthesized within the nucleus. Viruses which have a nuclear phase in their replication cycle have to have various tricks to be able to allow their RNA payload to enter. Though RNA is not readily transported into cells, proteins can be. This occurs via a network of proteins called importins (see figure 5-23C on the right). Proteins containing an amino acid sequence called the nuclear localization sequence (NLS; there are 2 common ones) are able to bind the importins, which can then transport them across the nuclear pore complex as shown on the right. RNA viruses often have replication cycles that do not require access to the nucleus, but there are some exceptions. <a href="https://jvi.asm.org/content/jvi/84/3/1254.full.pdf">Influenza viruses for example are RNA viruses that have their genomes associated with ribonucleoproteins, and these ribonucleoproteins express nuclear localization signals that facilitates the entry of their genomic RNA into the nucleus</a>. mRNA vaccines, on the other hand, are not associated with any proteins. Once inside the cytosol, the mRNA is naked and exposed to the harsh environment of ribosomes and exonucleases which destroy the mRNA in a matter of hours (at most). There is no conceivable mechanism by which mRNA can spontaneously be trafficked into the nucleus. Being made of nucleotides, it cannot contain a nuclear localization sequence. </p><p>The other relevant compartment would be the mitochondrion. Mitochondria are actually vestigial bacteria with their own genomes, and it’s thought that billions of years ago an ancient cell (probably an archaean- the cousins of bacteria) tried to consume the ancestor of the mitochondria but lacked the machinery to actually do the digesting and the two established a symbiotic relationship. Since that instance, the mitochondria have been an essential feature of our cell’s biologies. This allowed the mitochondria to develop an extremely reduced genome containing only<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5215404/pdf/PATH-241-236.pdf"> 37 genes</a> (most of the genes relevant to mitochondrial function are still in the nucleus). Mitochondria have their <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/116/17/8283.full.pdf">own ribosomes</a> and even their own <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/282189a0">genetic code</a> (sort of). There is also a specialized process for the clearance of diseased mitochondria called <strong>mitophagy, </strong>which is the subject of many excellent reviews e.g. <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001265">this</a>, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-018-0176-2">this</a>, and <a href="https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(18)30006-X.pdf">this</a>. </p><p>The collective conclusion from our understanding of these biological process is that a naked mRNA in the cytosol has no potential to end up in a cellular compartment that contains our own DNA means that, irrespective of the presence or absence of other factors, there is no chance of harm to the DNA from the mRNA vaccine. But still people wanted to ask me about reverse transcriptases so let’s discuss those.</p><p>The process of going from RNA to DNA (the exact opposite of what the central dogma of molecular biology dictates) is known as <strong>reverse transcription</strong>, and it is carried out with an enzyme called a <strong>reverse transcriptase </strong>(which are a really interesting group of enzymes). In general, reverse transcription is performed by a few different genetic entities: <strong>retroviruses</strong>, <strong>hepadnaviruses</strong>, <strong>telomeres</strong>, and <strong>retrotransposons</strong>. These are worth defining. </p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Retroviruses are viruses who have an RNA genome, from which they create a DNA copy through reverse transcription that then integrates into the cell of the host (by which I mean, literally inserts itself into the host cell’s genome and becomes a permanent part of it, in the form of a sequence called a <strong>provirus</strong>). The proviral sequence itself can then be transcribed in the host cell to produce viral proteins and particles that can go on to spread to the next cell. The most famous retrovirus is HIV-1. </p></li><li><p>Hepadnaviruses are DNA viruses which have gapped genomes (there is one complete DNA strand and another partial DNA strand which is linked to a pregenomic RNA), and unlike retroviruses, do not integrate into the genome of the host cell they infect. The most famous example is Hepatitis B virus, for which multiple effective vaccines exist. </p></li><li><p>Telomeres are structures present at the ends of human chromosomes which are maintained by a protein complex called telomerase that uses a reverse transcriptase called TERT to maintain them. The reasons this is necessary are discussed below. They are about 5-15 kilobases long normally, and shortening results in arrest of cell growth and replication (senescence), or can even trigger cell death by apoptosis. </p></li></ul></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606152858324_15060"><div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>
            My first successful open source project was <a href="https://github.com/vuciv/vim-bujo">Vim Bujo</a>, a task manager that you 
            can use straight from any vim session. You can access a general todo list, or a project specific one.
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://jerseyfonseca.com/projects/images/bujo/bujo.png"></p><h2>Coming up with the Idea</h2>
        <p>
            I typically use todo lists, but I've never been able to find anything 
            better than good 'ol pen and paper. I've tried the most popular apps, 
            but I just couldn't get into them. Switching screens from my work to mark 
            something as complete just kind of ruined the flow for me. On top of that, 
            all these apps were bloated with features I didn't want or need.
        </p>
        <p>
            For many years, I just stuck to pen and paper, but I was always looking for
            something digital. There had to be some technology that gave me the satisfaction and 
            organization of marking tasks as completed without interrupting my workflow! Well, I never found it... 
        </p>
        <p>
            I was getting into vim last year. You know how when you're learning about something new, 
            you start to see it everywhere? Like, the first time I learned Mechanics, I would think 
            about all the forces interacting whenever I took a step. Well, I was experiencing that, 
            except for vim. One day, I was jotting my ideas on a todo list  
            and I had an epiphany. "I can open a todo list straight from the file I'm working on!" 
            And so spawned the idea of a Vim Bullet Journal, or, Vim Bujo. 
            It was a vim plugin that I actually wanted to use. 
        </p>
        <h2>Making It</h2>
        <p>
           I had no experience with building vim plugins, or using vimscript, the language vim plugins are written in. 
           My first step was to checkout Steve Losh's "Creating a Full Plugin" from his book, 
           <a href="https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/">Learn Vimscript the Hard Way</a>. After skimming 
           through, I was able to get a pretty good idea of the file structure, but was still lacking on specifics, and 
           to be frank, did not have the time to read through the other 40+ chapters of Steve Losh's book. 
           To fill this gap in my knowledge, I decided to learn my favorite way: reading other people's code!
        </p>
        <p>
            I find just looking at other people's code is always a great way to get started. I don't mean copying, or 
            anything. I just mean looking at functional code, logic flows, and more high-level components. I decided to 
            check out some of <a href="https://github.com/tpope">Tim Pope's</a> projects. He is one of the most famous 
            and prolific vim plugin creators out there - and all his code is open source! Take advantage of things like this! 
            It's a gold mine!
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, from then on, I built the simplest version I can; it did everything it needed to do. When you typed ":Todo", 
            a new file would open and dock to your window. From here, you can use keybindings to enter a new task, or mark one 
            as completed. I tested it out, and it was exactly what I had been looking for. Okay, I probably overhyped it a little 
            to myself since I'm the one that made it... But it felt good, and was definitely something I wanted to use.
        </p>
        <h3>Adding Git Integration</h3>
        <p>
            So far, I was pretty happy with my project! Someone ended up making a really good feature request, though. 
            They asked if I can have git integration so that a project specific todo list would open up if you are in 
            a git repo. It turned out to be pretty easy!
        </p>
        <p>
            Git has a userful command called <code>git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree</code>. If this returned <code>true</code>, we would 
            use <code>git rev-parse --show-toplevel</code> to get the name of the toplevel directory and make a todo file named 
            after the project repo you are in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adding git integration wasn't a challenge at all, but I thought it was cool enough that I should include it! 
            Also, git integration just makes my project sound cooler, and that's what it's all about, right?
        </p>
        <h3>Where do I Store the Todo Files?</h3>
        <p>
            Once git integration existed, I needed to think about where I'd be storing these files on users' computers. 
            I originally just had a dotfile at the root directory of the project, but this wasn't optimal. Luckily, a user 
            presented a solution so simple it made me hit myself in the head. Just make a <code>~/.cache/bujo</code> folder where all 
            this would be stored! It wouldn't bother users at all, and if that wasn't good for them, they can set their 
            own filepath in their vimrc.
        </p>
        <h2>Marketing It</h2>
        <p>
            I gotta admit, I am pretty bad when it comes to marketing. I constantly delete my social medias, and so I never 
            build up an audience to share my creations with. Luckily, I had something genuine to share that communities 
            tend to receive well. I wasn't trying to spam anyone, I wasn't trying to get something from them, I was just 
            sharing what I made. Here were my most successful avenues:
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim">r/vim</a> on Reddit</h3>
        <p><img src="https://jerseyfonseca.com/projects/images/bujo/reddit.PNG"></p><p>
            My <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/hf98bu/vimbujo_a_minimalist_todo_list/">reddit post</a> was 
            probably the most successful avenue! I got 300+ upvotes, and engaged with around 20 people in the comments. 
            They offered me feedback, and I implemented it. This was the most important part of getting people to use it.
        </p>
        <h3>Discord</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen">The Primeagen</a> is the person who got me into vim. 
            His videos and streams are phenomenal and I love following him. I was also in his discord and asked 
            him if I'd be able to share my plugin in his channel. He said yes, and on top of that, he even started 
            using it! This didn't get me many users, but he started using it! Sometimes, when he's going through 
            his .vimrc, I see my plugin! This was by far the coolest part for me.
        </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            This was the first thing I've ever made that people actually used.
            <a href="https://github.com/vuciv/vim-bujo">On github</a>, people were contributing, logging issues, making feature requests, 
            and even forking the project to expand on it! I ended with over 100 stars, 
            which may not sound like much, but is a huge milestone for me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important thing I learned here was to build things I want to use.
            If I find it useful, odds are somone else finds it useful too!
        </p>

						<p>In a photo posted on NASA’s website and Twitter, the administration showed a real example of a breathtaking phenomenon once conjectured only in theory.</p><p>An Einstein ring is created when light from a galaxy or star passes by a massive object en route to the Earth. Because of an effect called "gravitational lensing", light looks to come from different places. If the source, lens, and observer are all properly aligned, we see a circle of light as the light behind the object warps and bends around it.</p><p>The effect was predicted in Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity. Light from a source traveling in a straight line is bent by the presence of a massive body.</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSwjjgfFyAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></figure><p>A story in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamiecartereurope/2019/05/29/the-true-story-behind-how-albert-einstein-was-proved-right-at-a-solar-eclipse-100-years-ago-today/?sh=5f5359d155a2">Forbes details</a> the fascinating account of how Einstein actually proved his theory showing the existence of these rings.</p><p>Setting out to prove Einstein, astronomers from Britain traveled to Africa and Brazil to measure the exact position of stars in the Hyades star cluster in the constellation of Taurus. </p><p>A total solar eclipse was visible from Peru to Mozambique, right across South America, the Atlantic Ocean, and southern Africa. The eclipse plunged a narrow path across the planet into darkness for a few minutes. Astronomers and scientists were dispatched to various places along the track taking photos of the star cluster to compare to photos taken six months earlier.</p><p>The totality on May 29, 1919, lasted six minutes 51 seconds. It was the longest solar eclipse since May 27, 1416. On Príncipe, it lasted 5 minutes 12 seconds. Ultimately, photos from both locations showed light bending in the cluster proving the effect and clinching Einstein's eternal claim to scientific fame.</p><p>GAL-CLUS-022058s is the largest and one of the most complete Einstein rings ever discovered in our universe.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Ethereum is one of the leading crypto projects (second to bitcoin). In December 2020 Ethereum released the first stage of Ethereum 2.0. The biggest difference is that there is no need for an expensive calculation to validate blockchain transactions, miners can earn money only by staking their coins. This is a shift from proof-of-work to <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking">proof-of-stake</a>. You can read more on the vision <a href="https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/vision">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="what-does-it-mean-for-you">What does it mean for you?</h3>

<p>If you want to “mine” eth you don’t need to invest in an expensive server farm anymore, all you need is to stake at least 32ETH and run the eth2 clients for as little as $10/month. In return you will earn passive income - currently, <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15tmPOvOgi3wKxJw7KQJKoUe-uonbYR6HF7u83LR5Mj4/edit#gid=842896204">around 10%</a>. The more people stake their eth the lower the interest rate will be. You can find the latest rate <a href="https://launchpad.ethereum.org/">here</a>.
In case you have at least 32ETH and you are OK to stake it for at least a year, probably more, until Ethereum reach their <a href="https://docs.ethhub.io/ethereum-roadmap/ethereum-2.0/eth-2.0-phases">next phase</a>, you can use this guide to learn how to do it.
This solution is great if you want to hold your ETH coins for 1-2 years and earn passive income by doing so.
<strong>This guide is for educational purposes only.</strong></p>

<h3 id="install-metamask">Install Metamask</h3>

<p>We will use Metamask as our ethereum wallet. You can install it from <a href="https://metamask.io/">here</a>. Do not lose the password and paraphrase for your wallet.<br>
After you finished installing your wallet, make sure you select the <code>goerli</code> (test) network.
<img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-11.png" alt="Metamask Goerli"></p>

<h3 id="get-goerli">Get Goerli</h3>

<p>Since we are using the Goerli test network, we will need some coins to play with. To be a validator you will need ether. You can get test ether coins from <a href="https://faucet.goerli.mudit.blog/">here</a>. All you need is to tweet your <strong>goerli</strong> wallet address. Make sure you ask for at least 32 eth (the minimum for a validator node).</p>

<h3 id="become-eth2-validator">Become eth2 validator</h3>

<p>Go to the Ethereum 2.0 pyrmont (test) <a href="https://pyrmont.launchpad.ethereum.org/">launchpad site</a> and click on <code>GET STARTED</code>. Read all the warnings and information, make sure you understand them all.<br>
The next step is to <a href="https://pyrmont.launchpad.ethereum.org/select-client">select your client</a> - choose <a href="https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse">lighthouse</a>.<br>
Select how much eth you want to stake, 32 eth is the minimum.
You will also need to <a href="https://pyrmont.launchpad.ethereum.org/generate-keys">select your local machine’s operating system</a> to <a href="https://github.com/ethereum/eth2.0-deposit-cli/releases/">download the CLI</a>. In this post I use Mac, but you can choose whatever OS you use. Open and extract the CLI folder you downloaded from GitHub. Inside that folder, you will find a <code>deposit</code> file. Run this file using: <code>/path/to/deposit new-mnemonic --num_validators 1 --chain pyrmont</code>. Please note:<br>
<code>/path/to/deposit</code> is whenever your downloaded <code>deposit</code> file is.<br>
<code>--num_validators</code> has the number of validators you want to have. Each validator is 32ETH.<br>
<code>pyrmont</code> is the test network. You should change it if you want to work on the main network (aka real money).</p>

<p>Here is example of the output you will have:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;</span> /Users/sagivo/Desktop/eth2deposit-cli-ed5a6d3-darwin-amd64/deposit new-mnemonic <span>--num_validators</span> 1 <span>--chain</span> pyrmont
Please choose your mnemonic language <span>(</span>czech, chinese_traditional, chinese_simplified, english, spanish, italian, korean<span>)</span> <span>[</span>english]: english
Type the password that secures your validator keystore<span>(</span>s<span>)</span>:
Repeat <span>for </span>confirmation:
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will be asked to choose a validator password. Do not lose this password, you will need it to get your money back at some point. <strong>This is not your wallet password</strong>, select a new password just for the validator client. After selecting the password you will get a seed phrase to store in case you lost your validator password. Store the seed phase in a secure location as well.<br>
If everything went well you should see a hippo(?) image.<br>
<img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-4.png" alt="Ethereum CLI validator"></p>

<p>Open the folder with the keys. In this folder you will find a few files:<br>
<code>deposit_data-[some number].json</code> - this is the information for your deposit.<br>
<code>keystore-[some number].json</code> - you will have one or more files based on the number of validators you selected.
In this stage, you have all you need to install the local clients. Keep this window open, we will get back to it after we install the clients.</p>

<h3 id="ethereum-client-components">Ethereum client components</h3>

<p>Now that you staked your eth, you will need 3 nodes to become ETH 2.0 validator:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ETH 1.0 client</strong>: this client will listen to the Ethereum 1.0 network. You can either run a local client or use a free 3rd party node. To save resources and keep this post simple, I’m using a free <a href="https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/signup?referral=5f4b22ad-1a24-46af-ab1c-4475e8fe177d">alchemyapi.io</a> node. You can find more 3rd party options <a href="https://ethereumnodes.com/">here</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Beacon node</strong>: ethereume 2.0 client.</li>
  <li><strong>Validator client</strong>: to validate eth2 transactions.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="create-eth1-client">Create eth1 client</h3>

<p>You can either create a local eth1 client or use a 3rd party node instead. Let’s use a 3rd party today. Open a free <a href="https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/signup?referral=5f4b22ad-1a24-46af-ab1c-4475e8fe177d">alchemyapi.io</a> and <a href="https://dashboard.alchemyapi.io/apps">create an app</a>. Make sure you select the <code>Goerli</code> network for your eth1 node.</p>

<p><img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-9.png" alt="Alchemyapi node"></p>

<p>After the app has been created go to the app’s page and click on <code>VIEW KEY</code>, you will need to copy the HTTP URL for the beacon node.

<h3 id="hosting-your-beacon-node-and-validator-client">Hosting your beacon node and validator client</h3>

<p>You can run your beacon node and validator client on a local computer. Beacon nodes are intended to be high-performance, highly available platforms that can support connections to numerous validator clients and maintain ongoing p2p connectivity with other beacon nodes. As such, their hardware requirements are anticipated to be server-grade CPU/SSD/networking connections.<br>
Your server needs to be available 24/7 or you will accrue penalties and lose ETH. This is why I prefer running my nodes on a hosted cloud server. In this tutorial, I choose <a href="https://m.do.co/c/29d9028f31d1">Digitalocean</a>. After playing with multiple specs, I’ve found that you can run your beacon node and validator client for just $10/month. Use <a href="https://m.do.co/c/29d9028f31d1">this link</a> to sign up for digitalocean and get $100 credit! This should cover your Ethereum staking expenses a while :)</p>

<h3 id="creating-a-digitalocean-droplet">Creating a digitalocean Droplet</h3>

<p>From your Digitalocean account, create a <a href="https://cloud.digitalocean.com/droplets/new">new droplet</a>.<br>
Choose the <code>Ubuntu</code> droplet. This will create a UNIX server running Ubuntu. <img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-1.png" alt="Ubunto droplet"></p>

<p>Select the $10/mo plan. The $10/month spec is the bare minimum you should choose. If you want to choose a stronger instance go for it.</p>

<p><img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-2.png" alt="10 dollar plan"></p>

<p>Setup SSH access under the <code>Authentication</code> section. This is important to be able to access your server from your terminal.<br>
You can leave the other settings as-is.<br>
Once your droplet setup is completed copy the ip address from the dashboard.<br>
<img src="https://sagivo.com/assets/ethereum-3.png" alt="copy ip"></p>

<h3 id="setting-up-your-cloud-server">Setting up your cloud server</h3>

<p>By now you should have a running digital ocean server and you should have generated <code>validator_keys</code> locally using the CLIt. Now let’s access your digital ocean machine to set it up.
First, let’s copy your local <code>validator_keys</code> folder to your hosted server.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>scp <span>-pr</span> /path/to/your/local/validator_keys <a href="https://sagivo.com/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="8cfee3e3f8cce8e5ebe5f8ede0">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>_ocean_ip:/validator_keys
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>/path/to/your/local/validator_keys</code>: the path for your local folder containing the generated validator keys.</li>
  <li><code>digital_ocean_ip</code>: your digitalocean machine’s IP.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now that we copied the keys to the droplet (digitalocean instance), let’s SSH into this machine.</p>



<ul>
  <li><code>digital_ocean_ip</code>: your new machine’s IP.</li>
</ul>

<p>The first (optional) step is to enable better metrics on the machine to track later in digitalocean. This will let you inspect CPU, memory, disk I/O, and other metrics in the digitalocean dashboard.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>curl <span>-sSL</span> https://repos.insights.digitalocean.com/install.sh | <span>sudo </span>bash
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="install-lighthouse">Install Lighthouse</h3>

<p>In this step, we will install lighthouse on your new server. <a href="https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse">Lighouse</a> is an open-source Ethereum 2.0 client, written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> and maintained by Sigma Prime.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Go to the <a href="https://github.com/sigp/lighthouse/releases">Lighthouse releases page</a> and select the latest linux release.</li>
  <li>Download the portable binary <code>wget lighthouse-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-portable.tar.gz</code>.</li>
  <li>Extract the archive: <code>tar -xvf lighthouse-${VERSION}-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.gz</code></li>
  <li>Test the binary with <code>./lighthouse --version</code> (it should print the version).</li>
  <li>Move the lighthouse binary to a location in your PATH, so the lighthouse command can be called from anywhere: <code>cp lighthouse /usr/bin</code></li>
  <li>
    <p>Clean your downloaded files</p>

    <div><div><pre><code><span>rm </span>lighthouse
<span>rm </span>lighthouse-<span>${</span><span>VERSION</span><span>}</span><span>-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu</span>.tar.gz
</code></pre></div>    </div>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="import-validator-keys">Import validator keys</h3>

<p>We will import the validator keys so we can use them by the validator.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>mkdir</span> <span>-p</span> /var/lib/lighthouse
lighthouse account validator import <span>--directory</span> /validator_keys <span>--datadir</span> /var/lib/lighthouse
</code></pre></div></div>

<ul>
  <li><code>/var/lib/lighthouse</code>: this folder will store our lighthouse data.</li>
  <li><code>--directory /validator_keys</code>: our imported <code>validator_keys</code> folder locaiton.</li>
</ul>

<p>You will be prompted to insert a password. Insert the password for your validator client again.</p>

<h3 id="run-beacon-node">Run beacon node</h3>

<p>We will run the beacon node as a daemon service. This way it will auto-restart if there’s an error. It’s important to have your eth 2.0 service running 24/7 to not accrue penalties and lose eth.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>nano /etc/systemd/system/lighthousebeacon.service
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Paste this text:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Lighthouse Eth2 Client Beacon Node
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
ExecStart=/usr/bin/lighthouse bn --network pyrmont --staking --datadir /var/lib/lighthouse --eth1-endpoints https://eth-goerli.alchemyapi.io/v2/[your token]

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a new service that will re-start if it fails.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>--network pyrmont</code>: we use the test network</li>
  <li><code>--eth1-endpoints</code>: comma-separated http addresses of your eth1 client nodes.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reload the daemon use</p>



<p>Now let’s start the beacon daemon service:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>systemctl start lighthousebeacon
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You can inspect the output using (safe to ctr+c once you’re done):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>journalctl <span>-fu</span> lighthousebeacon.service
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Also, let’s enable the service to start on server restart:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>systemctl <span>enable </span>lighthousebeacon
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="validator-client">Validator client</h3>

<p>Let’s create a validator service</p>

<div><div><pre><code>nano /etc/systemd/system/lighthousevalidator.service
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Paste this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>[Unit]
Description=Lighthouse Eth2 Client Validator Node
Wants=network-online.target
After=network-online.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
ExecStart=/usr/bin/lighthouse vc --network pyrmont --datadir /var/lib/lighthouse --graffiti "YOLO"

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a new service that will re-start if it fails.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>--network pyrmont</code>: we use the test network</li>
  <li><code>--graffiti</code>: an optional message you want to include in your validation blocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reload the daemons use</p>



<p>Start the validator daemon service.</p></div></article></div></div></div>

December 27, 2020 | http://extrawurst.github.io/gamedev/unity/programming/rust/2020/12/26/unity-flatbuffers.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://extrawurst.github.io/gamedev/unity/programming/rust/2020/12/26/unity-flatbuffers.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


<p>We recently switched from downloading and parsing JSON in our Unity client to a binary format based on Flatbuffers.
In this this article you are going to learn:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>why</em> we did that</li>
  <li><em>what</em> Flatbuffers is anyway</li>
  <li><em>how</em> you can do that yourself</li>
  <li>what <em>benefit</em> we gained</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>TL;DR</strong></p>

<p>You are looking to simplify your life integrating Flatbuffers in Unity? Look no further: <a href="https://github.com/gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity-docker">gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity</a></p>



<p>Our recent game <em>Wheelie Royale</em> (<a href="https://apps.apple.com/US/app/id1518264893">Appstore</a> / <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameroasters.wheelieroyale&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US">Playstore</a>) downloads a lot of replay data by other players. Replay data was transmitted in JSON format. In the most extreme cases up to 15mb of JSON for a single level.
While this is already a problem just because of mobile data usage it manifests even more severly in mid- to low-end devices when deserializing the JSON data.</p>

<p>After digging out my low-end test device (Galaxy S4) it took <a href="https://www.newtonsoft.com/json">Newtonsoft.JSON</a> <strong>20 sec</strong> to deserialize the 15mb. This is bad and for some players it even went up to a minute - an absolute dealbreaker.</p>

<p>Obviously we had to find a better method entirely.</p>



<blockquote>
  <p>FlatBuffers is an efficient cross platform serialization library (<a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/">Flatbuffers website</a>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Initially a Google internal project for game development it received some fame when Facebook announced massive performance gains by utilizing it on their mobile app (<a href="https://engineering.fb.com/2015/07/31/android/improving-facebook-s-performance-on-android-with-flatbuffers/">article</a>).</p>

<p>Using Flatbuffers gives us two main advantages:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Data is stored in binary form making it easy on the bandwidth</li>
  <li>Accessing Data is very fast since it is just a lookup from contiguous memory</li>
</ol>

<p>The following graphic visualizes this:</p>

<p><img src="http://extrawurst.github.io/assets/flatbuffers/fb.jpeg" alt="fb"></p>

<p>Flatbuffers store data in a <strong>contiguous</strong> chunk of memory making it also easy on the garbage collector that especially in our use case was trashed with a lot of small allocations.
If you mainly read your data from a buffer and do not need to alter it (our exact use case) it escentially reduces allocations to zero (reusing a static buffer).</p>

<p>Aside the compact memory layout Flatbuffers reduces the memory consumption by expecting both parties to know the schema. We later see how we generate code for client and backend to be able to speak the same <em>language</em>.</p>

<h2 id="comparison">Comparison</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Before</strong>: Deserializing 15mb of Json in <strong>20 secs</strong></li>
  <li><strong>After</strong>: Parsing the same data but using Flatbuffers (4mb) in <strong>0,5 sec</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>This is a speed improvement of <strong>40x</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: Of course this is not a proper scientific benchmarking method but it holds true even on our modern iPhones (albeit on a much smaller scale). I leave the more scientific methods of benchmarking to people smarter than me: 
<a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_benchmarks.html">benchmark</a></p>



<p>Here is a simplified version of our schema file. Keep in mind that we are dealing with playbacks (ghosts) of other players. Each ghost consists of a TON of deltas (Sample) that allow us to replay them.</p>

<pre><code>struct Sample {
  //...
  r: int16;
}

table GhostRecording {
  //...
  deltas: [Sample] (required);
}

table Ghost {
  //...
  recording: [GhostRecording] (required);
}

table Ghosts {
  //...
  items:[Ghost] (required);
}

root_type Ghosts;
</code></pre>

<p>Here you can see why our use case was particularly tough for the garbage collector in Unity since we are dealing with a lot of small individually allocated objects.</p>

<p>If you want to to more about the differences of <code>table</code> and <code>struct</code> you can find all details about the schema here: <a href="https://google.github.io/flatbuffers/flatbuffers_guide_writing_schema.html">Flatbuffers Schema</a></p>

<h2 id="code-generation">Code generation</h2>

<p>When it comes to the pipeline required to get this working I was disappointed at how little was available: no easy docker container to get <code>flatc</code> (the schema transpiler) working cross platform, no ready built .net library for Unity to get started.</p>

<p>So I built this and open sourced it on our company github: <a href="https://github.com/gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity-docker">gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity</a></p>

<p>Using this docker container it is easy to create your serialization/deserialization code using the following snippet:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>docker run <span>-it</span> <span>-v</span> <span>$(</span>shell <span>pwd</span><span>)</span>:/fb gameroasters/flatbuffers-unity:v1.12.0 /bin/bash <span>-c</span> <span>"cd /fb &amp;&amp; </span><span>\</span><span>
	flatc -n --gen-onefile schema.fbs &amp;&amp; </span><span>\</span><span>
	flatc -r --gen-onefile schema.fbs"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will mount your current working directory into the container, it is expecting to find a <code>schema.fbs</code> file in here and generate the necessary code for <em>Rust</em> and <em>CSharp</em> for you in two files called <code>schema.rs</code> and <code>schema.cs</code>.</p>



<p>Flatbuffers is not going to make your code more readable. Here is an example how we read in our ghosts from it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>var</span> <span>fb_ghosts</span> <span>=</span> <span>GR</span><span>.</span><span>WR</span><span>.</span><span>Schema</span><span>.</span><span>Ghosts</span><span>.</span><span>GetRootAsGhosts</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>ByteBuffer</span><span>(</span><span>data</span><span>));</span>

<span>var</span> <span>res</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Ghost</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>fb_ghosts</span><span>.</span><span>ItemsLength</span><span>);</span>
<span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>var</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>fb_ghosts</span><span>.</span><span>ItemsLength</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>e</span> <span>=</span> <span>fb_ghosts</span><span>.</span><span>Items</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>);</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(!</span><span>e</span><span>.</span><span>HasValue</span><span>)</span> <span>continue</span><span>;</span>
    <span>var</span> <span>recording</span> <span>=</span> <span>e</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>.</span><span>Recording</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>;</span>

    <span>var</span> <span>deltas</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>List</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Sample</span><span>&gt;(</span><span>recording</span><span>.</span><span>DeltasLength</span><span>);</span>

    <span>{</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>delta</span> <span>=</span> <span>recording</span><span>.</span><span>Deltas</span><span>(</span><span>j</span><span>);</span>
        <span>var</span> <span>r</span> <span>=</span> <span>delta</span><span>.</span><span>Value</span><span>.</span><span>R</span><span>;</span>
        <span>deltas</span><span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Sample</span><span>(</span><span>r</span><span>));</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>var</span> <span>ghost</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Ghost</span><span>();</span>
    <span>ghost</span><span>.</span><span>recording</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>GhostRecording</span><span>();</span> 
    <span>ghost</span><span>.</span><span>recording</span><span>.</span><span>deltas</span> <span>=</span> <span>deltas</span><span>;</span>
  
    <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>Add</span><span>(</span><span>ghost</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unlike some alternatives to Flatbuffers it does not create the Plain-Old-Data (POD) objects for you and deserialize into those. But that is by design. You could actually go without them when you only need to access it for reading.</p>

<p>We only create those to keep the code compatible with the previous approach that deserialized JSON into POD objects.</p>



<p>Of course there are alternatives that I do not want to hide:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers">protobuf</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/capnproto/capnproto">cap’n’proto</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here is a very nice comparison matrix: https://capnproto.org/news/2014-06-17-capnproto-flatbuffers-sbe.html</p>

<p>The main benefit for <strong>protobuf</strong> is that it does the extra step of creating POD objects for you bringing it even closer to what you are used to in regular JSON deserialization. It is a good tradeoff between speed (Flatbuffers) and convenience (JSON). Another nice thing is: protobuf also speaks JSON which simplifies debugging a lot.</p>

<p>The other alternative - <strong>cap’n’proto</strong> - is actually made by the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/25370932/1397367">same guy</a> who made protobuf and uses the same zero-allocation approach Flatbuffers uses. <strong>cap’n’proto</strong> does not support as many languages yet - thats the only reason I did not consider giving it a try (yet).</p>

<p>Ultimately there is no <em>best</em> solution, everything comes at a cost. If you need raw speed there is not much more you can get compared to Flatbuffers.</p>

<p>In this series we’re going to delve a bit into stack based virtual machines. First we’re going to see an overview, then we’ll build our own toy VM. Next, we’re going to see how what we’ll build maps to a real CPU. Finally, we’ll discuss the most famous of all: the JVM.</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>What’s a <em>stack based virtual machine</em> then? It’s an abstraction of a computer, that emulates a real machine. Generally it is built as an interpreter of a special <em>bytecode</em>, that translates its in real time for execution on the CPU.</p>

<p>Let’s start with a trivial example: suppose your program needs to add two numbers. To do that in a stack VM, the program will <em>push</em> the first number to the stack, <em>push</em> the second and then execute some form of the special instruction <em>add</em>, that will <em>pop</em> the first two elements of the stack and replace them with their sum. Let’s see it step by step:</p>

<p><img src="https://andreabergia.com/images/2015/03/Stack_1.png" alt="At the beginning"></p>

<p>The <code>SP</code> is the <em>stack pointer</em>, which refers to the head of the stack. The <code>IP</code> is the <em>instruction pointer</em>, which points to the address of the current instruction to execute. Let’s now execute the first instruction:</p>

<p><img src="https://andreabergia.com/images/2015/03/Stack_2.png" alt="After the first instruction"></p>

<p>You can see that the stack now contains <code>1</code> and that the instruction pointer has been moved to the next instruction. Let’s now simulate the second instruction:</p>

<p><img src="https://andreabergia.com/images/2015/03/Stack_3.png" alt="After the second instruction"></p>

<p>Finally we can execute the <code>add</code> instruction:</p>

<p><img src="https://andreabergia.com/images/2015/03/Stack_4.png" alt="After the add"></p>

<p>The head of the stack and the previous element have been popped and replaced with their sum.</p>

<h3 id="centrality-of-the-stack">Centrality of the stack</h3>

<p>As you have seen from the example, the main two data structures for a stack VM are the code listing, with the instruction pointer, and the stack data, which is accessed only via the stack pointer. While these two data structures seem trivial, they are more than enough to implement a lot of complex programs. By adding some external memory area (what is generally known as “memory on the heap”), this structure will become complex enough to form the basis of a real language such as Java or Scala.</p>

<p>The stack will be the central structure. From what we hve seen above you should have some idea on how to use it to implement the basic arithmetic, but it is also going to be the basis of implementing loops and conditional execution (if) and even function calls! We’re going to discuss all of this while building our toy VM.</p>

<h3 id="register-based-virtual-machines">Register based virtual machines</h3>

<p>Closely related to stack based VM are <em>register based virtual machines</em>. They are also interpreters of bytecode, but their design is quite different, since they don’t use the stack for the operands but rather a set of registers. While they tend to be more complex, they are also generally faster at runtime, since they map much more closely to the CPU (which, as we’ll see later, is actually an hardware register machine) and thus they tend to generate and execute better efficient code.</p>

<p>However stack based virtual machines are not just a learning toy. The most successful VM ever, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine">Java Virtual Machine</a>, is a stack-based virtual machine (and so is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Language_Runtime">CLR</a>, the basis of .NET). Furthermore the JVM is <em>extremely</em> high performant, while still quite simple - although that has been achieved more by the <em>immense</em> amount of money that has flown into its development than by some special characteristic of its architecture.</p>

<p>The most famous example of a register based virtual machine is probably <a href="http://www.lua.org/">LUA</a>, which can achieve <a href="http://luajit.org/performance.html">amazing performances</a> and is used in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Lua-scripted_video_games">many videogames</a> as a scripting language.</p>

<p>A quick google search on “Why functional programming” or “why functional programming matters” will yield quite insightful results. Having that said, I still believe there is more to add to this topic. And what would be my answer to these questions? One word: <strong>purity</strong> (or Statelessness). 
Before delving into purity let’s dissect the <strong>function</strong> in the functional programming paradigm.</p>



<p>Many years ago, when I first heard the term functional programming, I was very confused. I said, “Hey, I have been using C, we already have functions there. JavaScript also has functions, as many OOP languages
have functions disguised as methods of the objects. So why is this new term?”</p>

<p>Well, my first mistake was functional programming wasn’t really a new term. The conceptual origin of functional programming
<strong>lambda calculus</strong> is developed as early as 1930 by Alonzo Church and the first functional programming language LISP was available by the late ’50s. So functional programming wasn’t
something new at all. My second mistake was the confusion of the term “functional”. The word function here does not represent the procedures which we call functions in the programming languages but rather it refers to the mathematical functions just like Sine and Cosine. And it is <strong>purity</strong> that makes these mathematical functions different than the functions in those imperative programming languages. That is, for a pure function, given the same input that function will always yield the same output without any side effects.</p>

<p>For example, sin(90) will always yield 1 as a result, no matter when or how many times you call. Such function calls also have no side effects, that is, pure function calls will not alter anything you care about.</p>

<p>On the contrary, imperative programming languages will not constrain your functions to be pure.</p>

<p>There is a common argument associated with the functional programming paradigm, that it is mostly applicable for mathematics and science or finance, but how about the real-world line of business applications? In fact, the line of business applications is precisely where functional programming shines. But before claiming functional programming is the holy grail let’s review some misconceptions about functional programming.</p>

<h2 id="misconceptions-about-functional-programming">Misconceptions about functional programming</h2>

<p>When we ask developers, what are the characteristics of good code or a good programming language, it is likely you would hear the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Good code is more maintainable.</li>
  <li>Good code leads to better readability.</li>
  <li>Good code tends to be shorter and concise.</li>
  <li>Good code is testable and dependencies are isolatable.</li>
  <li>Good code is extendable.</li>
  <li>Good code is less buggy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Functional programming is not some sort of code nor it is a language but a paradigm. You could probably go with functional programming by using any language. However, some languages embrace it as a first-class citizen (or even dictate it) whereas some languages tend to be challenging or they become too verbose to go with functional programming. Thus above items about the good code
are not really relevant to the functional programming paradigm. I would like to emphasize once more the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functional programming <strong>does not</strong> necessarily lead to more maintainable code nor does it aim that.</li>
  <li>The code written with functional programming languages <strong>are not</strong> necessarily more readable.</li>
  <li>The practice of functional programming can also turn the code into spaghetti if one is not careful.</li>
</ul>

<p>Wow, if functional programming doesn’t give me those aspects I care about in my code, then why should I use it all?</p>

<h2 id="why-should-i-care-about-functional-programming">Why should I care about functional programming?</h2>

<p>We have discussed functional programming does not necessarily lead to better code. So why bother? The answer is, functional programming keeps the developer sane and you will sleep better!
Let’s see how with an example. Suppose that we have a Car class with a public property Color and two public methods Run() and Stop(). The Run method does whatever internally necessary to run the car.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2020-12-26-Functional-Programming/class-diagram.png" alt="Car"></p>

<p>Now we do:</p>
<pre><code>var car = new Car();
car.Run();
... //do other things.
SomeOtherFunction(car);
//Did SomeOtherFunction stopped the car? I don't know I have to track it.
... //other things

SomeOtherFunction(Car car){
  //hmm have I run the car before? I have to track it.
  car.Run();
  //now I have how to run the car perhaps more than one time. What's gonna happen?
}
</code></pre>

<p>We have 3 problems here:</p>

<p>1- As the author of SomeOtherfunction how will I know if the Run method was called before? I need to look up the caller’s code thus it’s an <strong>extra burden</strong> to the developer to find it out. 
One might argue, we could add an IsRunning property, however, nothing forces me at compile time to check that. I could easily forget doing such a check. And not always
such properties and methods are related. So I am <strong>burden</strong>ed with reviewing the caller’s code. Worse, in case <strong>SomeOtherFunction</strong> is a public surface for my API, I have to be extra careful. I have to resort to defensive programming, document my API, clearly describe the expected input state, and pray for the caller to read the docs.</p>

<p>2- What happens if I call Run twice. Will it throw an exception? Will it ignore? The only way to find out is either read the relevant API for the Car class or read the source. 
Hence we have another <strong>burden</strong> here.</p>

<p>3- After SomeOtherFunction returns how do I know if the car is stopped or not.  Again we have to read the docs or the source for the SomeOtherFunction and yet another <strong>burden</strong> here.</p>

<p>So you can observe such a simple code brings a lot of responsibility to the developer that he has to track and remember the state at various stages of the coding process. 
It could be easy to remember for one object but if you have lots of objects circulating deep into the code, it may drive you nuts.</p>

<p>How do we solve this problem? Well, the problem is about <strong>state tracking</strong> and if we didn’t have the state in the first place, we wouldn’t have that problem.</p>

<h2 id="the-functional-solution">The functional solution</h2>

<p>So we want to get rid of the state. Perhaps a way to do so is to represent the state by using the types. So instead of a single Car type, we could utilize two different types: <strong>StoppedCar</strong> and a <strong>RunningCar</strong>. Then we have a <strong>run</strong> function that is taking a <strong>StoppedCar</strong> and returning a <strong>RunningCar</strong>:</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2020-12-26-Functional-Programming/run.png" alt="Run-function"></p>

<p>Once we define such a run function, we solve all three problems. First, we always know that if the car is running:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>SomeOtherFunction</span><span>(</span><span>RunningCar</span> <span>car</span><span>){</span>
 <span>//we know for sure the car is running</span>
 <span>//you cannot call run again since the code won't compile</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And obviously, we cannot call the run function again since the code won’t compile. And depending on the return type the caller will know what state has been returned.
Now as developers, we have fewer things to track, fewer things to worry about. Now life is so easy! Or is it?</p>

<h2 id="if-functional-programming-is-so-good-why-it-is-not-popular">If functional programming is so good why it is not popular?</h2>

<p>Well, the first thing to acknowledge is functional programming is not about syntax. It’s a paradigm. For example, recently C# 9 has attained the record syntax, a record is a functional concept
and if you are not familiar with the functional paradigm, you might be confused about why we need records in the first place. You will only see unconvincing answers like records are good because they are immutable (the real answer is they provide value semantics and referential transparency, thus we don’t care about the memory location, whereas immutability is only a vehicle to achieve these).</p>

<p>What I am trying to say is to get started with functional programming, you have to forget about most things you already know about imperative programming. 
So it is literally baby steps again and it would take quite a while to master it. And that is one of the major reasons people shy away from functional programming.</p>

<p>In the imperative world we have statements that tell the compiler what to do:</p>

<ul>
  <li>do this;</li>
  <li>do that;</li>
</ul>

<p>Whereas functional programming is more like movie frames. Each frame is immutable and unchangeable but if we roll 24 frames per second. It creates the illusion of a movie.</p>

<p><img src="https://onurgumus.github.io/assets/posts/2020-12-26-Functional-Programming/frames.png" alt="frames"></p>

<p>Functional programming does the same. We never change the data but every time we need a change things we create a new instance of that type. And obviously, that’s a lot of CPU cycles and memory allocation compared to the imperative approach and 30 years ago that really mattered. 30 years ago, your colleagues would say, “Whoa! Are you allocating 200 bytes just to change the status of a car?” But these days, it is <strong>engineers are expensive and servers are not</strong>. Now, your users are unlikely to notice a few hundred nanoseconds delay. But you could utilize the hardware power for the sake of programmer productivity. Thanks to immutability, functional paradigm even scales better when you have a  distributed and/or multi-threaded environment. But these historical problems regarding the resource consumption associated with functional programming allowed the imperative paradigm to flourish whereas people remained skeptical with the functional programming.</p>

<p>Having a smaller community leads to fewer examples, fewer resources, less tooling. You can find a lot of articles, books talking about, Functional programming, but try to find a functional sample application for something a simple to-do list that persists the data to the database. You will be mostly out of luck. You might try to fallback trying to use your old tools like ORMs. But then you will be frustrated and ask yourself why to bother with the functional way at all. Indeed, CQRS with event sourcing is perhaps one of the correct ways to persist the data in functional programming, instead of ORMS. Aaaand you have another thing to learn!</p>

<p>Combined with the relearning process described, functional programmers are a minority among the developer community. Having that said, today’s challenges require complicated solutions, and solutions like reactive programming are going more and more popular. Probably one of the most famous and demanded javascript libraries is React. React is …</p></section></div></div></div>

This is because blockchains and blockchain-inspired distributed ledger technologies are built on a single, common, ledger, which is distributed either in a permissionless or permissioned manner. The permissionless distribution exposes a lot of information about the network participants, but in combination with proof-of-work verification makes it very difficult for an adversary to attack and overtake the network and e.g. change the inflation rate.</p><p>Permissioned network with no proof-of-work or similar consensus algorithm not only doesn’t provide the immutability feature but by having a single permissioned ledger gives potential control to those who grant the network privileges. As a result, the central bank as the ultimate permission issuer would have much stronger control over the monetary system and payment network than they have right now. This gives the central banks three very dangerous capabilities.</p><h2>Helicopter Money</h2><p>The reason why we’ve seen such an elevated business cycle over the past century is the central banking fiat money system. Unnatural expansion of the money supply causes booms, which are unsustainable and markets try to clear them when they are exposed as such.</p><p>Economists of the Austrian school understand, that the boom is the real problem and the economic crisis is the necessary and positive cleansing mechanism. Unfortunately, the (neo)Keynesian response to such an event is to prop the markets up by further monetary interventions.</p><p>However, the current design of the banking system requires the intermediary role of commercial banks in issuing credit to businesses. Central banks get frustrated when the commercial banks exercise caution in an economy, which hasn’t fully cleared the previous misallocations and hasn’t brought prices of capital goods to more sustainable levels.</p><p>Furthermore, since the predominant Keynesian narrative is that spending drives the economy (hint: it doesn’t - capital investments do), the central banks would like to spur more consumer spending by issuing money supply directly to consumers. Needless to say, commercial banks’ cautious approach to consumer credit in a period of growing unemployment doesn’t align well with the central bank’s goals either. During the COVID crisis, the governments managed to an extent to get around these hurdles by issuing benefits en masse, but those are complicated by logistics, bureaucracy, or legislation.</p><p>By closer integration of the monetary spigot to the end consumers and businesses, the central bank can much more easily issue credit, or just outright cashouts to the private individuals and commercial entities by simply “airdropping” new tokens to the existing token identities. They would not even compromise their stated intention of keeping the commercial banks in the picture - those would still serve as custodians of the token keys, and even have the ability to issue credit along the traditional lines.</p><p>This would lead to disastrous consequences. Economies get easily addicted to central banks’ money dope. With every new crisis, the chief monetarists had to increase intervention doses the same way as junkies have to do with their drug of choice. As with every addiction, the longer it lasts and the stronger it grows, the more difficult it is to cure it. And while monetary overdose such as we’ve seen in Zimbabwe or Venezuela might not come for a long time, if ever, junkies don’t perform well, as Japan’s three lost decades of BOJ’s interventions have demonstrated.</p><h2>Negative Interest Rates</h2><p>Hoarding is evil - or so the modern monetarists’ narrative goes. In the Keynesian framework, there is no space for the function of cash as a hedge in times of uncertainty. Savings accounts, in their minds, are just money that doesn’t work in spurring the miracles of spending- and monetary-driven economic growth. Negative interest rates are then potentially the most effective method of preventing hoarding by incentivizing account holders to spend their depreciating balances.</p><p>Currently, the central banks have to rely on commercial banks to pass the negative interest rates on their customers. Commercial banks instead are trying to convince the account holders to move their deposits from negative yielding accounts to interest yielding products and are consuming the negative rates on most of the outstanding cash balances.</p><p>With the central bank tokens being tied more tightly with their issuance authority, it would be much easier for the monetary interventionists to impose negative interest rates on all tokens in circulation. This would on a margin certainly increase the consumers’ and businesses’ propensity to spend and would also drive asset prices up as people would try to offload their cash savings. But to think of it as something beneficial is foolish. It was massive spending, record-low savings, and unsustainable asset valuations that led to the credit bubbles and crises of the past decades. To think that more of the same recipe would lead to a different, let alone better outcome is ludicrous.</p><h2>Financial Surveillance</h2><p>Third and final major implication of cash tokenization is the potential it creates for financial surveillance. The central banks are ostensibly introducing digital tokens to protect people’s privacy in the face of those reducing their anonymous cash usage. But the idea that any branch of government, let alone the one that imposes KYC/AML rules on the existing crypto token platforms, limits physical cash use to prevent tax avoidance, and uses financial surveillance to catch non-violent “criminals” cares about our privacy is laughable.</p><p>They’re not even hiding the fact, that tokenization of money would allow them to run what they call “data analytics”, but to think that they would not make the leap from aggregate analytics to individual data processing would be naive.</p><p>Of course, it’s not a coincidence, that China is the global leader in CBDCs. The surveillance potential of centralized tokenization is extremely attractive to the government that tries to keep tabs on every aspect of the lives of their underlings.</p><p>The proponents of the central banking tokens argue, that consumers need to be protected against targeted attacks on a country’s payment network. While such a risk exists - for example, if a country like Switzerland tried to provide anonymity for foreign depositors as it used to and as a result Visa and Mastercard would be pressured to shut down their payment networks for the country - if it materializes, the economy can always temporarily revert back to cash, supported by a vast network of local ATMs and bank branches.</p><p>If anything, the biggest attacks on the monetary exchange in the western world came from the governments themselves suspending or limiting cash withdrawals in times of liquidity crises as was the case in Cyprus or Greece, not to mention that those crises themselves were caused by central banking credit bubbles of the preceding periods.</p><p>Finally as was already mentioned, the argument about the protection of consumer privacy doesn’t pass the laugh test considering the history of continuous erosion of financial privacy by central banks and financial regulators.</p><p>In conclusion, the same characteristics for which people should oppose the transition to CDBCs give central banks the strongest reason to champion and implement them. And while the pretense of an investigation into the fiat money tokenization gives an impression of a debate on the topic, the reality is, there will be no debate and the digital currencies will go through and give central banks more control than they had before with all the disastrous consequences such control brings.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Having built a working example of <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2020/10/01/multi-tenant-node-red/" data-type="post" data-id="3981">Multi Tenant Node-RED </a>using Docker I thought I’d have a look at how to do the same with Kubernetes as a Christmas project.</p>



<p>I started with installing the 64bit build of Ubuntu Server on a fresh Pi4 with 8gb RAM and then using snapd to install <a href="https://microk8s.io/">microk8s</a>. I had initially wanted to use the 64bit version of Raspberry Pi OS, but despite microk8s <a href="https://microk8s.io/docs">claiming</a> to work on any OS that support snapd, I found that containerd just kept crashing on Raspberry Pi OS.</p>



<p>Once installed I enabled the dns and ingress plugins, this got me a minimal viable single node Kubernetes setup working. <br></p>

<p>I also had to stand up a private docker registry to hold the containers I’ll be using. That was just a case of running <code>docker run -d -p 5000:5000 --name registry registry</code> on a local machine e.g <code>private.example.com</code> . This also means adding the URL for this to microk8s as described <a href="https://microk8s.io/docs/registry-private">here</a>.</p>



<p>Since Kubernetes is another container environment I can reuse most of the parts I previously created. The only bit that really needs to change is the Manager application as this has to interact with the environment to stand up and tear down containers.</p>



<h2>Architecture</h2>



<p>As before the central components are a MongoDB database and a management web app that stands up and tears down instances. The MongoDB instance holds all the flows and authentication details for each instance. I’ve deployed the database and web app as a single pod and exposed them both as services</p>

</pre>


<p>This Deployment descriptor basically does all the heavy lifting. It sets up the mangment app, MongoDB and the private NPM registry.</p>



<p>It also binds 2 sets of secrets, the first holds holds the authentication details to interact with the Kubernetes API (the <code>~/.kube/config</code> file) and the <code>settings.js</code> for the management app. The second is the config for the Veraccio NPM registry.</p>



<p>I’m using the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#hostpath">HostPath</a> volume provider to store the MongoDB and the Veraccio registry on the filesystem of the Pi, but for a production deployment I’d probably use the NFS provider or a Cloud Storage option like AWS S3.</p>



<h2>Manager</h2>



<p>This is mainly the same as the <a href="https://github.com/hardillb/multi-tenant-node-red-manager">docker version</a>, but I had to swap out <a href="https://npmjs.com/package/dockerode">dockerode</a> for <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/kubernetes-client">kubernetes-client</a>.</p>



<p>This library exposes the full kubernetes API allowing the creation/modification/destructions of all entities.</p>



<p>Standing up a new instance is a little more complicated as it’s now a multi step process.</p>



<ol><li>Create a Pod with the custom-node-red container</li><li>Create a Service based on that pod</li><li>Expose that service via the Ingress addon</li></ol>

<p>I also removed the Start/Stop buttons since stopping pods is not really a thing in Kubernetes.</p>



<p>All the code for this version of the app is on github <a href="https://github.com/hardillb/multi-tenant-node-red-k8s-manager">here</a>.</p>



<h2>Catalogue</h2>



<p>In the Docker-Compose version the custom node `catalogue.json` file is hosted by the management application and had to be manually updated each time a new or updated node was push to the repository. For this version I’ve stood up a separate container.</p>



<p>This container runs a small web app that has 2 endpoints.</p>



<ul><li><code>/catalogue.json</code> – which returns the current version of the catalogue</li><li><code>/update</code> – which is triggered by the the notify function of the Verdaccio private npm registry</li></ul>



<p>The registry has this snippet added to the end of the <code>config.yml</code></p>


<pre title="">notify:
  method: POST
  headers: [{'Content-Type': 'application/json'}]
  endpoint: http://catalogue/update
  content: '{"name": "{{name}}", "versions": "{{versions}}", "dist-tags": "{{dist-tags}}"}'
</pre>


<p>The code for this container can be found <a href="https://github.com/hardillb/node-red-private-catalogue-builder">here</a>. </p>



<h2>Deploying</h2>



<p>First clone the project from github</p>


<pre title="">$ github clone https://github.com/hardillb/multi-tenant-node-red-k8s.git
</pre>


<p>Then run the <code>setup.sh</code> script, passing in the base domain for instances and the host:port combination for the local container registry.</p>


<pre title="">$ ./setup.sh example.com private.example.com:5000
</pre>


<p>This will update some of the container locations in the deployment and build the secrets needed to access the Kubernetes API (reads the content of <code>~/.kube/config</code>)</p>



<p>With all the configuration files updated the containers need building and pushing to the local container registry.</p>


<pre title="">$ docker build ./manager -t private.example.com:5000/k8s-manager
$ docker push private.example.com:5000/k8s-manager
$ docker build ./catalogue -t private.example.com:5000/catalogue
$ docker push private.example.com:5000/catalogue
$ docker build ./custom-node-red -t private.example.com:5000/custom-node-red
$ docker push private.example.com:5000/custom-node-red
</pre>


<p>Finally trigger the actual deployment with <code>kubectl</code></p>


<pre title="">$ kubectl apply -f ./deployment
</pre>


<p>Once up and running the management app should be available on <code>http://manager.example.com</code>, the private npm registry on <code>http://registry.example.com</code> and an instance called “r1” would be on <code>http://r1.example.com</code>.</p>



<p>A wildcard DNS entry needs to be setup to point all <code>*.example.com</code> hosts to the Kubernetes clusters Ingress IP addresses.</p>



<p>As usual the whole solution can be found on github <a href="https://github.com/hardillb/multi-tenant-node-red-k8s">here</a>.</p>



<h2>What’s Next</h2>



<p>I need to work out how to set up Avahi CNAME entries for each deployment as I had working with both <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2020/09/22/nginx-proxy-avahi-helper/" data-type="post" data-id="4040">nginx</a> and <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/2020/10/05/traefik-avahi-helper/" data-type="post" data-id="4107">traefik</a> so I can run it all nicely on my LAN without having to mess with <code>/etc/hosts</code> or the local DNS. This should be possible by using a <code>watch</code> call one the Kubernetes Ingress endpoint.</p>



<p>I also need to back port the new catalogue handling to the docker-compose version.</p>



<p>And finally I want to have a look at generating a Helm chart for all this to help get rid of needing the <code>setup.sh</code> script to modify the deployment YAML files.</p>



<p>p.s. If anybody is looking for somebody to do this sort of thing for them drop me a <a href="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/about/curriculum-vitae/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.hardill.me.uk/wordpress/about/curriculum-vitae/">line</a>.</p>

                <div>
                    <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>DDC/CI is a protocol for controlling monitor features like brightness, contrast, color temperature, input source, ... over the display cable (VGA, DVI, HDMI, Display port, ...).</p>
<p>It's a quite old protocol that is well supported across many different devices.</p>
<p>I'm currently using it to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adjust brightness of my two monitors depending on how the room is lighted</li>
<li>Switch monitor inputs between the VM-dedicated graphics card and the host graphics card, replacing the need of a very expensive KVM switch that can WQHD @144Hz.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="requiredpackages">Required packages</h2>
<p>You must install <code>ddcutil</code> package. The <a href="http://www.ddcutil.com/">official website</a> contains extensive information for troubleshooting.</p>
<h2 id="kernelmodules">Kernel modules</h2>
<p>Ddcutil connects to your screen over an I2C connection, and requires the <code>i2c-dev</code> kernel module to be loaded.</p>
<p>You can load the module at runtime using <code>sudo modprobe i2c-dev</code>.</p>
<p>To make it persistent across reboots, you need to add the module to <code>/etc/modules-load.d/i2c-dev.conf</code>:</p>
<pre><code>i2c-dev
</code></pre>
<p>Once the module is loaded, you should see some files in <code>/dev/i2c-*</code>.</p>
<h2 id="allowtheusertouseddc">Allow the user to use DDC</h2>
<p>By default the i2c dev files are owned by root, and can't be used by other users. One solution to allow your user to control DDC without using sudo is to add a custom udev rule:</p>
<p><code>/etc/udev/rules.d/45-ddcutil-i2c.rules</code></p>
<pre><code>KERNEL=="i2c-[0-9]*", GROUP="your-user", MODE="0660", PROGRAM="/usr/bin/ddcutil --bus=%n getvcp 0x10"
</code></pre>
<p>This rule automatically detects which i2c devices are DDC-capable, and allows members of the group "your-user" to control the file.</p>
<p>You can reload udev rules without rebooting by executing <code>sudo udevadm trigger</code></p>
<p>If you have multiple users, you can create a new group and add your user to the group:</p>
<pre><code>groupadd ddc
usermod -aG ddc $USER
</code></pre>
<h2 id="identifyyourmonitorinfo">Identify your monitor info</h2>
<h3 id="howtoaddressyourmonitor">How to address your monitor</h3>
<p>There are multiple ways to address your monitor, like display number (<code>--display</code>), model name (<code>--model</code>), serial number (<code>--sn</code>), i2c bus ID (<code>--bus</code>).</p>
<p>The bus ID method is way faster than the others, but may be unreliable if your hardware changes often.</p>

            <p>The language has been literally 'evolving' since the version
that many of us have begun (maybe since the initial day, if you
are Guido). I'm not talking about any features in specific,
but rather the whole language. If you compare a code fragment
that you wrote 5 years ago, with the 'refactored' version that
you would write if it were today the difference is obvious. </p>
<p>We've seen a lot of new syntax popping into our lives, in just the
last 5 years (starting from 3.5):</p>

<p>This huge list contains some of the (major~) changes that have been implemented since 3.5, there
are also quite a few minor ones (like <code>_</code> separator for numbers, <code>1_000_00</code> or <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0530/">PEP 530</a>
for async comprehensions or even a new one for 3.9 to extend the decorator syntax, <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0614/">PEP 614</a>.)</p>
<p>Well, since we all refreshed our memories, let's try to imagine a world where these features don't exist. Imagine
not having access to f-strings, writing weird stuff to deal with your coroutines, or repeating yourself 2 times whenever
you want to read chunks from a file, writing utility functions to merge 2 mappings and more awful cases. Except for maybe
PEP 465 (I never needed it, probably because I don't do scientific programming. But from what I saw by looking at the examples
in the PEP, it is quite good for people who work with data on a daily basis.) every feature in that list literally changed and
actively affected how I write my Python code, right now.</p>
<p>Seems like syntactical additions sounds great, why don't we add everything to the language? Let's start with
adding regex literals, and then move forward to call pipeline operator, blah blah blah. If you are subscribed
to the Python-ideas, then get ready to see tons of different, redundant new syntax proposals (even I, probably
proposed a couple of very obscure and stupid ideas in the past). Though this brings me back to the point of,
whether we should stop the syntactical growth at all or not. </p>
<p>In the last 6 month, 3 different major syntax changes were proposed. I guess everyone is somewhat familiar
with the pattern matching PEPs, PEP 622 (PEP 634, PEP 635, PEP 636). Also, there is PEP 637 for allowing keyword arguments
on the subscript syntax <code>[x=y, z=q]</code> and PEP 638, for syntactic macros. I am not going to criticize any of these PEPs, but
I'd like to ask you to think about them. Think of how they could affect you in 5 years. Think about whether your
coding styles would change because of them, think about how good fit they are to the language, and most importantly think about
whether you 'ACTUALLY' need them. Is there any 'ESSENTIAL' case that would be much better when you pass keyword arguments through
slices instead of just making a call to some sort of <code>get()</code> function? Or can't we have syntactical customization without having an
official definition of it? Does the syntax for 'patterns' (described by PEP 634) is a good fit for the Python language?</p>
<p>There are a lot of blog posts, <a href="https://discuss.python.org/t/gauging-sentiment-on-pattern-matching/5770">poll</a>s and maybe
hundreds of emails out there related to these proposals. I won't expect anyone to read them all, but if you want to get a 
general idea just check some of them out.</p>
<p>Have to say that, I'm extremely overwhelmed by seeing this amount of change proposals every day, in various
places. No one is forcing me to read them, though it is just a burden that I am intentionally or unintentionally taking to see what are people looking for in the language that I (myself) probably will be stuck
with for the next decade. Trying to comprehend what people are aiming with making language so complex with
growing the syntax more and more every day.</p>
<p>Don't forget that adding syntax is much more serious than adding a functionality to the runtime. That syntax
will be the face of the language, and you won't be able to alter it even a little bit. We all saw what happened
when the syntax was changed in a backwards-incompatible manner, and no one wants to go through that again. This
is why I am just asking you to think about whether do you believe these would be good fits for the language, whether
they will worth to their imponderable cost. </p>
<p>This is just me, throwing a bunch of questions into the void. If you want to talk more about these, feel free to
send me an email (batuhan [at] python [dot] org) or reach me through twitter (open DM for all, @isidentical).</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the course of the last year and a half, I’ve been doing some self-directed
learning on how radios work. I’ve gone from a very basic understanding of
wireless communications (there’s usually some sort of antenna, I guess?) all
the way through the process of learning about and implementing a set of
libraries to modulate and demodulate data using my now formidable stash of SDRs.
I’ve been implementing all of the RF processing code from first principals and
purely based on other primitives I’ve written myself to prove to myself that I
understand each concept before moving on.</p><p>I figured that there was a fun “capstone” to be done here - the blind reverse
engineering and implementation of the protocol my cheep Amazon power switch
uses to turn on and off my Christmas Tree. All the work described in this post
was done over the course of a few hours thanks to help during the demodulation
from <a href="https://github.com/tomberek/">Tom Bereknyei</a> and
<a href="https://blog.setec.io/">hlieberman</a>.</p><p>When I first got my switch, I checked it for any FCC markings in order to look
up the FCC filings to determine the operational frequency of the device, and
maybe some other information such as declared modulation or maybe even part
numbers and/or diagrams. However, beyond a few regulatory stickers, there were
no FCC ids or other distinguishing IDs on the device. Worse yet, it appeared to
be a whitelabeled version of another product, so searching Google for the
product name was very unhelpful.</p><p>Since operation of this device is unlicensed, I figured I’d start looking in
the ISM band. The most common band used that I’ve seen is the band starting
at <code>433.05MHz</code> up to <code>434.79MHz</code>. I fired up my trusty waterfall tuned to a
center frequency of <code>433.92MHz</code> (since it’s right in the middle of the band, and
it let me see far enough up and down the band to spot the remote) and pressed
a few buttons. Imagine my surprise when I realize the operational frequency of
this device is <code>433.920MHz</code>, exactly dead center. Weird, but lucky!</p><p><img src="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/waterfall.gif" alt=""></p><p>After taking a capture, I started to look at understanding what the modulation
type of the signal was, and how I may go about demodulating it.
Using <a href="https://github.com/miek/inspectrum">inspectrum</a>, I was able to clearly
see the signal in the capture, and it immediately stuck out to my eye to be
encoded using OOK / ASK.</p><p><img src="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/ook.png" alt=""></p><p>Next, I started to measure the smallest pulse, and see if I could infer the
symbols per second, and try to decode it by hand. These types of signals are
generally pretty easy to decode by eye.</p><p><a href="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/inspectrum-christmas-lights-4-bit.png"><img src="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/inspectrum-christmas-lights-4-strip.png" alt=""></a></p><p>This wound up giving me symbol rate of 2.2 Ksym/s, which is a lot faster than I
expected. While I was working by hand, <a href="https://github.com/tomberek/">Tom</a>
demodulated a few messages in Python, and noticed that if you grouped the bits
into groups of 4, you either had a <code>1000</code> or a <code>1110</code> – which caused me to
realize this was encoded using something I saw documented elsewhere, where the
0 is a “short” pulse, and a 1 is a “long” pulse, not unlike morse code, but
where each symbol takes up a fixed length of time (monospace morse code?).
Working on that assumption, I changed my inspectrum symbol width, and
demodulated a few more by hand. This wound up demodulating nicely (and the
preamble / clock sync could be represented as repeating <code>0</code>s, which is handy!)
and gave us a symbol rate of 612(ish) symbols per second – a lot closer to
what I was expecting.</p><p><a href="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/inspectrum-christmas-lights.png"><img src="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/inspectrum-christmas-lights-strip.png" alt=""></a></p><p>If we take the code for ‘on’ in the inspectrum capture above and demodulate
it by hand, we get <code>0000000000110101100100010</code> (treat a short pulse as a 0, and
a long pulse as a 1). If you’re interested in following along at home, click on
the inspectrum image, and write down the bits you see, and compare it to what
I have!</p><p>Right, so it looks like from what we can tell so far that the packet looks
something like this:</p><p>Next, I took a capture of all the button presses and demodulated them by hand,
and put them into a table to try and understand the format of the messages:</p><table><thead><tr><td>Button</td><td>Demod'd Bits</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>On</td><td>0000000000110101100100010</td></tr><tr><td>Off</td><td>00000000001101011001010000</td></tr><tr><td>Dim Up</td><td>0000000000110101100110100</td></tr><tr><td>Dim Down</td><td>0000000000110101100100100</td></tr><tr><td>Timer 1h</td><td>0000000000110101100110010</td></tr><tr><td>Timer 2h</td><td>0000000000110101100100110</td></tr><tr><td>Timer 4h</td><td>0000000000110101100100000</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 100%</td><td>0000000000110101000101010</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 75%</td><td>00000000001101010001001100</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 50%</td><td>00000000001101010001001000</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 25%</td><td>0000000000110101000100000</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Great! So, this is enough to attempt to control the tree with, I think – so I
wrote a simple modulator. My approach was to use the fact that I can break down
a single symbol into 4 “sub-symbol” components – which is to say, go back to
representing a <code>1</code> as <code>1110</code>, and a <code>0</code> as <code>1000</code>. This let me allocate IQ
space for the symbol, break the bit into 4 symbols, and if that symbol is 1,
write out values from a carrier wave (<code>cos</code> in the <code>real</code> values, and <code>sin</code> in
the <code>imaginary</code> values) to the buffer. Now that I can go from bits to IQ data,
I can transmit that IQ data using my PlutoSDR or HackRF and try and control my
tree. I gave it a try, and the tree blinked off!</p><p>🎉🎊 Success! 🎊🎉</p><p>But wait – that’s not enough for me – I know I can’t just demodulate bits and
try and replay the bits forever – there’s stuff like addresses and keys and
stuff, and I want to get a second one of these working. Let’s take a look at
the bits to see if we spot anything fun &amp; interesting.</p><p>At first glance, a few things jumped out at me as being… weird? First is
that the preamble is 10 bits long (fine, let’s move along - maybe it
just needs 8 in a row and there’s two to ensure clocks sync?). Next is that
the messages are not all the same length. I double (and triple!) checked
the messages, and it’s true, the messages are not all the same length. Adding
an extra bit at the end didn’t break anything, but I wonder if that’s just due
to the implementation rather than the protocol.</p><p>But, good news, it looks like we have a stable prefix to the messages from the
remote – must be my device’s address! The stable 6 bits that jump out right
away are <code>110101</code>. Something seems weird, though, 6 bits is a bit awkward, even
for a bit limited embedded device. Why 6? But hey, wait, we had 10 bits in the
preamble, what if we have an 8 bit address – meaning my device is <code>00110101</code>,
and the preamble is 8 <code>0</code> symbols! Those are numbers that someone working on
an 8 bit aligned platform would pick! To test this, I added a <code>0</code> to the
preamble to see if the message starts at the first <code>1</code>, or if it requires all
the bits to be fully decoded, and lo and behold, the tree did not turn on or
off. This would seem to me to confirm that the 0s are part of the address,
and I can assume we have two 8 bit aligned bytes in the prefix of the message.</p><div><p>preamble / sync</p><p>address</p><p>stuff</p></div><p>Now, when we go through the 9-10 bits of “stuff”, we see all sorts of weird
bits floating all over the place. The first 4 bits look like it’s either
<code>1001</code> or <code>0001</code>, but other than that, there’s a lot of chaos. This is where
things get really squishy. I needed more information to try and figure this out,
but no matter how many times I sent a command it was always the same bits (so,
no counters), and things feel very opaque still.</p><p>The only way I was going to make any progress is to get another switch and see
how the messages from the remote change. Off to Amazon I went, and ordered
another switch from the same page, and eagerly waited its arrival.</p><h2 id="switch-2">Switch #2</h2><p>The second switch showed up, and I hurriedly unboxed the kit, put batteries
into the remote, and fired up my SDR to take a capture. After I captured the
first button (“Off”), my heart sunk as I saw my lights connected to
Switch #1 flicker off. Apparently the new switch and the old switch have the
same exact address. To be sure, I demodulated the messages as before, and
came out with the exact same bit pattern. This is a setback and letdown – I
was hoping to independently control my switches, but it also means I got no
additional information about the address or button format.</p><p>The upside to all of this, though, is that because the switches are controlled
by either remote, I only needed one remote, so why not pull it apart and see if
I can figure out what components it’s using to transmit, and find any
datasheets I can. The PCB was super simple, and I wound up finding a “WL116SC”
IC on the PCB.</p><p><img src="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/remote-teardown.png" alt=""></p><p>After some googling, I found a single lone
<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201023121143/https://datasheet.lcsc.com/szlcsc/2007311538_WL-WL116AC-1527_C708721.pdf">datasheet</a>,
entirely in Chinese. Thankfully, Google Translate seems to have worked well
enough on technical words, and I was able to put together at least a little bit
of understanding based on the documentation that was made available. I took a
few screenshots below - I put the google translated text above the hanzi. From
that sheet, we can see we got the basics of the “1” and “0” symbol encoding
right (I was halfway expecting the bits to be flipped), and a huge find by way
of a description of the bits in the message!</p><p><img src="https://kc3nwj.com/imgs/christmas/wl116sc-pulse-width.png" alt=""></p><p>It’s a bummer that we missed the clock sync / preamble pulse before the data
message, but that’s OK somehow. It also turns out that 8 or 10 bit series of of
“0"s wasn’t clock sync at all - it was part of the address! Since it also turns
out that all devices made by this manufacturer have the hardcoded address of
<code>[]byte{0x00, 0x35}</code>, that means that the vast majority of bits sent are always
going to be the same for any button press on any remote made by this vendor.
Seems like a waste of bits to me, but hey, what do I know.</p><p>Additionally, this also tells us the trailing zeros are not part of the data
encoding scheme, which is progress!</p><p>Now, working on the assumptions validated by the datasheet, here’s the updated
list of scancodes we’ve found:</p><table><thead><tr><td>Button</td><td>Scancode Bits</td><td>Integer</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>On</td><td>10010001</td><td>145 / 0x91</td></tr><tr><td>Off</td><td>10010100</td><td>148 / 0x94</td></tr><tr><td>Dim Up</td><td>10011010</td><td>154 / 0x9A</td></tr><tr><td>Dim Down</td><td>10010010</td><td>146 / 0x92</td></tr><tr><td>Timer 1h</td><td>10011001</td><td>154 / 0x99</td></tr><tr><td>Timer 2h</td><td>10010011</td><td>147 / 0x93</td></tr><tr><td>Timer 4h</td><td>10010000</td><td>144 / 0x90</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 100%</td><td>00010101</td><td>21 / 0x15</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 75%</td><td>00010011</td><td>19 / 0x13</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 50%</td><td>00010010</td><td>18 / 0x12</td></tr><tr><td>Dim 25%</td><td>00010000</td><td>16 / 0x10</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Interestingly, I think the “Dim” keys may have a confirmation that we have
a good demod – the codes on the bottom are missing the most significant
bit, and when I look back at the scancode table in the datasheet, they make an
interesting pattern – the bottom two rows, right and left side values match
up! If you …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                <p>Yesterday, this site went down for about four hours. Complaints started rolling
in from my millions of ardent followers, spurring me into action. Join
me as I deconstruct what went wrong, how I fixed it, and how I tried to
prevent the problem from occurring again.</p>

<p>This site is built with <a href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a>, a static site generator
written in Go.
It<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> uses a slightly modified version of the
<a href="https://github.com/LordMathis/hugo-theme-nix/">Nix</a> theme by
<a href="https://github.com/LordMathis">Matúš Námešný</a>.
It’s deployed automatically using GitLab’s CI/CD (Continuous
Integration/Continuous Deployment) service. Every time I push a commit to the
remote repository, a server runs a deployment script that I wrote. The script
generates the site and then uploads it to my web host.</p>
<p>Since I got the flow working, I didn’t have any problems until now.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 8:22pm, I pushed a benign commit to the remote repository.
The commit in question simply removed a draft of a post I had been writing
and decided not to publish. As with all pushed commits, this triggered a
build and push of the site.</p>
<p>Hours later, I went to my site for something and noticed something strange:
the homepage was 404ing. So were all the other pages that should have
been there. So I looked through my CI logs and found that:</p>
<ol>
<li>Hugo had failed to build my site</li>
<li>My script attempted to upload anyway</li>
<li><em>It uploaded my <code>.git</code> directory</em></li>
</ol>
<p>The first one is okay; failures happen even though ideally they wouldn’t.
The second one is worrying: Why would that happen?
The third one had the potential to be disastrous.</p>
<h2 id="the-consequences">The consequences</h2>
<p>Luckily for me, there were few consequences. To my knowledge, my site gets very
few visitors. Also, it’s not like my site runs important tools or services for me,
since it’s a static site.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that could have been very bad…</p>
<h2 id="the-potential-consequences">The potential consequences</h2>
<p>As I mentioned above, for those four hours, my entire <code>.git</code> directory for the
repository that holds this site was available for all to browse at
<a href="https://reeshill.net/.git/">https://reeshill.net/.git/</a>. This of course means that not only was the current
state of the repository publicly accessible, all past version history was as well.</p>
<p>My CI script needs to authenticate with my web host to upload the generated site.
It does this with an app-specific password. For the script, this password needs
to be stored somewhere the CI server will have access to.
The naïve solution would be to hard-code the password into the script that runs
on CI. If I had done this, <em>even if I had later removed it</em>, the password would
exist in the history of the repository. Had this been the case, an attacker
would have had plenty of time to discover this in the version history and upload
malicious content to my web host, such as a Javascript cryptocurrency miner.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Past Me was smart enough not to put any secrets in version control.
The password is actually stored by GitLab and given to the CI server as an
environment variable. I trust GitLab a lot more than I trust myself to keep my
secrets safe.</p>

<p>Two big things went wrong at once to cause this failure. If either of them had
gone right, the damage would have been either nonexistent or extremely minimal.
But because they both managed to fail at once, the consequences were greater.</p>

<p>The immediate cause of failure was that Hugo installation started failing.
I was using a Docker image of Alpine Linux that contained
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lftp"><code>lftp</code></a>, which I use as an FTP client.
However, that image did not contain Hugo, and when I set it up I was afraid to
mess with it, so CI would install Hugo from the network every time it was run.
Something must have changed in the Alpine repositories, because suddenly
running <code>hugo</code> resulted in the error</p>
<pre><code>Error relocating /usr/bin/hugo: _ZNSt7__cxx1118basic_stringstreamIcSt11char_traitsIcESaIcEEC1Ev: symbol not found
</code></pre>
<p>This should have been no big deal. The CI should have failed and then I would
deal with fixing the Hugo installation. But because of problem #2, the whole
situation spiraled out of control.</p>
<h2 id="the-real-cause">The real cause</h2>
<p>When I wrote the script that builds and uploads the site in April 2018, I did not
yet understand how shell scripting works. Crucially, I didn’t understand exit
codes. When you run a shell command, part of the result is an exit code: a
number which is <code>0</code> if the command was successful and some other value if it
failed.</p>
<p>By default, a script that contains a sequence of commands will run all of those
commands in order, even if one or more command fails. For an example, see the
following script:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>#!/bin/sh
</span><span></span>
<span>echo</span> <span>'Started the script!'</span>
ls directory-that-does-not-exist
<span>echo</span> <span>'The exit code of the previous command was'</span> <span>"</span><span>$?</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>The second command (the <code>ls</code>) will fail if the named directory does not exist.
But the script will keep running. Here’s the output from running the above script:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./steamroll.sh 
Started the script!
ls: directory-that-does-not-exist: No such file or directory
The exit code of the previous command was 1
</code></pre><p>The second <code>echo</code> runs despite the previous command failing with a nonzero
exit code.</p>
<p>That’s kind of scary! In most programming languages, if the program encounters
an error, it will crash or display some sort of exception that halts execution.
Because the default shell behavior is to keep going regardless of failure status,
my script failed to generate the site but proceeded to the next step anyway.</p>
<p>In my case, when <code>lftp</code> was unable to upload the directory it was supposed to
upload (which was a child of the current directory), it instead uploaded the
current directory, which was the repository root. That looked like this:</p>
<pre><code>/builds/jarhill0/homepage/public: No such file or directory
Transferring file `README.md'
Transferring file `ci-upload.sh'
Transferring file `config.toml'
Making directory `.git'
Transferring file `.git/FETCH_HEAD'
Transferring file `.git/HEAD'
[etc.]
</code></pre><p>Ultimately, the failure of my script to halt once a command failed was what led
to the incident. Small failures should be expected, but when they happen there
should be a clear indication of failure and the process should not continue.</p>

<p>There were essentially three problems I had to fix:</p>
<ol>
<li>My site was down</li>
<li>My builds weren’t failing</li>
<li>My builds <em>were</em> failing</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="the-quick-fix">The quick fix</h2>
<p>Since I was still able to build my website on my local machine, I did that and
uploaded it. That gave me time to fix the underlying problems.</p>
<h2 id="the-process-fix">The process fix</h2>
<p>If one of my builds didn’t succeed, that should be reflected in the script’s
exit status.</p>
<p>It took six characters to fix my script:</p>
<p>Adding this line towards the top of the script does the following, according
to the <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/seth.html">man page for <code>set</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>-e  Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
</code></pre><p>That’s <em>exactly</em> what we want! As soon as a command fails, the script should
fail. With this option set, any failures that may occur down the road will
stop the CI job with a failure status. Perfect!</p>
<p>Here’s what it looks like in our test script from above:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell"><span>#!/bin/sh
</span><span></span>
<span>set</span> -e

<span>echo</span> <span>'Started the script!'</span>
ls directory-that-does-not-exist
<span>echo</span> <span>'The exit code of the previous command was'</span> <span>"</span><span>$?</span><span>"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And the output:</p>
<pre><code>$ ./stopsign.sh 
Started the script!
ls: directory-that-does-not-exist: No such file or directory
</code></pre><p>It stopped once there was an error. Sweet!</p>
<h2 id="the-build-fix">The build fix</h2>
<p>Now that my build status was properly reflecting the failure that was occuring,
I needed to make the builds succeed.</p>
<p>A quick search didn’t help me figure out what was causing the mis-installation
of Hugo, and I didn’t feel like digging in further because I knew that I was
misusing Docker.
The whole point of Docker is that it leads to reproducible states.
Instead of installing a new dependency on top of my Docker image every time,
I should put all necessary
dependencies in the image from the beginning. So I bit the bullet and figured
out how to make (actually, adapt) a Dockerfile. Now, all of my CI builds will
start with Hugo and <code>lftp</code> already installed.
It didn’t take all that long, and now I have removed one more source of failure!</p>

<p>Some failures, like the bug in my script fixed by <code>set -e</code>, can lie dormant for
quite a while
(in my case, a year and a half) before being exposed when something else fails.
When something works reliably for a while, we don’t often think to go back
and check that it works as we expect it does. And it’s very difficult to get
everything right the first time.</p>
<p>I’m glad that this failure led to an improvement in the way I use Docker images.
And I’m glad that the script has been fixed, because now any other failures
will be caught and I will be alerted. Above all, I’m glad that things were
configured well enough in the beginning that nothing bad happened to my site.</p>

<p>There is evidence of a new highly-infectious strain of COVID-19 emerging in the UK and other countries. This post is an elaboration of my current model of it, as promised in my <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://putanumonit.com/2020/12/26/lesswrong-2018-epistemology/" target="_blank">review of LessWrong’s collection on <em>Epistemology</em></a>. Most of the information I have on this new COVID variant comes from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CHtwDXy63BsLkQx4n/covid-12-24-we-re-f-ed-it-s-over" target="_blank">this post by Zvi</a>, the links from it, and comments. Read those if you haven’t yet.</p>



<p>Though I usually strive to have timeless content on my blog, I’m making another COVID exception. Ten months ago I write <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://putanumonit.com/2020/02/27/seeing-the-smoke/" target="_blank">Seeing The Smoke</a></em> and dozens of people told me it flipped the switch for them and let them prepare for COVID in time; this post may end up even timelier. I anticipate both my model and the evidence that feeds into it to change rapidly, everything below is a snapshot of what I believe as of Christmas Day 2020. Reminder: I am not an expert on any of this, just the Putanumonit guy putting a num on it.</p>



<hr>



<p>The median prediction on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CHtwDXy63BsLkQx4n/covid-12-24-we-re-f-ed-it-s-over" target="_blank">Zvi’s LW post</a> is around 60% that the new variant is at least 50% more transmissible and same for there being a third COVID wave in the US:</p>

<p>I would add a few things without straying too far from the crowd’s wisdom. </p>



<p>First, I would revise the crowd’s estimate for the first question down for no other reason than that the poll came at the end of a post titled <em>We’re Fucked, It’s Over</em>. If ever there was going to be a framing effect pushing estimates upwards, this would be it. There are also <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/CupOfjoe1986/status/1342386338717458432" target="_blank">more alternative explanations</a> for the information coming out of the UK than Zvi accounted for.</p>



<p>Instead of just saying that that there’s a 60% chance it has a 50% higher transmissibility, I would break it down something like this:</p>



<ul><li>35% that the new strain is a nothingburger.</li><li>30% that it’s <em>slightly </em>more transmissible, say with an effective reproduction rate (r<sub>t</sub>) 20% higher.</li><li>30% that it’s <em>significantly </em>more transmissible, e.g. 70% higher.</li><li>5% in the Captain Malcolm Reynolds probability bucket.</li></ul>



<p>I also believe it very likely that new variant is already present in the US, given that a dozen flights from London have landed in NYC just in the last week. Travel from the UK has been restricted on Christmas eve but the dust from the bolting horse has already settled by the barn door.</p>



<p>A variant that’s just 20% more infectious will still take over exponentially from the old variant resulting in a chart like the one we see.</p>

<p>Several people have tried to explain away the growth of the new variant as being due to things like catching a superspreader, but it doesn’t have to be one or the other. It could have r<sub>t</sub>=1.2 <em>and</em> catch a superspreader event to make it look like r<sub>t</sub>=1.5-1.7. This is why I am giving extra weight to the hypothesis of slightly higher transmissibility.</p>



<p>I also think there’s a <strong>huge </strong>difference between r<sub>tnew</sub>=1.2 and r<sub>tnew</sub>=1.7 (here I mean r<sub>t</sub> relative to the old strain given the same measures of containment) in terms of outcomes. </p>



<p>In the first case, to keep the virus suppressed (i.e. r&lt;1) we need to take measures that would have yielded r<sub>t</sub>=0.8 for the old strain. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rt.live/us/NY" target="_blank">New York sustained that number</a> (albeit never dipping below 0.7) for two months running in the spring. Given that ~30% of the state has already been infected, that makes this all the more doable. Gyms and restaurants will close and people will grumble, but we’ll probably survive till the vaccine.</p>



<p>r<sub>tnew</sub>=1.7 is an entirely different case. Suppressing it would require the sort of lockdown that would yield r<sub>t</sub>=0.6 for the old strain, a number that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://rt.live/" target="_blank"><strong>has never been reached by any US state for any amount of time</strong></a>. I see no way in hell that Americans would agree to a lockdown <em>much stricter than any we’ve had so far,</em> especially after they’ve been promised that the worst is behind them.</p>



<p>Rural red tribers will not agree because Biden is in the White House. Urban blue tribers because containment in cities is much harder anyway. Young people will not agree because the virus harms them less than the lockdown. Dumb people will not agree because they will not understand the science and math and smart people, seeing that, will try to get infected early before the hospitals are overwhelmed.</p>



<p>No one will believe any of the “experts” at the CDC or WHO or Dr. Fauci because they have all repeatedly lied and tried to manipulate people and reversed their positions without admitting that they have. They all have <em>negative </em>credibility at this point with many Americans.</p>



<p>If the new virus is 1.7 times as infectious I believe that Americans will most likely simply give up on containment, the populace if not the government. We’ll have time to vaccinate the most vulnerable 10-20% of the population by April-May, at which point the majority of everyone else will get the new strain. </p>



<p>There is a small chance that the US will get its shit together vaccine-wise and beat the new strain in a race. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1342569735884517379" target="_blank">Israel, for example</a>, has a simple system in place to vaccinate the vast majority of its 9-million strong population by the end of March. On this timetable, even a virus with r<sub>t</sub>=1.7 will not have time to explode before herd immunity kills it.</p>



<p>The same is not true of the US, which is currently projected to reach majority immunization no earlier than the late summer by refusing to do <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/yashkaf/status/1342546177288527872" target="_blank">basic things to rush the process</a>.</p>



<p>And what’s the Captain Mal bucket?</p>



<figure><div>
<p><span><iframe width="900" height="507" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MnQaYGJ5oYs?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;fs=1&amp;hl=en&amp;autohide=2&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true" sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin allow-popups allow-presentation"></iframe></span></p>
</div></figure>



<p>The new variant being more virulent in addition to being more infectious. Another newer strain that’s even worse. Or, in a nightmare scenario, a highly-transmissible mutation that also renders the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines ineffective. </p>



<p>If COVID has taught us one thing, it’s that it’s all usually worse than we thought.</p>



<p>So the bottom line is that I currently estimate a 30-35% chance of us being truly fucked, in the sense of dozens of millions more Americans getting COVID in 2021 and hundreds of thousands more dead, along with local attempts at extreme lockdowns. I’m not going to speculate on the further implications of this for things like financial markets or the fabric of our civilization. I also anticipate that I’ll be revising these numbers in the next few days. </p>



<p>But rationalists are seeing the smoke again.</p>

    <p>Haskell is notoriously famous for having a steep learning curve. A situation that frustrates newcomers to the language, especially newcomers who are experienced developers using other programming languages.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon to see seasoned developers express their frustration by making the point that all of the other languages they have picked up, they have been able to get productive within a reasonable amount of time, but Haskell only manages to remain an impenetrable wall of Egyptian glyphs after the same period of time.</p>

<p>A reason often cited for Haskell’s steep learning curve is the fact that <em>“Haskell is different”</em>. The argument goes: Haskell is not all that difficult, it is just different, and because of this, it is unfamilair. But most of the time, when this argument is made, it is not mentioned how exactly Haskell is different.</p>

<p>Sure, there could be other reasons why learning Haskell may be considered difficult, but we think the <em>difference</em> argument is an interesting one worth exploring. This is exactly what this post is about. The idea is to do more than just mention that Haskell is different but to show how. The hope is that doing this, will prepare newcomers to the language, hence preventing Haskell’s difference from being a stumbling block to learning the language.</p>

<p>So in what ways is Haskell different?</p>

<!--end_excerpt-->

<h2 id="two-axes-of-difference-syntax-and-computation-model">Two Axes of Difference: Syntax and Computation Model</h2>

<p>There are two axes where Haskell is fundamentally different: <em>The syntax and the computation model</em>.</p>

<p>Haskell has a syntax that is different from languages most experienced developers are familiar with. Also, Haskell’s computation model is based on a different paradigm when compared with most mainstream languages. Understanding this will help in developing a better learning strategy.</p>

<p>Most mainstream programming languages inherit the C-like syntax and have imperative semantics. Haskell syntax is not derived from C, and it is not an imperative language, instead, it is a functional language.</p>

<p>This means a programmer who is experienced with an imperative language with a C-like syntax will find it easy to pick up another imperative language with C-like syntax. Attempting to pick up Haskell in such a similar fashion will be harder and if not aware of these differences, Haskell will feel needlessly hard.</p>

<h3 id="syntax-difference-haskell-is-not-a-c-like-language">Syntax Difference: Haskell is not a C-like language</h3>

<p>Most, if not all current mainstream programming languages have a syntax inspired or derived from C. To illustrate this, let’s take a coding problem from <a href="https://www.codewars.com/">Codewars</a> and see the solutions in the first top <a href="https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/">5 programming languages</a> as rated by the Tiobe programming index, which at the moment of writing this post are: C, Java, Python, C++ and C#. <br></p>

<em>Problem Statement: Multiples of 3 or 5</em> <a href="https://www.codewars.com/kata/514b92a657cdc65150000006/">source</a></p>

<p>If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.</p>

<p>Finish the solution so that it returns the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below the number passed in.</p>

<p>Note: If the number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, only count it once. Also, if a number is negative, return 0(for languages that do have them)

<p>You see the pattern here? Even in Python, a language that uses whitespace instead of curly braces, the structure of the solutions are all similar. It is not then difficult to see how someone who is proficient in one of the languages can easily make sense of any of the other languages because the structure of their syntax are the same.</p>

<p>Note that some of these imperative languages above now have constructs that makes it possible to emulate functional syntax. For example iterations and operations usually performed via <code>for loops</code> can now be done using construncts like streams and lambdas. This only shows the influence of functional programming on mainstream imperative languages. Infact these functional style is often seen as unnatural to the original languages. The creator of Python, Guido van Rossum, shared a similar sentiment about functional programming style in Python:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Python probably has the reputation of supporting functional programming based on the inclusion of lambda, map, filter, and reduce in the language, but in my eyes these are just syntactic sugar, and not the fundamental building blocks that they are in functional languages.</p>

<p>Now let us see the solution in Haskell:</p>

<p>This looks very different from the previous solutions. The syntax is different and that is because Haskell’s syntax is not inspired by C. <strong>More importantly, this syntax is native to Haskell, and not just a style</strong>. This highlights how Haskell is different when it comes to the axis of syntax.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>An analogy:
Imagine you understand British English, and you want to learn how to write American English. Such a task would be pretty straight forward since you can more or less apply the bulk of the knowledge you already have. What you will then need to learn consists of knowing where to tweak things like the grammar and spelling and idioms that are peculiar to American English. Now contrast that to learning how to write Russian. To do that successfully you will need to be able to set aside what you already know in English and be ready to pick up new grammar rules, new alphabets, new spellings, new idioms, etc.</p><p>
Learning yet another of the mainstream C-family like languages once you know one, is like learning how to speak American English if you already know any variant of English Languages. Learning Haskell on the other hand is similar to already knowing English but wanting to learn Russian. You have to appreciate and understand the fact that the process cannot be approached with a strategy that involves applying what you already know and tweaking one or two things here and there, it has to be approached with the intention to pick up a totally different set of rules about computation and programming. If you are not aware of this fact, then it would become easy to get frustrated and make statements like: I am a senior programmer and in my 10 years of programming I have been able to pick up a new language in 2 weeks tops! I can’t do that with Haskell, hence Haskell is impenetrable. Nope Haskell is not impenetrable, you have just been applying the wrong learning technique. Being aware of this is part of the first steps in learning Haskell successfully.</p></div>

<h2 id="computation-model-difference-haskell-is-not-an-imperative-language">Computation Model Difference: Haskell is not an imperative language</h2>

<p>The other axis where Haskell is different is its computation model it is based on. This difference is not as obvious as the syntax difference but is a more important difference to appreciate.</p>

<p>Programming languages are based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_of_computation">Models of computation</a>. This is not difficult to appreciate, as programming languages can be seen as a mechanism to express computations.</p>

<p>The theory of computation and the different possible models have a rich mathematical and academic background, with sequential models, functional models, and concurrent models being the three broad categories.</p>

<p>Most mainstream programming languages are imperative in nature. This means their semantic is derived from the sequential model of computation. To be specific, most imperative languages are implementations of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random-access_machine">Random access machines</a>/<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machines</a>, which are just two examples of the sequential model of computation.</p>

<p>The essence of this model involves expressing computation as a sequential step that involves data mutation together with control structures that control how data is accessed and updated as part of the computation.</p>

<p>This model is the basis of the imperative programming paradigm.</p>

<p>Haskell on the other hand is not based on a sequential model of computation hence it is not an imperative programming language. Haskell is based on the functional model of computation. To be specific, Haskell is an implementation of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda calculus</a>, which is one example of a functional model of computation.</p>

<p>The essence of Lambda Calculus involves expressing computation based on function abstraction and application using variable binding and substitution. Haskell, at its core is nothing but an implementation of Lambda Calculus.</p>

<p>These computation models then dictate the mental model that would be required when working with a programming language based on them. A sequential model that involves data mutation requires a different model than a functional model that is an implementation of lambda calculus which requires function abstraction and application.</p>

<p>Hence this is why it is beneficial, especially for seasoned developers picking up Haskell to understand a bit of Lambda Calculus, not to the level required of a mathematician or a computer scientist, but enough to understand why Haskell is the way it is. If not for any other reason but the fact that it will help to appreciate what we mean by function in a mathematical sense and how that is …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>While trying to implement a long planned feature, an ad block in Angelfish, the Plasma Mobile webbrowser,
I was looking for a mostly complete and performant library that provides this functionality.</p>

<p>First I found libadblockplus, which is a C++ library providing the AdblockPlus core functionality.
Sounds great, right? Well, not quite. It includes it’s own v8 java script engine,
and since we are talking about a webbrowser with a QML interface here,
including a third java script engine and a second copy of v8 was absolutely not an option.
Even if this wasn’t a webbrowser,
running a java script engine as implementation detail of a library is at least … problematic.</p>

<p>The other option I found is <a href="https://github.com/brave/adblock-rust">adblock-rust</a>,
which is the built-in ad block of the Brave browser. As the name tells, it is written in Rust,
and I was originally looking for a C++ library. But it turned out this was not much of a problem,
since Rust features excellent C interoperability, just like C++.
Based on this common ground, bindings can be created to use Rust code from C++ (and the other way around if needed).</p>

<h2 id="approach-1">Approach 1</h2>
<p>My first approach was to use raw ffi. That means essentially building a C API featuring the typical C primitive types in rust,
and telling the rust compiler to represent structs in memory the same way that C would do.
Thanks to cbindgen, which automatically generates a header file with the information for the C compiler to know which fields a struct has and were they are,
we directly get something we can include in our C++ project.</p>

<p>The rust build system cargo is capable of running custom code at build time, and we can use that to run cbindgen on our rust code, by adding a file named <code>build.rs</code>:</p>
<pre><code>extern crate cbindgen;

use std::env;

fn main() {
    let crate_dir = env::var("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR").unwrap();

    cbindgen::generate(&amp;crate_dir)
        .unwrap()
        .write_to_file("bindings.h");
}
</code></pre>

<p>Our core data structure for the ad block looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>#[repr(C)]
pub struct Adblock {
    blocker: *mut Engine,
}
</code></pre>
<p>It stores a pointer to the rust Engine type in a C compatible struct.
The struct can not be created directly from C / C++, since we don’t know anything about the Engine type there.</p>

<p>So we need a function on the rust side that creates and initializes the Engine for us and packs it into an <code>Adblock</code> struct.
Since the code in angelfish is doing a bit more than only that, the function takes two C string arguments, and returns a pointer to a mutable (non-const) Adblock object.</p>
<pre><code>#[no_mangle]
pub extern "C" fn new_adblock(
    list_dir: *const c_char,
    public_domain_suffix_file: *const c_char,
) -&gt; *mut Adblock
</code></pre>
<p>A few more thigs in this function signature are unusual, but they are all related to the FFI / C compatibility we need here:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>#[no_mangle]</code> tells the rust compiler not to apply its rust specific function name mangling</li>
  <li><code>extern "C"</code> tells that this function should use the C calling conventions.</li>
</ul>

<p>Every time we interact with data from C, the rust compiler is unable to run its usual safety checks.
For that reason we need unsafe blocks around those lines of code.
If anything unexpectedly segfaults, it’s likely to be in our unsafe blocks.
To get a string that we can feed into a usual rust API, we can use <code>unsafe { CStr::from_ptr(public_domain_suffix_file).to_str() }</code>.</p>

<p>For more examples of how to interact with the C / C++ side, feel free to have a look at <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/plasma-angelfish/-/blob/20e166c0fe2e38be63824b957c02fa58865ac67c/src/rs/adblock/src/adblock.rs">some real code in Angelfish</a>.
I’m by no means an expert on this, but it should help you get started.</p>

<p>Using this approach, the ad block could successfully be implemented in about 140 lines of rust code, of which only half is FFI code, and the rest actual logic.</p>

<h2 id="approach-2">Approach 2</h2>
<p>The second approach is to use the cxx crate (library), which can generate most of the boilerplate FFI code automatically, and provides a modern API on the C++ side.
To do that, it implements its own wrapper types, each wrapping the functionality of one type of one of the languages. Those wrapper types are implemented in both languages, and allow easily passing more advanced types than pointers and number types through the FFI boundary.
On the rust side, the wrapper types are not really visible, because a macro generates everything for us.</p>

<p>The only unusual thing on the rust side will be a small ffi module, declaring which types and functions we want to expose to C++:</p>
<pre><code>#[cxx::bridge]
mod ffi {
    extern "Rust" {
        type Adblock;
        type AdblockResult;

        fn new_adblock(list_dir: &amp;str, suffix_file: &amp;str) -&gt; Box&lt;Adblock&gt;;
        fn should_block(
            self: &amp;Adblock,
            url: &amp;str,
            source_url: &amp;str,
            request_type: &amp;str,
        ) -&gt; Box&lt;AdblockResult&gt;;
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>All objects are returned as smart pointers, like <code>Box</code>.
On the C++ side, this will result in a <code>rust::Box&lt;Adblock&gt;</code>, which is a type generated by the cxx_build crate, which is doing something slightly similar to cbindgen.</p>

<p>With the cxx crate, our build.rs will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>extern crate cxx_build;

fn main() {
    cxx_build::bridge("src/adblock.rs").compile("angelfish-adblock")
}
</code></pre>

<p>You may wonder, if the cxx crate makes everything so easy, why did I start with approach 1 at all?
I had had a look at the cxx crate a few month ago, when it was still too minimal to do what I needed. Luckily I had another look, since it has become really useful in the meantime.
However learning the raw ffi way was important to understand what actually happens in the background, and I’d almost recommend everyone to have a look at that first before using the cxx crate. Using <code>cargo expand</code> you can then understand what cxx generated for you.</p>

<p>Given the cxx crate makes this so much easier, I initially feared it might add tons of new dependencies and increase the build time, but to my surprise it actually has a lot less dependencies than cbindgen. Even though cbindgen only uses those at build time (they don’t end up in the binary), they take some time to build.</p>

<p>Angelfish has recently switched to using the cxx crate, so you find usage examples in the <a href="https://invent.kde.org/plasma-mobile/plasma-angelfish/-/blob/d92e48e392303deda6cf3c1552f9f7b5189e2953/src/rs/adblock/src/adblock.rs">current version of the ad block code</a>.</p>

<h2 id="build-system">Build system</h2>
<p>After we have written the FFI, we need to build the Rust code as part of our project, most likely using CMake. This could be very annoying and complicated, but luckily <a href="https://github.com/AndrewGaspar/corrosion">Corrosion</a> exists to make this very easy for us.
It can build our rust code using the cargo build system, and create CMake targets for the library we built, so its easy to link against it.</p>

<h2 id="usage-in-kde">Usage in KDE</h2>
<p>Now that the implementation part is explained,
it makes sense to look into where this can be useful and where not.
Unfortunately the truth is that some distros are still not fully happy with having to package rust code,
because the rust community has a different approach to sharing code than known from the C / C++ world.
While Qt re-implements some functionality also found in other C++ libraries, to only make it necessary to package Qt and not one library for json, one for xml, for http and so on, the rust community likes to split everything into small packages, so no unnecessary code is included.</p>

<p>In Angelfish, all the rust code is optional, and Angelfish can of course still be built without Rust.</p>

<p>Possible areas in KDE that could profit from using Rust are icon and SVG theme rendering code, which could profit from using rsvg or resvg.
I can imagine it could also be useful for document thumbnailers, when a rust implementation of the file type already exists. A similar case could be KIO workers, and pretty much any other project that can profit from optional plugins.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This approach to using Rust in KDE allows to make use of the many libraries and language features the ecosystem provides, without running into the infamous “rewrite it in Rust” reflex. It avoids having to create rust bindings for all KDE Frameworks and Qt only to make use of Rust, and still produces readable code.</p>

While computers got faster and cheaper year after year for the last five decades, healthcare costs shot three to four times higher than inflation in the last two decades <span>alone.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="r2">2</a></sup></span></p> <p>And if the recent coronavirus pandemic that swept the globe in a few short weeks has shown us anything, it’s how close our healthcare systems truly are to their breaking point.</p> <p>Yet, unlike other stagnant technology areas, like defense or nuclear energy, most people will agree that healthcare is both badly broken and vital to fix, so by starting there at least, fewer people will try to stop an ambitious founder.</p> <p>Of all the healthcare fields that one could start with, many fashionable and less fashionable areas receive a fair bit of attention already from venture capitalists and philanthropists—it’s hard to tell them apart sometimes. Yet there’s one big area that has stagnated despite the close scrutiny it receives, and that’s pharmaceuticals.</p> <p>The great promise was that by unlocking the secrets of biology, we would create all kinds of life-saving, even life-enhancing medicine, from a full-course-meal in a pill to a general cancer cure.</p> <p>Moreover, breakthroughs in pharma would open up new avenues of research in many ancillary fields, from nutrition and anti-aging to preventative medicine writ large. The more progress we’d make, the less effort we’d have to put in to uncover new secrets.</p> <p>However, today’s pharma industry looks nothing of the sort. Looking from the outside, it seems that despite a growing mountain of scientific and technical know-how, the cures only seem to get harder and harder to find. So, one might reasonably ask: What went wrong?</p> <p>To cut the Gordian knot of pharma’s long stasis, we must turn to the one robust measure of progress the industry has, known simply as Eroom’s law. The name is already very suggestive, as it’s quite literally an ironic backward spelling of Moore’s law—the computer industry’s relentless benchmark of progress—which makes it a fitting place to&nbsp;start.</p> <p>Race to the bottom</p> <p>Eroom’s law is the observation that the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubled every nine years from 1950 through 2010. All in all, it shows a roughly 80-fold decline in the productivity of drug R&amp;D.</p> <p>It’s hard to say what’s worse, the staggering decline, or the fact that it went on unchecked for six decades. Either way, as the total sum of our efforts to look for life-saving secrets, Eroom’s law leaves no doubt that our ability to explore the frontier has atrophied catastrophically.</p> <figure> <img alt="A graph of Eroom’s law shows that the cost of developing a new drug roughly doubled every nine years from 1950 through the 2010." id="img-eroom-1" src="https://refoundable.com/assets/img/buf.png" data-echo="/assets/img/eroom-1.png"> <figcaption id="cap-eroom-1">By 2010, the total R&amp;D spend per drug approved was about a&nbsp;hundred times higher, in real dollars, than it was in 1950.<span>Graph by Jack Scannell</span></figcaption> </figure> <p>Although some aspects of this disturbing trend line were known since the 1980s, Eroom’s law was formally articulated in 2012, at the tail end of the long decline, in a seminal paper published in <em>Nature Reviews Drug Discovery</em> by four co-authors led by Jack Scannell.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="r3">3</a></sup></p> <p>In a field plagued by narrow specialization, Jack Scannell is something of a renaissance man, having seen the industry from a distance and up close while working in drug research, private consulting, pharma and biotech investing, and policy advising.</p> <p>When Scannell worked as an investment analyst, he used to ask the top executives at major pharma firms to explain why the productivity of drug R&amp;D kept falling for so long, when the science and technology inputs were getting cheaper and more efficient all the time. Generally, he’d get the same kind of answer: the industry had run out of “low-hanging fruit.”</p> <p>In the course of his own later investigations, Scannell began to focus on a serious technical problem called “model validity,” which he found was holding back progress in the science of drug discovery. And while everyone can acknowledge that there’s a host of issues to fix with the drug industry, we agree with Scannell that starting with the science could prove decisive in the heroic effort needed to restart general progress in the field.</p> <p>So, we sit down with Jack Scannell to discuss the beginning and end of Eroom’s law, the technical frontier of drug discovery, and whether drug R&amp;D can help win the fight against COVID-19 and prevent future pandemics.</p>  <hr>  <p id="q1">Your 2012 paper diagnosed the decline in drug R&amp;D productivity over the preceding six decades.

That struck me as an ugly contrast.</p> <p>Many people bemoaned the R&amp;D productivity problem before, but not enough people had drawn attention to the contrast between input and output efficiency. I thought it was an important public policy problem, and it seemed to attract less attention than it deserved.</p> <p>I remember talking about the contrast with a friend of mine, William Bains. We chatted that drug industry productivity looked like Moore’s law backwards, and that’s how the term “Eroom’s law” was born.</p> <p id="q2">The drug industry already knew it had an R&amp;D productivity problem, so what was missing in previous attempts to diagnose the issue?<a href="#q2"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>As long ago as 1980, there was a great paper on the R&amp;D slowdown by Fred Steward and George Wibberley, which we cited along with some other good work in our <span>paper.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="r4">4</a></sup></span></p> <p>However, in general, I thought there were two problems:</p> <p>First, a lot of the diagnostic efforts were private. They were happening in some of the drug and biotech companies, but they weren’t making it into the public domain, so they couldn’t affect science policy or investor behavior.</p> <p>Second, what did often make it into the public domain were not really diagnoses per se, but attempts to sell “solutions” that, in many cases, were largely unrelated to the core problems of drug R&amp;D.</p> <p>If, for example, you were an academic geneticist, low R&amp;D productivity was an occasion to promote more investment in genomics. If you were an investment bank, you saw an opportunity to promote M&amp;A to Big Pharma. If you were a consulting firm, you might say that the reporting lines or the business processes were wrong; things you could fix with a re-engineering project.</p> <p>At the time, I was working as an investment analyst. A bad prognosis can be very interesting to an analyst, because if you think an industry is in real trouble, you don’t have to own it. That meant I had a different set of biases to most people. And I didn’t have any particular solution to sell.</p> <p>On the whole, I think lots of people would’ve been better qualified to write the paper, but their day jobs meant they couldn’t write it.</p> <p id="q3">Eroom’s law was widely adopted after your paper came out. What was the general reaction you saw after you published?<a href="#q3"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>People were certainly glad that someone had put names to things that they knew, or suspected, were happening already. Apart from Eroom’s law itself, people liked something else we talked about in the paper, which I called the “Better than the Beatles” problem.</p> <p>Imagine how hard it would be to sell new pop songs if every new song had to be better than the Beatles, if you could download all the old Beatles records for free, and if no one ever got bored of listening to the same Beatles songs over and over again.</p> <p>That’s analogous to the problem the drug industry faces, in that some old drugs are very good, they cost next to nothing when their patents expire, and doctors don’t get bored of prescribing them.</p> <p>So in many therapy areas, you end up with this ever-expanding back catalog of virtually free and very good medicine, against which any new medicine would have to compete. That reduces the value of as-yet-undiscovered drugs. It also pushes drug R&amp;D towards the areas where we don’t have a catalog of good cheap stuff, or precisely the areas where R&amp;D is likely to be harder.</p> <p>Inevitably, people also appropriated Eroom’s law to justify what they wanted to do anyway. That reminds me of a line from a famous British TV comedy, <em>Yes, Prime Minister</em>, which is about a hapless politician who is ruthlessly managed by his civil servants: “Something must be done. This is something. Therefore, we must do it.” I do occasionally see papers that make the same kind of <span>argument.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="r5">5</a></sup></span></p> <p>However, to be honest, apart from a few people in the drug industry telling me that the paper became required reading, and aside from seeing the Eroom graph in a lot of presentations, it’s not clear to me that anything different was done after the paper was read.</p>  <hr>  <p id="q4">The standard fixes to raise drug R&amp;D productivity tend to focus on process efficiency and cost-cutting. Why haven’t these solutions been enough to stop and reverse Eroom’s law?<a href="#q4"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" version="1.1" width="16" height="16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z"></path></svg></a></p> <p>Simply put, they’re addressing the wrong class of problems.

December 27, 2020 | https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-12-16-trustix-announcement/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.tweag.io/blog/2020-12-16-trustix-announcement/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Downloading binaries from well-known providers is the easiest way to install new software.
After all, building software from source is a chore — it requires both time and technical expertise.
But how do we know that we aren’t installing something malicious from these providers?</p>
<p>Typically, we trust these binaries because we trust the provider.
We believe that they were built from trusted sources, in a trusted computational environment, and with trusted build instructions.
But even if the provider does everything transparently and in good faith, the binaries could still be <em>anything</em> if the provider’s system is compromised.
In other words, the build process requires <em>trust</em> even if all build inputs (sources, dependencies, build scripts, etc…) are known.</p>
<p>Overcoming this problem is hard — after all, how can we verify the output of arbitrary build inputs?
Excitingly, the last years have brought about ecosystems such as Nix, where all build inputs are known and where <em>significant amounts of builds are reproducible</em>.
This means that the correspondence between inputs and outputs can be verified by building the same binary multiple times!
The <a href="https://r13y.com/">r13y</a> project, for example, tracks non-reproducible builds by building them twice on the same machine, showing that this is indeed practical.</p>
<p>But we can go further, and that’s the subject of this blog post, which introduces <a href="https://github.com/tweag/trustix">Trustix</a>, a new tool we are working on.
Trustix compares build outputs for given build inputs across <em>independent</em> providers and machines, effectively decentralizing trust.
This establishes what I like to call <a href="https://build-transparency.org/">build transparency</a> because it verifies what black box build machines are doing.
Behind the scenes Trustix builds a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree">Merkle tree</a>-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Append-only">append-only</a> log that maps build inputs to build outputs, which I’ll come back to in a later post.
This log can be used to establish <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_(computer_science)">consensus</a> whether certain build inputs always produce the same output — and can therefore be trusted.
Conversely, it can also be used to uncover non-reproducible builds, corrupted or not, on a large scale.</p>
<p>The initial implementation of Trustix, and its description in this post are based on the Nix package manager.
Nix focuses on isolated builds, provides access to the hashes of all build inputs as well as a high quantity of bit-reproducible packages, making it the ideal initial testing ecosystem.
However, Trustix was designed to be system-independent, and is not strongly tied to Nix.</p>
<p>The developmentent of <a href="https://github.com/tweag/trustix">Trustix</a> is funded by <a href="https://nlnet.nl/project/Trustix">NLnet foundation</a> and the European Commission’s <a href="https://ngi.eu/">Next Generation Internet</a> programme through the <a href="https://nlnet.nl/PET">NGI Zero PET</a> (privacy and trust enhancing technologies) fund.
The tool is still in development, but I’m very excited to announce it already!</p>
<h2>How Nix verifies binary cache results</h2>
<p>Most Linux package managers use a very simple signature scheme to secure binary distribution to users.
Some use GPG keys, some use OpenSSL certificates, and others use some other kind of key, but the idea is essentially the same for all of them.
The general approach is that binaries are signed with a private key, and clients can use an associated public key to check that a binary was really signed by the trusted entity.</p>
<p>Nix for example uses an ed25519-based key signature scheme and comes with a default hard-coded public key that corresponds to the default cache.
This key can be overridden or complemented by others, allowing the use of additional caches.
The list of signing keys can be found in <code>/etc/nix/nix.conf</code>.
The default base64-encoded ed25519 public key with a name as additional metadata looks like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>trusted-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, in Nix, software is addressed by the hash of all of its build inputs (sources, dependencies and build instructions).
This hash, or the output path is used to query a cache (like <a href="https://cache.nixos.org/">https://cache.nixos.org</a>) for a binary.</p>
<p>Here is an example:
The hash of the <code>hello</code> derivation can be obtained from a shell with <code>nix-instantiate</code>:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ nix-instantiate '&lt;nixpkgs&gt;' --eval -A hello.outPath
"/nix/store/w9yy7v61ipb5rx6i35zq1mvc2iqfmps1-hello-2.10"</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, behind the scenes, we have evaluated and hashed all build inputs that the <code>hello</code> derivation needs (<code>.outPath</code> is just a helper).
This hash can then be used to query the default Nix binary cache:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>$ curl https://cache.nixos.org/w9yy7v61ipb5rx6i35zq1mvc2iqfmps1.narinfo
StorePath: /nix/store/w9yy7v61ipb5rx6i35zq1mvc2iqfmps1-hello-2.10

<p>Besides links to the archive that contains the compressed binaries, this response includes two relevant pieces of information which are used to verify binaries from the binary cache(s):</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>NarHash</code> is a hash over all Nix store directory contents</li>
<li>The <code>Sig</code> is a cryptographic signature over the <code>NarHash</code></li>
</ul>
<p>With this information, the client can check that this binary really comes from the provider’s Nix store.</p>
<h2>What are the limitations of this model?</h2>
<p>While this model has served Nix and others well for many years it suffers from a few problems.
All of these problems can be traced back to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure">single point of failure</a> in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_trust">chain of trust</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>First, if the key used by cache.nixos.org is ever compromised, all builds that were ever added to the cache can be considered tainted.</li>
<li>Second, one needs to put either full trust or no trust at all in the build machines of a binary cache — there is no middle ground.</li>
<li>Finally, there is no inherent guarantee that the build inputs described in the Nix expressions were actually used to build what’s in the cache.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Trustix</h2>
<p>Trustix aims to solve these problems by assembling a mapping from build inputs to (hashes of) build outputs provided by many build machines.</p>
<p>Instead of relying on verifying packages signatures, like the traditional Nix model does, Trustix only exposes packages that it considers trustworthy.
Concretely, Trustix is configured as a proxy for a binary cache, and hides the packages which are not trustworthy.
As far as Nix is concerned, the package not being trustworthy is exactly as if the package wasn’t stored in the binary cache to begin with.
If such a package is required, Nix will therefore build it from source.</p>
<p>Trustix doesn’t define what a trustworthy package is.
What your Trustix considers trustworthy is up to you.
The rules for accepting packages are entirely configurable.
In fact, in the current prototype, there isn’t a default rule for packages to count as trustworthy: you need to configure trustworthiness yourself.</p>
<p>With this in mind, let’s revisit the above issues</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>In Trustix, if an entity is compromised, you can rely on all
other entities in the network to establish that a binary artefact is
trustworthy. Maybe a few hashes are wrong in the Trustix mapping,
but if an overwhelming majority of the outputs are the same, you can
trust that the corresponding artefact is indeed what you would have
built yourself.</p>
<p>Therefore you never need to invalidate an entire binary cache: you
can still verify the trustworthiness of old packages, even if newer
packages are built by a malicious actor.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In Trustix, you never typically consider any build machine to be
fully trusted. You always check their results against the other
build machines. You can further configure this by considering some
machines as more trusted (maybe because it is a community-operated
machine, and you trust said community) or less trusted (for instance,
because it has been compromised in the past, and you fear it may be
compromised again).</p>
<p>Moreover, in the spirit of having no single point of failure,
Trustix’s mapping is not kept in a central database. Instead every
builder keeps a log of its builds; these logs are aggregated on your
machine by your instance of the Trustix daemon. Therefore even the
mapping itself doesn’t have to be fully trusted.</p>
</li>
<li>In Trustix, package validity is not ensured by a signature scheme.
Instead Trustix relies on the consistency of the input to output
mapping. As a consequence, the validity criterion, contrary to a
signature scheme, links the output to the input. It makes it
infeasible to pass the build result of input <code>I</code> as a build result for
input <code>J</code>: it would require corrupting the entire network.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Limitations: reproducibility tracking and non-reproducible builds</h2>
<p>A system like Trustix will not work well with builds that are non-reproducible, which is a limitation of this model.
After all, you cannot reach consensus if everyone’s opinions differ.</p>
<p>However, Trustix can still be useful, even for non-reproducible builds!
By accumulating all the data in the various logs and aggregating them, we can track which derivations are non-reproducible over all of Nixpkgs, in a way that is easier than previously possible.
Whereas the <a href="https://r13y.com/">r13y project</a> builds a single closure
on a single machine, Trustix will index <em>everything ever built</em> on every
architecture.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I am very excited to be working on the next generation of tooling for trust and reproducibility, and for the purely functional software packaging model pioneered by Nix to keep enabling new use cases.
I hope that this work can be a foundation for many other applications other than improving trust — for example, by enabling the Nix community to support new CPU architectures with community binary caches.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>   <p>[TL;DR: Google has gotten bad; we all know it; ideas for a startup making a better Google.]</p> <p>In 2000, Google got popular because hackers realized it was better than Lycos or Excite. This effect is happening again. Early adopters aren’t using Google anymore.</p> <p>They aren’t using DuckDuckGo either. They’re still using Google.com, but differently. To make Google usable, users are adding faux-query modifiers that to supress the “garbage Internet”.</p> <p>You see this in the typeahead logs.</p> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image6.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Products (Reddit)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image4.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Services (Reddit, Yelp)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image1.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Movies (Rotten Tomatoes)</em></center> <p><img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image5.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Even code (Github)</em></center> <p>Interestingly, this doesn’t work for all categories. <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image3.png" alt=""> <img src="https://dcgross.com/assets/new-google/image2.png" alt=""> <em></em></p><center><em>Recipes don’t have a “Reddit” equivalent</em></center> <h3 id="query-operators-mean-somethings-broken">Query Operators Mean Something’s Broken</h3> <p>More advanced users use modifiers like <code>site: filetype: intitle:</code> because adding “reddit” isn’t strict enough, as spammy websites often manipulate content to win SEO.</p> <p>How about those websites that stuff the year in the title? “Reviews UPDATED JANUARY 2020” are exploiting the fact that customers suffix queries with the year. What those people are trying to command is freshness, not a title match.</p> <p>Something’s broken, and a tiny share of Google is open for the taking. Obviously attacking incumbents head-on doesn’t work. Here are two alternative ideas for bootstrapping next-generation search:</p> <h3 id="1-boogle-a-query-reformulator">#1 Boogle, A Query Reformulator</h3> <p>Introducing Boogle, a proxy for Google that’s just Better Google Search. It’s a query expander. We predict the correct operators for your query, proxy Google’s results, and serve. For example:</p> <p><code>query("stripe.js example") -&gt; query("stripe.js example (site:github.com OR site:gitlab.com OR site:..."))</code></p> <p><code>query("is anker charger") -&gt; query("is anker charger (inurl:forum OR site:reddit.com OR ...))"</code></p> <p>Query topic modeling is a rich science with plenty of examples.</p> <p>You’d almost as fast as Google, never worse, and occasionally better. This will help build the reflex to use you instead. This approach isn’t that hard to get started with, and might work for the high-end users.</p>  <p>You could go after this vertical by vertical – build the <em>best</em> site for electric product search, for travel, for code, etc. A key question is how to build habitual recall to use your product over Google. Amazon and Airbnb both enjoy a huge amount of direct traffic. Some learnings from those:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Stellar mobile destination.</strong> Using Airbnb directly feels more fluid and fun than using Google for Airbnb.</li> <li><strong>The 90% Rule.</strong> To build reflex you need to give me what I want most of the time.** **With Prime, Amazon made it such that we stopped price comparing across other sites; Amazon would get it to us fastest, and that turns out to matter more than price. Most of the time you open Amazon.app, it satisfies.</li> <li><strong>Come for search, stay for something else.</strong> I don’t think of Airbnb or Amazon as search apps. They help me get things or book homes. You might want to your search app to be a destination for something else. This is where I think community comes in.</li> </ul> <p>Picking a vertical that <em>doesn’t</em> have strong typeahead completions[1] would help you build community around your search engine. Recipes, fitness, fashion, etc. don’t have decacorn conglomerates like Github or Reddit. That might mean it’s easier to build community around them, and put your flagship search engine on top.</p> <hr> <p>If you’re working on this kind of stuff, try out <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> or just shoot me an email – daniel@pioneer.app.</p> <hr> <p>[1] In reality I’d pick the vertical _I _love most. If you’re a guitar player start with music; a movie buff should build better Rotten Tomatos. Etc.</p> </article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
	   

<p>I accidentally stumbled upon something yesterday that I felt like
sharing, which fell squarely into the "why the hell didn’t I know about this
before?" category. In this post, I’ll describe how to manage
the various configuration files in your GNU/Linux home directory (aka
"dotfiles" like <code>.bashrc</code>) using GNU Stow.</p>

<p>The difficulty is that it would be helpful to manage one’s
configuration files with a version control system like Git, Mercurial
or Bazaar, but many/most dotfiles reside at the top-level of your home
directory, where it wouldn’t be a good idea to initialize a VCS
repository. Over time I’ve come across various programs which aim to
manage this for you by keeping all the files in a subdirectory and
then installing or linking them into their appropriate places. None of
those programs ever really appealed to me.  They would require a ton
of dependencies (like Ruby and a ton of libraries for it) or they
would require me to remember how to use them, which is difficult when
really for such a task you rarely use the program.</p>

<p>Lately I’ve been using <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/stow">GNU Stow</a> to manage
programs I install from source to <code>/usr/local/</code>. Basically, in this typical
usage, you install locally built packages to
<code>/usr/local/stow/${PKGNAME}-{PKGVERSION}</code> and then from <code>/usr/local/stow/</code> you run
<code># stow ${PKGNAME}-${PKGVERSION}</code> and the program generates symbolic links to
all the programs' files into the appropriate places under <code>/usr/local/</code>. Then,
when you uninstall a program via Stow, you don’t have to worry about any stray
files that you or a provide Makefile may have missed. It also makes handling
alternate versions of a program quite easy (i.e. when I’m experimenting with
different configurations of <a href="http://dwm.suckless.org/">dwm</a> or
<a href="http://st.suckless.org/">st</a>).</p>

<p>Some time ago I happened across a mailing list posting where someone described
using Stow to manage the installation of their dotfiles. I didn’t pay much
attention to it but my brain must have filed it away for later. Yesterday I
decided to give it a try and I have to say that it is so much more convenient
than those other dedicated dotfile-management programs, even if it wasn’t an
immediately obvious option.</p>

<p>The procedure is simple. I created the <code>${HOME}/dotfiles</code> directory and then
inside it I made subdirectories for all the programs whose cofigurations I
wanted to manage. Inside each of those directories, I moved in all the
appropriate files, maintaining the directory structure of my home directory. So,
if a file normally resides at the top level of your home directory, it would go
into the top level of the program’s subdirectory. If a file normally goes in the
default <code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/${PKGNAME}</code> location (<code>${HOME}/.config/${PKGNAME}</code>),
then it would instead go in <code>${HOME}/dotfiles/${PKGNAME}/.config/${PKGNAME}</code> and
so on. Finally, from the <code>dotfiles</code> directory, you just run <code>$ stow $PKGNAME</code>
and Stow will symlink all the package’s configuration files to the appropriate
locations. It’s then easy to make the <code>dotfiles</code> a VCS repository so you can
keep track of changes you make (plus it makes it so much easier to share
configurations between different computers, which was my main reason to do it).</p>

<p>For example, let’s say you want to manage the configuration for Bash, VIM and
Uzbl. Bash has a couple files in the top-level directory; VIM typically has your
.vimrc file on the top-level and a .vim directory; and Uzbl has files in
<code>${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/uzbl</code> and <code>${XDG_DATA_HOME}/uzbl</code>. So, your home directory
looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>home/
    brandon/
        .config/
            uzbl/
                [...some files]
        .local/
            share/
                uzbl/
                    [...some files]
        .vim/
            [...some files]
        .bashrc
        .bash_profile
        .bash_logout
        .vimrc
</code></pre>

<p>You would then create a <code>dotfiles</code> subdirectory and move all the files there:</p>

<pre><code>home/
    /brandon/
        .config/
        .local/
            .share/
        dotfiles/
            bash/
                .bashrc
                .bash_profile
                .bash_logout
            uzbl/
                .config/
                    uzbl/
                        [...some files]
                .local/
                    share/
                        uzbl/
                            [...some files]
            vim/
                .vim/
                    [...some files]
                .vimrc
</code></pre>

<p>Then, perform the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ cd ~/dotfiles
$ stow bash
$ stow uzbl
$ stow vim
</code></pre>

<p>And, voila, all your config files (well, symbolic links to them) are
all in the correct place, however disorganized that might be, while
the actual files are all neatly organized in your <code>dotfiles</code>
directory, which is easily turned into a VCS repo. One handy thing is
that if you use multiple computers, which may not have the same
software installed on them, you can pick and choose which
configurations to install when you need them. All of your dotfiles are
always available in your <code>dotfiles</code> directory, but if you don’t need
the configuration for one program, you simply don’t Stow it and thus
it does not clutter your home directory.</p>

<p>Well, that’s all there is to it. Hopefully someone else out there
finds this useful! I know I’ve found it to be a huge help.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><strong>Once upon a time,</strong> there were four little rabbits, and their names were Flopsy, Mopsy, Cottontail and Peter. They lived with their mother in a sandbank underneath the root of a very big fir tree. One day, their mother dropped them off at soccer practice and picked them up promptly afterward. When they got home, they all had bread and milk and blackberries.</p>
<p>That is roughly how the classic Beatrix Potter story from 1902 would go if it had been set in the American suburbs. But even if Potter hadnâ€™t set her books in Englandâ€™s Lake District, she would never have chosen a suburban setting. The suburbs kill the narrative adventure that is the lifeblood of childrenâ€™s literature.</p>
<p>Reading picture books to my children over the past 10 years, Iâ€™ve noticed how many of the stories shun a suburban setting. This is no accident: the tales that most grip the imagination of children (and adults), with few exceptions, require rural or urban locations for their drama and vitality.</p>
<p>To simplify, the antithesis of North American suburbia is walkability, and picture books with literary merit love walkability. Compelling childrenâ€™s stories require that their characters are able to navigate their setting at a pedestrian scale and pace. For example, in the US author Arnold Lobelâ€™s classic stories of the 1970s, Frog and Toad never appear in a car, despite being thoroughly anthropomorphised. What most draws the reader into the stories are the adventures that the amphibians experience between their houses â€“ in the meadow, the woods and the tall grass. They climb mountains and swim in ponds, but they also walk everywhere: to fly a kite, to buy ice-cream, to fulfil a to-do list.</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1372/insert-Frog-and-Toad.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>From <i>Adventures of Frog and Toad</i> by Arnold Lobel. <i>Image Â© the Estate of Arnold Lobel/Amazon</i></figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>The plots of the Frances stories of the 1960s and â€™70s written by Russell Hoban and illustrated by Lillian Hoban also revolve around walkability. Frances can walk to the general store and buy a tea set or a Chompo bar. Her trips on foot to her friendsâ€™ houses frequently initiate narrative adventure. â€˜Today is my wandering day,â€™ announces Francesâ€™s friend Albert, on which he likes to catch snakes, walk on fences and look for crow feathers. â€˜Wandering daysâ€™ in American suburbs, however, are infrequent or nearly impossible. Walkable environments preserve independence for the young, who are often the main characters in childrenâ€™s stories.</p>
<p>Both commutes are integral to the storiesâ€™ plots, enabling shenanigans for the zoo animals</p>
<p>Consider George and Martha as yet another example. The only cars we see them in are the bumper cars at the amusement park. The US writer and illustrator James Marshallâ€™s beloved hippopotamuses of the 1970s and â€™80s consistently engage meaningful, walkable destinations rather than sprawling subdivisions. They can hopscotch home after a visit to the store, comfort each other on their walk home from a scary movie, or push a bed to a picnic using roller skates.</p>
<p>In urban settings, walkability is closely <a href="https://transitcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Whos-On-Board-2016-7_12_2016.pdf" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">linked</a> to public transport, which is another narrative avenue for rich engagement with oneâ€™s environment. Accordingly, the number of picture books that feature trains and buses is significantly greater than the number of trains and buses that most Americans experience. Yet Iâ€™ve never seen a picture book that features a minivan or an SUV.</p>
<p>The zookeeper in Peggy Rathmannâ€™s <em>Good Night, Gorilla</em> (1994) lives within walking distance of the zoo. In Erin and Philip Steadâ€™s <em>A Sick Day for Amos McGee</em> (2011), the zookeeper takes the bus to work. Both commutes are integral to the storiesâ€™ plots, enabling shenanigans for the zoo animals.</p>
<p>Besides public transport, urban settings give other ample opportunities for their characters to explore their immediate environment. Cities are where weâ€™re more likely to find civic places, such as zoos, libraries or concert venues. Cities tend to have more diverse kinds of people and more intergenerational <a href="https://www.gu.org/resources/all-in-together-creating-places-where-young-and-old-thrive/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">activity</a> in both public and private places than in suburbia. Good picture books such as <em>Benâ€™s Trumpet</em> (1979) by Rachel Isadora and <em>A Chair for My Mother</em> (1982) by Vera Williams exploit these opportunities in their stories.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s one thing to find enviable walkability in Esphyr Slobodkinaâ€™s <em>Caps for Sale</em> (1940) or Margaret and <span>H A Reyâ€™s</span> <em>Curious</em> <em>George</em> series (1941-66) or Ludwig Bemelmansâ€™s <em>Madeline</em> series (1939-61) â€“ books written by European Ã©migrÃ©s to the US well before American housing developments and â€˜big boxâ€™ stores became the dominant <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/step-by-step-americans-are-sacrificing-the-right-to-walk" rel="noopener">pattern</a> of land use in the mid-20th century. But to continue to find dynamic city living in bestsellers such as Bernard Waberâ€™s <em>The House on East 88th Street</em> (1962) or Mo Willemsâ€™s <em>Knuffle</em> <em>Bunny</em> (2004) is revealing. (That both stories feature beautiful Victorian brownstones as their backdrop is a bonus.) Celebrated American childrenâ€™s books authors such as William Steig, the creator of Shrek, and Tomie dePaola consistently chose pre-modern settings for their stories, so the suburbs hardly even had a fighting chance.</p>

<p>More than any other works of fiction, picture books depend on their setting. When the automobile dominates the setting, the narrative dies faster than a trip down a cul-de-sac. Even when there are private modes of transportation in childrenâ€™s literature, they are ships, bicycles or hot-air balloons, where the transported are engaged with the world around them and the adventure or mystery that this world brings.</p>
<p>What we donâ€™t find in <em>Goodnight Moon</em> is the old lady driving her Chevy Suburban out of her subdivision to a Wal-Mart</p>
<p><strong>Of course, childrenâ€™s books</strong> are not marked exclusively by the narrative. The illustrations arguably play an even more important role. And there are multiple reasons, aside from the fact that the stories lack suburban settings, to avoid illustrations of the suburbs. One is that contemporary suburbs are often ugly. Another is that sprawl is hard to fit into a page. So, naturally, we donâ€™t find good childrenâ€™s books that feature pictures of â€˜snout housesâ€™ (with a garage that protrudes in front of the house, and typical of suburbs in the US and Canada), strip malls or parking lots. Instead, we find beautiful illustrations of the countryside and forest, such as in Jane Yolenâ€™s <em>Owl Moon</em> (1987) about a girl and her father who set out in the snow to look for an owl, or of the vibrant cityscape, as in Mordicai Gersteinâ€™s <em>The Man Who Walked Between the Towers</em> (2003) about Phillippe Petitâ€™s high-wire stunt in Manhattan, or the Paris of the <em>Madeline</em> stories.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the pictures display such stunningly beautiful and rich environments â€“ such as in <em>The Mysteries of Harris Burdick</em> (1984) by Chris Van Allsburg, or <em>Sidewalk Flowers</em> (2015) by JonArno Lawson and Sydney Smith â€“ that they carry the story with few or no words at all.</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1376/insert-sidewalk-flowers.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>From <i>Sidewalk Flowers</i> (2015) by JonArno Lawson and Sydney Smith. <i>Courtesy Walker Books</i></figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>In a number of cases, the setting for a childrenâ€™s picture book isnâ€™t relevant to the argument Iâ€™m making here because the setting has nothing do with the built environment or the natural environment. In some picture books (for example, Drew Daywaltâ€™s <em>The Day the Crayons Quit</em> (2013), illustrated by Oliver Jeffers) thereâ€™s really no setting to speak of. In other cases, the setting is entirely indoors or entirely fantastical. Itâ€™s not enough that a story takes place exclusively within a single-family home for it to count as suburban. Margaret Wise Brown and Clement Hurdâ€™s <em>Goodnight Moon</em> (1947) could well be suburban, but it also could be rural. What we donâ€™t find in <em>Goodnight Moon</em> is the old lady driving her Chevy Suburban out of her subdivision of single-family homes to a Wal-Mart for some sleeping pills.</p>
<p>Itâ€™s true that some popular picture books do seem to have a suburban setting: Victoria Kannâ€™s <em>Pinkalicious</em> series (2006-), the <em>Berenstain Bears</em> series (1962-) by the Berenstain family, and Norman Bridwellâ€™s <em>Clifford the Big Red Dog</em> (1963-) come to mind. But these books also come to mind when I consider books Iâ€™d rather burn than read â€“ not because they take place in the suburbs but because theyâ€™re so poorly written and illustrated. My only claim here is that <em>the best</em> childrenâ€™s books forgo suburbia.</p>
<p>There are, nevertheless, some exceptions to this rule. In Judith Viorst and Ray Cruzâ€™s classic 1972 picture book, for example, Alexander appears to be chauffeured around the suburbs by his mother; in that scenario, who wouldnâ€™t be having a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day? But for every quality picture book that has a suburban setting, there are 100 that donâ€™t.</p>
</div><div><figure data-align="center"><img src="https://d2e1bqvws99ptg.cloudfront.net/user_image_upload/1375/inset-Town-Mouse-Country-Mouse-T9MMF4.jpg" alt="" title=""><figcaption>Illustration for Aesopâ€™s fable <i>The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</i>. <i>Photo by Alamy</i></figcaption></figure></div><div>
<p>At least since Aesopâ€™s fable <em>The Town Mouse and the Country Mouse</em>, many childrenâ€™s stories exhibit a kind of anti-urban romanticism, of which Virginia Lee Burtonâ€™s <em>The Little House</em> (1942) is one memorable example. Cities are dangerous and dirty places in contrast to the idyllic countryside. Books set in cities often react against this trend by showing the benefits of city life. Yet this counter-reaction is, arguably, guilty of romanticising the urban. Childrenâ€™s books that use pedestrian settings, whether urban or rural, fall prey to both kinds of romanticisation, displaying exclusively the attractiveness of a walkable town or a tranquil forest. However, the accuracy of these portrayals is not the point of the settings. Rather, their job is to serve the narrative and delight the reader.</p>
<p>Childrenâ€™s literature thrives on imaginative or surprising encounters, which need a geography that creates mischief and curiosity. But the suburbs, for all their benefits in real life, are places that in childrenâ€™s literature lack imagination, or at least donâ€™t provide suitable stage-sets for imaginative adventure and exploration: …</p></div></div></div>

Eamon and I are  both first year students at the Olin College of Engineering at the time of publishing. </p><h2>The ‘abstract’ - a big picture overview of what we did:</h2><p>Over our first semester at Olin, in an entrepreneurial spirit we learned and redeveloped Corewars: a 30 year-old computational-thinking game. Corewars was fascinating because of its potential to be used as a powerful logical programming framework. The way players could use simple assembly commands to execute code visually and manipulate data held much promise for complex logical problem-solving both in a competitive or collaborative nature. </p><p>After eye-opening discussions with Indian engineering and computer science professors, it appeared that there was a need for a scalable method to build students’ creative problem solving skills. We developed Corewars as a game-based educational software, similar to MIT’s Scratch in some ways. At the end of the semester, as Adi had a chance to visit India, we completed development and used the game as a teaching tool for undergraduate computer science students. We tested the game and pedagogy by presenting the approach and teaching the game to groups of professors and students in person at India’s premier private research university.</p><p><strong>View what we <a href="https://corewarstechalpha.herokuapp.com/">built in action</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/aramachandran7/corewars">source code</a>!</strong></p><p>Below, we document our process, learnings, and what we seek to do in the future in detail.</p><p><undefined>

    </undefined>  </p><p><em>Eamon and I before we knew what we were getting ourselves into</em></p><h2>The Backstory</h2><p>Last September, as two first-year engineering students who’d just hardly moved into Olin, Eamon and I realized we wanted to work together on “something something entrepreneurship”. It was vague, it was naïve, but it was genuine.</p><p>After a <em>painful</em> ideation process, echoed by other college students interested in entrepreneurship, we eventually settled in the education space. </p><p>Adi had been talking with a machine learning professor, born and raised in the USA, who now teaches masters students at a top ranked private university in India. At the time, the professor, Amar, had been complaining about some of his masters students. </p><p>They struggled to creatively problem-solve. </p><p>Amar would give them an open ended engineering challenge - perhaps to optimize a device for weight, or to increase the efficiency of an algorithm. Instead of asking follow up questions, inspecting the device or reading through the algorithm, most of Amar’s students would ask him one simple question. </p><p><em>‘Sir, what is my next step?’</em> </p><p>Students would have the tendency to expect to be spoon fed; they were expecting problems like what you’d find in a text book, where Amar would have the answers and he was simply waiting for them to get the problem right or wrong. </p><p><strong>Yet no engineering projects or challenges or jobs are like this</strong> - they’re open ended, require creativity, problem-solving and collaboration skills (yes, let’s just throw all the buzzwords in). </p><p><strong>We’ve heard that from a young age, many Indian students are taught by the education system that education is the ability to pass tests and memorize or ‘mug’ facts, formulas, or spellings.</strong> </p><p>For Amar, he could spend hours with each student in 1:1’s, working through open-ended challenges and helping his students develop a better creative edge. But no professor has that amount of time. Moreover, we believed that Amar’s problems were echoed throughout the country. <strong>Our question became, how do you build creative intuition for students, at scale and cheaply?</strong></p><p>So that was it. Naively, we set out on our journey to solve what we liked to call the ‘creativity-problem’ in the Indian education system. Get students to problem solve with an entirely different mental framework. Somehow figure out a curriculum or an exercise radical enough to undo ~14 years of teaching. </p><p>And on top of all this, whatever we made magically needed to be business-viable. We needed to balance our desire for solving important social problems with creating a sustainable product that people would use.</p><h2>The Start</h2><p>Initially, we knew nothing about the space, other than what Amar had told us. Therefore, we figured we had to start with talking to people. We assumed that because of the very bureaucratic state of the majority of India’s top  engineering / technical institutions, selling any software to institutions / universities would be downright impossible. </p><p>And students wouldn’t be the ones paying for software like this - they had no idea that the ‘creativity-problem’ was even a problem. Thus professors became our target market. <strong>Talking to Indian engineering professors was our first step.</strong> Through one connection or another, we tracked down and interviewed a number of engineering and computer science professors from IIT, NITT, BITS Pilani, and a couple other highly ranked Indian engineering schools.</p><p>While verifying the ‘creativity-problem’ was the focus of our interviews, we focused on asking open-ended questions to get a better feel for the space we were in. </p><p>Our interviewing style and questions looked something like this. </p><p><em>Describe, in-depth, some of the problems within the undergraduate engineering education system? What about solutions you’ve seen? If you could change one thing about the system, what would it be?</em> </p><p><em>Questions about students - What do you like about your students? What do they do particularly well in? What does your ideal class / teaching style look like, and what is it usually like? What’s preventing you from achieving this?</em></p><p>To summarize our interviews, Indian professors described to us a world unlike anything we’d ever seen. It almost seemed like if we had been interested in the Indian higher ed space, Amar wouldn’t have been the right person to start off with. He was an extreme early adopter, an extreme edge case with very progressive educational opinions. Most of the professors we talked to were nothing like him, and appeared mostly ok with the status quo. </p><p>And after talking to a few students, the picture changed more, both filling in some gaps, but also confusing us even more. </p><p>Here’s a rough picture we formed in our heads combining what we heard from engineering/CS students and professors. </p><ul><li>The overall large lecture hall environment isn’t conducive to students being engaged in class. Although teachers complain about some of their students’ internal motivation for learning, teachers themselves often aren’t thinking about feedback or changing their own instructional styles. </li><li>While not the case in every college, in certain courses the only metric for student learning is the final - incentivizing students to not attend lectures and memorize the content the night before. </li><li>And lastly, for many students, college represents a tremendous amount of newfound freedom. This can mess with their ability to study, work hard, and stay motivated; and oftentimes, a student culture of procrastination and disengagement can be prominent and even will spread to motivated students. </li></ul><p>These problems are really tough. We were taken aback after hearing the students’ perspectives the first time, especially coming from a place like Olin. </p><p>But Amar had convinced us that these were problems worth solving, no matter their difficulty; giving up was not an option. We decided that we wanted to brainstorm more and try mashing together our ideas with some of the problems we’d heard through interviews. </p><p>Here are the needs that we believed professors had.</p><ul><li>Reduce what we called the Gap - incoming undergraduate engineering and CS students’ backgrounds, motivation, and pre-existing knowledge was extremely varied, and resulted in some students not being satisfied with the content. </li><li>Increase student motivation - from the professors’ point of view, many students weren’t there to do much other than pass the tests.  </li><li>Enable professors to engage more closely with students’ current culture - professors felt like they were out of sync with the students and their habits.  </li><li>Increase employability - how easy it was to get a job out of college was a key metric that was brought up by professors several times. </li></ul><h2>What we decided to do:</h2><p>With this all in place, we decided to move forwards with a <em>game based software</em> that: </p><ul><li>Would have a low ‘barrier of entry’<ul><li>Be easy for students from any background to pick up </li><li>Be visual and simplistic to wrap your head around</li><li>Have some level of a competitive / addictive nature and well defined metrics of success</li></ul></li><li>Act as a teaching tool to build students’ creativity and collaboration skills</li><li>Be at least tangentially related to engineering / CS </li><li>Have a way for teachers to track progress, assign grades, etc. after giving it to students as a ‘homework’ assignment</li></ul><p><strong>Games still require the open-ended problem solving that makes projects so hard, but at the same time don’t require learning technical skills.</strong> This meant that students could focus on learning and practicing problem solving skills, without the overhead of having to pick up new technical skills.</p><p>We decided to rebuild, reimagine, and repurpose an old computer game - Corewars - for the task. Corewars is a game from the 80’s, where two programs fight it out over a limited memory buffer. It’s interesting because the programs exist within the same memory buffer that they are trying to take over — each program’s code can be modified, overwritten or even hijacked by the opponent. The programs themselves are written in a pseudo assembly language called Redcode, with 23 commands including simple operations like adding and multiplying, to more complicated ones that can create new processes or copy memory.</p><p>The technical challenges we faced can be broadley broken up into backend and frontend implementation. For the backend, we had to create what was in essence a simple assembly compiler. It would have to take in two processes written in Redcode, then execute them in an empty memory buffer. For the frontend, we had to create a clear visualization of what the processes were doing, and also had to …</p></div></div>

<p>Not Being Bullish Enough on Bitcoin is a big mistake. Why? You’ll sell too early, and not grasp Bitcoin well enough to get the big picture here. You might not secure the coins well enough, and you might not actually realise the societal implications of Bitcoin. </p>



<h2>Not Being Bullish Enough On Bitcoin Means Selling too early</h2>



<p>Fundamentally, a lot of people did not truly peer into <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/185">what Bitcoin is</a>, and this made them not bullish enough. This is a big error, as it pushes them to sell bitcoin too early. While they think they’re being clever timing a top, Bitcoin proceeds to humble them a few years later after another cycle. </p>



<p>Lopp has a great example here: </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>At time of writing in Dec 2020, Bitcoin is now around $23,000 USD. Selling early is penny wise, pound foolish. </p>



<p>Many people wish they had bought bitcoin earlier, but truth be told: that’s only half the challenge. The other half is actually HODLing it through the long term and not selling it out. </p>



<p>As bitcoin old-timers in the space will tell you, you could have bought early… but then you probably would have also sold early. It takes understanding and conviction.</p>



<h2>Not Being Bullish Enough On Bitcoin Means Not Securing it Correctly</h2>



<p>It’s a wild roller-coaster. Bitcoin can 10x in the space of a few months, and you can be left <em>very</em> exposed if you’re not careful. A $10k bitcoin stack can quickly become $100k, a $100k stack can quickly become $1M and so on. </p>



<p>Consider the worth of your stack currently, and think about if Bitcoin were to 10x or 20x over a few months or a year. Would you be comfortable with the level of security you have? </p>



<p>If you aren’t bullish enough, and you’re only looking for a 2x and then flip for fiat profits, you aren’t thinking big enough. You should be looking to learn about bitcoin security by listening to SLP such as <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/97">SLP97</a> and <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/215">SLP215</a> with Michael Flaxman. You should be looking at ways to: </p>



<ul><li>Ensure appropriate entropy in your bitcoin seed generation </li><li>Minimise single points of failure</li><li>Consider multi signature</li><li>In the ideal case, use open source hardware and software that has been vetted from a security perspective</li><li>Learn about how to verify signatures for software you use</li><li>Learn hardware wallet best practices</li></ul>



<h2>Not learning enough about how to use Bitcoin the right way</h2>



<p>When we talk about using Bitcoin, we mean using it in a self sovereign way. You shouldn’t be in a situation where you are exclusively trusting or relying on your service provider to give you your bitcoins. </p>



<p>This is not stocks or dollars in your bank account. This is Bitcoin. Use it the self sovereign way. </p>



<p>In practice this means: </p>



<ul><li>Don’t leave your coins in custodial accounts. Use sovereign bitcoin wallets where you hold the private keys. Or at least, a quorum of private keys (e.g. you hold 2 of 3 keys, or 4 of 5 keys). </li><li>Ideally, perform your own validation by running your own underlying bitcoin node. This is easy with <a href="https://www.ministryofnodes.com.au/2020/09/28/cost-effective-bitcoin-use-hardware-wallet-own-node/">Specter Desktop + Bitcoin Core</a>, or with <a href="https://www.ministryofnodes.com.au/2020/03/26/mynode-video-tutorials/">myNode</a>, or other projects e.g. Umbrel, <a href="http://raspiblitz.com/">RaspiBlitz</a>, <a href="http://ronindojo.io/">Ronin Dojo</a>, <a href="http://btcpayserver.org/">BTCPay Server</a>, <a href="http://nodl.it/">nodl</a> etc. </li></ul>



<h2>Not realising the societal implications of Bitcoin</h2>



<p>Fiat money has cultural consequences that many simply do not understand right now. It’s like we’re fish swimming in the water without realising what we’re swimming in. We’ve grown up in an environment of cheap debt, facing incentives to go into debt or lose. </p>



<p>This drives all kinds of changes in our society that weren’t so obvious pre-1971. Increased welfare statism, increased debt, higher time preference, increased centralisation into managerial superstates, to name a few. </p>



<p>As Bitcoin becomes more widely adopted, society’s return to hard money will drive significant cultural shifts that align with the return to hard money. Listen to <a href="http://stephanlivera.com/51">SLP51 with Guido Hulsmann</a> to know more.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Fundamentally, it takes knowledge, conviction, and dedication to do this. There are many pitfalls along the way, and it takes work from the HODLer to methodically and skilfully avoid these pitfalls. Of course, we can lament the difficulty and push it off til the future when it’ll be easier. But that is also giving up the huge return potential, and also the freedom and moral imperative of bringing about a Bitcoin Standard. </p>



<p>Do your research and learning, be methodical in your approach, and you’ll be in with a good shot. </p>

</p><h2>1 Introduction</h2>

<p>ASCII is an acronym of "American Standard Code for Information
Interchange". ASCII art means art made out of different characters in
the ASCII map and can thus be represented in plain text format. It
cannot include extended characters or text formatting such as bold or
italics. ASCII art is always done on a fixed-width font like Courier
New or Fixedsys, never on a proportional font like Arial or Times New
Roman. It can be made in Notepad or MS-DOS Edit, but there are also
some specific programs for making ASCII art. And no, I'm not talking
about ASCII converters.</p><p>
People often comment on ASCII art by saying "Wow, that is so amazing,
I'd never have the patience to make something like that". I don't get
it. Why do they think ASCII art requires so much patience? I can make a
decent fullscreen ASCII in an hour (even if it sometimes takes ten
hours). It takes me at least fifteen hours to draw a decent fullscreen
CG picture.</p><p>
ASCII art isn't easy and it does require skill, but you don't have to
care about things like brush strokes or colors and usually not about
shading either. In a way it is a lot like pixel art. When I started
pixeling it felt very familiar due to my ASCII and ANSI experience.
Pixel artists will probably experience a similar reaction when they
start drawing ASCII. You don't have to have great drawing skills to be
a good ASCII artist. I, for instance, suck at drawing, I can paint but
I can't do the sketch like thing at all. ASCII sketching is practically
something non-existant, but if this interests you, nothing stops you
from trying this new style.</p><p>
Some people wonder what's the point. What's the point in making art in
general? I think limitations are what makes art interesting and feeds
the creative mind. ASCII art probably isn't something that you
encounter in an art museum (which is regrettable), it's more like
everyday art. I guess it has something in common with pop art. ASCII
art can be sent via email or to Usenet newsgroups, it can be
used on IRC and many chatrooms (do that with caution, though). You can
include ASCII art in your signature or login screen or print it out
with your old matrix printer. It can be used for representing game
situations, graphs or molecular models.</p><p>
I've heard opinions of ASCII art not being art but graphical design,
but I disagree with that. Design is usually considered to be something
functional, such as advertisements or interfaces, while visual art is
something you can hang on your walls. ASCII art usually isn't
functional but aesthetical. I know people who have ASCII pictures
hanging on their walls.</p><p>

There are other ASCII tutorials, but I decided there's still room
for another one. Many of the others are outdated, some are even more
than 10 years old. They also feature slightly different techniques and
lack some of the parts that my tutorial focuses on. This turned out
perhaps more like a ASCII drawing/culture FAQ than an actual tutorial,
but I hope it will still be useful.

</p><h2>2 Types of ASCII art</h2>

<h4>2.1 Lineart</h4>

<div><p>Lineart is just what its name implies, things are represented with
(usually thin) outlines, sometimes dotty, sometimes consisting mostly
of slashes, underscores and pipes. Lineart also includes most FIGlet
fonts and demoscene logos. Suitable for both huge images and tiny
pictures.</p></div><pre>            .-"""-.

<h4>2.2 Solid</h4>

<div><p>Solid art is the "opposite" of lineart, it's not outlined but filled
and flat-shaded.
It's often best fit on mid-sized and large pictures, though it can also
work for small pieces, such as the heart here. Often it looks better
than lineart, simply for the fact that it's not as "thin". Solid art is
often used for logos, ornament designs and text, but it fits almost any
kind of subject. It's not very well suited for faces though.</p></div><pre>  ,o8o, ,o8o,

<h4>2.3 Grayscale</h4>

<div><p>Grayscale is like solid art, but it consists of many different
characters that are used to portrays lighter and darker areas, making
it the most suitable kind of ASCII for picturing faces. It is usually
best viewed white on black, such as the example below (people using
most graphical browsers can select it with a mouse or press Ctrl-A to
see it in inverse color). Most converters create grayscale art, though
rather messy kind with often no antialiasing. Grayscale could be
considered the most difficult of all ASCII techniques.</p></div><pre>                           .,,,yyyy@@yyyyy,,,

<h4>2.4 Camelized</h4>

<p>Camelized ASCII art isn't very popular, even though it already appeared
in
the book Alice in Wonderland. It is usually poetry (sometimes prose)
made into the shape of an object, often an animal. There are a couple
of different techniques for making the shapes. Some people use extra
spacing to achieve lines of required length, others wrap words from the
middle or use extra characters. JavE has a feature for camelized ASCII.

			This much I knew:
			<br>
				In the future, all cities would look like the one that appeared behind Kaptain Kool &amp; the Kongs on Saturday morning's <i>Krofft Supershow</i>. Bloated, curvaceous structures — engineered by the same people who designed Corvette Stingrays and Yes album covers — built out of shiny fiberglass, pristine chrome, and pulsating neon light -- Tomorrow's city would be a Space Age coral reef, teeming with millions of funky life forms, its limitless nooks and enclaves seething with parties, discos, arcades, and mind-blowing good times....

			My van would be more than just a mode of transportation... It would be my spaceship for navigating the Strip.
			<br>
				The Strip would eventually encompass the world. Domed cities would interconnect across continents , and hamster-tube highways would extend down into the ocean so that you could cruise the aquatic sea-cities. 
			<br>
				Your van could literally take you anywhere on Planet Earth. Maybe not as fast as a Concorde jet, but speed wasn't important. Getting there was all the fun.

			What I would be doing for a living? I didn't care. According OMNI magazine, the technological changes of the 
			Eighties were going to be so <i>vast</i>, so <i>profound</i>, that the job market would be unrecognizable by the time I entered the workforce.
			</p><p>
			
				Nearly any job I trained for now would be obsolete by 1990. Computers and solar-powered robot factories would be doing most of the work. Consumer goods would be mostly free, and the U.N. would be paying us all not to work.

			The important things in human life — sex, technology, hedonism, and the peaceful exploration of inner and outer space — these would occupy most of our time as a new Golden Age dawned for humanity. No matter where you went, you would find millions of groovy freaks boogying down, partying hearty, and tossing off symphonies, rocketship designs, and cures for cancer as freely as a tree drops fruit. Human civilization would have truly begun....

I'm not going anywhere in particular. I just have to lose myself in the suburbs for a few hours. I'll creep back later in the day. Hopefully my housemates will be gone and I can sneak back into my room.

		The locale I'm trapped in is<b> Santa Luna,</b> California, a sleepy seaside college town 

 situated 50 miles west of Silicon Valley. If exciting things are happening in Silicon Valley, 
you surely won't hear about them here. 

Santa Luna is its own self-contained bubble reality, a sort of hippy-dippy alternate universe that might have branched off from ours
if McGovern had won the 1972 presidential election. 
</p><p>
Tourists call this town "charming." For me, being stuck here after I've  graduated
feels a lot like bathing in my own urine.

For those of you who either weren't alive, or weren't paying attention at the time:
</p><p>
Back in 1983 an old acidhead named William Gibson sat down at his
Hermes 3000 manual typewriter and banged out what was to become
the most popular science fiction novel of that decade...
</p><p>
Concerning people plugging their brains directly into their
computers, Gibson's novel was originally titled <i>Jacked In.</i></p><p>
The publishers feared this sounded too much like "jacked off",
and changed the title to a more marketable <i>Neuromancer</i>.

	</p></div>

<!--~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-->


<li>
	<div>
	<p><img src="http://www.electricsheepcomix.com/almostguy/images/30_neuromancer.gif"></p><div><p>


This little book of his was to cause quite a stir...</p><p>

<i>Neuromancer</i> had a tremendous cultural impact, not the least of which was the introduction of a new word into the English language 
— <i><b>cyberspace</b></i>.
</p><p>
In subsequent years, the prefix "cyber-" sort of broke off and did its own <i>thing...</i></p></div>

	<div>
	<p><img src="http://www.electricsheepcomix.com/almostguy/images/30_cyberexpo93.gif"></p><div><p>
Which brings us to the year 1993 and the first annual <b>“Cyber Expo.”</b></p><p>

For the past few years I had been reading about a newly emerging <b> “cyberculture” </b>
in exciting new magazines with names like <i>Phringe Surfer, FutureShock, Cyborgasm, Digital Frontier</i>, and <i>Fast Forward.</i></p><p>
In May of 1993 I scraped together my month's grocery money and made the Greyhound bus trip to San Francisco. 
I was <i>finally</i> going to meet the movers and shakers of this cyberculture face to face!
Smart drug entrepreneurs, multimedia artists, hackers, inventors of mindblowing new technologies,
<i>all</i> would be congregating here in this one space.

It was already 1993, and the future  I'd imagined in 1978 was running a little behind schedule.</p><p>

Was it possible that here and now, the future was off to a proper start?</p><p>

Would I  finally  find the community I'd always hoped for? </p><p> Would I, at last,  discover  “my” people?

The presentation was called “Cyber Revolution: Power to the People” and it was attended by some of the hippest of the California "Digerati".
</p><p>
I took the opportunity to buttonhole an editor I'd been petitioning for several months. His name was Sparky West and he was editor-in-chief of 
<i>Fast Forward</i>, one of the seminal cyberculture magazines.
</p><p>
Their motto: <i>"Made for the Smartest People on Earth."</i></p><p>
(Yes,<i> I know.</i> That should have been my first warning.)

</p><p>
808 and Guinness proved to be a bad mix; but then, I wasn't really in a partying mood to begin with.

It was a crowded bathroom, as bathrooms usually are at these events... 
Stoned ravers stampeding in to empty their bladders of all the $7-a-bottle mountain-spring water 
and “smart-drinks” they've been guzzling on the dancefloor. 


</p><p>

I knew I was taking more than my fair timeshare in this stall, so I wasn't too surprised when this random guy came barging in..... obviously needing the toilet for the same reasons I did...

December 26, 2020 | https://jerseyfonseca.com/projects/bujo | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://jerseyfonseca.com/projects/bujo">archive.org</a>

        <p>
            My first successful open source project was <a href="https://github.com/vuciv/vim-bujo">Vim Bujo</a>, a task manager that you 
            can use straight from any vim session. You can access a general todo list, or a project specific one.
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://jerseyfonseca.com/projects/images/bujo/bujo.png"></p><h2>Coming up with the Idea</h2>
        <p>
            I typically use todo lists, but I've never been able to find anything 
            better than good 'ol pen and paper. I've tried the most popular apps, 
            but I just couldn't get into them. Switching screens from my work to mark 
            something as complete just kind of ruined the flow for me. On top of that, 
            all these apps were bloated with features I didn't want or need.
        </p>
        <p>
            For many years, I just stuck to pen and paper, but I was always looking for
            something digital. There had to be some technology that gave me the satisfaction and 
            organization of marking tasks as completed without interrupting my workflow! Well, I never found it...

            I was getting into vim last year. You know how when you're learning about something new, 
            you start to see it everywhere? Like, the first time I learned Mechanics, I would think 
            about all the forces interacting whenever I took a step. Well, I was experiencing that, 
            except for vim. One day, I was jotting my ideas on a todo list  
            and I had an epiphany. "I can open a todo list straight from the file I'm working on!" 
            And so spawned the idea of a Vim Bullet Journal, or, Vim Bujo. 
            It was a vim plugin that I actually wanted to use. 
        </p>
        <h2>Making It</h2>
        <p>
           I had no experience with building vim plugins, or using vimscript, the language vim plugins are written in. 
           My first step was to checkout Steve Losh's "Creating a Full Plugin" from his book, 
           <a href="https://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/">Learn Vimscript the Hard Way</a>. After skimming 
           through, I was able to get a pretty good idea of the file structure, but was still lacking on specifics, and 
           to be frank, did not have the time to read through the other 40+ chapters of Steve Losh's book. 
           To fill this gap in my knowledge, I decided to learn my favorite way: reading other people's code!
        </p>
        <p>
            I find just looking at other people's code is always a great way to get started. I don't mean copying, or 
            anything. I just mean looking at functional code, logic flows, and more high-level components. I decided to 
            check out some of <a href="https://github.com/tpope">Tim Pope's</a> projects. He is one of the most famous 
            and prolific vim plugin creators out there - and all his code is open source! Take advantage of things like this! 
            It's a gold mine!
        </p>
        <p>
            Well, from then on, I built the simplest version I can; it did everything it needed to do. When you typed ":Todo", 
            a new file would open and dock to your window. From here, you can use keybindings to enter a new task, or mark one 
            as completed. I tested it out, and it was exactly what I had been looking for. Okay, I probably overhyped it a little 
            to myself since I'm the one that made it... But it felt good, and was definitely something I wanted to use.
        </p>
        <h3>Adding Git Integration</h3>
        <p>
            So far, I was pretty happy with my project! Someone ended up making a really good feature request, though. 
            They asked if I can have git integration so that a project specific todo list would open up if you are in 
            a git repo. It turned out to be pretty easy!
        </p>
        <p>
            Git has a userful command called <code>git rev-parse --is-inside-work-tree</code>. If this returned <code>true</code>, we would 
            use <code>git rev-parse --show-toplevel</code> to get the name of the toplevel directory and make a todo file named 
            after the project repo you are in.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adding git integration wasn't a challenge at all, but I thought it was cool enough that I should include it! 
            Also, git integration just makes my project sound cooler, and that's what it's all about, right?
        </p>
        <h3>Where do I Store the Todo Files?</h3>
        <p>
            Once git integration existed, I needed to think about where I'd be storing these files on users' computers. 
            I originally just had a dotfile at the root directory of the project, but this wasn't optimal. Luckily, a user 
            presented a solution so simple it made me hit myself in the head. Just make a <code>~/.cache/bujo</code> folder where all 
            this would be stored! It wouldn't bother users at all, and if that wasn't good for them, they can set their 
            own filepath in their vimrc.
        </p>
        <h2>Marketing It</h2>
        <p>
            I gotta admit, I am pretty bad when it comes to marketing. I constantly delete my social medias, and so I never 
            build up an audience to share my creations with. Luckily, I had something genuine to share that communities 
            tend to receive well. I wasn't trying to spam anyone, I wasn't trying to get something from them, I was just 
            sharing what I made. Here were my most successful avenues:
        </p>
        <h3><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim">r/vim</a> on Reddit</h3>
        <p><img src="https://jerseyfonseca.com/projects/images/bujo/reddit.PNG"></p><p>
            My <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/hf98bu/vimbujo_a_minimalist_todo_list/">reddit post</a> was 
            probably the most successful avenue! I got 300+ upvotes, and engaged with around 20 people in the comments. 
            They offered me feedback, and I implemented it. This was the most important part of getting people to use it.
        </p>
        <h3>Discord</h3>
        <p>
            <a href="https://twitter.com/ThePrimeagen">The Primeagen</a> is the person who got me into vim. 
            His videos and streams are phenomenal and I love following him. I was also in his discord and asked 
            him if I'd be able to share my plugin in his channel. He said yes, and on top of that, he even started 
            using it! This didn't get me many users, but he started using it! Sometimes, when he's going through 
            his .vimrc, I see my plugin! This was by far the coolest part for me.
        </p>
        <h2>Results</h2>
        <p>
            This was the first thing I've ever made that people actually used.
            <a href="https://github.com/vuciv/vim-bujo">On github</a>, people were contributing, logging issues, making feature requests, 
            and even forking the project to expand on it! I ended with over 100 stars, 
            which may not sound like much, but is a huge milestone for me. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The most important thing I learned here was to build things I want to use.
            If I find it useful, odds are somone else finds it useful too!
        </p>

</section>
<p>When I joined my first startup almost ten years ago, most of the prevailing wisdom about startups said that you should be ready for an 80-hour per week grind. So, I made it my mission to work longer and harder than anyone else on the path to success.</p>
<p>At that time, I didn’t have a family, significant other, or many hobbies outside of work, plus I liked my job, so it was relatively easy to put in long hours and work weekends. While I did a lot of tasks in those early days, looking back, I realize that <em>I didn’t actually accomplish much.</em></p>
<p>After working for three early-stage startups and <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/cto-writer">founding my own in 2020</a>, I’ve talked to countless founders about startup hours, pacing, burnout, and hustling. I’ve since seen a lot of founders fall into the trap of working more hours instead of working smarter, so in this post, I’ll give you my perspective on why this happens. Finally, I’ll share a few things that I’ve learned about maintaining balance in a startup from both an employee’s and founder’s perspective.</p>
<h2 id="typical-startup-hours">“Typical” Startup Hours</h2>
<p>One of the challenging things about joining a startup is that there are rarely “typical” work hours. Some startups expect employees to be in the office from 8 am to 8 pm every day and answer emails on the weekend, while others might allow complete flexibility with very little concern over hours worked.</p>
<p><strong>While it’s <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/myths-working-engineer-startup">a myth that every startup requires you to work overtime every week</a>, most startup employees put in 50-60 hours per week, and many founders put in 60-100 per week.</strong></p>
<p>The problem with long hours is that they’re counterproductive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“John Pencavel found that productivity per hour declines sharply when a person works more than 50 hours a week. After 55 hours, productivity drops so much that putting in any more hours would be pointless. And, those who work up to 70 hours a week are only getting the same amount of work done as those who put in the 55 hours.” - <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/20/stanford-study-longer-hours-doesnt-make-you-more-productive-heres-how-to-get-more-done-by-doing-less.html">CNBC Report on Standford Productivity Study</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://amzn.to/2WjbkL5"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Vn2qohv.jpg" alt="Bored and Brilliant book cover"></a></p>
<p>Your body ultimately needs sleep, food, relaxation, and <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/how-and-why-you-should-be-bored"><em>even boredom</em></a> to function properly. This is especially true for those of us who do <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/eight-hour-workday-is-a-lie/">high-concentration, creative work</a> (like writing, programming, and strategic thinking).</p>
<p>One of my favorite reads in 2019 was <em><a href="https://amzn.to/2WjbkL5">Bored and Brilliant</a></em> because it reminded me of the need to put down my phone and just think every once in a while. Regular introspection leads to clarity, focus, and prioritization that is extremely valuable as a startup founder.</p>
<p><em>Looking for more good startup books? I’ve listed <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books">a few dozen of my favorites here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="why-are-startup-hours-so-long">Why Are Startup Hours so Long?</h2>
<p>So if the research is against long hours for most people, why do startup founders work so much? And, why do they, in turn, expect their employees to do the same?</p>
<p>There are four factors I see at play in defining startup working hours:</p>
<h3 id="1-hustle-culture">1. Hustle Culture</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“I don’t think it’s fair for people to say that they work 100 hours. That’s just a PR move, like when Elon Musk sleeps on a hard couch in a meeting room. Why couldn’t he have a nice bed delivered to his office?” - <a href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-hours-per-day-do-startup-employees-work-compared-to-those-at-a-regular-company/answer/Nope-Nope-351">Anonymous opinion on Quora</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>You might think of startup founders as original, free-thinking, creative people, but most of them are just as vulnerable to peer pressure and cultural norms as any of us. So, when high-profile startup founders report that they <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/elon-musk-sleeps-under-desk-as-tesla-faces-model-3-production-goals-2018-6">slept at the office</a>, other founders see this as a template for success. Some even <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/04/why-some-men-pretend-to-work-80-hour-weeks">lie about the number of hours they work</a> because of the cultural pressure to put in more time.</p>
<h3 id="2-work-life-separation-is-dwindling">2. Work-Life Separation is Dwindling</h3>
<p>It’s even harder to “unplug” from work when your office is six feet away from your bedroom, and your phone goes to bed with you at night. Now that more companies are going remote, employees <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-19-lockdown-work-from-home-day-one-hour-longer/">are working longer hours</a> and having more meetings in what would be off-hours.</p>
<p>The problem is even more pronounced for startup founders. They are often betting their financial future on their new business or so wildly passionate about the problem they solve that it’s next to impossible to “turn it off.”</p>
<h3 id="3-external-pressure">3. External Pressure</h3>
<p>Building a business requires making promises to a lot of people. As a founder, you’re telling employees that they’ll have a job, you’re telling customers that you’ll deliver value, and you’re promising your family that all this sacrifice will be worth it someday. These pressures are amplified when startups raise money because venture-funded startups have a board who might watch the founders closely to make sure they’re working as hard as possible to get them the return they expect.</p>
<p>Once these external pressures are internalized, companies tend to build a culture that encourages long hours. Managers then reward employees who put in the most time, and employees come to expect these working conditions. You can see this vicious cycle most prominently in <a href="https://abovethelaw.com/2019/12/the-biglaw-firm-where-associates-are-putting-in-the-most-working-hours/">law and consulting</a> where billable hours are a badge of honor.</p>
<h3 id="4-gatekeeping">4. Gatekeeping</h3>
<p>This might be controversial, but I believe that part of the reason startups tout their commitments to long hours is as a form of gatekeeping.</p>
<p>When you require everyone in your company to work 60+ hour weeks, you exclude people who have a family at home, kids they need to pick up from school, or mental health issues. This disproportionately hurts minorities, single parents, older workers, and <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/16/working-long-hours-harms-women-but-protects-men-study-shows/">women</a>, and it’s part of the reason we see fewer underrepresented groups in startups.</p>
<p>This isn’t always the case though. I remember meeting a CTO at another startup early in my career who quit work at 3 pm every day to pick up his kids. This <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-culture">set a culture at the company</a>, which was totally different from my experience.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ApmhcQ1.png" alt="Long hours is a form of gatekeeping"></p>
<h2 id="you-need-appropriate-pacing">You Need Appropriate Pacing</h2>
<p>All this pressure will eventually lead to burnout somewhere within your startup. Whether the founder cracks under pressure or you can’t retain employees because of the rigorous pace, it often hurts the organization in the long run.</p>
<p>Short sprints of long hours are possible - and in my experience, often necessary in a startup - but growing a successful company takes years, not months. No number of hours worked can shortcut this fact.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“If you really look closely, most overnight successes took a long time.” – Steve Jobs</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The problem is that many founders get pressured into thinking short-term. Whether it’s investors pushing them to show traction required for future funding rounds or unfulfilled promises to customers, founders often overcommit themselves to a point where a sustainable pace is impossible.</p>
<h2 id="tips-for-startup-founders">Tips for Startup Founders</h2>
<p>At different stages of a company’s life, different levels of commitment are required. But, no matter what you’re working on, it’s not productive to keep grinding away month after month without giving yourself a break.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you have employees, <strong>you can’t expect them to selflessly spend their lives working long hours and holidays just to help you fulfill your dream.</strong> You <em>can</em> push people to a certain point, but learning how to do so in a productive and worthwhile way is one of the best things you can learn if you want to retain your best employees.</p>
<p>Here are four things I’ve learned about startup work hours and pacing as a founder:</p>
<h3 id="1-dont-push-people-without-a-purpose">1. Don’t Push People Without a Purpose</h3>
<p>It’s tempting as an entrepreneur to always want more from your employees, but just because you feel a sense of urgency in managing your business doesn’t mean every one of your employees will feel the same. <strong>One of the most frustrating things for employees is being pushed to work harder, longer hours without a clear purpose that ties directly into their performance.</strong></p>
<p>Similarly, if you do expect employees to work 60+ hours per week, be upfront with them about this expectation. There are plenty of young go-getters (I was one of them) who don’t mind putting in long hours but be aware that you might be missing some highly-qualified, experienced candidates with this approach.</p>
<h3 id="2-more-work-is-not-a-solution-to-poor-planning">2. More Work is Not a Solution to Poor Planning</h3>
<p>If one department in your company is behind on a deadline, figure out how you can work with them to either adjust expectations, change their requirements, or estimate better next time. Just because you or someone in your organization planned poorly does not mean it’s a good idea to push everyone else to the breaking point.</p>
<h3 id="3-listen-to-your-employees">3. Listen to Your Employees</h3>
<p>Even more important than avoiding situations that stress your employees is listening to them when they are feeling the pressure. If you’re cultivating the right atmosphere at the office, don’t be surprised when someone shows up to tell you that they can’t keep up the pace for another 60 hour week.</p>
<h3 id="4-trust-your-people">4. Trust Your People</h3>
<p>Finally, as an entrepreneur, you have to be able to trust your employees. If you don’t, you need to ask yourself why you hired them or find a way to replace them. When you trust your employees, you’ll know that when they insist they’re working too much, they really are.</p>
<p><em>Note: I’ve added a few books on this topic in <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/startup-books">my list of the best startup books for founders here</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="questions-for-potential-startup-employees">Questions for Potential Startup Employees</h2>
<p>While the bulk of an early-stage startup’s culture is defined by the founders, employees and managers have a lot of influence on working hours and pacing too. If you’re being hired by a startup and you’re not sure about what the culture is like, here are some questions you can ask to get a better sense:</p>
<h3 id="1-how-many-hours-per-week-is-typical">1. How Many Hours Per Week is Typical?</h3>
<p>You can ask this question without sounding lazy. I always tell employees this expectation, but if you’re in an interview with a startup and they don’t say it explicitly, it’s better to know what they expect than to be surprised on your first day.</p>
<h3 id="2-do-you-have-typical-working-hours">2. Do You Have Typical Working Hours?</h3>
<p>Again, with more companies going remote, many are also giving employees the option to work their own hours. I have customers in Europe, Australia, Asia, and the US, so even though I try not to work more than 40 hours per week, I don’t have a very “typical” schedule.</p>
<h3 id="3-do-people-hang-out-outside-of-work-much">3. Do People Hang Out Outside of Work Much?</h3>
<p>I asked this question in interviews with startups because I wanted to know the dynamic of …</p></div></article></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>The why and how of Kubernetes, instead of the what. A gentle introduction to Kubernetes.</p><div>
        <p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/Kubernetes_logo_without_workmark.svg/1234px-Kubernetes_logo_without_workmark.svg.png"></p>
<p>When asked what <a href="https://k8s.io/">Kubernetes</a> is, most people will answer with "a container orchestration system".</p>
<p>This is a good factual statement of the <em>what</em>, but it misses the <em>why</em> and <em>how</em>, which are much more important for developing a good understanding of Kubernetes.</p>
<p>In this article, we'll explore <em>why</em> and <em>how</em> Kubernetes is (instead of the what), and why <strong>containers are just an implementation detail</strong> and <strong>not the main point of Kubernetes</strong>.</p>
<p>If "Kubernetes = Docker but highly complex" is you, read on. I'll try to correct some misunderstandings in this post. Otherwise, you may be interested in my next post on declaratively running Kubernetes without building up bad state (link at the end of this article).</p>
<h2 id="so-what-why-is-kubernetes">So <del>what</del> why is Kubernetes?</h2>
<p>Think of Kubernetes like an operating system (OS).</p>
<p>In a traditional OS you have resources like CPU, memory, and storage. The job of the OS is to schedule which software gets what resources at any given time.</p>
<p>Kubernetes does the same thing. You have resources on each one of your nodes, and Kubernetes assigns those resources to the software running on your cluster.</p>
<p>For our purposes, there are <strong>two key differences</strong> between Kubernetes and a traditional OS.</p>
<p>The first difference is the way you define what software to run. In a traditional OS, you have an init system (like systemd) that starts your software. In Kubernetes, you define objects, and Kubernetes uses these objects to configure and run the software you specify. Objects are similar to those in programming languages: they are typed and contain data specific to their type.</p>
<p>The second difference is that Kubernetes works across multiple computers. In a traditional OS, you need to decide what software gets deployed to what machine. With Kubernetes, you deploy one piece of software to the entire cluster, and Kubernetes figures out what machine to run it on based on the rules you give it. For example, you might say you want to run IPython notebooks on any node with a GPU, and run your web apps on nodes without GPUs.</p>
<p>Notice how my definition of Kubernetes doesn't include the word "container". This is on purpose. <strong>The main idea behind Kubernetes is declarative infrastructure management, not running containers.</strong> Someone could also have implemented the ideas behind Kubernetes but with VMs or processes as the smallest compute units.</p>
<p>Credit: I heard this analogy first from <a href="https://fyd.ai/">~fydai</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-kinds-of-objects-are-there">What kinds of Objects are there?</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, the main idea behind Kubernetes is its object system. All objects have some basic fields (like their <code>name</code>, <code>uid</code>, and user-customizable <code>label</code>s), and many common objects additionally have a <code>namespace</code> that helps keep logical groups of objects separate.</p>
<p>Here are some common object types, and what you might use them for. Obviously, some of these are oversimplified (a <code>Deployment</code> actually makes a <code>ReplicaSet</code> not a <code>Pod</code>), but we're ignoring details for now.</p>
<p><code>Pod</code> - A small group of containers (but is usually just one container). Note: Containers follow the OCI standard, meaning any image built by any OCI-compatible software (like Docker, Podman, etc.) will work on any other OCI-compatible runner.</p>
<p><code>Deployment</code> - A group of pods, with some basic fields for things like the number of replicas to deploy.</p>
<p><code>Service</code> - A group of ports that point to pods, depending on some user-specified rules.</p>
<p><code>Ingress</code> - Expose your service with some rules, such as the hostname to respond on. This requires an Ingress provider like nginx to be installed on your cluster (more on this in a later post).</p>
<p><code>PersistentVolumeClaim</code> - A reference to a persistent filesystem that you can store your data in. This requires a pvc provider to be installed on your cluster- which range from local filesystem storage on one node to distributed storage with Ceph (more on this in a later post).</p>
<p><code>CustomResourceDefinition</code> - It is also possible to make your own types, and write your own logic to determine what they do. This can allow you to create higher level objects like <code>PostgresInstance</code> or <code>MonitoringEndpoint</code>. This is known as the "Operator Pattern" and is beyond the scope of this article.</p>
<p><strong>These objects are your Kubernetes building blocks.</strong> To deploy software, you just need to combine them in various ways to serve your needs.</p>
<p>Let's look at an example.</p>
<h2 id="example-a-typical-web-app">Example: A Typical Web App</h2>
<p>To make this less scary, let's do this without looking at the actual objects. Objects are typically written in YAML, but this was a bad design choice by the designers of Kubernetes. Most typical uses will require generating YAML in some way, which I'll talk more about in the next article. If you want to read the YAML I used for this, check out <a href="https://gist.github.com/nikhiljha/8509ac568bdcf3d28541fca281f3c15b">this gist</a>.</p>
<p>Say we have an OCI image that contains a web app that listens on port 8080. To represent this in Kubernetes, we will use a Pod.</p>
<center><img src="https://nikhiljha.com/images/2020/kubernetes-intro/pod.svg"></center>
<p>The Pod definition will contain some variables that we set, such as the image reference (<code>k8s.gcr.io/echoserver:1.4</code>), the pod name (<code>echo</code>), some resource requests (<code>100MB</code> RAM and half a CPU core), a label (<code>app=echo</code>), and the port that it listens on (<code>8080</code>).</p>
<p>When we add this object to the cluster, Kubernetes will run the container on an available node that has enough compute resources. However, a Pod is an ephemeral unit. If it crashes or stops, it won't restart. To fix this, we'll wrap our Pod object in a <code>Deployment</code> object.</p>
<center><img src="https://nikhiljha.com/images/2020/kubernetes-intro/deployment.svg"></center>
<p>The Deployment definition will have a name (<code>echo</code>), a label (<code>app=echo</code>), and a copy of the Pod object definition we wrote earlier.</p>
<p>Remember, a Deployment object creates Pod objects according to some specification. For now, we'll create just one.</p>
<p>We'll then add the <code>Deployment</code> object to the cluster by running <code>kubectl apply -f my_definition_file.yaml</code>, and pretty soon we can see both the <code>Deployment</code> and the <code>Pod</code> it made in <code>kubectl get deployment</code> or <code>kubectl get pod</code>.</p>
<p>Next we need a way to access the deployment. To do this, we'll use a <code>Service</code> and an <code>Ingress</code>.</p>
<center><img src="https://nikhiljha.com/images/2020/kubernetes-intro/svc-ingress.svg"></center>
<p>The <code>Service</code> will point to port <code>8080</code> on all <code>Pod</code>s that are labeled <code>app=echo</code>, and the <code>Ingress</code> will route all traffic on <code>echo.example.com</code> to the <code>Service</code> with the name <code>echo</code>.</p>
<p>If we visit <code>echo.example.com</code>, we'll see our echo service! Hooray!</p>
<p><img src="https://nikhiljha.com/images/2020/kubernetes-intro/browser-sc.svg" alt=""></p>
<p>But wait, there's more. Remember when I said that using a <code>Deployment</code> to manage our <code>Pod</code> would give us an extra-cool feature?</p>
<p>Let's see what happens when we set <code>replicas</code> to <code>2</code> in our <code>Deployment</code>.</p>
<center><img src="https://nikhiljha.com/images/2020/kubernetes-intro/deployment(2).svg"></center></div><p>Now, even if one <code>Pod</code> crashes, the other one is still around to serve requests, while the other one restarts! We've successfully deployed Highly Available HTTP Echo™!</p><p>Hopefully this gave you a good idea of how to use the various Kubernetes building blocks to define infrastructure.</p><p>In my next post, I'll talk about how you can declaratively setup and manage your Kubernetes cluster <em>without</em> building up bad state or having to manage too much YAML.</p><p>Here are the Kubernetes-related articles I'm working on...</p></div>]]>

We have our whole lives ahead of us to work, so taking a few months off to “find yourself” can be completely justifiable.</p><p>Well, let’s just say that wasn’t the case for me.</p><p>I spent sleepless nights scouring job postings for any company that might be interested in what little I had to offer. I smacked that “Upload Resume” button around like it was my arch nemesis, but made sure to carefully upload the proper file format before doing so.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume.png" alt="upload PDF for resume" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A01-Uploading-Resume-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>My days consisted of nothing but napping, eating, uploading, and submitting. To put it mildly, I was in a state of panic to find some sort of work.</p><p>Some might have viewed this obsessive job search as an impressive character trait. It may have masqueraded as a signal of ambition, an indicator that I was a guy that had his priorities straight.</p><p>The truth, however, was far from that. I wasn’t driven by some magnificent search for purpose, or the nagging desire to provide value to society. I was driven by something far less chivalrous:</p><p>My intense, terrifying fear of being homeless.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness.png" alt="fear of homelessness" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A02-Thinking-of-Homelessness-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>For the longest time, this fear is what drove my panicked desire to find stable, well-paying work (regardless of how <a href="https://moretothat.com/pointless-job/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pointless it was</a>). I thought that as long as I could save some money with each paycheck, I wouldn’t have to sleep in the streets if something went awry.</p><p>Some of you may understand this fear, while others may view it as deeply irrational. I know people from wealthy backgrounds who have this fear, and people raised on welfare that don’t. My family didn’t have much money growing up, but that doesn’t quite justify the existence of this strain of fright.</p><p>Regardless of its origin, this fear was very much alive in me throughout my twenties, and it framed my perspective of money. Instead of viewing money as a generator of wealth, I saw it as an immediate safety net that (barely) kept me away from living on freeway on-ramps. The more of it I had, the more relief and distance it gave me from the streets.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net.png" alt="falling into money safety net" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A03-Safety-Net-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Well, many years have passed since then, and fortunately, I no longer have this fear.<span title="It took some time and life experience to reshape this perspective, but chief among them was the realization that being homeless was more about the poverty of love than the absence of money. As the bonds with my loved ones strengthened and took shape, this truth grew apparent and faded that fear out of my mind.">1</span> However, that doesn’t mean that I no longer think about money. It’s the <a href="https://moretothat.com/how-money-forever-changed-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">greatest story humanity has ever subscribed to</a>, so it will always be a central character in the theater of everyday life. What has changed isn’t money itself, but the way in which it colors the way I view the world.</p><p>Life is almost always a framing problem, and wealth is no exception to this. To say that money is complicated is a cliche worthy of a thousand eye rolls, but when it comes to our ongoing relationship with it, I find that it’s quite simple to explain and distill. At any given moment, our journey falls along a vertical spectrum with three main phases:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller.png" alt="more to that - the money spectrum" width="1500" height="1820" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-247x300.png 247w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-844x1024.png 844w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-768x932.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-1266x1536.png 1266w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B01-The-Money-Spectrum-smaller-610x740.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>This is what I call <span>The Money Spectrum</span>, and it represents the wide variety of views we have about the almighty dollar/euro/whatever throughout our lives. Money can be a difficult thing to talk about because it invokes a blend of weird emotions, and this amorphous slushie of feelings can be hard to express through the crude tool of language.</p><p>The purpose of the Money Spectrum is to take this formless slushie and build it into a concrete model that we can all understand. The first step to solving a problem is to articulate it clearly, and that’s what this spectrum is here to do.</p><p>Each of the three phases represent a specific purpose money has for us, with Phase 1 being the ground level of this journey up the tower. We will go into what each of these three phases are soon, but before we do, keep in mind that this is a spectrum, meaning that we will find ourselves sliding along the scale at any time.</p><p>It’s entirely possible that someone will be 100% immersed in Phase 1, but it’s more likely that they will be closer to Phase 1 than Phase 2, and will share characteristics of both areas. This is an important distinction that we will make later on in this post, but for now, remember that our relationship with things are rarely absolutes, and money is no exception to this rule.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum.png" alt="everything is a spectrum" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/A04-Everything-is-a-spectrum-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Let’s begin our journey up the Money Spectrum with this question: when you take a look at your bank account balance, what do you feel?</p><p>Well, if you’re a part of the 28% of Americans that have <a href="https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/financial-security-june-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">no emergency savings whatsoever</a>, the answer to that question will likely be a combination of fear and anxiety. When the sole purpose of money is to provide for the basic necessities of life, then your relationship with it will be a shaky one. Scarcity creates fragility, and it is this situation that opens the doors to Phase #1.</p><h3>Phase #1: Survival</h3><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1.png" alt="Phase 1 - Survival" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B02-Entrance-to-Phase-1-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>One might say that we all share some space in this part of the spectrum. Ultimately, all the necessities of life require payment of some kind: the food we put in our mouths, the clothes we walk around in, the roof over our heads, etc. Without money we wouldn’t have any of these things, so it’s fair to say that it is a requisite of survival for all of us, right?</p><p>Well, not quite.</p><p>While it’s true that money is required to have these basic necessities, that doesn’t mean that we all fear the loss of these necessities equally. A low-income household and an upper middle-class family may both rent property, but the former may worry incessantly about next month’s payment, while the latter may not. Both understand the importance of money, but have different ideas of how their survival could be impacted by the lack of it.</p><p>The difficult thing about the word “survival” is how subjective it tends to be, as humans are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_aversion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">more reactive to loss than to gain</a>. If a billionaire experienced a sudden reversal in fortune and couldn’t afford his ten-bedroom house anymore, it’s quite possible that he’d say his very survival was being threatened.</p><p>To remove this fog of subjectivity, let’s zoom in on the Survival part of the spectrum and break it down. When I use the word “survival” in this post, I’m simply referring to one’s ability to exist and to have one’s health. In the illustration below, I’ve separated the section out into its smaller constituents, with the level of poverty increasing the lower you go.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1.png" alt="the stages of survival" width="1500" height="1520" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-296x300.png 296w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-1011x1024.png 1011w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-768x778.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B03-Subsections-of-Phase-1-610x618.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>At the lowest level, you have no money or access to food, and you are literally starving to death. This is more likely a function of national/civic infrastructure than an individual’s lack of money, as this is quite rare in any first-world country. However, it is still largely a function of having no fiscal resources, and this is the worst place one can find themselves in as a result of that.</p><p>A step up would be the lack of shelter, or homelessness. This is where one’s fears regarding survival can start feeling real, despite the fact that they are probably nowhere near it (my own fear was a good example of this). This likely happens because most of us are vividly familiar with the problem of homelessness, and have grown up seeing real-life evidence of it everywhere.</p><p>I have clear childhood memories of my parents interacting with the homeless, and you probably do as well. Homelessness is an ever-present window into the difficulties of the human condition, and it reminds you of what can be possible when things go wrong. When we think about our survival being threatened, this familiar sight is where the mind can point to, regardless of how distant that place actually is.</p><p>The next few steps up the spectrum have to do with one’s idea of survival once they have their basic necessities (food/water, shelter, and clothing). Survival is no longer a relentless exercise in acquiring these necessities, but more so a strong commitment in maintaining them. And of course, the fuel that keeps the resource engine running is money.</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities.png" alt="money fuels basic necessities" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-300x220.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-1024x751.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-768x563.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B04-Money-as-fuel-for-basic-necessities-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>In order to sustain the health of oneself and one’s family, a consistent stream of income is needed, and this generally comes in the form of paid employment. Keep in mind that toward the upper-end of the Survival phase, you are no longer fighting for existence; you are fighting for preservation. You want the flow of money to be predictable, something you can count on every few weeks to sustain the level of basic resources you need.</p><p>A job provides this sense of security, and when you view money as a means for survival, holding this job is all that matters. It doesn’t matter how much you hate your job or how terrible the working conditions may be; as long as the number of hours you work result in a predictable deposit amount, you’ll succumb to it.</p><p>But if this pattern continues and time runs in your favor, there’s a point in which the lines between the Survival phase and Phase #2 (which I’ll reveal shortly) start getting blurry.</p><p>At what point does your job provide you with enough money to feel a sense of security? Is it when you’re no longer living paycheck-to-paycheck and you’re able to save some money each month? If that’s the case, what do your savings have to look like for you to feel a sense of relief? $2,000? $10,000? $30,000?</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1.png" alt="how much savings is enough" width="1500" height="1520" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-296x300.png 296w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-1011x1024.png 1011w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-768x778.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/B05-Savings-in-Phase-1-610x618.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>Toward the upper end of this phase, survival becomes more about your mindset and less about your reality. You are well past the place where you risk sleeping in the streets, but you may continue to operate under the belief that it could happen at any time. This traps you into a limited way of thinking, and paralyzes your potential for growth.</p><p>When you’re in a survival mindset, you will always feel like you’re barely holding onto what you have. Whether that’s $1,000 or $100,000, nothing you have can adequately push away the fears you have about sliding down the spectrum. This may be the result of parental conditioning, personal experience, or any number of reasons, but the longer you view money as a means for survival, the less willing you will be to take the risks required to lead a fulfilling life.</p><p>Risk is usually accompanied with the emotion of fear, and if you’re operating on survival mode, you will be scared to do anything uncertain, no matter how small that risk actually is:</p><p><a href="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode.png"><img loading="lazy" src="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode.png" alt="high survival - high fear" width="1500" height="1500" srcset="https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode.png 1500w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-300x300.png 300w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-1024x1024.png 1024w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-150x150.png 150w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-768x768.png 768w, https://2m93ao7jjy53ndft63v8tvcp-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E01-Fear-vs-Risk-in-Survival-Mode-610x610.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p><p>With this level of consistent fear, you won’t do anything outside of your comfort zone.

            <!-- Share buttons by mashshare.net - Version: 3.7.2--><p>Calvin Barrows has written an article for railbusinessdaily.com about the root cause(s) of overheating in certain metro systems, using London Underground’s ‘Tube’ Network as an example.</p>
<p>Calvin is a Chartered Engineer, latterly retired. His work focused on forensic engineering, to establish the mechanisms of structural and mechanical failures; then continuing as an engineering manager, within the rail industry.</p>
<p>Sylvia Telatycka is co-author and linguist, who with Calvin runs a small but successful property development and rental business.</p>
<p>“This guest article aims to encourage a wider discussion around our hypothesis as to the root cause(s) of overheating in certain metro systems, using London Underground’s ‘Tube’ Network as an example.</p>
<p>Rather than go into complicated thermodynamic formulae to demonstrate the credible science upon which this theory is based, we have described in simple terms the comparable heat generation and heat exchange processes at work, to clarify how these affect this historic Tube network. This is important because, in the earliest days of the London Tube, overheating was simply not an issue…. but WHY….?</p>
<p>In the first instance, we need to understand clearly what the problem is. Paraphrasing Charles Kettering: a problem well defined is half solved and mindful of that, we took the basic premise of the Tube overheating and framed a series of questions to help identify the problem.</p>
<p>1. When does overheating happen?</p>
<p>2. Do ALL metros/subways overheat?</p>
<p>3. Why might some metros/subways overheat, and some might not?</p>
<p>4. And why are these questions relevant to London’s network?</p>
<p>5. How can this overheating be mitigated?</p>
<p>Few would disagree that the Tube overheats but understanding WHEN and WHERE it happens is most revealing. In winter passengers mainly travel bundled up in their winter coats and the saloons are heated. In summer, heavy clothing is shed – indeed some passengers have been known to travel in swimwear.</p>
<p><img src="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.20.35.png" alt="" width="598" height="320" srcset="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.20.35.png 598w, https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.20.35-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 598px) 100vw, 598px"></p>
<p>In the above graph i, London’s mean surface ambient air temperatures, averaged over a 30 year period, show a clear increase from approximately -5°C in the winter to around +30°C in the summer.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the following graph ii represents the results of TfL’s temperature monitoring within the underground network, for both the deep tube and sub-surface lines. The TfL temperature variations not only confirm passengers’ subjective perception, they also mimic the curve of temperature data above and demonstrate conclusively that underground network temperatures align with the external seasonal temperatures.</p>
<p><img src="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.17.png" alt="" width="587" height="298" srcset="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.17.png 587w, https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.17-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 587px) 100vw, 587px"></p>
<p>In the course of our research we looked at different types of rail networks, categorising them as follows because they all perform differently in relation to overheating:-</p>
<p>1. Metro train networks – which run ONLY underground.</p>
<p>2. Trains networks – which run predominately overground.</p>
<p>3. Metro train networks – which run both overground and underground.</p>
<p>Underground-only networks like Glasgow’s or Warsaw’s are not affected by the overground conditions, so there is little seasonal variation in train and network temperatures. Their ambient underground temperature remains about 16°C – unlike the wide temperature range the TfL data above show for London’s Tube network. Underground-only networks irrefutably demonstrate that operational heat such as braking, being generated year-round, is NOT a significant cause of metro networks overheating. Furthermore, since passengers are not being exposed to overheating they remain comfortable and safe.</p>
<p>Overground-only trains are cool in winter and therefore heated. However, in summer they will overheat, unless they are proactively cooled, usually by air-conditioning, though AC deals with the symptoms, not underlying causes, and it is environmentally unfriendly. Whilst AC is technically sound as long as it can discharge the exhaust heat to free air, if it does not work for some reason…. What then? There have been at least three incidents over the last 15 years where power failures compromised the AC, triggering saloon temperature rises to 46°C; with distressed passengers fainting from heat exhaustion, and others desperate enough to smash windows and even to try and break through emergency doors.</p>
<p>Which brings us neatly to MIXED metro networks like London’s Tube, which run both overground and underground, to see why this overheating is NOT restricted to the overground areas of these networks. The reason behind this apparent contradiction is that these mixed networks are, thermodynamically speaking, open systems – ones that freely exchange energy and matter with their surroundings – where:-</p>
<p>1. The free exchange of energy is a regular transfer of air in and out of the tunnels; and</p>
<p>2. The free exchange of mass is a regular travel of hot, loaded trains in and out of the tunnel.</p>
<p>TfL engineers continue to focus on ‘base load’, aka the operational heat, which by definition is year-round, so this can never explain the seasonal nature of the problem. Saloon AC is not a viable solution here, expelling more heat into an already overheated tunnel. We need to be thinking more holistically: rather than the ‘Cooling the Tube Project’ it should be the ‘Cooling the Whole Tube Network in the Summer Project’.</p>
<p>Clearly the root cause of this 100+ year old seasonal problem is the SUN. However, its sheer power to affect every aspect of a network like London’s Tube has been significantly underestimated. In a thermodynamic nutshell:-</p>
<p>1. Radiation from the sun is short wave energy in the form of light, which on striking the earth or a solid object increases their internal energy.</p>
<p>2. This internal energy is in the form of heat and is then re-radiated from the surface of the earth (and solid objects) as long wave heat energy, which in turn warms the ambient air.</p>
<p>The unintentional consequence of the above process in a thermodynamically open system is that hot ambient air plus heat from solar irradiated trains travelling on the surface is carried into the tunnels.</p>
<p>In the context of mixed metro networks, when overground, all external surfaces of the train exposed to the sun, including wheels and bogies, are being directly irradiated. Like any heat conductive surface, the irradiated train body get hot. The sun’s shortwave radiation readily shines through the window glass; then striking the internal surfaces is converted into heat within those materials. However, heat being longwave radiation and, struggling to pass back out through the window glass, is trapped – an unintended ‘greenhouse’ effect. Finally, the undercarriage components consist of massive chunks of metal – usually black – with the ability to absorb immense amounts of heat.</p>
<p>Furthermore, while rail buckling is a familiar problem, the knock-on effects of the sun on the track beds have never really figured in the context of the network overheating. The whole of the track bed including the rails is absorbing and reflecting heat. So, when trains pass over it, this heat is then reflected outwards and upwards into the wheels, bogies, underside of the carriages, the brakes and traction motors. These get super-heated, not so much through operation, but principally because they are in an overheated environment.</p>
<p><img src="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.34.png" alt="" width="548" height="282" srcset="https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.34.png 548w, https://mk0railbusinessipb4k.kinstacdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screenshot-2020-08-03-at-14.22.34-300x154.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 100vw, 548px"></p>
<p>The above concept graph predicts the build-up of solar irradiation acting on a train, starting early in the day and repeatedly travelling (in this example) the length of the Central Line. The train is irradiated when overground and dissipates a large proportion of that heat load during the underground sections of the journey. However, each irradiated train movement passing throughout the entire network compounds the effect of previous trains, elevating tunnel temperatures even more as the day progresses – rudimentary monitoring has shown saloon temperatures overground typically increase by up to 6°C in 30 mins between Leyton and Epping around 4.30-5.00pm on a summer afternoon.</p>
<p>While the piston-drag effect as the train passes in and out of the tunnel portals will draw in hot ambient air, probably contributing a small amount of heat to the underground sections, compared to the storage-radiator capacity of the train itself, cumulatively dissipating within the tunnel, it is unlikely to be that significant.</p>
<p>Having identified the root causes of overheating and the contributing factors, the task of managing the overheating in the tunnels is actually quite simple – deal with the overheating of the trains on the surface BEFORE THEY ENTER THE TUNNELS.</p>
<p>There are four obvious radiant barrier measures. These are solar-reflective paints (typical surface temperature reductions of 20⁰C) and Low E glass (absorbing some 80% less solar radiation than standard glass), both of which could be easily retroactively applied to existing trains and become the standard for new rolling stock. Then there is green planting on tracks, with its low heat absorption properties compared to ballast and rails. Once in place maintenance costs should be minimal and the benefits considerable. Lastly effective stabling of off-peak trains, providing appropriate solar shade AND ventilation, is imperative.</p>
<p>In conclusion, and most importantly, it should not be forgotten that overheating saloons will adversely affect passenger health and safety. In London’s Tube, this problem would be exacerbated in a ‘stalled-train event’ underground. Passengers overheated in a carriage, within an overheated tunnel, is a potentially fatal matter, especially when temperatures rise, as they often do in summer, to 40°C or higher and where passengers can do nothing but wait until LU staff can direct their escape.”</p>

<p>I recently bought an used iPod Classic 6th gen. While the storage capacity on the backside is specified to be 80 GB, I was only able to copy around 20GB of data to the hard drive before the iPod would shut itself off.<br>Lets fix that.</p>



<p>The iPod can boot in <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“emergency disk mode”</a>, which boots a minimal OS that just exposes the internal hard drive over USB. I’ll use this mode in the rest of this post, as I figure that what I do won’t be disturbed by any software on the iPod.<br></p>



<p>To confirm the problem, I tried writing zeros all over the drive, and as expected, after writing 18 GB, the iPod crashed.</p>



<pre># dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda bs=512K oflag=sync<br>dd: error writing '/dev/sda': Input/output error<br>34285+0 records in<br>34284+0 records out<br>17974689792 bytes (18 GB, 17 GiB) copied, 1065.78 s, 16.9 MB/s</pre>



<pre># dmesg<br>[80318.901496] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] tag#0 FAILED Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE<br>[80318.901504] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] tag#0 Sense Key : Medium Error [current] <br>[80318.901509] sd 2:0:0:0: [sda] tag#0 Add.

<p>From this, it is pretty clear that the hard drive is broken and should be changed. It just turns out that Apple made it notoriously hard to change the hard drive, with iFixit giving it a difficulty level of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/iPod+Classic+Hard+Drive+Replacement/564" target="_blank">“Very difficult”</a>. The drive will probably eventually fail, but I would like to use it until it fails.<br></p>



<p>So lets see if we can work around the problem with software instead. As filesystem creation didn’t fail on the drive, I suspect that there are working sectors located after the bad sectors that made the iPod crash. So what if we could just tell the filesystem not to use those bad sectors? It turns out most filesystems supports exactly that, and with FAT32 we can set the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_of_the_FAT_file_system#Cluster_values" target="_blank">cluster value to&nbsp;0x?FFFFFF7</a> to mark the clusters with bad sectors.</p>



<p><strong>man 8 mkfs.fat</strong> tells us that we can use -l FILENAME to “Read the bad blocks list from FILENAME.”. So we’ll just have to figure out how to generate that list.</p>



<p>To figure out which sectors work, I started with the ‘badblocks’ program. The iPod claims a sector size of 4KB, so we’ll use that:<br></p>



<pre>fdisk -l /dev/sda<br>Disk /dev/sda: 74.4 GiB, 79824777216 bytes, 19488471 sectors<br>Units: sectors of 1 * 4096 = 4096 bytes<br>Sector size (logical/physical): 4096 bytes / <strong>4096</strong> bytes<br>I/O size (minimum/optimal): 4096 bytes / 4096 byte</pre>



<p>To find all the bad sectors, I tried the following (-s for show progress, -v for verbose).</p>



<pre># badblocks -o bad-blocks.txt -b 4096 -sv /dev/sda<br>Checking blocks 0 to 19488470<br>Checking for bad blocks (read-only test): done                                                 <br>Pass completed, 15097507 bad blocks found. (15097507/0/0 errors)</pre>



<p>At some point my iPod rebooted/froze, and badblocks reported all the remaining sectors as bad. This sucks, as some of those sectors probably work.</p>



<p>What we can do is to look at the output, and find where it begins reporting all blocks as bad. Then we tell badblocks to start at a that point to work around the reboot (in my case it happens when I try to read or write to sector 4390976). This turned out to happen a lot, and was very slow and time consuming, so I switched to a different approach.</p>



<p>I came to think of the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/" target="_blank">ddrescue</a> tool, which is designed to be used with faulty drives, so I gave that a go. It turns out that we can misuse ddrescue to figure out which sectors can’t be read, by trying to recover all data from the disk and write the output to /dev/null. For some reason ddrescue is able to detect a bad sector without rebooting the iPod. Any sector that can’t be read, must be in the set of all bad sectors, so this will get us started. ddrescue will write the unrecoverable sectors to mapfile.txt.</p>



<pre># ddrescue --verbose --force --sector-size=4096 --cluster-size=1 --log-events=ddrescue.txt /dev/sda /dev/null mapfile.txt<br> GNU ddrescue 1.22<br> About to copy 79824 MBytes from '/dev/sda' to '/dev/null'<br>     Starting positions: infile = 0 B,  outfile = 0 B<br>     Copy block size:   1 sectors       Initial skip size: 208 sectors<br> Sector size: 4096 Bytes<br>  ipos:   17982 MB, non-trimmed:        0 B,  current rate:   32768 B/s opos:   17982 MB, non-scraped:        0 B,  average rate:    975 kB/s<br> non-tried:        0 B,  bad-sector:   41922 kB,    error rate:       0 B/s<br>   rescued:   79782 MB,   bad areas:     7916,        run time: 22h 43m  9s<br> pct rescued:   99.94%, read errors:    10235,  remaining time:         n/a<br>                               time since last successful read:         n/a<br> Finished</pre>



<p>This took a long time. Around 24 hours with my iPod.</p>



<p>When it finishes, you can visualize the result using ddrescueview, which plots good sectors as green, and bad sectors as red. There are way more sectors than there are “pixels” in the following picture – a single field represents many sectors. This is my result:</p>



<figure><a href="https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-mapfile-all.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="543" src="https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-mapfile-all-1024x543.png" alt="" srcset="https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-mapfile-all-1024x543.png 1024w, https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-mapfile-all-300x159.png 300w, https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-mapfile-all-768x407.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></a></figure>



<p>If we zoom in on one of the areas with bad blocks, we can spot a pattern, which I think kind of looks like scratches. If I remember correctly, this is zoomed all the way in, making each field represent a single sector.</p>



<figure><a href="https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-zoomed-in.png" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="542" src="https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-zoomed-in-1024x542.png" alt="" srcset="https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-zoomed-in-1024x542.png 1024w, https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-zoomed-in-300x159.png 300w, https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/ipod-zoomed-in-768x406.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 767px) 89vw, (max-width: 1000px) 54vw, (max-width: 1071px) 543px, 580px"></a></figure>



<p>Now that we have a list of sectors that can be read, we need determine which of those can be written to as well. To test this, we’ll try the <strong>badblocks</strong> program again, but this time we’ll tell it to skip the bad sectors found by ddrescue.</p>



<p>The mapfile is a table of position, size and a status row. Position and size are in bytes, and the status is a symbol with the following meaning:</p>



<pre>'?'       non-tried block
'*'       failed block non-trimmed
'/'       failed block non-scraped
<strong>'-'       failed block bad-sector(s)</strong>

<p>To convert the mapfile into a format that is supported by badblocks, do:</p>



<pre>$ ddrescuelog --list-blocks=- --block-size=4096 mapfile.txt &gt; badblocks-from-ddrescue.txt<p>$ head badblocks-from-ddrescue.txt<br>4387902<br>4388462<br>4388862<br>4389821<br>4389822<br>4390088<br>4390364<br>4390515<br>4390630<br>4390648</p></pre>



<p>We use this file as input to badblocks, and specify a block size of 4096 bytes which is the sector size.</p>



<pre># badblocks -n -v -s -b 4096 -i badblocks-from-ddrescue.txt -o badblocks.txt /dev/sda<p>-n = non-destructive read-write<br>-v = verbose<br>-s = Show progress<br>-b 4096 = block size<br>-i badblocks-from-ddrescue.txt = Skip a list of known bad blocks<br>-o = write the bad blocks to this file</p></pre>



<p>I was expecting that command to find all the missing bad blocks, but it unfortunately didn’t go that well. My iPod soon crashed again, and I had to manually reboot the iPod and find the bad block index in the badblocks.txt file where it started to report all sectors as bad, merge all the found bad blocks together, and tell it to start from that new offset. After a few iterations of this, I gave up, and decided to try something else.</p>



<p>In the pattern we saw using <a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/ddrescueview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ddrescueview</a>, it looked like the bad blocks were somewhat grouped together. So what if we “filled out” the bad areas? A simple way to do this is to just consider all blocks near a bad block as bad. I wrote the following awk script to do just that.</p>




<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br>8<br>9<br>10<br>11<br>12<br>13<br>14<br>15<br>16<br>17<br>18<br>19<br>20<br>21<br>22<br>23<br>24<br>25<br>26<br>27<br>28<br>29<br>30<br>31<br>32<br>33<br>34<br>35<br>36<br>37<br></p></td><td><div><p><span>BEGIN</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; <span># Tune this value</span><br>
&nbsp; gapTreshold = <span>4000</span></p><p>

&nbsp; <span># Stores the previous bad block we handeled</span><br>
&nbsp; lastBad = <span>0</span><br>
<span>}</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; currentBad = <span>$1</span></p><p>

&nbsp; <span># Is the currentBad close to the lastBad block?</span><br>
&nbsp; <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>(</span>currentBad<span>-</span>lastBad<span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> gapTreshold<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span># Fill out the entire space</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>for</span> <span>(</span>i = lastBad<span>+</span><span>1</span> ; i <span>&lt;</span> currentBad; i<span>++</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>print</span> i<br>
&nbsp; <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span># We are not close to the previous block.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span># So lastBad must have been the last one in a streak.</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span># Skip if lastBad = 0</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>if</span> <span>(</span>lastBad<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span># Write bad blocks out after the last one</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>for</span> <span>(</span>i = lastBad<span>+</span><span>1</span>; i <span>&lt;</span> lastBad<span>+</span><span>(</span>gapTreshold<span>/</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>; i<span>++</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>print</span> i<br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>}</span></p><p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; <span># Write gapTreshold/2 bad blocks out before this one</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>for</span> <span>(</span>i = currentBad<span>-</span><span>(</span>gapTreshold<span>/</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>; i <span>&lt;</span> currentBad; i<span>++</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <span>print</span> i<br>
&nbsp; <span>}</span><br>
&nbsp; <span>print</span> currentBad<br>
&nbsp; lastBad = currentBad<br>
<span>}</span></p><p>

<span>END</span> <span>{</span><br>
&nbsp; <span># Print some bad blocks after the last block</span><br>
&nbsp; <span>for</span> <span>(</span>i = lastBad<span>+</span><span>1</span> ; i <span>&lt;</span> lastBad <span>+</span> <span>(</span>gapTreshold<span>/</span><span>2</span><span>)</span>; i<span>++</span><span>)</span><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; <span>print</span> i<br>
<span>}</span></p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>




<p>Setting the gapTreshold to 4000 is what eventually worked for me, and with that list as input (and around 10 iterations of badblocks where I would find a new bad block, add it to the list and re-run the script), I could run the badblocks program on the hard drive without crashing the iPod! (By the way: badblocks gets really resource hungry when you give it a large list as input!)</p>



<pre>$ awk -f fill-gaps.awk badblocks.txt &gt; badblocks-filled.txt<br>$ sudo badblocks -n -v -s -b 4096 -i badblocks-filled.txt /dev/sda # (no output)<br>$ wc -l badblocks.txt<br>10267<br>$ wc -l badblocks-filled.txt<br>943079</pre>



<p>943079 * 4k sectors is a little less than 4GB of unusable blocks, which is very much acceptable! That means I should be able to use around 75GB of my iPod’s storage instead only 18GB!</p>



<p>Next step is creating the filesystem with our new list of bad blocks as input. I was expecting this to be the most simple step. I was wrong.</p>



<p>First step is to make a partition that the filesystem can reside on. This is the default layout on the iPod, and can be created using a tool like (g)parted:</p>



<pre># fdisk -l /dev/sda<br>Disk /dev/sda: 74.4 GiB, 79824777216 bytes, 19488471 sectors<br> Units: sectors of 1 * 4096 = 4096 bytes<br> Sector size (logical/physical): 4096 bytes / 4096 …</pre></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><figure> <figcaption>I know you want to. - Photo by Author </figcaption></figure> <p>You might not be aware of it, but you use some form of open source software every single day.</p> <p>Every time you start an app on your phone or launch a program on your computer, you profit from the code that someone has written for free.</p> <p>WordPress, the largest and most well-known content management system, is used by <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/cm-wordpress" rel="nofollow">38% of all websites</a> worldwide. It is open source and free to use.</p> <p>Linux is powering <a href="https://w3techs.com/technologies/details/os-linux" rel="nofollow">30% of all websites</a> globally. It is open source and free to use.</p> <p>These are just two examples out of a myriad of projects which were created to solve a problem or serve a use case.</p> <p>These projects became highly popular as communities formed around them. They tried to deliver the best product possible in terms of user experience, stability, security, and more.</p> <p>But not only the usage of open source projects is rising. The participation in the open source movement as a whole is growing as well.</p> <p>According to the <a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" rel="nofollow">State of the Octoverse report</a> by GitHub, out of more than 40 million developers on GitHub, 10 million new&nbsp;users joined in 2019 alone!</p> <p>The open source movement is growing quickly and you should become a part of it too.</p> <p>Whenever I see a new update for my operating system or new software releases of tools that I actively use every day, it makes me smile. I enjoy the thought of products continuously getting better and more sophisticated.</p> <p>Do you feel the same way?</p> <p>Here is why I am convinced that you should start contributing to open source software right now.</p> <h2>You can learn a lot from the source code</h2> <p>Since the source code in open source projects is available for anyone to read, that means that a large number of developers can battle-test and improve a project.</p> <p>Developers point out privacy or security issues, update the documentation, and improve source code to the newest web development standards all the time.</p> <p>Especially when you go through the code of projects with hundreds or even thousands of contributors, you can gain immense knowledge about best practices and code quality.</p> <p>Not only is reviewing the code itself a learning experience, but also the structure and folder hierarchy in larger projects is well thought-out and works well in the long run.</p> <h2>You will work with the smartest people</h2> <p>Compared to a company that has a limited number of employees to work on feature requests and bug fixes, you have the brightest minds working in open source development.</p> <p>In my imagination, I see it as swarm intelligence, which can solve every problem that arises.</p> <p>The more people that join a community, the better a project can scale. It can be like a buzzing beehive, where you could have pull requests to a codebase from users all around the world 24/7, non-stop.</p> <p>A good example is the well-known code editor <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/vscode" rel="nofollow">Visual Studio Code</a> which got very popular with a total of 1,200+ contributors on GitHub.</p> <p>You won’t see a single day without any pull requests on GitHub and the monthly release cycles always bring out new amazing features.</p> <p>When you participate in a project and submit a pull request, you will receive extremely helpful feedback from highly experienced maintainers. You can then implement that feedback to grow as a developer.</p> <h2>Your own code could be used globally</h2> <p>Since some software development projects are used by millions of users daily, it can be very rewarding to see your own code helping so many people.</p> <p>I wrote lint rules for the JavaScript projects called <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/eslint-plugin-unicorn" rel="nofollow">eslint-plugin-unicorn</a> and <a href="https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte" rel="nofollow">svelte</a>. It’s a great feeling knowing that my pull request will improve the code quality of many developers all around the world.</p> <p>From my personal experience, it is also motivating to get positive feedback in the form of a thankful comment.</p> <h2>Open source projects are inclusive</h2> <p>A great advantage of free open source software is that no one is excluded from using the product because they can’t afford it.</p> <p>While some open source projects cost money to use, most do not.</p> <p>Also, when you’re contributing to a project on GitHub, many of the bigger repositories have a code of conduct. These make sure that every contributor feels welcome and accepted in a project.</p> <h2>Projects are starting to become sustainable</h2> <p>The main goal of a company is to become profitable - which often leads to questionable decisions. But open source software focuses on solving the needs of its users as the highest priority.</p> <p>Most projects are entirely volunteer-supported, and project maintainers will unfortunately never see any financial reward. But there are great ways nowadays that you can help make these projects sustainable.</p> <p>With websites like <a href="https://opencollective.com/" rel="nofollow">OpenCollective</a>&nbsp;or <a href="https://github.com/sponsors" rel="nofollow">GitHub Sponsors</a>, you can donate to speed up the development of projects that you like.</p> <p>Personally, I think that it would be great if every company donated at least a small sum to open source software projects because they profit from these tools daily. Such support would reduce the stress for a lot of maintainers and some could even take up the work full-time.</p> <h2>How to contribute to open source</h2> <p>Contributing to open source development sounds more scary than it really is. There are plenty of projects out there on GitHub which encourage first time contributors and newbies to take action by labeling issues as “Good first issue”, “Beginner friendly” or “Help wanted”.</p> <p>Don’t know where to start?</p> <p>Ask yourself: what is an application that you enjoy using every day and where you would want to give back?</p> <p>It can be as simple as searching for that application on GitHub and looking through the open issues.</p> <p>It doesn’t have to be a code contribution, either - you can also help out by creating a pull request to update the documentation, fix typos that you find, or by doing a thorough code review.</p> <p>The <code>README.md</code> file of a project usually includes a passage of how to contribute.</p> <p>If you decide to contribute to a project, I recommend reading my article about&nbsp;<a href="https://markushatvan.com/blog/contributing-to-open-source-projects-the-right-way">Contributing To Open Source Projects The Right Way</a>. It’s a detailed step-by-step guide about the contribution workflow.</p> <p>I wrote it to be very beginner friendly, so don’t worry about becoming overwhelmed. You will be able to find your first project and submit a contribution in no time!</p> <h2>Wrapping up</h2> <p>It always impressed me that everyone in the world can join an open source software project and work on it.</p> <p>And open source software only works as a collaborative effort. The goal is to produce the best product or service without compromising on important factors like stability, security, or user privacy.</p> <p>I hope you understand the importance of open source software and that you value its benefits. No matter what your reasons are for giving back to the open source community, just know that you are highly appreciated!</p> <p>Many projects can only thrive with support and contributions from developers like you.</p> <h2>Helpful resources</h2> <ul><li><a href="https://octoverse.github.com/" rel="nofollow">The State of the Octoverse</a></li> <li><a

December 26, 2020 | https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/api-pagination-design/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Returning all results for a given query could be a challenge for an API, especially if there are thousands of results. It puts a load on a server, on a client, on a network, and often is unnecessary. Thus people invented pagination.</p>
<p>The usual way to paginate is an offset or a page number. So you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=10
{"items": [...100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>and to continue you make a request like that:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?page=11
{"items": [...another 100 products]}
</code></pre>
<p>In case of a simple offset it’ll look like <code>?offset=1000</code> and <code>?offset=1100</code> — it’s the same old soup, just reheated. It’ll either go straight into SQL query like <code>OFFSET 1000 LIMIT 100</code> or will be multiplied by page size (that <code>LIMIT</code> value). In any case, it’s a suboptimal solution, since every database has to skip that 1000 rows. And to skip them it needs to identify them. It does not matter if it’s PostgreSQL, or ElasticSearch, or MongoDB, it’ll have to order them, count them, and throw them away.</p>
<p>This is a kind of work which no one needs. But it repeats over and over again since it’s <em>easy</em> to implement — you directly map your API onto your query to a database.</p>
<p>What do you do then? We could look at what databases do! They have this concept, called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cursor_(databases)">cursor</a> — it’s a pointer to a row. So you can say to a database “return me 100 rows after <strong>that</strong> one”. And it’s much easier for a database to do since there is a good chance that you’ll identify the row by a field with an index. And suddenly you don’t need to fetch and skip those rows, you’ll go directly past them.</p>
<p>An example:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWe"}
</code></pre>
<p>API returns an (opaque) string, which you can use then to retrieve the next page:</p>
<pre><code>GET /api/products?cursor=qWe
{"items": [...100 products],
 "cursor": "qWr"}
</code></pre>
<p>Implementation-wise there are many options. Generally, you have some ordering criteria, for example, product id. In this case, you’ll encode your product id with some reversible algorithm (let’s say <a href="https://hashids.org/">hashids</a>). And on receiving a request with the cursor you decode it and generate a query like <code>WHERE id &gt; :cursor LIMIT 100</code>.</p>
<p>Just a little performance comparison, look at how offsets work:</p>
<pre><code>=# explain analyze select id from product offset 10000 limit 100;
                                                           QUERY PLAN                                                            
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limit  (cost=1114.26..1125.40 rows=100 width=4) (actual time=39.431..39.561 rows=100 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on product  (cost=0.00..1274406.22 rows=11437243 width=4) (actual time=0.015..39.123 rows=10100 loops=1)
 Planning Time: 0.117 ms
 Execution Time: 39.589 ms
</code></pre>
<p>And how where works:</p>
<pre><code>=# explain analyze select id from product where id &gt; 10000 limit 100;
                                                          QUERY PLAN                                                          
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Limit  (cost=0.00..11.40 rows=100 width=4) (actual time=0.016..0.067 rows=100 loops=1)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on product  (cost=0.00..1302999.32 rows=11429082 width=4) (actual time=0.015..0.052 rows=100 loops=1)
         Filter: (id &gt; 10000)
 Planning Time: 0.164 ms
 Execution Time: 0.094 ms
</code></pre>
<p>That is a difference of several orders of magnitude! Of course, the actual numbers depend on a size of a table, on your filters and on a store implementation. There <a href="https://use-the-index-luke.com/no-offset">a great article</a> with more technical information - there are slides embedded, see slide 42 for performance comparison.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody orders products by an id — you usually order them by some relevancy (and then by id as a <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/17330992/46854">tie breaker</a>). In the real world, you’ll have to look at your data to determine what to do. Orders can be ordered by id (as it’s monotonically increasing). Wishlist items can be ordered like that as well — by wishlisting time. In our case products come from ElasticSearch, which naturally supports this cursor stuff.</p>
<p>One deficiency you can see is that it’s impossible to generate a “previous page” link with a stateless API. So in case of a user-facing pagination, if it’s important to have prev/next and “go directly to page 10” buttons there is no way around this offset/limit stuff. But in other cases using cursor-based pagination can greatly improve performance, especially on really big tables with really deep pagination.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
                <div>
                    <p>I started using Signal 5 years ago as I became increasingly conscious of my data footprint. Around the same time, I closed my Facebook and Instagram accounts, and later, my Google Account.</p><h2 id="the-problem-with-signal">The problem with Signal</h2><p>Signal makes it very difficult, and in most cases, impossible, for one to back up, export, or migrate message data. The Signal team insists these restrictions are meant to protect users’ privacy. However, backup and migration policies differ for each official Signal client and sometimes contradict each other.</p><p>For example, while iOS offers no official backups process, Android backups are built into the app. At the same time, iOS users can migrate their data to a new device (as long as their phone number hasn’t changed), but this is impossible on Android. Meanwhile, decrypting messages from the desktop client is trivial, but linking one’s phone and desktop client only syncs messages forward in time.</p><h2 id="why-export-signal-s-message-history">Why export Signal's message history</h2><p>Because it’s my fucking data.</p><p>The road to exporting my data was long, frustrating and filled with dead ends – it took over a year to get here. What's paradoxical is that someone else's phone turned out to be the key to my data. </p><p>In recent years, I moved most of my conversations to Signal, including those with family and close friends. Shortly after we started dating, I asked my partner to switch to Signal, and we’ve used it exclusively ever since. At some point, I thought it would be nice to export our conversation history – a sort of time capsule of our relationship. “Easy,” I thought. I was wrong.</p><p>Since we started dating, I had switched from a OnePlus 2 to an iPhone XS Max. And since migrating from Android to iOS isn’t possible, part of our conversation history was locked on my old phone. Jailbreaking the iPhone was out of the question since my version of iOS had not been jailbreaken. The Signal Desktop client could have offered an easy avenue to decrypt our chat history, but there was a period of several months during which I had not linked my iPhone to the Signal desktop client.</p><p>I opened a <a href="https://community.signalusers.org/t/ios-backups-through-the-desktop-client/8123">thread about this in the Signal Community Forum</a> in June of 2019. It quickly became apparent that backing up my Signal data would be an uphill battle. </p><p>Luckily, my partner had an iPhone 7, which she recently replaced with a company phone. Her old iPhone contained our entire message history in one place and was easy to jailbreak. Jackpot.</p><p>One important lesson I learned during this process:<strong> to ensure access to your conversation history, install the Desktop client and link it to your mobile device as soon as you start using Signal. </strong>The Signal database and encryption key are both accessible on your computer, allowing for easy decryption. Linking the desktop client later will only sync messages forward in time from the moment the devices are linked.</p><h2 id="tips-to-increase-your-chances-of-exporting-your-signal-database">Tips to increase your chances of exporting your Signal database</h2><p>If you haven’t linked the desktop client and extracting the iOS database is your only option, this guide is for you. If you've decided to embark upon this journey, here's some advice. </p><h3 id="stop-updating-ios">Stop updating iOS</h3><p>Your best chance of jailbreaking iOS is on older firmware versions. Turn off automatic updates and decline prompts to update iOS.</p><h3 id="backup-shsh-blobs-with-every-new-ios-update">Backup SHSH blobs with every new iOS update</h3><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHSH_blob">SHSH blobs</a> are the digital signatures that Apple generates and uses to personalize iOS firmware files for each iOS device. Apple only signs firmware updates for a limited time after release. Having these signatures handy allows one to install versions of iOS after Apple stops signing them – like when a jailbreak becomes available for that version. In some cases, you may be able to downgrade iOS to a previous version.</p><p>Backup SHSH blobs every time Apple releases a new version of iOS (e.g., 14.0, 14.1, 14.1.1). I personally use the <a href="https://github.com/airsquared/blobsaver">blobsaver</a> app, but <a href="https://tsssaver.1conan.com/v2/">TSS Saver</a> is a popular alternative.</p><h3 id="learn-about-jailbreaking-and-stay-up-to-date-on-developments">Learn about jailbreaking and stay up to date on developments</h3><p>Developers and hackers are constantly working to break the security of iOS, and new methods to jailbreak iPhones are frequently made public. Stay informed on jailbreak releases by following the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/">/r/jailbreak subreddit</a>.</p><p>This <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11DABHIIqwYQKj1L83AK9ywk_hYMjEkcaxpIg6phbTf0/edit#gid=1014970938">exhaustive list of jailbreak compatibility</a> by device and iOS version is also a great resource.</p><p>It's also useful to understand the difference between <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Untethered_jailbreak">untethered</a>, <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Semi-untethered_jailbreak">semi-untethered</a>, <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Semi-tethered_jailbreak">semi-tethered</a>, and <a href="https://www.theiphonewiki.com/wiki/Tethered_jailbreak">tethered</a> jailbreaks.</p><h3 id="recognize-that-this-may-not-work">Recognize that this may not work</h3><p>Depending on your iPhone, you might never be able to jailbreak it or extract Signals decryption key from the iOS Keychain. Apple is making it increasingly difficult to jailbreak iOS devices – improvements to hardware and software are leaving fewer cracks for hackers to exploit.</p><p>Ok, let's get our hands dirty. </p><h2 id="how-to-maybe-backup-signal-for-iphone">How to (maybe) backup Signal for iPhone </h2><p>This guide explains how I was able to backup and extract data from Signal's encrypted SQLite database on an iPhone 7 with iOS 13.6.1. </p><h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites </h3><ul><li>Physical access to the iPhone with Signal still installed</li><li>An original iPhone cable</li><li>A Mac or Linux computer</li><li>Patience and a bit of luck</li></ul><p>Shell environments will be differentiated as such. </p><pre><code>// Host machine
$ &lt;command&gt;

// iPhone 
root# &lt;command&gt;</code></pre><h3 id="step-1-jailbreak-ios">Step 1: Jailbreak iOS</h3><p>For iOS 13.6.1 on an iPhone 7, I used <strong>checkra1n</strong> which offers a straight forward semi-tethered jailbreak. Depending on the iPhone device and version of iOS, a jailbreak may or may not be available. </p><p>See this <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11DABHIIqwYQKj1L83AK9ywk_hYMjEkcaxpIg6phbTf0/edit#gid=1014970938">updated list of iOS jailbreaks</a> for device compatibility and instructions. </p><h3 id="step-2-ssh-into-the-iphone">Step 2: SSH into the iPhone </h3><p>Cydia usually comes with OpenSSH installed and enabled, allowing shell access over IP or USB. If SSH access isn't activated, launch Cydia and install OpenSSH. </p><p><strong>As always, the root password on iOS is <code>alpine</code>.</strong></p><p>If the iPhone and the host machine are on the same network, SSH into the phone using its IP address. It may be found in the phone's WiFi settings. </p><pre><code>$ ssh root@[iphone ip] -p 22</code></pre><p>If SSH over the air isn't possible, USB may be an alternative. However, this involves enabling a proxy service on the host machine.</p><p>First, install <em><em>libimobiledevice</em></em> on the host machine. </p><pre><code>$ brew install libimobiledevice</code></pre><p>Then, edit <em><em>com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</em></em> and append the following XML to the file. </p><pre><code>$ nano ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</code></pre><pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd"&gt;
&lt;plist version="1.0"&gt;
&lt;dict&gt;
&lt;key&gt;Label&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;string&gt;com.usbmux.iproxy&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;key&gt;ProgramArguments&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;array&gt;
&lt;string&gt;/usr/local/bin/iproxy&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string&gt;2222&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;string&gt;22&lt;/string&gt;
&lt;/array&gt;
&lt;key&gt;RunAtLoad&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
&lt;key&gt;KeepAlive&lt;/key&gt;
&lt;true/&gt;
&lt;/dict&gt;</code></pre><p>And finally, launch the proxy on the host machine. </p><pre><code>$ launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.usbmux.iproxy.plist</code></pre><p>It should now be possible to SSH into the iPhone over USB on port <code>2222</code>.</p><pre><code>$ ssh root@localhost -p 2222</code></pre><h3 id="step-3-install-required-packages">Step 3: Install required packages </h3><p>Once logged into to the iPhone's shell, install the following packages as they will come in handy. </p><pre><code>root# apt install zip unzip nano wget</code></pre><h3 id="step-4-backup-the-signal-data-directory">Step 4: Backup the Signal data directory</h3><p><strong>Locate Signal's data directory</strong></p><p>Much like macOS, iOS stores application data in a <em>Library</em>-like directory. In iOS&nbsp;13, its located here <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/</code>. </p><p>Signal's data directory contains the encrypted SQLite database file in <code>./grdb/signal.sqilte</code> and attachments, such as images and videos in <code>./Attachments</code>.</p><p>The data directory may be found by searching the filesystem for Signal's encrypted database file, <code>signal.sqlite</code>.</p><pre><code>root# find / -type f -iname "signal.sqlite"</code></pre><p>That should return something which looks like this:<br><code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/grdb/signal.sqlite</code> </p><p>The Signal directory is: <code>/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/</code></p><p><strong>Zip the Signal directory</strong></p><p>It is recommended to zip the entire directory, not only the database file, as it also contains images and other message attachments. This archive can reach several gigabytes.</p><pre><code>root# cd /private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/
root# zip -r signal-backup.zip &lt;Signal directory&gt;

# ex: zip -r signal-backup.zip /private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/01484069-3446-4CC0-8BE7-7464E7D08FDF/</code></pre><p><strong>Retrieve the backup on the host machine</strong></p><p>In a new terminal session on the host machine, use <code>scp</code> to copy the backup. </p><pre><code>$ scp -P 22 root@localhost:/private/var/mobile/Containers/Shared/AppGroup/signal-backup.zip ~/</code></pre><p>Once complete, verify that the backup has fully transferred by unpacking it.</p><p>This is the most complex part of this operation and it helps to have a basic understanding of core iOS development concepts.</p><p><strong>Understanding iOS Entitlements </strong></p><p>From the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements">Apple Developer Documentation</a>: </p><blockquote>An entitlement is a right or privilege that grants an executable particular capabilities. For example, an app needs the HomeKit Entitlement — along with explicit user consent — to access a user’s home automation network. An app stores its entitlements as key-value pairs embedded in the code signature of its binary executable.</blockquote><p><strong>Enter Keychain Dumper</strong></p><p>We will use <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper"><strong>Keychain-Dumper</strong></a> to attempt extracting the Signal encryption key. It requires entitlements to access Keychain data for any particular app. </p><p>Reading through Keychain-Dumper's GitHub issues, I learned that entitlements changed in iOS 13.5 – prior to this version, an application <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/issues/52#issuecomment-638174691">could be given wildcard entitlements</a>. Changes in 13.5 made it such that apps need specific entitlements. Thankfully, it's possible to update an executable's entitlements, even as a binary.</p><p>The <code>keychain_dumper</code> binary included in its <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper">GitHub repo</a> has wildcard entitlements. We'll need to update them in order to give it permission to decrypt the Signal key.</p><p><strong>Install Keychain Dumper on the iPhone</strong></p><p>Back on the iPhone, download and extract the <a href="https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/releases/tag/1.0.0">keychain_dumper binary</a>, and move it to <code>/usr/bin</code>.</p><pre><code>root# wget https://github.com/ptoomey3/Keychain-Dumper/releases/download/1.0.0/keychain_dumper-1.0.0.zip

It certainly would have made it easier to build the company according to his vision rather than something that needed to please the shareholders that needed an IPO to get a return.</p><p>In the early days you had the GOATS like Reid Hoffman (founder LinkedIn), Max Levchin (Paypal and Affirm), and the likes answering questions. Now it’s some 14yr old telling you about the opportunity of a lifetime: screencasting stories from Reddit, having the speech to text tool read them, turn it into a video and put it on YouTube. And then…? Millions I guess?</p><p>It went from THE place to get high-quality courses from knowledgeable instructors to the flea-market of cheap knock-offs and fake guru business opportunity courses. While you can find quality courses there, the overall quality has badly degraded. The best instructors aren’t incentivized to create a course because your $1000 course containing 3 decades of experience will sell for $9.99 of which you’ll get $2.50. So if you actually have something to offer, you’ll go somewhere else, leaving mainly the type of people that game the system in order to make a quick buck.</p><p>People used to LOVE Facebook with a vengeance. Now I have 80 notifications, 40 of which are new friend suggestions of people I’ve never met, 20 are strangers that sent out a blast to get likes for their new page, 17 are events, and 3 are birthdays. [2]</p><p>Oh yeah… and not 1 is actually relevant to me.&nbsp;You can fool a user only so many times before you’ve essentially trained them to ignore you.</p><p><em>They started implementing the same dark patterns with their DM. You get notifications for being friends for a certain time and when you accept a new friend.</em></p><p>In its search for endless optimization, the platform has become bloated and just plain annoying. I can’t think of a single person in my cohort (and younger cohorts) that use FB as much or more as 10 years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>The current demographic appears to be the same type of people that use Bing over Google, or Explorer over Chrome. Late adopters that are sticky to defaults.</p><p>So be careful when optimizing. Remember the quantification bias! </p><p><em>Discussed in </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/paradigm"><em>Paradigm Shift: Drastically Increase The Odds of Success</em></a></p><p>Just because something is easy to measure doesn’t mean it’s insightful. Just because something can’t be measured easily doesn’t mean it isn’t.</p><p>Remember that business is part art part science: <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/artofbusiness" target="_blank">The Art Of Business, Where Science And Business Depart</a>.</p><p>[1]  I <a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/comedy">made the point before</a> when it comes to certain areas that are sufficiently complex (e.g. statistics, data science, economics), you either want no one or a person with extraordinarily deep expertise. </p><p>Interesting piece on the fraud that’s going on in Data Science: <a href="https://logicmag.io/intelligence/interview-with-an-anonymous-data-scientist/"><em>The Smart, the Stupid, and the Catastrophically Scary: An Interview with an Anonymous Data Scientist</em></a></p><p>What you don’t want is someone that knows enough to bullshit you but not enough to get it right. An indicator that you might have the right person is the phrase: ‘‘I’m not sure’’ or ‘‘ it depends on…’’. In these fields, the vast majority of so-called experts add no value at best or negative value at worst.</p><p>[2] This is what I admired so much about Systrom’s and Krieger’s Instagram. Their almost zen-like essentialism. No bloating, no fluff, trying very hard to take away things as they did about adding things. How many new features did they launch in a month before their Facebook acquisition? How many new features does IG launch now per month? </p><p>I’m not saying adding new features is bad. I’m also not saying that a company shouldn’t scale. The point I’m making is that entropy is real. It’s much easier for your product to become worse, than it is to become better. So if that’s not a core focus, it probably won’t happen by accident.</p><p>But scale and improvements in user love (which follow from a better service/product) are not mutually exclusive. Apple provides a data point. Especially during the Jobs reign. </p><p><em>More on this in the essay series: </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/deeplove"><em>Do You Have Customers Who Deeply Love You?</em></a><em> </em></p></div></div></div>]]>
