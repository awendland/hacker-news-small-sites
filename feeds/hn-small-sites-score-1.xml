<blockquote>
<p>tl;dr
<a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/automated-releases/">Here</a> you can find the first blog post about automated releasing. The purpose of this blog post is to show how you can do the same automation in non-JavaScript projects. Even if JavaScript community created tooling, you can still use it in other projects and don’t freak out.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This post and the <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/automated-releases/">previous one</a> come from our experience we gained when working on full automation for all tools maintained by <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/" target="_blank">AsyncaPI Initiative</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/asyncapi/" target="_blank">AsyncAPI</a> is a specification that you use to create machine-readable definitions of your event-driven APIs.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The previous post focused on JavaScript as the first library that we automated was our <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/generator/" target="_blank">generator</a>. It covered publishing to NPM and usage of the JavaScript community ecosystem. Now we have automation rolled out to all our libraries, Go-written too.</p>

<h2 id="what-i-need-to-automate-release">What I need to automate release?<a href="#what-i-need-to-automate-release" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>To automate a release efficiently, you need two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Machine-readable information that allows you to identify if a given commit should trigger a release or not.</li>
<li>Tooling that you can easily plug in and configure without the need to write everything from scratch.</li>
</ul>

<p>This automation is possible thanks to the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/" target="_blank">Conventional Commits</a> specification. The purpose of Conventional Commits is to make commits machine-readable but also human-readable. It defines a set of commit prefixes that can be easily parsed and analyzed by tooling and looks good to the human eye too.</li>
<li>The <a href="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release" target="_blank">Semantic Release</a> package and related plugins that support Conventional Commits and publishing to different channels like GitHub, NPM, Slack, and others.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="where-s-the-catch">Where’s the catch?<a href="#where-s-the-catch" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>This blog post is about the automation of releases for non-JavaScript projects. Let me be honest though, solutions I mentioned in the previous chapter come from the JavaScript community.</p>

<p>The problem is, there are people who <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/9pwzpn/why_do_people_hate_javascript/" target="_blank">Hate JavaScript</a>, they truly <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-is-JavaScript-so-hated" target="_blank">hate it</a> like it is a living thing. Although, I’m personally proud to be an idiot that has a programming language that I can use.</p>

<p>Conventional Commits specification is heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/angular/angular/blob/22b96b9/CONTRIBUTING.md#commit-message-format" target="_blank">Angular Commit Guidelines</a>. The Semantic Release package and its plugins ecosystem are all Node.js packages.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/10FHR5A4cXqVrO/giphy.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>If you have Java or Go project, you can still use these tools. You do not have to keep <code>package.json</code> in your repository, so don’t worry, you can keep your repository clean. The great folks from Semantic Release thought about you too.</p>

<p>One of the projects where we use this JavaScript tools is our parser for AsyncAPI documents. It is a <a href="https://github.com/asyncapi/parser-go" target="_blank">Go parser</a>.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-release-configuration">Semantic Release configuration<a href="#semantic-release-configuration" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>The Semantic Release package supports configuration files in different formats and file types. You are not bound to <code>package.json</code>. We chose to use <code>.releaserc</code> file in YAML format but there are <a href="https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release/blob/master/docs/usage/configuration.md#configuration-file" target="_blank">other options</a> too.</p>

<pre><code>---
branches:
- master
plugins:
- - "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer"
  - preset: conventionalcommits
- - "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator"
  - preset: conventionalcommits
- - "@semantic-release/github"
  - assets:
    - path: asyncapi-parser.darwin.amd64
      label: Binary - Darwin AMD64
    - path: asyncapi-parser.linux.amd64
      label: Binary - Linux AMD64
    - path: asyncapi-parser.windows.amd64.exe
      label: Binary - Windows AMD64
</code></pre>

<p>Our configuration uses plugins to:
- Analyze Git commits with Conventional Commits specification.
- Create a Git tag and generate changelog for release notes.
- Publish a release with additional assets. We compile our parser as binaries that are compatible with many platforms and we want to have them easily accessible with each release.</p>

<p>We place the configuration under <code>.github/workflows/</code>, next to our GitHub Action release workflow file: <code>release.yml</code>. It indicates that it is for release only, nothing else.</p>

<h3 id="release-workflow">Release workflow<a href="#release-workflow" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h3>

<p>Let us have a look at the differences between this workflow and the workflow I described for a typical JavaScript project <a href="https://www.asyncapi.com/blog/automated-releases/">here</a>.</p>

<p>First, you define a <code>test</code> job with the Go environment to trigger tests with different versions of Go.</p>

<pre><code>test:
  name: 'Testing'
  runs-on: ubuntu-latest
  strategy:
    matrix:
      go: 
        - '1.14'
        - '1.13'
        - '1.12' 
  steps:
    - name: Checkout repo
      uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Setup Go
      uses: actions/setup-go@v1.1.2
      with:
        go-version: '${{ matrix.go }}'
    - name: Invoking go test
      run: go test ./...
</code></pre>

<p>The next step is the <code>release</code> job, where you can differentiate two core steps. The first part is the generation of the binaries that you want to expose in the GitHub release.</p>

<pre><code>- name: Setup Go
  uses: actions/setup-go@v1.1.2
  with:
    go-version: '1.14'
- name: Invoking go vet and binaries generation
  run: |
    go vet ./...
    GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.darwin.amd64 ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
    GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.linux.amd64 ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
    GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.windows.amd64.exe ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
</code></pre>

<p>So far, it is all Go-related operations. How about the release? For the release, you need to set up a Node.js environment to run Semantic Release. Node.js community has this excellent package, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/npx" target="_blank">npx</a>, that allows you to run a package without installing it, and this is what you can do here in the workflow.</p>

<pre><code>- name: Setup Node.js
  uses: actions/setup-node@v1
  with:
    node-version: 13
- name: Add plugin for conventional commits
  run: npm install conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits
  working-directory: ./.github/workflows
- name: Release to GitHub
  working-directory: ./.github/workflows
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
    GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: asyncapi-bot
    GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: info@asyncapi.io
    GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: asyncapi-bot
    GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: info@asyncapi.io
  run: npx semantic-release
</code></pre>

<p>You only have to install <code>conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits</code> explicitly if you want to use <code>conventionalcommits</code> preset when analyzing Git commits and generating the changelog:</p>

<pre><code>plugins:
- - "@semantic-release/commit-analyzer"
  - preset: conventionalcommits
- - "@semantic-release/release-notes-generator"
  - preset: conventionalcommits
</code></pre>

<p>Take a look at full release workflow for reference:</p>

<pre><code>name: Release

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  test:
    name: 'Testing'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    strategy:
      matrix:
        go: 
          - '1.14'
          - '1.13'
          - '1.12' 
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v1.1.2
        with:
          go-version: '${{ matrix.go }}'
      - name: Invoking go test
        run: go test ./...
  
  release:
    name: 'Release to GitHub'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: 
      - test
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repo
        uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Setup Go
        uses: actions/setup-go@v1.1.2
        with:
          go-version: '1.14'
      - name: Invoking go vet and binaries generation
        run: |
          go vet ./...
          GOOS=darwin GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.darwin.amd64 ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
          GOOS=linux GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.linux.amd64 ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
          GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 go build -o=.github/workflows/asyncapi-parser.windows.amd64.exe ./cmd/api-parser/main.go
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: 13
      - name: Add plugin for conventional commits
        run: npm install conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits
        working-directory: ./.github/workflows
      - name: Release to GitHub
        working-directory: ./.github/workflows
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GH_TOKEN }}
          GIT_AUTHOR_NAME: asyncapi-bot
          GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL: info@asyncapi.io
          GIT_COMMITTER_NAME: asyncapi-bot
          GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL: info@asyncapi.io
        run: npx semantic-release
</code></pre>

<p>You see, you can still have your project “clean” from any JavaScript-specific files and references. Everything you need for running your release with the JavaScript community tooling is only in the release-related configuration.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a href="#conclusion" arialabel="Anchor"> #︎</a> </h2>

<p>I don’t think I can ever understand this “hate” towards JavaScript. I think, though, that you can “hate” the language, but if you see some amazing tooling built with it, that can increase your productivity, grit your teeth, put bias aside, and enjoy life. Especially, if in exchange you get this excellent feature, notification about release under the Issue and Pull Request:</p>

<p>One of the few remaining challenges of deploying applications as microservices, running in containers, is complexity. A cloud environment may start as a simple ecosystem for microservices, but it doesn’t take much for that simplicity to be replaced by a complex web of containers.</p>



<p>Modern container orchestration systems like <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubernetes</a> don’t really help with simplicity either. In fact, it is too easy to end up with a complex network of pods across multiple clusters when you don’t incorporate Kubernetes deployment best practices correctly.</p>



<p>When it was first made popular back in late 2019, the <a href="https://cnab.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloud Native Application Bundles</a>, or CNAB, is designed to combat the complex nature of containerisation. Today, CNAB has become the go-to standard for simplifying the process of bundling, installing, and managing apps in containers.</p>



<h2>A Cloud-Agnostic Solution</h2>



<p>CNAB was first introduced in 2018, but it wasn’t widely adopted until late in 2019. As a standard, one of the biggest advantages offered by CNAB is its support for any cloud computing environment. Yes, it is a cloud-agnostic approach that can be implemented in any environment.</p>



<p>In fact, the primary goal of CNAB is to make containerisation easier to incorporate across different cloud environments. Moving a bundled app from one cloud cluster to another should involve nothing but the standardised process.</p>



<p>CNAB itself is a tool that was initially developed by Microsoft and Docker. Considering that <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker </a>is still used on top of existing container orchestration systems, it is easy to see how CNAB immediately became the universal tool to use.</p>



<p>Before we get to the technical side of CNAB, there are several additional advantages to acknowledge first, starting with the fact that <strong><em>CNAB makes deploying applications easy</em></strong>. Since packages are standardised, you can scale up the distribution of pre-made apps.</p>



<p>That level of standardisation is perfect for developers offering on-premise or self-hosted solutions. Rather than having to manually install and configure everything, applications can be delivered as packages or bundles, and any cloud administrator can install them easily.</p>



<p>CNAB also <strong><em>highlights security as an important factor</em></strong>. The signing and verification runtimes that are part of CNAB makes securing bundled apps easy. In fact, administrators can always check the crypto signature of bundled apps to make sure that they come from legitimate sources.</p>



<h2>Introducing: Duffle</h2>



<p>The packaging and unpacking of cloud-native applications are best done using <a href="https://duffle.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duffle</a>, a tool natively built to adopt CNAB. It is the implementation of the CNAB specification to the letter, despite many other tools introducing their own takes on authoring application bundles.</p>



<p>Duffle depends on a Docker engine to build and install CNABs. If you are using a local development environment, you need to make sure that you can use Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows, or Docker on Linux to eliminate the dependency. You can also use Docker in the cloud if one is available.</p>



<p>The tool itself is straightforward. Once you have your application ready for deployment, simply run <strong><em>duffle build ./appfolder/yourapplication/</em></strong> to start the process. Duffle will take you through 6 steps and you will have a successful build at the end of the wizard.</p>



<p>Running bundled applications requires you to run <strong><em>duffle install</em></strong> command while cleaning up applications can be done with the <strong><em>duffle uninstall</em></strong> command. You may also want to generate credentials for the bundled apps for them to run properly.</p>



<p>There are some parameters to be defined before you can bundle applications successfully, starting with the usual name-version-description-keywords combination of the metadata. You can then add <em>cnab</em> under <em>invocationImages</em> and begin defining how the bundle should be processed.</p>



<p>Everything else is easy. The app itself can be in any form you like as long as it is designed to run in Docker containers. You can also define user-overridable parameters for the install process, plus you can embed executable images if there are dependencies to manage.</p>



<p>That’s the entire CNAB standard. As long as these parameters are defined, you will have no trouble creating bundles and installing them using the commands we discussed earlier.</p>



<h2>Thick and Thin</h2>



<p>One last thing to understand about CNAB and how it makes containerisation of cloud-native applications easy is the two types of bundles you can create: thin bundle and thick bundle. As the names suggest, thin bundle contains only the bundle definition, while thick bundle also includes all of the invocation images and additional resources that may be required.</p>



<p>A thin bundle requires an active repository. This is because when the bundle is installed, tools like Duffle will try to find the correct packages from storage repos. Thick bundle is usually the safer way to go when you need to bundle applications without additional dependencies, such as when the bundle is needed for on-premise deployment.</p>



<p>Every bundle is signed to prevent tampering. Regardless of the bundle type you use, CNAB allows for consistent bundling, installation, and management of containerised applications without fail.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  

  <p>It’s hard to write software that is easy to maintain and adapt to change.
There’s a multitude of maxims to try and tease out general solutions to this, or
at least approaches that can mitigate the problem.</p>
<p>This point did the rounds on Hacker News and elsewhere:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Write code that is easy to delete, not easy to extend.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://programmingisterrible.com/post/139222674273/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete-not-easy-to">programmingisterrible</a></p>
<p>This is one of the better maxims for producing maintainable and adaptable
software. One of the most important aspects that distinguishes it is that it
acknowledges that <em>your code is probably bad</em>. At some point, in some situation,
in someone’s perception, the code you are writing now is going to be bad and
difficult. The person that encounters that difficulty is also likely to be you.</p>
<p>Other maxims and approaches to this problem go down the route of trying to
improve the code, and once they’ve taken that junction, they leave behind a
whole avenue of thought around acknowledging the basic fact that any code will
be bad in some situation, and that trying to optimise it often tends to actually
exacerbate this problem. <em>Trying to improve it makes it worse.</em> This is quite
funny, and increasingly enlightening the more you are forced to confront it.</p>
<p>(To stretch this even further, have a look at the concept of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_wei">無爲</a>, or “inaction”. But that is probably
an unsupportable digression.)</p>
<p>Once you acknowledge that your code will inevitably be an annoyance to someone
at some point, you are liberated to find different ways to make the situation
better, if not the code. Focusing on how to make it easy to delete is a good
route into that thought pattern.</p>
<p>For example, there’s a tendancy to have code extend its tentacles further than
they should go, rather than minding its own business. We try to generalise
beyond the problem that is currently being solved. “We can abstract this out and
then the same code will also solve x, y and z”. “We can prevent this problem
that I have just imagined from ever happening”. “We can make it easier to
achieve a, b and c in future.” Maxims like DRY actively encourage this line of
thinking.</p>
<p>“Make it easy to delete”, on the other hand, takes you down a different path.
“Let’s keep this simple and self-contained”. “Let’s encapsulate this cleanly”.
“Let’s make fewer assumptions about the rest of the application, and let the
rest of the application make fewer assumptions about this part”. These are
healthier ideas to be thinking about as you write new code.</p>
<p>When thinking of “business logic”, we should also think of “mind your own
business logic”. It’s a kind of politeness. Code that is easy to delete tends to
fulfil that.</p>

    <p>When writing React apps or modern JavaScript in general, we often create files with a set of reusable functions or classes. People tend to use default exports in such cases and I'm going to explain, why it's not the best idea to use them.</p>
<span id="more-4175"></span>
<h3>What is a default export?</h3>
<p>The origin of default exports comes from a willingness to replicate the functionality of exporting modules from CommonJS spec to ES6.
So what is a default export basically? Let's have a look at the following piece of code:</p>
<pre><code>// src/components/SomeComponent.js
export default class SomeComponent {
    ...
}</code></pre>
<p>So you can import it into another file like in the following example:</p>
<pre><code>// src/App.js
import SomeComponent from './components/SomeComponent';</code></pre>
<p>After importing it you can use it however you like in the code of <code>App.js</code> file. The important thing to note is that you don't have to use <code>SomeComponent</code> as a name of imported code. It can be literally anything, because there's no strict convention here.</p>
<h3>What is a named export?</h3>
<p>Comparing to the default exports example it looks differently. First of all there's no <code>default</code> keyword.</p>
<pre><code>// src/components/SomeComponent.js
class SomeComponent {
    ...
}

export const OtherComponent = () =&gt; {
    ...
}

export { SomeComponent };</code></pre>
<p>So you can import it into another file like in the following example:</p>
<pre><code>// src/App.js
import { SomeComponent, OtherComponent } from './components/SomeComponent';</code></pre>
<p>So what are the main differences between both approaches and why you might consider using default exports as a bad practice? The explanation is in the next section.</p>
<h3>The fight</h3>
<p>Let's compare both approaches. I'll try to explain you which of these approaches is better and why.</p>
<h4>Naming convention strictness</h4>
<p>Like I mentioned earlier, in the default export section, using default exports and importing into another file, you are not restricted to use a component name (or class name, or whatever) defined in the definition file. While importing you can change its name into anything that you find reasonable.</p>
<pre><code>// src/components/SomeComponent.js
export default class SomeComponent { ... }

// src/App.js
import AnyComponent from './components/SomeComponent'</code></pre>
<p>In case of named exports it's not so easy to use any name for imported piece of code. You are restricted to use names defined in the definition file of a piece code.</p>
<pre><code>// src/components/SomeComponent.js
class SomeComponent { ... }

export { SomeComponent };

// src/App.js
import { SomeComponent } from './components/SomeComponent';</code></pre>
<p>But what if you want to change the name of imported component? It's not complicated:</p>
<pre><code>// src/components/SomeComponent.js
class SomeComponent { ... }

export SomeComponent;

// src/App.js
import { SomeComponent as AnyComponent } from './components/SomeComponent';</code></pre>
<p>It might be useful when importing components with similar names from different sources.
In the case when you're exporting many components with similar names from many different files, it might be useful to set some sort of namespace for them. Let's take a look:</p>
<pre><code>// src/components/SomeComponent.js
class Button { ... }

export const Panel = () =&gt; {};
export const config = {};

export Button;

// src/App.js
import * as UI from './components/SomeComponent';

function App () {
    doSomething(UI.config);

    return (
        &lt;UI.Panel&gt;
            &lt;h1&gt;Title&lt;/h1&gt;
            &lt;UI.Button /&gt;
        &lt;/UI.Panel&gt;
    )
}</code></pre>
<p>The last way of importing components is commonly used in React environment for importing React library in TypeScript projects:</p>
<pre><code>import * as React from 'react'</code></pre>
<p>In my opinion having multiple ways of importing components versus one unreliable way of importing them is much better in terms of bulding quality apps. You can accomodate imports to your needs.</p>
<h4>Error reporting</h4>
<p>Spotting errors early is extremely important in software development. From my experience using default exports is error-prone solution because you don't know whether a specific piece of code exists in a file.
When I'm using named exports my code editor can early spot errors by checking whether an imported component exists in a source file. I don't have to worry about mistyping component names.
And there we are, typos, these are the most problematic errors, because sometimes they tend to be different to spot a first glance, especially when doing code reviews in apps like Github or Gitlab.</p>
<h4>Long term code mainteinance</h4>
<p>This one is pretty important when building professional apps, not just pet projects that will never get into the public. Choosing the right exporting convention, I mean using named exports over default exports increases code maintainability a lot.
Let's imagine a situation when you're doing a code refactor. You're looking for occurences of a specific component in a codebase. With named exports it's pretty simple, because the imported component name usually is the same as exported one.
With default exports it's not that easy, the component names might differ, sometimes a lot. It can have a different name, the name can have a typo. It's all confusing and makes code mainteinance harder.</p>
<h3>Default exports as necessary evil sometimes</h3>
<p>Sometimes you might be forced to use default exports anyway. Because of other tools that are used when developing React apps. Such tool's developers didn't accomodate it for using code exported using named exports convention. For instance when lazy loading React components. It's a code <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/rfcs/pull/64" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">design decision made by React team</a>.
At the end you have to write something like the following, in order to lazy load your React component:</p>
<pre><code>// e.g. App.js
const LazyComponent = React.lazy(() =&gt; import('./LazyComponent'));

function App {
    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;Suspense fallback={&lt;div&gt;Loading ...&lt;/div&gt;}&gt;
                &lt;LazyComponent /&gt;
            &lt;/Suspense&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    )
}</code></pre>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>In projects I'm working on I'm using named exports because it makes a codebase more predictable and less error-prone. I prefer getting errors as soon as possible when exporting non-existing components and I love having classes names and component names the same as in the their source files. It helps me a lot in reading the code.</p></section></div>]]>

Through machine learning models built into the operating system, these sounds can be picked up and transmitted to the user in any way that they wish.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/38/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png?q=20" width="700" height="1110" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png" width="700" height="1110" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png 500w" sizes="500px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Real-Time Text on the iPhone.</figcaption></figure><p id="2bf5">Group FaceTime calls have become more important than ever during the global pandemic, and Apple has added a small but important accessibility feature to them. Now, if a member of a group FaceTime call is using sign language to communicate, their video will be automatically pinned.</p><p id="ab6c">Using computer vision to detect this can be a boon to those with hearing loss, since reading sign language while the screen is moving around can be frustrating.</p><p id="43b4">In addition to this, Apple has made further improvements to its Real-Time Text feature, which is used for text based communication during phone calls. Previously, it was difficult for RTT users to multitask during phone calls, but it no longer requires the full screen.</p><p id="0458">When we think of accessibility on iOS, VoiceOver is often the first to come to mind. This year, VoiceOver received several significant updates, making it even more useful than before. If you aren’t familiar with it, VoiceOver is Apple’s screen reader, available on all platforms, including iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS.</p><h2 id="ae54">VoiceOver Recognition</h2><p id="aa80">In the past, VoiceOver would require developers to adopt it inside their apps to work well on third-party apps.</p><blockquote><p id="210b">On-device intelligence recognizes key elements displayed on your screen to add VoiceOver support for app and web experiences that don’t have accessibility support built in. — Apple</p></blockquote><p id="2717">This year, Apple is tapping into their machine learning technology to semantically detect where and how to use VoiceOver on unsupported apps. This makes virtually all apps natively supported by VoiceOver and increases their accessibility for those with visual impairments.</p><h2 id="6119">Image Descriptions</h2><p id="6f0d">To make VoiceOver even more useful, Apple has used its computer vision library with <em>even more</em> machine learning to detect the contents of an image.</p><blockquote><p id="2f5f">VoiceOver reads complete-sentence descriptions of images and photos within apps and on the web. VoiceOver speaks the text it identifies within images and photos. — Apple</p></blockquote><p id="f5ed">Instead of simply stating that an image is present, VoiceOver can now provide detailed descriptions of what’s pictured in an image for more useful information to VoiceOver users. It can also detect text in an image through optical character recognition — another great way that machine learning is being used in the iOS 14 update!</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="d6f7">Evidently, there have been plenty of great updates at WWDC20 in accessibility, with even more that weren’t listed here. By releasing a large number of small features, Apple has made their devices more accessible than ever. And, they’ve supercharged many of their flagship accessibility solutions by coupling machine learning technology with them.</p><p id="ab7f">Be sure to <strong>smash that “clap” button</strong> as many times as you can, <strong>share this tutorial</strong> on social media, and <strong>follow me on Twitter.</strong></p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="08a6"><em>Editor’s Note:</em><a href="http://heartbeat.fritz.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> </em><strong><em>Heartbeat</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong><em>is a contributor-driven online publication and community dedicated to exploring the emerging intersection of mobile app development and machine learning.

                            <p><strong>If you threw a rock in a room full of African startup founders today</strong>, you would likely hit one offering to give users loans “in just 10 minutes!” via their mobile phones. This should not surprise you; in the past 24 months, we have witnessed a windfall for fintech startups on the continent, with investors <a href="https://qz.com/africa/1211233/how-much-did-african-startups-raise-in-2017-partech-disrupt-africa/">deploying more capital</a> into the sector than anywhere else.</p>
<p>The problem they aim to solve is well-documented. Many consumers in emerging markets operate entirely outside the formal financial ecosystem. They are financially ‘excluded’, and in response, startups hope to harness mobile technology to ‘include’ them in the formal economy. There is little infrastructure to ‘disrupt’, so these startups <a href="https://qz.com/africa/749008/african-fintech-isnt-disrupting-the-financial-industry-its-building-it/">must build it</a>. Take lending. Today’s formal financial systems are designed around predictability; a certain amount of money called “salary” shows up on schedule every month, and stability; this salary comes from the same source [1]. The bank’s risk assessment methods only support giving loans against this consistency. But these conditions are increasingly not true for the average consumer in developing markets. Income is irregular and unpredictable, and most transactions happen offline via cash, other signals must be used to determine creditworthiness.</p>
<p>Fintech startups are betting big that they can accurately figure out who <em>can</em> and <em>will</em> repay unsecured loans, offer those loans to them directly, circumvent the traditional institutions who have failed so far, and <a href="https://www.thesubtext.io/paylaters-personal-piggybank">build new financial ecosystems</a> around themselves.</p>
<p>But one company, <a href="http://mines.io/">Mines</a>, has just <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/offering-a-white-labeled-lending-service-in-emerging-markets-mines-raises-13-million/">raised a $13 million Series A</a> round to do the exact opposite.</p>
                                        <h3>All Men Are Not Equal</h3>
<p>The dominant narrative in startups today closely tracks the story of the demise of knights. In the Tudor period (1485 - 1603), the English Renaissance brought new philosophy, new art, and new literature. Henry VII took the throne like you would expect a 15th century monarch to: noble knights on horseback engaging in chivalric combat. Being a warrior in those days required years of intense training and mastery of handheld weapons like swords, and axes, and war hammers.</p>
                                                                        
                <div>

                                        <div>
                        <hr>
                        <p>Battle of Bosworth by Philip James de Loutherbourg (1804); This is where Henry VII won the Wars of the Roses.</p>
                    </div>
                                    </div>
                                        <p>But the Renaissance also brought new technology. By the end of Elizabeth I’s reign - the end of the Tudor period - battles were won by siege warfare [2] and projectile weapons like crossbows, cannons, and muskets. Times had changed, but medieval knights could not keep up. The result was that all men were made ‘equal’. Knights and castles that were once impenetrable were now vulnerable to armies of barely-trained peasants with bows and guns. The knights had become [3] ‘priests of a dead religion’, and became obsolete as the grounds of warfare shifted beneath their feet. The things that once made them powerful were now their greatest handicaps (e.g., reinforcing their breastplates to withstand bolts and arrows, would have made them too heavy to carry). They were - to misuse the term as we often do - disrupted.</p>
<p>In the same way, accepted wisdom says [4] the battle between startups and incumbents comes down to whether the startups get distribution before the incumbents gets innovation. “The large corporations are not nimble enough!”, the narrative goes. “Innovate or die!” “Startups will disrupt you, and you will be disrupted!” Mobile, specifically enabled by internet connectivity, is changing the nature of markets, and enabling young companies in Africa compete ‘unfairly’ with old, large institutions. But instead of competing with legacy players, <a href="http://mines.io/">Mines</a> is trying to empower them.</p>

<p>Mines started in 2014 as an AI research project by Stanford Professor, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunle-olukotun-80a2735/">Kunle Olukotun</a>, who partnered with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ekechi/">Ekechi Nwokah</a>, then a Principal Security Engineer at Amazon AWS, to apply the technology to risk assessment for financial services. Since then, they have integrated with 9Mobile (FKA Etisalat), a Nigerian telco operator to launch <a href="https://www.kwikcash.ng/">Kwikcash</a>, disbursing 4.5 billion naira ($12.5m), with an average ticket size of 12,000 naira ($33) in the past 18 months, according to MD, Nigeria and VP Commercial, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adiasowho/">Adia Sowho</a>, ex Director of Digital Business at 9Mobile. She reckons they are the largest credit platform in Nigeria today. (The company has also penned partnerships with Airtel, and payment processor, Interswitch.)</p>

                                        <h3>Competition By Ecosystem</h3>
<p>Remember the above quote: “the battle [...] comes down to whether the startups get distribution before the incumbents gets innovation”. Mines - in theory, at least - is handing innovation on a platter to banks, telcos, large retailers, and payment processors. The knights are getting guns, too!</p>
<p>By offering them credit-in-a-box, Mines is sacrificing data ownership and a direct relationship with the consumer for faster - better - distribution. But why is this the right approach? Their pitch to their clients is that they [Mines] have built better technology than they [clients] can build, and that they [Mines] have a better product than other consumer players can deliver. If that is true, why not take this ‘better’ product directly to the consumers and beat everyone else? Isn’t this the more valuable position in the value chain?</p>
<p>I posed this question to Adia (she was kind enough to join me for <a href="https://twitter.com/skweird/status/1028975798139670528">a drink</a> a few days ago), and she argued that partnerships are the most effective path to scale in these emerging markets. I see the logic here, and mostly agree. Big corporates own distribution today and <a href="https://twitter.com/skweird/status/1025989325387902977">thus</a>, have most of the leverage. Consumer markets are shallow, and mobile penetration has not yet delivered its great promise of integrating fragmented markets. (We will talk more about this soon.)</p>
<p>But in taking this approach, Mines is also doing two things:</p>
<ul><li>Commoditizing credit scoring and sucking out air for smaller startups, forcing them to look elsewhere for growth. For example, almost all digital credit/fintech apps in Nigeria offer bill payments and airtime purchases as a feature, ensuring that nobody will switch apps to access that feature. The same might happen with credit.</li><li>Creating the opportunity for Mines to create an ecosystem of ecosystems; powering even other fintech startups. This would provide the opportunity for, say, Piggybank or a service to quickly launch a loans product like I <a href="https://www.thesubtext.io/paylaters-personal-piggybank">predicted</a> in Issue #1 (I admit, confirmation bias might be getting to me here...).</li></ul><p>If the above is true, then we will arrive here:</p>

<p>This is the big opportunity. Mines’ many markets are not the countries it plans to expand into (though, the company’s leadership have taken pains to <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/10/offering-a-white-labeled-lending-service-in-emerging-markets-mines-raises-13-million/">communicate</a> that they serve ‘emerging markets’, not ‘Nigeria’ or ‘Africa’), but all the different businesses, each with their own pool of customers, who will operate their own financial ecosystems with Mines at the base. Some of these customers will use products from more than one Mines client, helping Mines get better at identifying good borrowers, and forming credit-scoring infrastructure.</p>
<p>But therein lies my main reservation; by relying on its partners for its data and its growth, Mines both extends its reach and limits its grasp. Today, like most other consumer credit platforms, the company’s flagship product, Kwikcash requires users to have BVN …</p></div></div></div>

At its root we have a Cargo workspace with a <code>binaries</code> crate, and a number of supporting library crates.</p><p>Having our crates in one repo makes them easy to reference in our <code>binaries</code> crate without needing to publish to <a href="https://crates.io/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crates.io</a> or get too fancy with specifying git dependencies in our <code>Cargo.toml</code>. When the time comes to publish these libraries as open source, it's trivial to break it out into its own repo.</p><a href="#library,-binary,-why-not-both" id="library,-binary,-why-not-both"><h3>Library, binary, why not both?</h3></a><p>We have one main library crate that contains a unified API for talking to hardware, media codecs, network protocols, etc. Outside of that private API, we also have standalone crates in our workspace that we consider candidates for open-sourcing. For example, we’ve written our own actor framework fit for long-running high-throughput actors, as well as our own network protocol for reliable, high-bandwidth, low-latency media streaming.

We use separate binaries for different parts of the tonari system and each of these lives in <code>binaries</code>, a combination library/binary crate. Its library modules contains a set of reusable actors that combine our private API with our actor system, and then a collection of individual binaries that consume these actors and define the plumbing between them.</p><a href="#flags-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see" id="flags-as-far-as-the-eye-can-see"><h3>Flags as far as the eye can see</h3></a><p>We make extensive use of feature flags to allow development of our project on different OSes (like Brian's 1970s-era MacBook Pro) or different hardware configurations. This allows us to easily swap out camera hardware without extra runtime checks or using awful <code>sed</code> hacks.

For example, Linux uses <code>v4l2</code> (Video For Linux...2) to access most webcams, but other webcams might have their own SDK.  To compile for platforms that don't use <code>v4l2</code> or when an SDK isn't available for a particular OS, we can put those SDKs behind feature flags and export a common interface.

As a (simplified) concrete example, let's say we have a common camera interface defined as a trait:</p><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> Capture <span>{</span>
    
    <span>fn</span> <span>capture</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>self</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> Vec<span>&lt;</span>u8<span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre><p>Let's also say we have three different camera interfaces - <code>v4l2</code>, <code>corevideo</code>, and <code>polaroid.</code> We can make our binaries work exclusively with this trait to be flexible, and we can swap in different implementations of <code>Capture</code> with feature flags.</p><pre><code><span>#[cfg(feature = "v4l2")]</span>
<span>mod</span> v4l2 <span>{</span>
    <span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> V4l2Capture <span>{</span>

For example, we can have a struct which has a field - <code>video_capture: Box&lt;dyn Capture&gt;</code> which will let us store any type which can <code>Capture</code> from a camera.

An example <code>Cargo.toml</code> file to support the capture implementations we wrote above might look something like …</p></div></div>

            <p><span>2020-05-22</span></p><p>If you use git then you should almost certainly create a <em>global</em> <code>gitignore</code>
file to ignore things like that should almost never be version controlled, e.g.</p>
<ul>
<li>operating system cruft (<code>.DS_Store</code>, <code>Thumbs.db</code>)</li>
<li>editor tempfiles and non-shared<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> configuration (<code>*.swp</code>, <code>.vscode</code>)</li>
<li>compiled output (<code>*.o</code>, <code>__pycache__</code>, <code>build/</code>)</li>
<li>virtual environments and external dependencies (<code>venv</code>, <code>node_modules</code>)</li>
<li>files you should rename before you commit (<code>Untitled.ipynb</code>)</li>
<li>tooling caches and output (<code>.mypy_cache</code>)</li>
</ul>
<p>By default, the global gitignore path is <code>~/.config/git/ignore</code> on Unix/macOS
and <code>%USERPROFILE%\git\ignore</code> on Windows.</p>
<p>The syntax is just like that for <code>.gitignore</code> files. Here’s what <a href="https://github.com/williamsmj/dotfiles/blob/master/git/.config/git/ignore">mine looks
like</a>.</p>
<h2 id="dont-misuse-the-repository-gitignore">Don’t misuse the repository <code>.gitignore</code></h2>
<p>You might be tempted to put this stuff in a per-repository <code>.gitignore</code> file. I
think that’s fine (if you <em>insist</em>) for things that are guaranteed to be
created in a working copy of a particular repository (e.g. <code>__pycache__</code> in a
Python project), and thus at particular risk of being merged by collaborators
who don’t have a global gitignore like this. But I much prefer to avoid it for
OS-specific or editor-specific stuff. Here’s why:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>These are things you always want to ignore. Recreating and updating this
file in every repository is a waste of time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Other users of the repository do not care about the crap created by the
operating system or the editor you happen to be using currently, and you
don’t care about theirs. This stuff should not be in the shared,
version-controlled configuration.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you follow this advice, repository <code>.gitignore</code> files will contain only of
project-specific configuration. They will be shorter and, if you work on a
project with lots of collaborators, they will produce less history churn.</p>
<h2 id="overriding-gitignore">Overriding gitignore</h2>
<p>If you do want to override your global behavior for some reason then you have a
couple of options. You can either manually <code>git add -f</code> the files. Or you can
use gitignore’s <code>!</code> negation syntax in the repository’s <code>.gitignore</code> or
<code>.git/info/exclude</code>.</p>
<p>So, for example, if you’ve ignored <code>foo.txt</code> globally, but you really want to
commit it in a particular repository, you can <code>git add -f foo.txt</code> or put
<code>!foo.txt</code> in a repository <code>.gitignore</code> (which is normally version controlled
and shared with collaborators) <code>.git/info/exclude</code> (which is not, and is
therefore a truly local configuration).</p>
<h2 id="you-dont-need-to-change-coreexcludesfile">You don’t need to change <code>core.excludesfile</code></h2>
<p>You’ll see
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7335420/global-git-ignore">advice</a> to do
something like <code>git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore</code> to tell git
where you keep your global gitignore. There is no need to do this unless you
object to the perfectly reasonable default location
(<code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/git/ignore</code> or <code>%USERPROFILE%\git\ignore</code>).</p>

<p><em>Pont</em> is an online implementation of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qwirkle">Qwirkle, a board game by Mindware Games</a>.
It was written for my parents,

<p>Play is split into <strong>rooms</strong>,
which are identified by a three-word code

Within each room,
the game distributes pieces,
enforces the game rules,
and provides a local chat window.</p>
<p>Unusually, it's a web-based multiplayer game <strong>without any Javascript</strong>:
both the client and server are written in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>,
which is compiled into <a href="https://webassembly.org/">WebAssembly</a> to run on the browser.
(There's a Javascript shim to load the WebAssembly module, but I didn't have to write it myself)</p>
<h2>Architecture</h2>
<p>Keep in mind, I'm <em>not a web developer</em>,
so this is probably a weird <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outsider_art">outsider architecture</a>
for web applications.
Here's what the system looks like:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/diagram.svg" alt="Diagram"></p>
<p>The system uses <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a> for certificates:
both static assets and WebSocket communication are encrypted
between the client and the server.
The game server does not communicate securely with the NGINX proxy,
but if anyone is on the server watching,
I've got bigger problems.</p>
<p>The <code>wasm</code> bundle and <code>pont-server</code> executable are both
written in Rust and managed in the <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont"><code>pont</code> repository</a>.
They both depend on <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-common/src/lib.rs"><code>pont-common</code></a>,
which defines basic types and logic for gameplay
(e.g. so that both the client and server can check whether a move is legal).</p>
<p>The client and server communicate via <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API">WebSockets</a>.
Messages are strongly typed as an <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-common/src/lib.rs#L7-L48"><code>enum</code> in <code>pont-common</code></a>,
serialized using <a href="https://serde.rs/">Serde</a>,
and packed into <a href="https://github.com/servo/bincode">bincode</a>
to be sent as binary WebSocket messages.</p>
<h2>Server</h2>
<p>The game server using async Rust,
which was... exciting:</p>
<ul>
<li>There's a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/ej649l/a_summary_of_the_current_state_of_async_rust/fcw16a9/">"very polite cold war"</a>
going on between the two major (incompatible?) runtimes,
with packages that only work in one or the other</li>
<li>An <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/channel/mpsc/index.html">infinite</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/tokio/0.2.21/tokio/sync/mpsc/fn.channel.html">supply</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/crossbeam-channel/0.4.2/crossbeam_channel/">of</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/channel/oneshot/fn.channel.html">options</a>
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures-channel-preview/0.3.0-alpha.19/futures_channel/index.html">for</a>
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/mpsc/index.html">channels</a></li>
<li>General confusion between <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/"><code>futures</code></a>,
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/future/index.html"><code>std::Future</code></a>, and
<a href="https://docs.rs/futures-util/0.3.5/futures_util/"><code>futures_util</code></a>
(exacerbated by the fact that Googling for things will land you
into a random version of the docs)</li>
<li>Error messages that rival C++ in incomprehensibility</li>
</ul>
<p>To be fair, the Rust <code>async</code> ecosystem is relatively new,
so most of this can be ascribed to growing pains;
I'm sure that the ergonomics and library situation
will improve over time.</p>
<p>I ended up using the <a href="https://github.com/stjepang/smol"><code>smol</code> runtime</a>
because it's got relatively few dependencies,
and I appreciated that it wasn't trying to own the entire async universe
(unlike Tokio and <code>async-std</code>).</p>
<p>After getting over those hurdles,
the server architecture is relatively straightforward.
A bunch of independent tasks run asynchronously,
communicating to the outside world via WebSockets
and internally via <a href="https://docs.rs/futures/0.3.5/futures/channel/mpsc/fn.unbounded.html">unbounded MPSC queues</a>.</p>
<p>Here's an example of the server running one game (with two players),
plus one new client who has just connected.  Each rectangle
represents an async task:</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/server.svg" alt="Server"></p>
<p>The system has <code>2 + n_players + n_games</code> async tasks running at one time:</p>
<ul>
<li>A top-level task which accepts incoming connections.</li>
<li>A top-level task which logs the number of active rooms, once per minute</li>
<li>One async task per client connection, which passes messages between the WebSocket connection
and the application's internal queues.</li>
<li>One async task per room, which handles game state</li>
</ul>
<p>These tasks each map to a <a href="https://docs.rs/smol/0.1.10/smol/struct.Task.html"><code>smol::Task</code></a>.
(As a small optimization,
the first player's <code>Task</code> handles both the player communication
and running the room, which is why they're both blue in the diagram above)</p>
<p>The server compiles down to a 5 MB static binary.
The whole system is hosted on the smallest VM offered by
<a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a>,
which is a $5/month machine.
I'm looking forward to the inevitable <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slashdot_effect">DDOS</a>,
where I can see how well it scales!</p>
<h2>Client</h2>
<p>The client is <a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/src/lib.rs">2000 lines of framework-less excitement</a>.
It uses a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">state machine pattern</a>
to represent the flow of the game,
accepting messages from the server
and updating the state accordingly:
for example, top-level state flows from
<code>Connecting</code> to <code>CreateOrJoin</code> to <code>Playing</code>.</p>
<p>The game board is represented as an SVG;
everything else is standard HTML elements.
In fact, the whole UI is pre-constructed in
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/deploy/index.html"><code>index.html</code></a>
and revealed on demand.</p>
<p>The client has a bit of polish:
Pieces are animated as they move around the board,
and there's an optional color-blind mode,
which adds corner markings to indicate color.</p>
<p><img src="http://www.mattkeeter.com/projects/pont/cb.png" alt="Color-blind mode"></p>
<p>I use direct DOM manipulation
(from the <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-bindgen/api/web_sys/"><code>web-sys</code></a> crate)
to control the system.
This exercise has left me appreciating the usefulness of virtual DOMs,
but I didn't want to bring in the complexity of a framework.
(Is there a Rust + <code>wasm</code> version of <a href="https://svelte.dev/">Svelte</a> yet?)</p>
<p>For deployment,
I'm using <a href="https://rustwasm.github.io/wasm-pack/"><code>wasm-pack</code></a>
and serving the resulting <code>wasm</code> blob from the same server as the other static assets.</p>
<p>The main challenges on the client side were
(of course) dealing with cross-browser compatibility:
Safari, in particular, supports fewer features
and has funky handling of touch events.</p>
<h2>Conclusions</h2>
<p>After a bit of a learning curve,
this all worked surprisingly well!</p>
<p>The client side is still a bit messy,
with animations, UI inputs,
and server events all fighting to break the system's invariants.
For example,
there was a nasty bug where dragging the board while
an animation was running could drop the system into an invalid state.</p>
<p>This isn't surprising:
stateful UIs are hard,
which explains the popularity of declarative approaches.
At this point, the client is feature-complete
and hasn't quite collapsed under its own weight,
so I'm not inclined to do any dramatic refactorings.</p>
<p>Rust as a language continues to be great,
despite minor complaints.
I already discussed the async ecosystem above,
and won't dwell on that any further.
On the client side,
there are often impedance mismatches with WebAssembly:
for example, using Rust closures as callbacks
requires
<a href="https://github.com/mkeeter/pont/blob/master/pont-client/src/lib.rs#L1189-L1211">cryptic boilerplate</a>.</p>
<p>Still, with all of the pieces in place,
making changes is pleasantly fast,
and I trust the compiler to check that I haven't broken anything.</p>
<p>I'm particularly happy with the combination of WebSockets, Serde, and bincode:
having both the client and server process a strongly-typed stream of events
makes things easy to reason about.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
<p>I tried writing a Chunked-List data structure and made all the mistakes while using unsafe for that.</p>
<p>I have always avoided C and C++ because I knew I could not be trusted with Pointers.
Rust allows me to keep the high risk code contained into small unsafe { } sections.
I want to write down what mistakes I made inside those sections and how I caught them.
My next blog post will be about the data structure.</p>
<h2 id="not-reading-the-docs">Not reading the docs</h2>
<p>At first I just assumed that the .add() and .offset() methods on pointers would mutate the pointer.
They do not.
Instead they return a new pointer,
which gets dropped silently if you don't use it.
Unlike for example Result, which is must_use annotated.</p>
<pre><span>// wrong code:
</span><span>let </span><span>mut</span><span> buf </span><span>= </span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>];
</span><span>let</span><span> ptr </span><span>= &amp;mut</span><span> buf[</span><span>0</span><span>] </span><span>as *mut </span><span>u8</span><span>;
</span><span>unsafe </span><span>{ ptr.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>) }
</span><span>// ptr still points to the first element, with no warnings
</span></pre><pre><span>// better code:
</span><span>let </span><span>mut</span><span> buf </span><span>= </span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>];
</span><span>let</span><span> ptr </span><span>= &amp;mut</span><span> buf[</span><span>0</span><span>] </span><span>as *mut </span><span>u8</span><span>;
</span><span>let</span><span> ptr </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ ptr.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>) }
</span></pre>
<p>I caught that because I had tests and they failed.</p>
<p>So turns out that "better" is not good enough!
The pointer points to the first <em>element</em>
and while going one past the element is not UB,
using it would be.
We need a pointer to the whole array if we want to move around in it.</p>
<pre><span>// correct? code:
</span><span>let </span><span>mut</span><span> buf </span><span>= </span><span>[</span><span>1</span><span>, </span><span>2</span><span>];
</span><span>let</span><span> ptr </span><span>=</span><span> buf.</span><span>as_mut_ptr</span><span>();
</span><span>let</span><span> ptr </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ ptr.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>) }
</span></pre>

<h2 id="alignment-issues">Alignment-issues</h2>
<p>In the data structure I was building each chunk would have
a fixed size/capacity and link to the next chunk.
The basic data structure is, assuming 64 bit,  defined as:</p>
<pre><span>pub </span><span>struct </span><span>Chunk&lt;T&gt; {
    </span><span>buf</span><span>: [</span><span>u8</span><span>; 4096 - 2 - 8],
    </span><span>len</span><span>: </span><span>u16</span><span>,
    </span><span>next</span><span>: Option&lt;Box&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>&gt;&gt;,
    </span><span>phantom</span><span>: PhantomData&lt;T&gt;,
}
</span></pre>
<p>For initialization I wanted to just pass in a page of memory and write to it</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>new</span><span>&lt;T&gt;(</span><span>base</span><span>: [</span><span>u8</span><span>; 4096]) -&gt; Chunk&lt;T&gt; {
	</span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>Simple right?
Well not so fast.</p>
<p>An array of u8 has an alignment of 1, meaning it can start on any byte of memory.
But the chunk's len field has an alignment of 2, can only start on even bytes.
The next field even has an alignment of 8.
I solved that my requiring the user to pass in an uninitialized chunk that - by definition -
fits the required alignment:</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>new</span><span>&lt;T&gt;(</span><span>base</span><span>: MaybeUninit&lt;Chunk&lt;T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Chunk&lt;T&gt; {
	</span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>I caught this using miri.
The new function signature makes getting a Chunk a bit more annoying for the user.
But at least its safe now.</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Well no. Right now Chunk has an alignment of 8.
What if we want to store something with a bigger alignment?
Segfaults, thats what.</p>
<pre><span>#[</span><span>repr</span><span>(C, </span><span>align</span><span>(4096))]
</span><span>pub </span><span>struct </span><span>Chunk&lt;T&gt; { }
</span></pre>
<p>Now its force-aligned to a full page.</p>
<p>This one I actually caught on my own due to thinking about the previous alignment error.</p>
<p>But wait, there is more!
We also need to consider the case of T being bigger than the buffer,
or having an alignment even larger than a whole page.
Sadly at the moment its not very viable to check this at compile-time,
so runtime-checks will have to do.</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>new</span><span>&lt;T&gt;(</span><span>base</span><span>: MaybeUninit&lt;Chunk&lt;T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Chunk&lt;T&gt; {
        assert!(std::mem::size_of::&lt;T&gt;() </span><span>&lt;= </span><span>BUF_SIZE</span><span>);
        assert!(std::mem::align_of::&lt;T&gt;() </span><span>&lt;= </span><span>4096</span><span>);
	</span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>Now we are good. I hope.</p>
<h2 id="off-by-one">Off-By-"One"</h2>
<p>In the wonderful world of safe rust, everything is done with iterators
and actually indexing anything is a rare sight.
In fact I have come to basically never use manual indexing or offsets in my code.
A bit like a mathematician, seeing actual numbers just feels wrong.</p>
<p>In unsafe rust you will need to manually count with pointers.</p>
<h3 id="pointer-casts">Pointer Casts</h3>
<p>The first mistake I made was actually in safe code, producing a value I then wanted to use in an unsafe block:</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>new</span><span>&lt;T&gt;(</span><span>base</span><span>: MaybeUninit&lt;Chunk&lt;T&gt;&gt;) -&gt; Chunk&lt;T&gt; {
        assert!(std::mem::size_of::&lt;T&gt;() </span><span>&lt;= </span><span>BUF_SIZE</span><span>);
        assert!(std::mem::align_of::&lt;T&gt;() </span><span>&lt;= </span><span>4096</span><span>);
	</span><span>let</span><span> base_ptr </span><span>=</span><span> base.</span><span>as_mut_ptr</span><span>();
	</span><span>// skip to len field:
	</span><span>let</span><span> len_ptr </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ base.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>4096 </span><span>- </span><span>2 </span><span>- </span><span>8</span><span>) };
	</span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>base_ptr is of type *mut MaybeUninit&lt;Chunk<t>&gt;, so I was skipping a few thousand whole chunks,
landing very deep in uninitialized memory.</t></p>
<pre><span>	</span><span>// fixed:
        </span><span>let</span><span> store_ptr </span><span>=</span><span> store.</span><span>as_mut_ptr</span><span>() </span><span>as *mut </span><span>MaybeUninit&lt;</span><span>u8</span><span>&gt;;
</span></pre>
<p>This is also a bit of a lesson about the scope of unsafe: while the unsafe block itself might be short
everything that touches things that are also relied on in an unsafe context is also very relevant.
In fact The whole module should probably be considered unsafe, because private values are accessible.
For example changing the Chunks length field would lead to undefined behaviour, even though its a "safe" operation.</p>
<h3 id="lengths">Lengths</h3>
<p>Now that I had the ability to create a new Chunk,
I wanted to actually do something with it.
Like for example inserting and removing elements.</p>
<p>An insert is a memcopy, followed by a write,
a remove is a swap followed by a memcopy.</p>
<p>the swap/write are quite straightforward,
but I made some mistakes with the memcopy:</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>insert</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>index</span><span>: </span><span>usize</span><span>, </span><span>element</span><span>: T) -&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {
	</span><span>// ...

	</span><span>let </span><span>(_pre, values, _post) </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ </span><span>self</span><span>.buf.</span><span>align_to</span><span>() };
	</span><span>let</span><span> copy_source_index </span><span>= &amp;mut</span><span> values[index] </span><span>as *mut </span><span>MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;;
	</span><span>// pointers are allowed to overshoot an allocation by one,
	// so this is fine.
	</span><span>let</span><span> copy_target </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ copy_source.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>) };

    	</span><span>let</span><span> remainder </span><span>= </span><span>self</span><span>.len </span><span>-</span><span> index;
	
	</span><span>unsafe </span><span>{ std::ptr::copy(copy_source, copy_target, len) };
	</span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>This is an acceptable implementation of insert (with important sanity checks removed for brevity).
Now lets do remove! Basically the same as insert, but with source and target swapped.</p>
<pre><span>fn </span><span>remove</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;mut </span><span>self</span><span>, </span><span>index</span><span>: </span><span>usize</span><span>) -&gt; Option&lt;T&gt; {
	</span><span>// ...
	</span><span>let </span><span>(_pre, values, _post) </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ </span><span>self</span><span>.buf.</span><span>align_to</span><span>() };
	</span><span>let</span><span> copy_target </span><span>= &amp;mut</span><span> values[index] </span><span>as *mut </span><span>MaybeUninit&lt;T&gt;;
	</span><span>let</span><span> copy_source </span><span>= unsafe </span><span>{ copy_target.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>) };

	</span><span>let</span><span> remainder </span><span>= </span><span>self</span><span>.len </span><span>-</span><span> index;

	</span><span>unsafe </span><span>{ std::ptr::copy(copy_source, copy_target, remainder) };
	</span><span>// ...
</span><span>}
</span></pre>
<p>Except that's wrong.</p>
<pre><span>	</span><span>let</span><span> remainder </span><span>= </span><span>self</span><span>.len </span><span>- </span><span>(index </span><span>+ </span><span>1</span><span>);
</span></pre>
<p>is correct because the value at index has just been removed, that was the whole point!</p>
<p>Found this one with miri.</p>
<h2 id="dealing-with-unsafe">Dealing with unsafe</h2>
<p>Seeing all the mistakes I made here is some rules I use to try and avoid them:</p>
<h3 id="avoid">Avoid</h3>
<p>Do not use unsafe, if you can somehow avoid it.
If you need something chances are someone else already did it,
just use their code!
You can even help them review it to catch issues.</p>
<p>I have seen people use unsafe for performance reasons,
especially to avoid zeroing something
but it seems to almost never actually make a difference.</p>
<h3 id="read-think">Read &amp; Think</h3>
<p>Read and think about the rules around <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ptr/index.html">pointers</a> and <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/mem/union.MaybeUninit.html">uninitialized data</a> in rust.
Also there is the <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/index.html">Nomicon</a>.</p>
<h3 id="code-carefully">Code Carefully</h3>
<p>I put each unsafe operation into its own block.
Each block gets a comment on why I personally think this operation is sound.</p>
<h3 id="tests">Tests</h3>
<p>Write tests for all the unsafe code you create.
Make sure to cover edge-cases,
in my example that would be inserting/removing at the last position.</p>
<h3 id="miri">Miri</h3>
<p>Use miri! Its really useful and easy to get started with.</p>
<pre><span>$</span><span> rustup component add miri
</span><span>$</span><span> cargo miri test
</span></pre>
<p>miri can't test code it does not see,
so make sure your tests actually run the important parts.</p>
<p>Also it won't catch every problem in the code it does see, not a replacement for thinking!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Hope you learned something from this post,
maybe about unsafe,
maybe about never trusting code I write cause its got an error every 20 lines.
Or maybe you feel inspired to review the unsafe parts of your favourite library!</p>

<p>I believe Rust is a great language to make SIMD actually usable for ordinary
humans. I’ve played with libraries to making it accessible two years ago (or was
it 3?) and my impression was „Whoa! This is cool. I can’t wait until this is
usable on stable.“ The libraries back then were <a href="https://crates.io/crates/stdsimd"><code>stdsimd</code></a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/faster"><code>faster</code></a>.</p>

<p>Fast forward to today. I considered using some SIMD operations in a project in
work. I have some bitsets and wanted to do operations like bitwise AND on them.
If I represent them as bunch of unsigned integers, using SIMD on that makes
sense. But for that, I need to compile on stable, I want the code to be readable
and I don’t want to deal with writing multiple versions of the code to support
multiple levels of SIMD support.</p>

<p>The thing is, while using SIMD on stable is possible, the standard library
offers only the intrinsics. These are good enough as the low-level stuff to
build a library on top, but none of the current ones quite cut it.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/packed_simd"><code>packed_simd</code></a> takes the interface of the previous <code>stdsimd</code> and provides
types like <code>u8x16</code>. But it still requires nightly, because it depends on many
unfinished features (const generics, probably specialization) and these don’t
seem to be ready any time soon.</li>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/faster"><code>faster</code></a> seems to be dead and not updated. I think it is waiting for what
comes out of <code>packed_simd</code>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://crates.io/crates/simdeez"><code>simdeez</code></a> offers only signed ints and is unsound. The interface is a bit
awkward. I’ve eventually tried using this one and it is possible, but I
believe it’s possible to do better.</li>
</ul>

<p>So I think it’s time I roll up my sleeves and give it a shot. So here are my
plans.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-simd-and-why-its-great">What is SIMD and why it’s great</h2>

<p>CPUs are complex beasts and they try to run as fast as possible. For that, they
do a lot of magic ‒ pipelining, speculative execution, memory prefetching, etc.
So, when there’s an instruction to sum up two numbers together, a lot of effort
goes into decoding the instruction, scheduling it onto some execution units,
getting the operands, mapping between real and virtual registers, and only a
little bit into the actual summing. Some clever people decided it makes sense to
introduce instructions that take tuples of operands, do the decoding and all the
other overhead once, but do multiple (2, 4, …) summing operations in parallel,
because it requires only having wider (or more) arithmetic units. So, instead of
doing this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>c1</span> <span>=</span> <span>a1</span> <span>+</span> <span>b1</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>c2</span> <span>=</span> <span>a2</span> <span>+</span> <span>b2</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The CPU can do something like this, but taking the time of only one instruction
(that’s a bit simplifying the things, it’s never that easy with performance).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>(</span><span>c1</span><span>,</span> <span>c2</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>a1</span><span>,</span> <span>a2</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>(</span><span>b1</span><span>,</span> <span>b2</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Under optimal circumstances, this allows great speed-ups ‒ depending on how
modern the CPU is and how many „parallel“ operations it can do at once.</p>

<h2 id="why-simd-is-not-so-great">Why SIMD is not so great</h2>

<p>The problem with SIMD is, it’s hard to use, for several reasons.</p>

<ul>
  <li>There are newer processors and older processors. The older ones support only
the older vector instructions, like SSE while newer ones add more modern
instructions like AVX. The more modern support more parallelism so we really
want to use them, but we also really want to support the older CPUs, so when
using SIMD, we end up writing the algorithm multiple times and auto-detecting
at runtime which one to use. That’s annoying. If we want to aim for other
things than just x86-based CPUs, but ARMs too, we end up writing even more
variants.</li>
  <li>It’s usually available only as compiler intrinsics, which are more or less
just the low level CPU instructions wrapped into syntax of function calls. So
working with these is awkward. If we have two arrays of floats, we want to
write simple iterator-based code with <code>.zip</code> or <code>.sum</code>, not worry about
intrinsics. We want the code to be readable, not a submission to the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Obfuscated_C_Code_Contest">obfuscation contest</a>.</li>
  <li>It’s possible to use the vector instructions only when the memory is properly
aligned, the lanes are independent..</li>
</ul>

<p>Therefore, SIMD is a lot of work to use. It usually is not worth the effort and
it ends up being used only in very core parts of high-performance code, like
video decoders. Compilers try to use SIMD when possible too, but it’s not
perfect because they usually aim at the „common denominator“ instruction set
(what even the oldest CPUs support) and they often fail to prove some of the
properties (like that the size of the slice is a multiple of the number of lanes
or that it’s well aligned).</p>

<h2 id="two-approaches-to-simd-in-rust-libraries-so-far">Two approaches to SIMD in Rust libraries so far</h2>

<p>It’s a pity only very few pieces of code actually take the advantage of the full
power of the CPUs. If Rust made SIMD usage approachable by people instead of the
current dark arts of few selected, it could lead to making ordinary algorithms
and programs faster. If Rust programs were consistently 5% faster than C++
programs because it’s possible to just use SIMD without studying 4 years for it,
it could drive more adoption.</p>

<p>So there appeared two attempts to have an interface which is actually usable in
normal code.</p>

<h3 id="the-vector-types-way">The Vector Types way</h3>

<p>This is what <a href="https://crates.io/crates/packed_simd"><code>packed_simd</code></a> does. It offers bunch of types named like <code>f32x16</code>.
These are almost like <code>[f32; 16]</code> but with the proper alignment. The programmer
can express the intention of having the slices well aligned and multiples of the
lanes, or maybe have pairs (<code>f32x2</code>) when doing 2D graphics. The compiler then
doesn’t have to prove anything, the prerequisites are already guaranteed by the
type.</p>

<p>Under the hood, an operation of <code>f32x16</code> can translate to one <code>512</code>-bit wide
intrinsic, or two <code>256</code>-bit wide, or just <code>16</code> ordinary instructions, depending
on what the target architecture supports.</p>

<p>The downside is, this doesn’t really work well with runtime detection. Doing the
detection inside each <code>+</code> between vectors will be slow, we’ll likely lose more
than we gain by using the wider instructions. So this compiles into the common
denominator too. This is still quite good ‒ both because this can be overridden
when compiling and some older CPUs ignored, and because for example <code>x86-64</code>
always supports at least SSE (<code>128</code> bit wide vectors).</p>

<h3 id="the-native-vector-type">The native vector type</h3>

<p>This is what <a href="https://crates.io/crates/faster"><code>faster</code></a> and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/simdeez"><code>simdeez</code></a> do. While above we had a set of widths
of each base type (eg. <code>f32x2</code>, <code>f32x4</code>, <code>f32x8</code>, <code>f32x16</code>) and we picked the
one that made sense for our code, which was possibly wider than what the CPU
does, here we get just the one sized exactly for the CPU. So we might get either
<code>f32x4</code> or <code>f32x16</code>, depending for which instruction set we compile for
currently.</p>

<p>In this model, it’s the job of the programmer to write the code in
width-independent way. If you have a long vector of floats, it gets divided into
pairs or quadruples depending on what is being compiled for.</p>

<p>As the whole closure or function is being compiled for a certain architecture,
it allows the compiler to optimize a little bit more. Furthermore, <a href="https://crates.io/crates/simdeez"><code>simdeez</code></a>
compiles for multiple instruction sets at once (using macros) and can dispatch
the right variant ‒ it detects the CPU support and then chooses the appropriate
variant.</p>

<h2 id="my-plan">My plan</h2>

<p>I’d like to combine these two approaches. First, I’d provide marker „Instruction
set“ types, like <code>Sse4_1</code> or <code>Avx</code>. Then there would be a type alias
<code>CompileTime</code> which would be the newest instruction set detected at compile time
(eg. the common denominator).</p>

<p>Then there would be bunch of types like with <a href="https://crates.io/crates/packed_simd"><code>packed_simd</code></a>, but parametrized
by the instruction set. So <code>f32x16&lt;Avx2&gt;</code> would sum by doing one AVX2
instruction, <code>f32x16&lt;Sse&gt;</code> would do it by 4 SSE instructions and
<code>f32x16&lt;Polyfill&gt;</code> would do it by 16 „ordinary“ instructions. All of them would
still be more or less <code>[f32; 16]</code> under the hood, just with the right alignment
and they would be convertible to each other, just the operations would be done
differently. The bare-bones <code>f32x16</code> would default to be <code>f32x16&lt;CompileTime&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>The instruction set markers would have bunch of associated types and constants ‒
the „native“ <code>f32</code> type, native number of bits, etc. An instance of the marker
type would work as a detection token, see below.</p>

<h3 id="safety-of-the-operations">Safety of the operations</h3>

<p>What happens if I do this on an old CPU?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>fn</span> <span>sum</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Avx2</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Avx2</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Avx2</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This would explode in nice fireworks of <a href="https://vorner.github.io/undefined.html">undefined behaviour</a>. So this must not
be possible without use of <code>unsafe</code>. But I don’t like libraries that force the
user to use <code>unsafe</code> ‒ sure, some <code>unsafe</code> might be available for special needs,
but ordinary usage should be possible with safe only.</p>

<p>The idea is to gate the <em>creation</em> of these vectors on having detected the CPU
support. Doing detection every time one is created would be slow, but it is
possible to return a token when successfully detecting the support and require
the token as a parameter, something like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Returns Result&lt;Avx2, InstructionSetNotAvailable&gt;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>token</span> <span>=</span> <span>Avx2</span><span>::</span><span>detect</span><span>()</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>([</span><span>0.0</span><span>;</span> <span>16</span><span>],</span> <span>token</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>([</span><span>0.0</span><span>;</span> <span>16</span><span>],</span> <span>token</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="dispatch-of-the-best-variant">Dispatch of the best variant</h3>

<p>So we can detect <em>if</em> some instruction set is available and create the
corresponding vectors. But what if we want to let the compiler generate code for
all possible levels and pick the best one at runtime? The answer is generics and
a auto-generated function called into existence by a proc macro.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[simd_dispatch]</span>
<span>fn</span> <span>sum</span><span>&lt;</span><span>I</span><span>:</span> <span>InstructionSet</span><span>&gt;</span><span>(</span><span>token</span><span>:</span> <span>I</span><span>,</span> <span>a</span><span>:</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>&lt;</span><span>I</span><span>&gt;</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>:</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>&lt;</span><span>I</span><span>&gt;</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>&lt;</span><span>I</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>a</span> <span>+</span> <span>b</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>// Creates vectors of the CompileTime instruction set</span>
<span>let</span> <span>a</span> <span>=</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>([</span><span>0.0</span><span>;</span> <span>16</span><span>],</span> <span>COMPILE_TIME_TOKEN</span><span>);</span>
<span>let</span> <span>b</span> <span>=</span> <span>f32x16</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>([</span><span>0.0</span><span>;</span> <span>16</span><span>],</span> <span>COMPILE_TIME_TOKEN</span><span>);</span>
<span>// Detects the CPU instruction set, generates the appropriate token and casts</span>
<span>// the parameters appropriately.</span>
<span>sum_dispatch</span><span>(</span><span>a</span><span>,</span> <span>b</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="iterators">Iterators</h3>

<p>Sometimes we don’t have our data partitioned into vectors. Instead we have a big
slice of the primitive types. The library would provide iterator adapters that
would „cut“ the array into appropriate vectors and return these (or references
to them). There would be multiple variants, eg:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>iter_vectors_unsafe</code>: It would split the slice into the vectors, assuming it
is well aligned and divisible by the number of lanes. This one would be unsafe
to call and produce undefined …</li></ul></section></div></div>

 <p>
  As I am currently right in the middle of a far-reaching rework of Genode's
  low-level GUI stack, I'd like to share a bit of background behind this work:
  the Why, the What, and the How.
 </p>
 <h4>
 <a name="Current_state"></a>
 Current state</h4>
  <p>
   The current incarnation of Genode's low-level GUI-related interfaces is almost
   identical to the very first version that we originally created in 2006.
   Genode has a very strong asymmetric notion of the
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/20.05/architecture/Recursive_system_structure.html#Client-server_relationship">relationship</a>
   between client and server components. In this relationship, the client depends
   on the server but the server does not depend on the client.
  </p>
  <p>
   At the lowest level, the framebuffer driver and input driver(s) were
   envisioned as servers that provide the <i>Framebuffer</i> and <i>Input</i> session
   interfaces to higher-level GUI components. From our former academic view, this
   felt natural because those drivers <i>provide</i> <i>resources</i> to other components.
   Provide... serve... server! The nitpicker GUI server uses those low-level
   services to implement a higher level service that ultimately allows for the
   multiplexing of graphics and input.
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/genode-foundations/20.05/components/Common_session_interfaces.html#Nitpicker_GUI">Nitpicker</a>
   virtualizes the low-level framebuffer and input interfaces while supplementing
   the notions of visible views and input focus. Such a system looks as follows:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://genodians.org/nfeske/nitpicker_orig.png">
  </p>
  <p>
   The drivers and the nitpicker GUI server are displayed in red because they are
   servers. The GUI applications at the right are nitpicker clients. Nitpicker,
   in turn, is a client of the framebuffer and input drivers.
  </p>
  <p>
   The client interface of the nitpicker GUI server is success story. A few
   <a href="https://genode.org/documentation/release-notes/15.11#GUI_stack">evolutionary tweaks</a>
   notwithstanding, the original design scales up to the windowed working
   environment of Sculpt OS while retaining the tiny complexity of the nitpicker
   GUI server.
  </p>
  <p>
   However, the approach of modelling the framebuffer and input drivers as
   servers is a dead end, for the following reasons.
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     Drivers are sometimes extremely complex. When looking at the complexity of
     the Intel framebuffer driver (ported from the Linux kernel) for example, it
     feels foolish to trust that it won't fail. Because the nitpicker GUI server
     depends on the liveliness of the driver, however, the well-being of the
     driver is on the critical path for the entire GUI stack and all GUI
     applications.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     It is impossible to transparently restart or replace the driver at runtime
     without also restarting the GUI stack and - transitively - all GUI
     applications. This is because the nitpicker GUI server is connected as a
     client to the drivers. The connections are like a life supply for the GUI
     server. Cutting those would ultimately kill the GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Adding secondary displays is rather difficult because this would require
     nitpicker to know what framebuffer servers are out there and to request
     multiple framebuffer connections. Adding such a protocol would inflate
     the complexity of nitpicker.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
 <h4>
 <a name="Inverting_interfaces"></a>
 Inverting interfaces</h4>
  <p>
   To overcome these limitations, we must break the dependency of the GUI
   server from the drivers, like illustrated here:
  </p>
  <p>
    <img src="https://genodians.org/nfeske/nitpicker_next.png">
  </p>
  <p>
   In this scenario, the GUI server no longer <i>uses</i> the drivers, but the drivers
   use the GUI server. The relationship is reversed. Only the nitpicker GUI
   server remains red. Of course, the drivers cannot talk to nitpicker GUI
   server via nitpicker's regular client interface. Instead, two new interfaces
   enter the picture:
  </p>
  <div><dl>
   <dt>The <i>Capture</i> session interface</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     is like the inverse of the original
     <i>Framebuffer</i> session interface. It allows a client to obtain pixel data
     from the server. From the GUI server's perspective, a framebuffer driver
     is like a frame capturing device - which it is.
    </p>
   </dd>
   <dt>The <i>Event</i> session interface</dt>
   <dd>
    <p>
     is like the inverse of the original
     <i>Input</i> session interface. In contrast to a input session, which allows
     a client to obtain input events, an event session allows a client to
     induce input events. Nitpicker is an event server that consumes the input
     events from the driver(s).
    </p>
   </dd>
  </dl></div>
  <p>
   The benefits of this approach are manifold:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li>
    <p>
     The low-complexity GUI server remains as the only component that must never
     fail, which makes the GUI stack much more resilient compared to today.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Since the nitpicker GUI server no longer depends on the drivers, it can be
     started before the drivers are running, speeding up the boot time of
     graphical scenarios. In scenarios with rigid power management, we can remove
     the graphics driver - and switch off the graphics device - all while the GUI
     server and all GUI applications stay intact.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Drivers can be restarted anytime. From the perspective of the nitpicker
     GUI server, this looks like a client disconnect and connect. Drivers
     can also be replaced at runtime, e.g., swapping out the VESA and Intel
     drivers.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Connecting more than one driver to the nitpicker GUI server becomes
     conceptually simple. This clears the path towards multi-head support.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     The new capture session interface of the nitpicker GUI server would be
     the right hook for implementing screenshot/screencast applications, or a
     remote desktop server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Analogously to capture devices, input devices can enter and leave the
     system at any time without disruption, which will allow for the fine-grained
     management of USB HID devices. Think of plugging a new HID device to
     your Sculpt system. A new USB device would show up.
     The user can deploy the matching HID driver with the option of routing the
     event session of the driver to the system GUI server. Isn't that wonderful?
    </p>
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   What is the downside? <i>It is a lot of work!</i> This leads us the following
   section.
  </p>
 <h4>
 <a name="The_plan"></a>
 The plan</h4>
  <p>
   Turning the low-level session interfaces upside down is an invasive operation
   that must be carried out in several steps, each yielding an intermediate
   consistent state.
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>
     We start off with some low-risk <b>cosmetic</b> changes, namely the renaming
     of the "Nitpicker" session interface to "Gui" session. The strange
     branding of the session interface after a particular implementation is a
     relic from the early days. This
     <a href="https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues/3778">change</a> has already
     entered Genode's master branch.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Consistently use <b>32-bit RGB</b> as pixel format by all drivers and
     applications. This is a long-standing feature request that eliminates
     the need for color-space conversions and generally improves the output
     quality.
     It is quite labor-intensive because it requires me testing many
     different hardware platforms covering the drivers vesa_fb_drv, fb_sdl,
     intel_fb_drv, imx53_fb_drv, imx8_fb_drv, rpi_fb_drv, boot_fb_drv,
     omap4_fb_drv, exynos5_fb_drv.
     This <a href="https://github.com/genodelabs/genode/issues/3784">change</a> has already
     progressed well.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introducing the new <b>Capture</b> session <b>interface</b>.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Implementing the <b>capture service</b> in the nitpicker GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introduce a <b>nitpicker</b> option to choose the framebuffer <b>back end</b> between
     the use of a requested framebuffer session (as done today), the use of a
     capture client for the pixel output, or the use of another GUI server
     (for stacking multiple instance of nitpicker).
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Turn "Framebuffer" <b>drivers</b> into "Capture" clients, covering all the
     drivers mentioned above. Shoveling code. Adjusting all existing
     scenarios to use nitpicker's capture service.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Pruning</b> the remaining use of the <b>framebuffer client</b> interface.
     In fact, when done, I want to remove the <tt>Framebuffer::Connection</tt>
     completely. This will require the reworking of the terminal, MESA back end,
     several tests, and the liquid_framebuffer. In the process, I hope to largely
     eliminate the use cases of the nit_fb (now called gui_fb) component so
     that this component can be removed in the end.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Turning</b> a few other <b>framebuffer clients</b> into "Capture" servers, in
     particular test-framebuffer, fb_bench, and test-driver_manager.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     <b>Removal</b> of the "Framebuffer" <b>session interface</b>, retaining the interface
     merely as a part of the GUI session.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Introducing the new <b>Event</b> session <b>interface</b> and adding its implementation
     to the nitpicker GUI server.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Adding a new <b>event_filter component</b> taking the place of the input_filter.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     With the structural changes done, it would be time for optimizations.
     As a prerequisite for tear-free animations, the <b>frame buffering</b> will be
     moved from the clients into the nitpicker GUI server. At first, this will be
     transparent to most clients. The subsequent removal of client-side buffering
     is second independent step. As another optimization, I plan to go though all
     places that employed the dithering of pixels.
    </p>
   </li>
  </ol>
  <p>
   Of those topics, the rework of the framebuffer drivers is certainly the most
   elaborate one. I'm considering to drop the Exynos5 and OMAP4 drivers.
   Even though I strive for replacing the input session interface by the new
   event session interface, the scope of the task of reworking the input drivers
   is not yet completely tangible to me.

<p>The last couple of days I picked up on my ELK Stack a couple thousands of SSH Brute Force Attacks, so I decided I will just revisit my SSH Server configuration, and change my SSH Port to something else for the interim. The dashboard that showed me the results at that point in time:</p>
<p><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/rbekker/image/upload/v1539292443/kibana-failed-ssh-auth_udkxkl.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Then I decided I actually would like to setup a SSH Honeypot to listen on Port 22 and change my SSH Server to listen on 222 and capture their IP Addresses, Usernames and Passwords that they are trying to use and dump it all in a file so that I can build up my own password dictionary :D</p>
<h2 id="sshconfiguration">SSH Configuration:</h2>
<p>Changing the SSH Port:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
</code></pre>
<p>Change the port to 222:</p>
<pre><code>Port 222
</code></pre>
<p>Restart the SSH Server:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart
</code></pre>
<p>Verify that the SSH Server is running on the new port:</p>
<pre><code>$ sudo netstat -tulpn | grep sshd
tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:222            0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      28838/sshd
</code></pre>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/random-robbie/docker-ssh-honey">random-robbie</a>, as he had everything I was looking for on Github.</p>
<p>Setup the SSH Honeypot:</p>
<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/random-robbie/docker-ssh-honey
$ cd docker-ssh-honey/
$ docker build . -t local:ssh-honepot
$ docker run -itd --name ssh-honeypot -p 22:22 local:ssh-honepot
</code></pre>
<p>Once people attempt to ssh, you will get the output to stdout:</p>
<pre><code>$ docker logs -f $(docker ps -f name=ssh-honeypot -q) | grep -v 'Error exchanging' | head -10

<h2 id="savingresultstodisk">Saving results to disk:</h2>
<p>Redirecting the output to a log file, running in the foreground as a screen session:</p>
<pre><code>$ screen -S honeypot
$ docker logs -f f6cb | grep -v 'Error exchanging' | awk '{print $6, $7, $8}' &gt;&gt; /var/log/ssh-honeypot.log
</code></pre>
<p>Detach from your screen session:</p>
<pre><code>Ctrl + a; d
</code></pre>
<p>Checking out the logs</p>
<pre><code>$ head -3 /var/log/ssh-honeypot.log

4x.7.2x.1x root HowAreYou
4x.7.2x.1x root Sqladmin
</code></pre>
<p>Leaving this running for a couple of months, and I have a massive password database:</p>
<pre><code>$ wc -l /var/log/honeypot/ssh.log
54184260 /var/log/honeypot/ssh.log
</code></pre>
<p>That is correct, 54 million password attempts. 5372 Unique IPs, 4082 Unique Usernames, 88829 Unique Passwords.</p>

<p><em>Your success is inversely related to the number of excuses you’ve made in your life.</em></p>



<figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/8238/8597076899_95d792f7e6_z.jpg?resize=525%2C525&amp;ssl=1" alt="No Excuses" width="525" height="525" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/live.staticflickr.com/8238/8597076899_95d792f7e6_z.jpg?resize=525%2C525&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"><figcaption>Ahhhh, the wisdom of The Simpsons.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s face it, we all make excuses. Excuses are a part of life. But do they really help? </p>



<p>Of course not. </p>



<p>There is a fundamental imbalance in the economy of excuses: everyone likes to make excuses. Nobody likes to listen to them. You can fashion excuses into “reasons.” You can try to justify them to everyone and anyone all day long. The first excuse might gain you a little leeway, but each subsequent excuse will quickly dismantle your reputation. People begin to tune you out after a while.</p>



<p>At the end of the day, your reliance on excuses will hold you back more than the “excuses” themselves.</p>



<p>The difference between taking your life to the next level and wallowing in mediocrity is simply the ability to identify and kill your excuses when they arise.</p>



<p>If you disagree, flip it around and ask yourself:</p>



<ul><li>How much patience do you have for people who overpromise and underdeliver?</li><li>How much money have you given to businesses that continually fall short of expectations? How much sympathy do you have for their excuses?</li><li>How successful is the kid in school who always claims his dog ate his homework?</li><li>If you’ve ever run a business, how many opportunities would you give an employee who gave you an earful of excuses every single time they were late?</li></ul>



<p>Need I say more?</p>



<h4>There’s Always Two Sides to the Coin</h4>



<p>I used to be a huge manufacturer of excuses. In school, especially in my underachieving college days, I would come up with every excuse in the book as to why I didn’t get an assignment in on time. “I wasn’t feeling well,” “I didn’t get that email,” “I had two other tests to study for,” etc. I felt that my excuses were always enough to let me off the hook. But they were really just keeping me from achieving my full potential.</p>



<p>When I began managing restaurants, I soon came to understand how my professors must have felt years earlier. One restaurant I managed was near a college campus. 75% of the employees were college students. <em>You can imagine the list of excuses I received</em>. The funny thing is, when a student/employee gives an excuse, they think they are the only one with that particular excuse. But when you become the recipient of excuses, you begin to develop a sixth sense for which excuses are legit and which ones are not. Needless to say, the best opportunities and the best shifts went to those who made the least excuses.</p>



<p>Excuses given to others are enough to close off a world of opportunities to you. But the most harmful excuses are the ones you tell yourself. This is because the recipient—YOU—will almost always accept them. “I’m too tired to exercise,” “I don’t have time to mow the lawn,” “I’m too broke for a gym membership,” “Okay, just this one time,” “I can’t because…” Excuses become habits. Habits become destiny.</p>



<p>My point is simple. If you want to enjoy more success, if you want to get that raise or promotion at work, if you want to take on more responsibility, if you want more authority, hold yourself to a higher standard and kill your excuses.</p>



<h4>Here are seven strategies I’ve used to kill my excuses:</h4>



<ul type="1"><li><strong>Take ownership</strong>. Face it, your excuses are used to get out of taking responsibility for something. Most employees make excuses and they wonder why they were passed up for promotion. Set yourself apart from the crowd. Take ownership of your shortcomings and own the solutions. Every position of leadership I’ve attained resulted from a consistent ownership habit. No excuses–doing what it takes to get the job done. It sounds easy. It’s even easier in practice. Act like the owner, think like the owner, and soon you will be an owner.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Create solutions</strong>. Instead of waiting for others to solve a problem, instead of waiting for a problem to magically solve itself, instead of hoping for sympathy from someone depending on you, find the solution. Don’t have an hour to devote to writing? Wake up earlier or stay up later. Don’t have the energy to work out? Start by putting on your running shoes. Running late? Prioritize and get back on schedule. There is always a solution for every problem.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Commit to a process</strong>. If the excuses are a recurring event, like why you aren’t hitting the gym, or why you can’t seem to get into a meditation habit, develop a system. For me, I write down the three MITs I want to accomplish the night before, so when I wake up I can hit the ground running. To develop consistency, I’ve used the Jerry Seinfeld Strategy of marking each day on a calendar with an X for when I performed a particular habit. Jerry’s habit was writing jokes. The idea is simply to not break the chain of X’s.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Cultivate a mindset of positivity</strong>. Our excuses usually originate from negativity, or things we don’t want to do. Begin to look at that “chore” in a positive light, or else you’ll always have an excuse for not doing it. For example, instead of putting off mowing the lawn because you’re tired, look at it as a way to get outside, get some fresh air, and get a little workout in.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Think about WHY</strong>. When you identify your reasons behind doing something, you suddenly eliminate the need for excuses. You’ll be more likely to follow through on what you need to do when you understand the true meaning behind it.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Do more of what you genuinely enjoy</strong>. I had no excuses regarding taking a road trip. I don’t have to make excuses regarding my daily writing habit. I don’t make excuses regarding kettlebell exercises and pull-ups. The more you can steer your life towards more of what you enjoy and less of what you don’t, the more likely you will find success on that path.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Read about someone you admire and how they handle failure</strong>. What was their philosophy on excuses? For me, in the last several years it had been (and still is) Kobe Bryant and his work ethic. Some people will make you want to run through a brick wall. He was one of them.  And if that’s not enough, when you think something is impossible for you to do, look up <a href="https://www.kyle-maynard.com/">Kyle Maynard</a>.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Bonus: Make excuses. Then do it anyway</strong>.</li></ul>



<p>Hold yourself to a higher standard. Kill your excuses.</p>

 		<p>“Use managed services.”</p>
<p>If there was one piece of advice I wish I could shout from the mountains to all cloud engineers, this would be it.</p>
<p>Operations, especially operations at scale, are a hard problem. Edge cases become commonplace. Failure is rampant. Automation and standardization are crucial. People with experience running software and hardware at this scale tend to be rare and expensive. The mistakes they’ve made and situations they’ve learned from aren’t easy to pick up.</p>
<p>When you use a managed service from one of the major cloud vendors, you’re getting access to all the wisdom of their teams and the power of their automation and systems, for the low price of their software.</p>
<p>A managed service is a service like AWS relational database service, Google Cloud SQL or Azure SQL Database. With all three of these services, you’re getting best of breed configuration and management for a relational database system. There’s configuration needed on your part, but hard or tedious tasks like setting up replication or backups can be done quickly and easily (take this from someone who fed and cared for a mysql replication system for years). Depending on your cloud vendor and needs, you can get managed services for key components of modern software systems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>File storage</li>
<li>Object caches</li>
<li>Message queues</li>
<li>Stream processing software</li>
<li>ETL tools</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note that these are all components of your application, and will still require developer time to thread together.)</p>
<p>You should use managed services for three reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s going to be operated well. The expertise that the cloud providers can provide and the automation they can afford to implement will likely surpass what you can do, especially across multiple services.</li>
<li>It’s going to be cheaper. Especially when you consider employee costs. The most expensive AWS RDS instance is approximately $100k/year (full price). It’s not an apples to apples comparison, but in many countries you can’t get a database architect for that salary.</li>
<li>It’s going to be faster for development. Developers can focus on connecting these pieces of infrastructure rather than learning how to set them up and run them.</li>
</ul>
<p>A managed service doesn’t work for everyone. If you need to be able to tweak every setting, a managed service won’t let you. You may have stringent performance or security requirements that a managed service can’t meet. You may also start out with a managed service and grow out of it. (Congrats!)</p>
<p>Another important consideration is lock-in. Some managed services are compatible with alternatives (kubernetes services are a good example). If that is the case, you can move clouds. Others are proprietary and will require substantial reworking of your application if you need to migrate.</p>
<p>If you are working in the cloud and you need a building block for your application like a relational database or a message queue, start with a managed service (and self host if it doesn’t meet your needs). Leverage the operational excellence of the cloud vendors, and you’ll be able to build more, faster.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>You’ve likely experienced it: “You’re above and beyond everything we’re asking. There’s no promotion this round but all you need to do is <strong>__</strong>_”. Insert a semi-important but not absolutely necessary thing. Even worse if it’s something you’re really not good at.</p>

<p>One of the most demotivating things that an organization or manager can do is requiring “perfection” for a promotion. It’s a problem with two main dimensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s incommensurate with the value being added to the business.</li>
  <li>Perfection is subjective.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="incommensurate-with-value-add">Incommensurate with Value-Add</h2>

<p>Ultimately all performance comes down to one thing: how much value are you adding to the business? Examples of where forcing perfection gets things out of whack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I coded up a feature that brought in $10M to the business this year. I wasn’t promoted because they said I don’t speak enough in meetings.</li>
  <li>I saved the company from collapse because I was the only one who knew how to debug the system when it was melting. I wasn’t promoted because they said I show up too late every day.</li>
  <li>I identified a winning strategy for the entire business that drove us to another echelon of success. I wasn’t promoted because my design docs have typos.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that matters is the value being added to the business. There are nuances where behavior can set bad examples or cause issues for others, but that detracts from value added to the business and should be considered. The unfortunate and unbelievably common case is that some sort of benign missing strength is held against people.</p>

<h2 id="perfection-is-subjective">Perfection is Subjective</h2>

<p>When managers go down the rabbit whole of chasing perfect promotions they’re much more likely to be biased. In reality, most people’s internal picture of a perfect candidate for a promotion is something like “what did I look like when I got promoted?” That’s often the closest image a manager has of what a promotion at that level looks like.</p>

<p>In mild cases you get things like “when I got promoted I had to walk in the snow to work, uphill both ways.”</p>

<p>In more severe cases you get things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Men who don’t promote women because they’re not “aggressive enough” or they “don’t speak up enough”</li>
  <li>Extroverts who don’t promote introverts because they don’t like public speaking.</li>
  <li>Non-parents who don’t promote parents because they don’t work until midnight in the office.</li>
</ul>

<p>Promote people based on impact to the business, not their style of delivery.  Don’t hold people down because they deliver value in a way that isn’t comfortable, known, or practiced by you.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In promotions and growth, focus more on amplifying strengths than fixing “weaknesses”.  You’ll find it’s much easier and much more fruitful to have people play to their strengths.</p>

<p>Promote imperfect people - that’s all you’ve got.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>                                
                                    <div> 
                                        <p>As someone who grew up throughout the 90's and 00's, some of my fondest memories stem from progressive advancements in internet and computing technologies.  Upgrading from Dial-Up internet to DSL was a grand event in our house.  I remember my brother and I fighting over the computer day in and day out to play games like Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory, which was released in 2003. (I'm convinced that this will be the all-time best FPS game ever created.)  At around the same time, we upgraded to one of the best Dell computer's available at the time. It had 512MB of RAM and a Pentium 4 processor.  This was a major upgrade from our Compaq Celeron, which had something like 64MB of RAM. <br>
<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/MV5BOGFmNjMzZTktNDg2ZS00ZjllLTlkMTAtZTAzMzBkN2UyMzk2XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjU3MzI1NzI@._V1_.jpg" alt="Wolfenstein - Enemy Territory"></p>

<p>Eventually, the grandeur of DSL faded as the rest of the world began to adopt Cable and Fiber internet.  It wasn't until I briefly moved to Philadelphia that I was finally able to experienced what I had been missing out on.  In college I lived in a neighborhood that was one of Verizon's first Fios builds.  I was absolutely blown away by the 25 Mbps connection.  This was in 2009. I'm amazed that over a decade later, in 2020, some households still don't have access to cable or fiber internet yet.</p>

<p>Like many of our customers do now, I could never figure out why it was so difficult to get us fiber service.  The cable is cheap, just throw it up on a pole and give me internet! Right?  Well, not so fast... <br>
<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/1849761.jpg" alt="Fiber Spaghetti"></p>

<p>A quick overview of how utility services are run and the challenges involved...</p>

<p>As most people know, there are primarily two ways to deliver utility services to a home or business.  Aerial and underground.  Water, gas, and sewer are always serviced underground for obvious reasons.  Electric, telephone, cable, and fiber have the ability to either be above or below ground.</p>

<h3 id="aerial">Aerial.</h3>

<p>As with anything else, aerial has pro's and con's.</p>

<p>The pro's are primarily upfront costs (this is debatable) and speed of deployment (this is also debatable).</p>

<p>The con's are that contrary to it being cheaper to physically deploy, the pole owners generally charge up-front make ready fee's.  These fees can range from $0 to upwards of $50,000/mile.  It's essentially pay to play.  If we want to attach to 50 poles, the pole owner might determine that 10 of those poles are old and need to be replaced before we can attach to them.  Rather than fork up the cash themselves, they'll force us to pay to replace their poles in order to approve the attachment.</p>

<p>In addition to that, there are the annual pole fee's.  Depending on your agreement, we've seen pole fee's ranging anywhere from $7/pole per year all the way up to $43/pole per year with 10% annual increases (I'm looking at you PPL.  This ridiculous rate was purely intended to keep us from attaching to their poles, IMO.  It's impossible to make money with these rates). <br>
<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-10-22.04.34.png" alt="Pole Rates"></p>

<p>Another con is that even though installing the cable on poles is faster, it usually takes the pole owner around 6 months just to review applications and to determine make ready requirements and costs.  As an example, if we have fiber on a pole that's 1 pole short from being able to service your house, it would take at least 6 months just to run fiber to that one additional pole. So close, yet so far.</p>

<h3 id="underground">Underground.</h3>

<p>Like aerial, underground has its own list of pro's and con's.</p>

<p>When you install a service underground, you own it for life.  There are no annual fee's.  You pay one time to install it and you're set for life.  This sounds like a pro, but it's also a con.  When we run metro conduit, it generally costs us between $15-25/ft (not including customer drops).  For the sake of argument, let's assume we're at the high-end of our costs.  If we install 1,000ft of conduit, that's $25,000 that we need to pay out of pocket upfront.  Some blocks have upwards of 30 customers, but others have as little as 5.  Let's average it out at 20 customers per block, that's $1,250 upfront per customer, assuming we get every single customer.  Conservatively, we're initially looking at a 50% take rate.  This could grow to 100% overtime, but we never make that assumption. So that's $2,500/customer.  Imagine spending $2,500 per house/building and then have them tell you that your $69/m service is too expensive.  Generally speaking, we won't do a street unless our numbers look better than this, but this is a realistic scenario as we scale and get access to cheaper capital, etc.</p>

<img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/enorthampton02.jpg" alt="Underground Construction Restoration"></p>

<h3 id="politics">Politics</h3>

<p>Cost issues aside, there are a number of other hurdles one needs to get past just to begin the process of building out a network.  You'd think that risking everything you have in an effort to bring your local economy into the 21st Century would be a welcome sight.  That's what I thought too; was I wrong.  While there are plenty of supporters (I truly appreciate you all), there are just as many, if not more, critics.</p>

<p>We've been fortunate enough to have had a handful of people get behind us overtime and give us a shot.  I'm sure others haven't had it so easy.  I know this because even after we've become an established player in our city throughout the past 4 years, neighboring townships and municipalities haven't been as opened armed to welcome us into their communities as I had anticipated or would have liked.</p>

<p>I'll go into more detail on small government policies that really hamper our ability to deploy underground later below.</p>

<h3 id="toomanyopinions">Too Many Opinions</h3>

<p>I'm generally a big fan of individual citizens trying to make an impact in their communities.  However, in too many cases these contributions seem to be made in the form of unproductive complaints rather than productive feedback or action.  Far too many people have a say in things that they probably shouldn't.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case A.</em></strong></p>

<p>A new customer had recently signed an agreement with us to run fiber into their building.  This is a non-profit who's members are selflessly donating their time to restore a landmark in the community.  Upon receiving their signature, I notified the city that we would be pulling a permit to connect the building in question to our underground network.  They said okay; that was that.  Our nearest existing hand hole is approximately 90ft to the right of the new customer's property; in front of another property.  As a courtesy, I notified the manager of that establishment to let her know that we would be performing work over the weekend, from Friday into Saturday.  They're closed Saturday and Sunday so I had assumed they would appreciate the notice and possibly even sign up with us.  The project would involve removing 90ft of sidewalk, running conduit, and then restoring the sidewalk with brand spankin' new concrete.  The total timespan that this would occur, from when our shovel hit the ground to having new sidewalks in place, would be 48 hrs.  The response that I received from a member of their organization made me facepalm.</p>

<p><img src="http://chrishacken.com/content/images/2020/03/Screenshot-2020-03-10-18.53.55-copy.png" alt="Sidewalk Issues"></p>

<p>Not long after receiving this email, I became aware that they didn't even own the building in question, nevermind the sidewalk.  They lease it.  This was eventually "resolved" after a series of negotiations between the non-profit's president and the establishment in question.  Often times we aren't as lucky.</p>

<p>We initially planned to have this new customer installed within a week of them signing the contract.  Now it will end up being around 2 months from start to finish.  Long story short, I learned my lesson in trying to be courteous.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case B.</em></strong></p>

<p>Last year we were installing conduit for our fiber optic network.  There were countless instances where people would literally stop their cars, roll down their windows, and yell profanities at us.  In what world is that acceptable behavior for an adult? I can't imagine being so far off my rocker that I would feel the need to yell at a bunch of construction workers trying to build a fiber optic network (not that they had any idea what we were doing).  If these are the types of people influencing decisions, there's something wrong.</p>

<p>City workers have a tough job fielding complaints from people like this and I commend them for it.  It shouldn't affect policy though.</p>

<p><strong><em>Case C.</em></strong></p>

<p>In another incident that took place not long, maybe a day or two, after <em>Case B</em> above.  A local store owner came back to us as we're swinging pick axes in 95 degree heat telling us we need to hurry up and we should hire more workers.  "My customers keep calling saying there's no where to park."  Mind you, we're standing right next to a massive parking lot that is approximately 1/3rd full.  I made my best attempt to kindly explain that paying 3 guys to stand around a hole to watch one person hand-dig to expose a utility isn't going to make our work go any faster.  I don't think he liked my response.</p>

<h3 id="theconsequences">The Consequences</h3>

<p>In many cases, resident complaints are justified.  Utility providers need to be held accountable for shitty restoration work.  However, the way in which bad restoration work is being combated is counter productive.  There has been a huge increase in curb-to-curb restoration requirements by local governments.  Essentially what these rules state is that anytime a utility cuts asphalt beyond a predetermined length, say 100ft, they are then responsible for replacing the entire road surface from the curb on the left side of the street to the curb on the right side of the street.  I believe some municipalities are also trying to introduce these measures to offload the costs of repaving roads themselves, similar to how pole owners force you to replace their aging utility poles under their make-ready requirements.  (One municipality told me as much when I attended a local council meeting in an effort to get them to waive this ridiculous ordinance for us.)</p>

<p>These policies will ultimately do more harm than good.  For us, these are the one and only thing preventing us from providing superior fiber internet services in these areas.  Forcing curb-to-curb asphalt …</p></div></div></div>

<p>CTMU is a metaphysical theory of the universe by Christopher Langan, a man with the highest recorded IQ in the world. The crux of CTMU is that the universe is both procedure and object, code and data, function and parameter, effectively a self-modifying process that targets itself. The SCSPL<a href="http://ctmucommunity.org/wiki/Self-Configuring_Self-Processing_Language">[0]</a> is what CTMU terms as the BIOS or Operating System of our universe – it stands for Self-Configuring Self-Processing Language.</p>



<p>My main hypothesis is that the SCSPL is precisely the general solution to the Busy Beaver problem. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">[1]</a></p>



<p>Assuming our universe is infinite, its `cosmic egg`, the program that represents our universe, is the solution to $\displaystyle{\lim_{n \to \infty} BB(n)}$</p>



<p>BB visits as many possible states as possible before halting. In simple terms it asks: Find the longest running program that doesn’t get stuck in an infinite loop. Classically, BB is a challenge for Turing machines. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">[2]</a> Turing machines are notoriously hard to program because they do not distinguish between code and data.</p>



<p>We can and should extend BB to Von Neumann machines <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Neumann_machine">[3]</a>, like the one that you are reading this post on right now. Von Neumann machines differ from Turing machines because they make a distinction between code and data by reserving memory for each. Upon execution of a program on a VN, it is simply copied from the hard drive to reserved, read-only memory. The instruction pointer of the CPU, known as EIP, points to memory location of the code to execute and simply increments every time the CPU runs a line of code. Loops and conditional statements are accomplished by adding or subtracting from EIP. This is known as jumping. The important takeaway here is that the code is static and unchanging and in turn, it resides in reserved memory that must remain static and unchanging.</p>



<p>In a VN, a memory module of n bits, has 2^n possible states. Assuming one of these is a halting state, we could in theory write a program that would run through all or almost all of these states. However, we would almost certainly need to scrap the paradigm of storing programs in unchanging, read-only memory. For example, if our machine has 100 bits of memory, and our program takes up 90 bits, we could only hope to write a program that iterates through all possible states of the 10 non-reserved bits, a measly 1024 states. This is a far cry from the enormous size of the memory space of all 100 bits ~ 12676506002 28229401496703205376.</p>



<p>Self modifying programs dwarf static programs in runtime. This is because the entire memory is used for the state space – not just a small data section. Unfortunately, other than in the niche underground culture of blackhats writing viruses and worms, the principles of polymorphic code are poorly understood. We barely understand how to write self-modifying programs and neither Mathematics nor Computer Science have researchers or categories of study dedicated to elucidating it.</p>



<p>The lack of knowledge on self-modifying programs is sad in so many ways but one practical application really hurts all of humanity: compression. Self-modifying programs are actually the most concise family of programs. <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">[4]</a> This is so much so, that a self-modifying program is what generates our entire universe.</p>



<p>If you care about having a real, tangible model of physics that rivals string theory and the standard model, then solving BB is imperative and urgent! Our place in the universe, in space and time, is many many steps into BB(∞). In order to peer back into the ontological basis of reality, our only solution is BB. Too many non-linear changes have occurred since the initial Big Bang, or BB, coincidence? I think not 😉</p>



<p>If there is a multiverse, BB would run through it. It truly is the holy grail representing the universe of ALL possibilities. I could go on, and talk about computational elements of self-modifying programs that reinforce themselves and create stable motifs, ala gliders in cellular automata, but I think this is enough for you to understand: BB is the code for our universe.</p>



<p>Let’s solve BB generally, for VN machines, and supplant string theory, particle physics, and bring the ontological computational truth back to reality on Earth. It is our duty.</p>

<p><strong>It has been a long journey!</strong> I was silent for a while, haven’t posted regularly on my blog. But don’t worry, I’m fine. Instead, I took this situation around coronavirus and focused on writing a book “<em>Performance Analysis and Tuning on Modern CPU</em>”. I started writing this book almost a year ago, so I’m happy I finally can show something to the people. Right now, the <strong>early draft is ready and I’m welcoming everybody to review the book and maybe even add something to it</strong>. I know a lot of people are struggling right now, so I decided to make the book <strong>FREE</strong> for all. Eventually, everyone will be able to download PDF version of it.</p>

<p><strong>Why I started it?</strong> I started this book with one simple goal in mind: educate developers to better understand performance of their applications running on modern HW. Most of developers are used to look no further than the source code of their application without trying to understand performance implications of the changes they make. I know for many of us what happens under the hood is sort of black matter. I know it’s hard, but hopefully with this book, performance world of modern HW will become more accessible.</p>

<p><strong>What is the book about?</strong> Have you ever debated with a coworker about performance of a certain piece of code? Then you probably know how hard it is to predict which version is going to work best. With so many moving parts inside the modern processors even a small tweak to the code can trigger significant performance change. Besides all its complexity, HW has many features that support performance analysis. That’s right, CPUs are capable of telling us what performance bottlenecks are and where they occur. Thus, the book focuses on how your code looks like from the CPU perspective and provides recipes for HW specific optimizations. The core of the book is centered around how to find the right place in the code to improve performance.</p>

<p>Below I present the sweetest parts of the book contents:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>1. Introduction
2. Measuring Performance
3. CPU Microarchitecture 101
4. Terminology And Metrics In Performance Analysis
5. Performance Analysis Approaches
  5.1. Code Instrumentation
  5.2. Tracing
  5.3. Workload Characterization
  5.4. Sampling
  5.5. Static Performance Analysis
  5.6. Compiler Optimization Reports
6. CPU Features For Performance Analysis
  6.1. Top-Down Microarchitecture Analysis (TMAM)
  6.2. Last Branch Record (LBR)
  6.3. Processor Event-Based Sampling (PEBS)
  6.4. Intel Processor Traces (PT)
7. Source Code Tuning For CPU
  7.1. Data-Driven Optimizations
  7.2. CPU Front-End Optimizations
  7.3. CPU Back-End Optimizations
  7.4. Optimizing Bad Speculation
  7.5. Other Tuning Areas
8. Optimizing Multithreaded Applications
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>Who is this book for?</strong> Primarily, this book is written for developers working in performance critical projects. This includes the following areas: High performance computing (HPC), High Frequency Trading (HFT), GameDev, Data Centers (Facebook, Google, etc), and other areas. But I hope it will be useful for any C++ developer: you can use this book to learn performance analysis which will stack up nicely with other skills you might have. All examples in the book are written in C/C++, but to the large extent they are applicable to any native programming language (like C, C++, Rust, Go and even Fortran). While this book is fairly low-level, I hope, it will be accessible even to developers that are just starting performance related work.</p>

<p>I gave this book all my knowledge and experience and I’m eager to share it with community. I decided to make this book open to everyone and <strong>I welcome everyone to review and contribute to the book</strong>. I hope, this way we can combine best performance practices and expertise from people in different areas.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>【想看中文的读者<a href="https://interconnected.blog/china-scale-technology-sandbox/#chinese-version-below">请点击这里</a>或滚动到本页下方】</p><p>China’s Internet economy is often viewed by many people through the lens of U.S.-China relations or China’s domestic structure. Some times those lenses are useful, other times not so much.</p><p>One aspect, where applying a geopolitical lens is <em>not </em>useful, is how the Chinese Internet’s sheer size has become a technology sandbox for creating and battle-testing new solutions to solve new challenges at scale, which few other economies can replicate. This often-overlooked characteristic has already allowed many useful technologies to mature.</p><h2 id="buy-buy-buy">Buy, Buy, Buy</h2><p>The most straightforward way to grasp the scale of China’s online economy is through e-commerce, serving its <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/265140/number-of-internet-users-in-china/">roughly 900 million Internet users</a>. Even though other sectors are also growing -- e.g. shared economy, IoT, autonomous driving, facial recognition, SaaS, etc. -- e-commerce has been around the longest with the cleanest numbers to compare and interpret.</p><p>China’s e-commerce landscape is primarily driven by two major shopping holidays: Singles’ Day and 618. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singles%27_Day">Singles’ Day</a> is the more high-profile one, a “manufactured” shopping day created by Alibaba that happens on November 11 every year. 618 is less well-known outside of China, though still impressive in terms of scale. It’s “manufactured” by JD.com.com that begins on June 1 and ends on June 18 (thus “618”), which happens to be the company’s founding anniversary. The comparable “manufactured” shopping holidays in the U.S. would be Amazon’s Prime Day and the set of shopping days around the Thanksgiving holiday (Black Friday and Cyber Monday).</p><p>Here’s a chart comparing the GMV (Gross Merchandise Value) in USD among these four e-commerce shopping events in the last three years:</p><figure><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/TdojTyICC3sAQb2w7Ojrm04N_qNDNba_tSq9KOSGJrhFzwadr77S8mlc4iLiORauHfJJ7sqY_FrzKEn-NmOfHGerieko1fYEnZ4UjxxZA1ZcqXDcPMEJYRAd5vq4BUPhXZORT95E" alt=""></figure><p>A few things to keep in mind as you look at these numbers: the GMV volumes for 618 and Singles Day reflected in this chart are by the original creator of that holiday, i.e. JD.com for 618 and Alibaba for Singles’ Day. Thus, it’s not a full picture of the entire GMV volume that was generated on those days. I did this because these shopping holidays, which used to be driven just by the company that created it, are now national events where almost every company participates, thus tracking the total volume gets a bit messy. For example, <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/06/19/alibaba-and-jdcom-score-record-sales-on-618-shoppi.aspx">during the most recent 2020 618</a>, the first shopping holiday since the coronavirus outbreak, JD.com pulled in $38 billion USD and Alibaba pulled in $98 billion USD for a total of $136 billion USD just between those two platforms. That total certainly does not include new e-commerce upstarts, like Pinduoduo and Little Red Book. As for “U.S. Thanksgiving”, it’s the combined online shopping volume of three days: Thanksgiving Day, Black Friday, and Cyber Monday, across all retailers big and small.</p><p>Whether you agree with my approach or not, I think the overarching point is clear: China’s e-commerce size is multiple times bigger than America’s. <strong>But what’s the implication from an engineering and technology sandboxing perspective?</strong></p><h2 id="build-build-build">Build, Build, Build</h2><p>While all that Wall Street analysts and venture capitalists may see are massive revenue and business growth, for engineers and operators, what they see are technical and logistical challenges. GMV is just a measurement of transaction volume and may not translate directly to profit. But regardless of profitability, a technology stack needs to withstand that workload, with each transaction leading to processing and updates in payment gateways, bank records, user profiles, warehouse inventories, delivery dispatches, and many other places in the system.</p><p>To illustrate these scaling challenges more concretely, during the 2019 Singles’ Day, the peak transaction volume on Alibaba’s various shopping platforms was <a href="https://tech.sina.com.cn/i/2019-11-11/doc-iihnzahi0215062.shtml">544,000 transactions per second</a> and the total amount of data processed on Alibaba Cloud was <a href="https://www.infoq.cn/article/r8GENiPVdMQwdaScrb86">around 970 petabyte</a>. No matter how you slice and dice them, these are huge numbers on a huge scale.</p><p><strong>This predicament is a blessing and a curse. </strong>The curse is, of course, the many all-nighters that the engineers, product managers, designers, operators, i.e. all the builders, have to endure to create, build, and test different solutions to meet these challenges. On-calls, 2 am pager alerts, even interrupted weddings, are the human cost that goes into making these solutions work.</p><p>The blessing is that <strong>many newer, better-designed technologies are being battle-tested earlier in their development, pushing them to mature more quickly, which is good for technological advancement in general.</strong> You can write all the test suites and simulations you want, but nothing beats large-scale production workloads to give a piece of technology a real test and fair shake. <strong>And China has plenty of those workloads to go around. </strong></p><p>Thus, large Chinese tech companies are early adopters of many young technologies that their American counterparts might shun. <strong>This risk profile is born out of necessity, not luxury. </strong>They live in a cutthroat, competitive business environment. They have to not only meet current demands, but also architect their tech stack to adapt to new commercial models as they pop up and become popular. <strong>One recent example would be livestream shopping.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/2020/06/livestream-selling.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/livestream-selling.jpeg 600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/livestream-selling.jpeg 1000w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/livestream-selling.jpeg 1600w, https://interconnected.blog/content/images/size/w2048/2020/06/livestream-selling.jpeg 2048w"><figcaption>What livestream shopping looks like in China.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="some-beneficiaries">Some Beneficiaries</h2><p>Here’s a list of new technologies that became<strong> publicly available in the last five years</strong> -- some home-grown in China, some created elsewhere -- that have benefited from the China-scale technology sandbox.</p><p><a href="https://kylin.apache.org/"><strong>Apache Kylin</strong></a><strong>:</strong> an open-source online analytical engine first created by eBay’s engineering team in China. It has been battle-tested in companies like Baidu, JD.com, and Xiaomi. It is commercially supported and augmented by the startup, Kyligence.</p><p><a href="https://pulsar.apache.org/"><strong>Apache Pulsar</strong></a><strong>:</strong> an open-source distributed data streaming system first created and deployed inside Yahoo. It has benefited greatly from wide usage inside Tencent, <a href="https://streamnative.io/blog/tech/2019-10-22-powering-tencent-billing-platform-with-apache-pulsar/">specifically its billing platform that</a> integrates with many payment gateways, not just WeChat Pay. The project is commercially supported by the startup, StreamNative.</p><p><a href="https://skywalking.apache.org/"><strong>Apache Skywalking</strong></a><strong>:</strong> an open-source application performance monitor tool, designed to observe microservices. It has been used in Huawei, Xiaomi, Tencent, among others. The startup <a href="https://www.tetrate.io/">Tetrate</a>, which provides enterprise-grade service mesh solutions based on the open-source projects, Envoy and Istio, also commercially supports Skywalking.</p><p><a href="https://goharbor.io/"><strong>Harbor</strong></a><strong>:</strong> an open-source cloud-native registry service that secures artifacts, like containers, with policies and role-based access control. It was originally created by VMWare’s engineering team in China, then donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) to be governed independently. It’s been battle-tested in companies, like JD.com and China Mobile. Harbor recently reached <a href="https://www.cncf.io/announcement/2020/06/23/cloud-native-computing-foundation-announces-harbor-graduation/">“graduation” status in the CNCF</a>, indicating its maturity.</p><p><a href="https://riscv.org/"><strong>RISC-V</strong></a><strong>: </strong>an open standard Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) for hardware. It was born out of academia at UC Berkeley in 2010, so you can argue that it shouldn’t belong on this list. That being said, its <a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/">user-space ISA</a> and <a href="https://riscv.org/specifications/privileged-isa/">privileged ISA </a>wasn’t frozen, and thus ready for software and hardware development, until June 2019. Alibaba has put a lot of resources into RISC-V and <a href="https://www.techspot.com/news/81177-china-alibaba-making-16-core-25-ghz-risc.html">sports the fastest RISC-V based processor to date.</a> The entire ecosystem is stewarded by the foundation, RISC-V International, with <a href="https://riscv.org/members-at-a-glance/">three of the six Premier Members</a> being Chinese organizations -- Alibaba, Huawei, and the Institute of Computing Technology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences.</p><p><strong><a href="https://github.com/pingcap/tidb">TiDB</a> / <a href="https://github.com/tikv/tikv">TiKV</a>:</strong> two open-source projects that, when combined together, offer a MySQL-compatible distributed relational database with analytical capabilities. Both projects were initially created and open-sourced by the startup, PingCAP. TiKV has since been donated to the CNCF similar to Harbor and is <a href="https://github.com/cncf/toc/pull/414">currently under review to “graduate” </a>as well. These two technologies have been battle-tested in companies, like Meituan-Dianping (the Yelp + Uber Eats + Groupon + TripAdvisor of China). Its usage has expanded to tech companies in Japan, India, Southeast Asia, among other regions. Based on a ranking of database technologies <a href="https://www.modb.pro/dbRank">created in China by the data industry-focused website MoTianLun</a>, TiDB is the most popular solution.</p><p>This list of beneficiaries is by no means comprehensive. (I welcome your suggestion of other technologies I’ve missed; just email or <a href="https://twitter.com/kevinsxu">tweet at me</a>!) If we expand the time frame to longer than five years, <strong>a few more technologies easily come to mind: Apache Flink in Alibaba, Alluxio (from UC Berkeley) in Baidu and Tencent, CockroachDB in Baidu, Vitess (from YouTube) in JD.com, to name a few.</strong> We can arguably include the industry-default container orchestration software, Kubernetes, as well, because JD.com adopted Kubernetes very early in its development and <a href="https://www.cncf.io/blog/2018/08/02/qa-with-jd-com-kubernetes-cloud-native-and-cncf-projects-driving-big-data-and-ai/">runs one of the largest bare metal production clusters</a> in the world.</p><p>All these technologies happen to be open source solutions, which may be due to my own personal bias for open source. That being said, open-source is also the most common, if not default, way that new technologies get created nowadays. China’s own open-source ecosystem is burgeoning, which I wrote about at length in my “Open Source in China” series: <a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-players/">Part I</a>, <a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-game/">II</a>, <a href="https://interconnected.blog/open-source-in-china-the-trends/">III</a>.</p><h2 id="let-technology-be-technology">Let Technology Be Technology?</h2><p>A piece of technology that has been battle-tested by the workloads of a Tencent, Meituan-Dianping, or JD.com should comfortably withstand the requirements of a Snap, Uber Eats, or Shopify. The Chinese Internet economy is a fertile ground for technology innovators, not just in China but everywhere, to accelerate the improvement and maturity of their creations. <strong>All technologies should be nationless and borderless, in theory. </strong></p><p>Of course, there are tradeoffs to every decision. Real concerns and difficulties exist in operating in China’s technology landscape. However, most of these difficulties are regulatory, business, cultural, and ultimately people issues, not pure technology issues.

<p>I have a dedicated server with LXD installed where I have a bunch of system containers running to host a lot of my playground services, and to access the operating system of those lxc containers, I need to SSH to the LXD host, then exec or ssh into that LXC container.</p>

<p>This became tedious and wanted a way to directly ssh to them, as they don’t have public ip addresses, it’s not possible but found its possible to access them using proxyjump.</p>

    <p>It all started on an Thursday afternoon in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks, as we were ramping up to Starburst Enterprise
Presto 332-e release. Karol discovered what seemed to be a serious regression, and turned out to be even more
serious Cloud environment issue.</p>

<!--more-->



<p>At the Presto project, we take serious care of stability and efficiency, so releases undergo
rigorous performance benchmarks. The intention is to safe guard against any performance regressions
or stability problems. Usually, the performance improvements are benchmarked separately when they
are being added to the codebase. At Starburst, those benchmarks are even more important, especially
for the Starburst Enterprise Presto LTS releases.</p>

<p>On a side note, we use <a href="https://github.com/prestosql/benchto/">Benchto</a> for organizing
<a href="https://github.com/prestosql/presto/tree/master/presto-benchto-benchmarks">Presto benchmark suites</a>,
executing them and collecting the results. We use managed <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> in a public
cloud for provisioning Presto clusters, along with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-on-kubernetes/">Starburst Enterprise Presto Kubernetes</a>.
We use <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter</a> for producing result reports in HTML and PDF formats.</p>



<p>It all started in March, when <a href="https://github.com/sopel39">Karol Sobczak</a>
was grilling Presto with heavy rounds of benchmarks for the Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e release.
On one Thursday afternoon he reported stability problems, with few benchmark runs failing with
exceptions similar to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200326_150852_00338_dj225): Unknown block encoding:
LONG_ARRAY� � �� � @@@���� �@  @ � �@@@ @@� @�@D�� @@��@ `� @@� @#�@ � 0�
... (9550 more bytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In Presto, a block encoding is a way of encoding a particular Block type (here, a <code>LongArrayBlock</code>).
They are used when exchanging blocks of data between Presto nodes, or in spill to disk.
Blocks form a polymorphic class hierarchy, so every time a block is encoded, we need
to also store the encoding identifier. The encoding identifier (here, the <code>LONG_ARRAY</code> string)
is written as <code>&lt;string length&gt;</code> (4-byte, signed integer in little-endian) followed by
<code>&lt;string bytes&gt;</code> containing the UTF-8 representation of the encoding id. Clearly, in the case above,
the receiver read the <code>&lt;encoding id length&gt;</code> as 9623 instead of 10! How could that be ever possible?</p>

<p>Presto 332 brought a lot of good changes and upgrade to Java 11 was one of them.
Therefore, Starburst Enterprise Presto 332-e was the first Starburst release using Java 11 by default.
For earlier releases, we ran benchmarks using AWS EC2 machines orchestrated with <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">Starburst’s Presto
CloudFormation Template (CFT)</a>. This was also the first time we did
Presto release benchmarks running on Kubernetes clusters, with AWS EKS. We could suspect many different factors
as being the cause. We started to sift through the code, search team’s “collective brain” and
the Internet for any ideas. One of the important sources was Vijay Pandurangan’s writeup on <a href="https://tech.vijayp.ca/linux-kernel-bug-delivers-corrupt-tcp-ip-data-to-mesos-kubernetes-docker-containers-4986f88f7a19">data
corruption bug discovered by Twitter in 2015</a>. Of course, we also repeated benchmark runs. Seeing is believing.</p>



<p>On the next day, a customer reported similar problems with their Presto cluster. Of course, they
were not running a yet-to-be-released version that we were still benchmarking. They run into what seemed to
be a very serious regression in a Starburst Enterprise Presto 323-e release line. The customer was also using
the AWS cloud, but not the Kubernetes deployment. They were using <a href="https://www.starburstdata.com/presto-aws-cloud/">CFT-based deployment</a>
– the same stack we were using for all our release benchmarks so far – and we had never run into issues like this before.
As the customer was using a fresh-off-press latest minor release, we decided (in spirit of global health care trend)
to “quarantine” that release and roll back the customer installation to the previous version.</p>

<p>However, the fact that a small bug fix release triggered data problems was unnerving. The fact that we
did not discover any of these problems before, was even more unnerving.</p>



<p>As we were running more and more, and even more test runs, we discovered new failure modes.
For example:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>Query failed (#20200327_001931_00020_8di4r): Cannot cast DECIMAL(7, 2) '18734974449861284.67' to DECIMAL(12, 2)
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Well, this message is not <em>wrong</em>. It’s not possible to cast <code>18734974449861284.67</code> to <code>DECIMAL(12, 2)</code>.
Except that it is <em>also</em> not possible to have a <code>DECIMAL(7, 2)</code> with such value. Something wrong happened to the
data. At that moment, we realized the problem was very serious, because data could become corrupted.
This corrupted data could lead to a failure (like above), but it could also lead to incorrect query results,
or incorrect data being persisted (in case of <code>INSERT</code> or <code>CREATE TABLE AS</code> queries). We created
a virtual War Room (that is, a Slack channel), got together all Presto experts and our experienced field team
to discuss potential causes, further diagnostics and mitigation strategies.</p>

<p>Since the problem was affecting data exchanges between Presto nodes, we listed the following strategies
to try to dissect the problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>determining which query (queries) is (are) causing failures,</li>
  <li>running with HTTP/2,</li>
  <li>reverting to running on Java 8,</li>
  <li>enabling exchange compression (as decompression is very sensitive to data corruption),</li>
  <li>trying to upgrade Jetty,</li>
  <li>determining whether failures correlate with JVM GC activity,</li>
  <li>inspecting the source code.</li>
</ul>



<p>We were able to quickly prototype and verify some of the ideas. Switching to HTTP/2 or
upgrading Jetty to the latest version did not help. Nor did downgrading to Jetty version
that had been using for a long time. We also verified that problem was reproducible with Java 8,
so we concluded Java 11 was not the cause of it.</p>



<p>We identified the problem occurs somewhere within exchanges, between one Presto worker
node serializing a <code>Page</code> object (basic unit of data processing in Presto) and another node
deserializing it.</p>

<p>While decimal cast failure didn’t directly point at the data corruption problem (there could
be many other reasons for it), there was no other explanation for the <code>Unknown block encoding</code> exceptions.
The serialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.serialize</code> (used by <code>TaskOutputOperator</code>, the data sender) and
deserialization is done in <code>PagesSerde.deserialize</code> (used by <code>ExchangeOperator</code>, the
receiver of the data). As the logic is nicely encapsulated in <code>PagesSerde</code> class, we
added checksums to the serialized data: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
This felt like a smart move – except that it gave us nothing more than a confirmation that
there is a problem (“checksum failure”).
This we already knew.</p>

<p>We considered adding logging to capture data going out from one node and going in on
another node, but that would be huge amount of logs. One run of benchmarks transfers
hundreds of terabytes of data between the nodes.</p>

<p>We went ahead and created a Presto build that added data redundancy to be able to reconstruct
the data on the receiving side.
There are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erasure_code">well-known error-correction codes</a>
(e.g. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction">Reed–Solomon error correction</a>
available in Hadoop 3). In our case, speed of <em>implementation</em> (a.k.a. simplicity) was a deciding factor,
so we added data mirroring: <code>&lt;checksum&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt; &lt;serialized page&gt;</code>.
In order to avoid logging of all the data exchanges, we added the deserialized pages (both copies)
to the exceptions being raised.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>java.sql.SQLException: Query failed (#20200401_113622_00676_p7qp7): Hash mismatch, read: 1251072184702746109, calculated: 7591448164918409110
    Suppressed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Slice, first half: 040000000A0000004C4F4E475F415252.... (945 kilobytes)
    Suppressed: java.lang.RuntimeException: Slice, secnd half: 040000000A0000004C4F4E475F415252.... (945 kilobytes)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The exception told us the first part was changed, since read checksum did not match the calculated
checksum (it was calculated based on the first copy of the data and was different than the checksum
calculated on the sending side).
Having the encoded data in the exception like that, it was easy to extract the actual data and compare,
so now we could see <em>how</em> the data was changed.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cat failure.txt | grep 'Slice, first half' | cut -d: -f4- | sed 's/^ *//' | xxd -r -p &gt; changed
cat failure.txt | grep 'Slice, secnd half' | cut -d: -f4- | sed 's/^ *//' | xxd -r -p &gt; original
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Comparing binary files is fun, but in practice it can be more convenient to compare <code>hexdump</code> output.
The output below was created with <code>vimdiff &lt;(hexdump -Cv original) &lt;(hexdump -Cv changed)</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, built on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>You can use <strong>Foam</strong> for organising your research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, optionally, publishing it to the web.</p>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is free, open source, and extremely extensible to suit your personal workflow. You own the information you create with Foam, and you’re free to share it, and collaborate on it with anyone you want.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In a rush?</strong> You <em>could</em> jump to <a href="#getting-started">Getting started</a>, but I highly recommend reading the introductory sections first. <strong>Foam</strong> isn’t obvious.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-foam">How do I use Foam?</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-navigation-demo.gif" alt="Short video of Foam in use"></p>

<p>Whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Second Brain</a> or a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, <strong>Foam</strong> can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a single <strong>Foam</strong> workspace</a> for all your knowledge and research.</li>
  <li>Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them <strong>Bubbles</strong>, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Use Foam’s shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with <code>[[wiki-links]]</code>, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.</li>
  <li>Get an overview of your <strong>Foam</strong> workspace using a [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/graph-visualisation" title="Graph visualisation">graph-visualisation</a>] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/backlinking" title="Backlinking">backlinking</a>].</li>
</ol>

<p>Foam is a like a bathtub: <em>What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-foam">What’s in a Foam?</h2>

<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/vercel">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: This documentation was researched, written and published using <strong>Foam</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a GitHub repository from foam-template</a>. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository and open it in VS Code.</li>
  <li>When prompted to install recommended extensions, click <strong>Install all</strong> (or <strong>Show Recommendations</strong> if you want to review and install them one by one)</li>
</ol>

<p>After setting up the repository, open <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/.vscode/settings.json">.vscode/settings.json</a> and edit, add or remove any settings you’d like for your Foam workspace.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to use <strong>Foam</strong>, read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>].</p>

<p>There are [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/known-issues" title="Known Issues">known-issues</a>], and I’m sure, many unknown issues! Please <a href="http://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues">report them on GitHub</a>!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> doesn’t have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] you choose to install, but it’s up to you to discover what you can do with it!</p>

<p>Head over to [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>] for some useful patterns and ideas, and</p>

<h2 id="call-to-adventure">Call To Adventure</h2>

<p>The goal of <strong>Foam</strong> is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s is currently about “10% ready” relative to all the features I’ve thought of, but I’ve only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I’m excited to learn from others.</p>

<p>I am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d love to have you along on the journey.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A while ago I tweeted the good news that we’ve handed over our largest single monetary reward yet in the <a href="https://curl.haxx.se/docs/bugbounty.html">curl bug-bounty program</a>: 700 USD. We announced this security problem in association with the <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/06/24/curl-7-71-0-blobs-and-retries/">curl 7.71.0 release</a> the other day.</p>



<p>Someone responded to me and wanted this clarified: we award 700 USD to someone for reporting a curl bug that potentially affects users on virtually every computer system out there – while Apple just days earlier <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/researcher-lands-100000-reward-for-sign-in-with-apple-authentication-bypass-bug/">awarded a researcher 100,000 USD</a> for an Apple-specific security flaw.</p>



<p>The difference in “amplitude” is notable.</p>



<h2>A bug-bounty</h2>



<p>I think first we should start with appreciating that we have a bug-bounty program at all! Most open source projects don’t, and we didn’t have any program like this for the first twenty or so years. Our program is just getting started and we’re getting up to speed.</p>



<h2>Donations only</h2>



<p>How can we in the curl project hand out any money at all? We get donations from companies and individuals. This is the only source of funds we have.<strong> We can only give away rewards if we have enough donations in our fund.</strong></p>



<p>When we started the bug-bounty, we also rather recently had started to get donations (to our <a href="https://opencollective.com/curl">Open Collective fund</a>) and we were careful to not promise higher amounts than we would be able to pay, as we couldn’t be sure how many problems people would report and exactly how it would take off.</p>



<h2>The more donations the larger the rewards</h2>



<p>Over time it has gradually become clear that we’re getting donations at a level and frequency that far surpasses what we’re handing out as bug-bounty rewards. As a direct result of that, we’ve agreed in the the curl security team to increase the amounts.</p>



<p>For all security reports we get now that end up in a confirmed security advisory, we will increase the handed out award amount – until we reach a level we feel we can be proud of and stand for. I think that level should be more than 1,000 USD even for the lowest graded issues – and maybe ten times that amount for an issue graded “high”. We will however never get even within a few magnitudes of what the giants can offer.</p>

A so called hockey stick graph.</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Are we improving security-wise?</h2>



<p>The graph with number of reported CVEs per year shows that we started to get a serious number of reports in 2013 (5 reports) and it also seems to show that we’ve passed the peak. I’m not sure we have enough enough data and evidence to back this up, but I’m convinced we do a lot of things much better in the project now that should help to keep the amount of reports down going forward. In a few years when we look back we can see if I was right.</p>



<p>We’re at mid year 2020 now with only two reports so far, which if we keep this rate will make this the best CVE-year after 2012. This, while we offer more money than ever for reported issues and we have a larger amount of code than ever to find problems in.</p>

<h2>The companies surf along</h2>



<p>One company suggests that they will chip in and pay for an increased curl bug bounty <em>if the problem affects their use case,</em> but for some reason the problems just never seem to affect them and I’ve pretty much stopped bothering to even ask them.</p>



<p>curl is shipped with a large number of operating systems and in a large number of applications but yet not even the large volume users participate in the curl bug bounty program but leave it to us (and they rarely even donate). Perhaps you can report curl security issues to them and have a chance of a higher reward?</p>



<p>You would possibly imagine that these companies should be keen on helping us out to indirectly secure users of their operating systems and applications, but no. We’re an open source project. They can use our products for free and they do, and our products improve their end products. But if there’s a problem in our stuff, that issue is ours to sort out and fix and those companies can then <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2019/08/01/the-slowest-curl-vendors-of-all-time/">subsequently</a> upgrade to the corrected version…</p>



<p>This is not a complaint, just an observation. I personally appreciate the freedom this gives us.</p>



<h2>What can you do to help?</h2>



<p>Help us review code. Report bugs. Report all security related problems you can find or suspect exists. Get your company to sponsor us.

    <p><em>Writing assembly code that runs on multiple architectures.</em></p>
    <p>A few years back, while I worked as a Solaris engineer at Oracle,
I posted an april fools joke to one of our internal mailing lists.
Do you remember <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(operating_system)">Solaris</a>?
<a href="https://vojtechkral.github.io/blag/polyglot-assembly/pepperidge-farm.jpg">Pepperidge farm remembers</a>.
Unfortunatelly Solaris 12 was
<a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/01/oracle-sort-of-confirms-demise-of-solaris-12-effort/">never released</a>
(not as such, anyway) and many of the devs were laid off shortly afterwards,
but that's a different story... The april fools e-mail read as follows:</p>
<pre><span>Hi all,
   can I please get a codereview for my new Hello World program?
The purpose of the program is to output a greeting.
As the code is very short, I'm inlining it at the end of this email.
The code has been tested on sparc and x86.
Only 64 bit arch is supported - please compile with cc -m64.
cstyle reports no issues.

Thanks!
Vojtech

<p>I expect <code>main()</code> not being a function and instead being an array of numbers
won't be news to many people, this
<a href="http://jroweboy.github.io/c/asm/2015/01/26/when-is-main-not-a-function.html">has been done before</a>.
(If you've never seen this before, have a look at that blogpost, it's pretty good!)</p>
<p>The focus of this post instead is this line:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The code has been tested on sparc and x86.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Any code that a Solaris dev looked to push to the core repository
had to be rigorously tested on both architectures targeted by Solaris: x86 and SPARC.
And this code doesn't really look like it could run on multiple architectures, right? ...
But it does. And it does that with a trick I call a <em>polyglot assembly</em> code.
Maybe that's a little too pompous a name for a silly joke, but I didn't know what else to call it...</p>
<h2 id="linux-x86-64-arm">Linux, x86-64 &amp; ARM</h2>
<p>I recently decided to revive the idea and, since both Solaris and SPARC
are fairly obscure nowadays, to port the code over to Linux on x86-64 and ARM.</p>
<p>Here's the new code:</p>
<pre><span>#include </span><span>&lt;stdint.h&gt;

</span><span>const </span><span>uint64_t</span><span> _start[] </span><span>__attribute__</span><span>((section(</span><span>".text"</span><span>))) </span><span>= </span><span>{
    0xe3a00001909032eb, 0xe3a0200ce28f1014,
    0xef000000e3a07004, 0xe3a07001e3a00000,
    0x6c6c6548ef000000, 0x0a214d5241202c6f,
    0x18ec834800000000, 0x4800000045058b48,
    0xa20fc03148240489, 0x0c24548908245c89,
    0x142444c710244c89, 0x01c0c74800000a21,
    0x0001c7c748000000, 0x480124748d480000,
    0x050f00000015c2c7, 0x480000003cc0c748,
    0x6c654820050fff31, 0x00000000202c6f6c,
};
</span></pre>
<p>It's still just a <em>Hello, World!</em> program.</p>
<p>To build it, I recommend <code>gcc -static -nostdlib</code>.
I found out the special section attribute is necessary for gcc to put the code in the right section.</p>
<p>You can also get pre built binaries <a href="https://github.com/vojtechkral/asm-polyglot/releases/tag/0.1">here</a>.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that the resulting binaries are <strong>still platform-specific</strong>.
The polyglot trick's purpose is to make it possible to build for x86-64 and ARM from the same source file.
While the executable code inside the ELF file is the same bit by bit for both platforms,
the ELF header and section layout is somewhat different and unfortunatelly there seems to be no way around this
(at minimum, the kernel checks the ELF architecture byte and won't load the program unless it matches).</p>
<p>So anyway, how does it work?</p>
<p><img src="https://vojtechkral.github.io/blag/polyglot-assembly/diagram.png#right" alt="diagram"></p>
<p>The basic idea is pretty simple: The code starts with a magical snippet
that gets interpreted by both architectures and basically performs
a conditional jump based on which architecture is runing the code.</p>
<p><em>Architecture #1</em> decodes this bit as a an effective no-op instruction
(in my example it's actually an ALU instruction whose output is ignored)
and simply continues to the area marked blue in the diagram.
<em>Arch-#1</em>-specific code is stored there.</p>
<p><em>Architecture #2</em> decodes the initial part as a jump and proceeds
to jump over to the yellow area where the code for <em>arch #2</em> follows.</p>
<p>How do you come up with the magical architecture-selecting prolog?</p>
<p>It turns out x86 is actually a pretty good choice for <em>arch #2</em>, because it has
a short near-jump instruction, just 2 bytes. Together with 2 <code>NOP</code>s (1 byte each)
this makes up the length of one regular (non-Thumb) ARM instruction.</p>
<p>The three x86 instructions, a <code>JMP</code> and two <code>NOP</code>s, can be arbitrarily reordered
and also the jump distance can be adjusted, and as I found out this is
enough degrees of freedom to find a valid nop-like ARM instruction.</p>
<h2 id="searching-the-instruction-space">Searching the instruction space</h2>
<p>The original Solaris code was a result of basically just hokus-pokus.
In the Linux rewrite I tried to come up with a somewhat more automated way of finding the right combo.
There's a hackish <a href="https://github.com/vojtechkral/asm-polyglot/blob/master/jmps.py">python script</a>
and a Makefile rule that generate <a href="https://vojtechkral.github.io/blag/polyglot-assembly/jmps.txt">a big plaintext list</a> of all <code>NOP</code>/<code>NOP</code>/2-byte <code>JMP</code>
permutations along with their ARM representations.</p>
<p>From the list it's apparent that the <code>JMP</code>, <code>NOP</code>, <code>NOP</code> ordering yields a safe
ARM <code>addsls</code> instruction most of the time, at least as long as the jump distance is small enough
for the <code>addsls</code> to not touch the <code>sp</code> or <code>pc</code> registers...</p>
<p>In my case I only need to <code>JMP</code> 52 bytes ahead. This results in <code>addsls r3, r0, r11, ror #5</code> on ARM,
which is a perfectly harmless instruction. Maybe a bit too complex (a conditional add with a bit rotation), but harmless.</p>
<p>In summary, the magical bytes that make an x86 CPU jump ahead and
an ARM CPU continue are:</p>
<pre><span>eb 32 90 90
</span></pre><h2 id="the-code">The code</h2>
<p>The source code for this mini-project can be found <a href="https://github.com/vojtechkral/asm-polyglot">on my github</a>.</p>
<p>The C file quoted above effectively contains the following two code paths for x86-64 and ARM, respectively:</p>

<p>I decided to automate the whole process of generating the C file and the binaries for x86-64 and ARM.
There's a big <code>Makefile</code> that goes through the arduous process of first generating ARM code from the source ARM asm file,
dumping the compiled ARM, feeding that to a Python script with a template of the x86 + compiled ARM code,
compiling that, generating the C source from that, and finally compiling the C source for both x86 and ARM.</p>
<p>Running the Makefile requires having an arm cross-compiling gcc installed along with a matching gdb.</p>
<h2 id="practical-applications">Practical applications</h2>
<p>There are none :-)</p>
<p>At least as far as I know.
As stated earlier, the resulting binary is still platform-specific,
Which means the trick can't be used to make multi-platform ELFs :-|</p>
<p>In theory it could be used to create a multi-platform shellcode,
but I find it unlikely that it would actually be useful in practice.</p>
<p>Multi-platform kernels maybe? But then again boot procedures differ quite a lot
between architectures, so again it's probably not very practical...</p>
<p>So yeah, it's really just a joke done for fun and to perhaps learn something new...</p>

        <p>Knowing how to use containers in application development is a must for a modern-day developer. One reason for the recent demand for containers has been the emergence of Docker. Docker has not only increased the use of containers, it has had a great impact on the way we approach application development.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are a developer who is yet to find a proper introduction to this popular technology, you are in the right place. In this article, we are going to introduce you to the concept of Docker and get a hands-on approach to learning Docker by dockerizing a simple application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>First, let’s clarify what Docker is and why it has become this important.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-docker">What is Docker?</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Docker is a tool developers use to create, deploy, and run applications in an isolated environment through containers.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here it is again, containers. Though this term is used a few times since the beginning of the article, you may not have an idea what a container is. In order to fully understand the above statement, we have to first understand what a container is.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-is-a-container-and-why-do-we-need-it">What is a Container and Why Do We Need It?</h2>
<p>A container is a software unit that packs application code and all the dependencies used in the application into a single package. Packaging allows the container to isolate the application from the host environment it is running in. The application sees the container as its environment instead of the host device. This abstraction guarantees that an application running in a development environment is able to run in a production environment without going through significant changes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Even if several applications are running on the host device, the container isolates the containerized application from interfering with the operation of other applications and sharing their resources.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before containers, virtual machines were used to isolate applications from the host environment. In virtual machines, each machine uses a separate operating system to run the application. Though this approach also achieves the purpose of isolating the applications, it has a downside of adding too much overhead on top of the application. Containers, on the other hand, share the OS kernel of the host device instead of using an OS of its own, which removes the overhead added by the virtual machines. This makes containers more lightweight and resource-efficient compared to virtual machines.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though containers have been in use long before Docker, it’s safe to say that Docker is the biggest reason for the extreme popularity of containers in the modern programming world. Other than being open-source, Docker’s ease of use, reliability, and efficiency made the programming world instantly fall in love with this technology.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="what-are-the-dockerfile-docker-image-and-docker-engine">What are the Dockerfile, Docker Image, and Docker Engine?</h2>
<p>Docker comes with its special language. Dockerfile, Docker image, and Docker engine are 3 words commonly used among Docker users. These are also the 3 most important components used when building Docker containers.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h3>
<p>Dockerfile contains a set of instructions to build a Docker image, which we are going to discuss next. These instructions will be run one after the other when creating the Docker image. Instructions in the Dockerfile contain information such as the host device’s OS, the programming language of the application, application directory location, network ports, and environment variables.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="docker-image">Docker Image</h3>
<p>Docker image is a template that is used to create the final Docker container for the application. We can generate the Docker image of an application by running the docker build command with the Dockerfile as a parameter. To create the Docker container, we use the docker run command and the Docker image.&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="docker-engine">Docker Engine</h3>
<p>Docker engine is where all the Docker containers are running on. Both Windows and Linux based applications can run on Docker engines.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="how-to-dockerize-a-simple-application">How to Dockerize a Simple Application</h2>
<p>Now we have got to the most interesting part of this tutorial. We are going to dockerize a simple application to get hands-on Docker experience. First, we will create a simple Node.js application and then, create the Dockerfile, Docker image, and finally the Docker container for the application.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Before continuing, however, make sure you have Docker installed on your device. You can follow the official documentation to install Docker on your <a href="https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/install/">Windows</a> or <a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/">Ubuntu OS</a>. Check out the docs for other OS.</p>
<h3 id="create-a-simple-nodejs-application">Create a Simple Node.js Application</h3>
<p>We are going to create a simple Node application that sends a “Hello World” message when we visit the root route.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Follow these steps to set up your application:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">npm init
npm install express --save
</code></pre></div><p>Inside the directory, <code>app.js</code> file contains our main application code.&nbsp;
&nbsp;</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="javascript"><span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>express</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>require</span>(<span>'express'</span>)
<span>const</span>&nbsp;<span>app</span>&nbsp;<span>=</span>&nbsp;<span>express</span>()
&nbsp;
<span>app</span>.<span>get</span>(<span>'/'</span>,&nbsp;(<span>req</span>,&nbsp;<span>res</span>)&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>res</span>.<span>send</span>(<span>"Hello&nbsp;World!"</span>)
})
&nbsp;
<span>app</span>.<span>listen</span>(<span>process</span>.<span>env</span>.<span>PORT</span>,&nbsp;()&nbsp;=&gt;&nbsp;{
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span>console</span>.<span>log</span>(<span>"Node&nbsp;server&nbsp;has&nbsp;started&nbsp;running"</span>)
})
</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="create-the-dockerfile-for-the-application">Create the Dockerfile for the Application</h3>
<p>Now we can create the Dockerfile with the information that is needed to create the Docker image.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Create a file named <code>Dockerfile</code> inside the application directory. To create the Docker Image for our application, the Dockerfile should contain a set of commands like this.&nbsp;</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span>FROM</span><span> node:latest</span><span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>WORKDIR</span><span> /docker-tutorial</span><span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>COPY</span> . .<span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>ENV</span> PORT <span>3000</span><span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>RUN</span> npm install<span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>EXPOSE</span><span> $PORT</span><span>
</span><span></span> <span>
</span><span></span><span>ENTRYPOINT</span> [<span>"node"</span>, <span>"app.js"</span>]<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now we will go through what each of these commands means.&nbsp;</p>
<ol>
<li>FROM—This command sets the base image and the new image of the application is built on top of this. In our case, we use an image that contains npm and the latest Node.js version. This image is pulled from Docker Hub which is a public repository of Docker images.&nbsp;</li>
<li>WORKDIR—This command sets the working directory for the application that will be running inside the container.&nbsp;</li>
<li>COPY—This command copies the files in the application directory to the working directory which we set with the previous command. You can pass the path to a specific file name or do as above to copy all the files in the application directory to the Docker image. In the latter case, make sure you have navigated to the application directory on the command line when running the docker build command.</li>
<li>ENV—In the Node application, note how we passed the environment variable, PORT (process.env.PORT), to the app.listen function instead of directly passing the port number the application should listen to. Therefore, we have to set the PORT environment variable in the application environment. For our application that is going to the Docker container. So, we use the ENV command to pass the variables that we want to set as environment variables inside the Docker container.&nbsp;</li>
<li>RUN—This command runs npm install to install the dependencies used in our application, which are saved to package.json file.&nbsp;</li>
<li>EXPOSE—This command exposes the application to listen to the given port. Since we have already set the port number as an environment variable, we pass the variable name, $PORT, &nbsp;in place of the actual port number. However, remember that the application is exposed to the port 3000 inside the container’s environment and not the host device’s environment.&nbsp;</li>
<li>ENTRYPOINT—This command sets how to enter, or how to start, our application. Docker joins the array we pass to create a single command that starts the application, which is node app.js.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="build-the-docker-image">Build the Docker Image</h3>
<p>We use docker build command to build the Docker image from the Dockerfile. Here is how it works:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">docker build -t &lt;image-name&gt; &lt;dockerfile-location&gt;
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure you have navigated to the application directory on your command-line before running the command. You can pass a dot (.) in place of the Dockerfile location to indicate that the Dockerfile is in the current directory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For our example we will run:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="shell">docker build -t docker-tutorial .
</code></pre></div><p>Output:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="text">Sending build context to Docker daemon  2.008MB

</code></pre></div><p>Once you run the docker build command, Docker will execute each command in the Dockerfile consecutively. When executing the FROM command, if the Node image hasn’t been pulled to your device before, Docker will pull the image from Docker Hub.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once all the commands are executed, you will see the message “successfully built” if the image was created without running into an error.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can use the command, <code>docker images</code>, to see all the images currently in your device.&nbsp;</p>

                            in this time was too high, and other parts of our city need funding desperately.

      <p>Dave Liepmann</p>
      <section>
        <p>Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas demonstrated by Edward Tufte’s books and handouts. Tufte’s style is known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS was created by <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com/">Dave Liepmann</a> and is now an Edward Tufte project. The original idea was cribbed from <a href="https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/">Tufte-<span>L<span>a</span>T<span>e</span>X</span></a> and <a href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html">R Markdown’s Tufte Handout format</a>. We give hearty thanks to all the people who have contributed to those projects.</p>
        <p>If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your contribution in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub project: <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte-css</a>. Please note the <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css#contributing">contribution guidelines</a>.</p>
        <p>Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not print. Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not to say “websites should look like this interpretation of Tufte’s books” but rather “here are some techniques Tufte developed that we’ve found useful in print; maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the web”. Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way to implement this particular set of ideas. It should be a starting point, not a design goal, because any project should present their information as best suits their particular circumstances.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>To use Tufte CSS, copy <code>tufte.css</code> and the <code>et-book</code> directory of font files to your project directory, then add the following to your HTML document’s <code>head</code> block:</p>

        <pre><code>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="tufte.css"/&gt;</code></pre>

        <p>Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS conventions described in this document. For best results, View Source and Inspect Element frequently.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="fundamentals">Fundamentals</h2>
        <h3 id="fundamentals--sections-and-headers">Sections and Headings</h3>
        <p>Organize your document with an <code>article</code> element inside your <code>body</code> tag. Inside that, use <code>section</code> tags around each logical grouping of text and headings.</p>
        <p>Tufte CSS uses <code>h1</code> for the document title, <code>p</code> with class <code>subtitle</code> for the document subtitle, <code>h2</code> for section headings, and <code>h3</code> for low-level headings. More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your document:</p>
        <blockquote cite="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000hB">
          <p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings: chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of <em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into <em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points. Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it didn’t require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>
          
        </blockquote>
        <p>As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an example of block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled, semantically correct HTML using <code>blockquote</code> and <code>footer</code> elements. See page 20 of <a href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</a> for an example in print.</p>
        <p><span>In his later books<label for="sn-in-his-later-books"></label></span><span><a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_be"><em>Beautiful Evidence</em></a></span>, Tufte starts each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and the first few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a span with the class <code>newthought</code>, as demonstrated at the beginning of this paragraph. Vertical spacing is accomplished separately through <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags. Be consistent: though we do so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate use of header elements and the <code>newthought</code> technique. Pick one approach and stick to it.</p>

        <h3 id="fundamentals--text">Text</h3>
        <p>Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black colors. Tufte CSS uses <code>#fffff8</code> and <code>#111111</code> because they are nearly indistinguishable from their ‘pure’ cousins, but dial down the harsh contrast. We stick to the greyscale for text, reserving color for specific, careful use in figures and images.</p>
        <p>In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype Bembo<label for="sn-proprietary-monotype-bembo"></label><span>See Tufte’s comment in the <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt">Tufte book fonts</a> thread.</span> font. A similar effect is achieved in digital formats with the now open-source <a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book">ETBook</a>, which Tufte CSS supplies with a <code>@font-face</code> reference to a .ttf file. In case ETBook somehow doesn’t work, Tufte CSS shifts gracefully to other serif fonts like Palatino and Georgia.</p>
        <p>Also notice how Tufte CSS includes separate font files for bold (strong) and italic (emphasis), instead of relying on the browser to mechanically transform the text. This is typographic best practice.</p>
        <p>If you prefer sans-serifs, use the <code>sans</code> class. It relies on Gill Sans, Tufte’s sans-serif font of choice.</p>
        <p>Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on mouseover or when clicked. Here is a <a href="#">dummy example</a> that goes nowhere. These links are underlined, since this is the most widely recognized indicator of clickable text. <label for="mn-blue-links">⊕</label><span>Blue text, while also a widely recognizable clickable-text indicator, is crass and distracting. Luckily, it is also rendered unnecessary by the use of underlining.</span> However, because most browsers’ default underlining does not clear descenders and is so thick and distracting, the underline effect is instead achieved using CSS trickery involving background gradients instead of standard <code>text-decoration</code>. Credit goes to Adam Schwartz for that technique.</p>
        <p>As always, these design choices are merely one approach that Tufte CSS provides by default. Other approaches can also be made to work. The goal is to make sentences readable without interference from links, as well as to make links immediately identifiable even by casual web users.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="epigraphs">Epigraphs</h2>
        <div>
          <blockquote>
            <p>The English language . . . becomes ugly and inaccurate because our thoughts are foolish, but the slovenliness of our language makes it easier for us to have foolish thoughts.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>
            <p>For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.</p>
            
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote>I do not paint things, I paint only the differences between things.</blockquote>
        </div>
        <p>If you’d like to introduce your page or a section of your page with some quotes, use epigraphs. Modeled after chapter epigraphs in Tufte’s books (particularly <em>Beautiful Evidence</em>), these are <code>blockquote</code> elements with a bit of specialized styling. Quoted text is italicized. The source goes in a <code>footer</code> element inside the <code>blockquote</code>. We have provided three examples in the epigraph of this section, demonstrating shorter and longer quotes, with and without a paragraph tag, and showing how multiple quotes within an epigraph fit together with the use of a wrapper class.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2 id="sidenotes">Sidenotes: Footnotes and Marginal Notes</h2>
        <p>One of the most distinctive features of Tufte’s style is his extensive use of sidenotes.<label for="sn-extensive-use-of-sidenotes"></label><span>This is a sidenote.</span> Sidenotes are like footnotes, except they don’t force the reader to jump their eye to the bottom of the page, but instead display off to the side in the margin. Perhaps you have noticed their use in this document already. You are very astute.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes are a great example of the web not being like print. On sufficiently large viewports, Tufte CSS uses the margin for sidenotes, margin notes, and small figures. On smaller viewports, elements that would go in the margin are hidden until the user toggles them into view. The goal is to present related but not necessary information such as asides or citations <em>as close as possible</em> to the text that references them. At the same time, this secondary information should stay out of the way of the eye, not interfering with the progression of ideas in the main text.</p>
        <p>Sidenotes consist of two elements: a superscript reference number that goes inline with the text, and a sidenote with content. To add the former, just put a label and dummy checkbox into the text where you want the reference to go, like so:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"&gt;
&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox"
       id="sn-demo"
       class="margin-toggle"/&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>You must manually assign a reference <code>id</code> to each side or margin note, replacing “sn-demo” in the <code>for</code> and the <code>id</code> attribute values with an appropriate descriptor. It is useful to use prefixes like <code>sn-</code> for sidenotes and <code>mn-</code> for margin notes.</p>
        <p>Immediately adjacent to that sidenote reference in the main text goes the sidenote content itself, in a <code>span</code> with class <code>sidenote</code>. This tag is also inserted directly in the middle of the body text, but is either pushed into the margin or hidden by default. Make sure to position your sidenotes correctly by keeping the sidenote-number label close to the sidenote itself.</p>
        <p>If you want a sidenote without footnote-style numberings, then you want a margin note.
          <label for="mn-demo">⊕</label>
          
          <span>
            This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
          </span> On large screens, a margin note is just a sidenote that omits the reference number. This lessens the distracting effect taking away from the flow of the main text, but can increase the cognitive load of matching a margin note to its referent text. However, on small screens, a margin note is like a sidenote except its viewability-toggle is a symbol rather than a reference number. This document currently uses the symbol ⊕ (<code>&amp;#8853;</code>), but it’s up to you.</p>
        <p>Margin notes are created just like sidenotes, but with the <code>marginnote</code> class for the content and the <code>margin-toggle</code> class for the label and dummy checkbox. For instance, here is the code for the margin note used in the previous paragraph:</p>
        <pre><code>&lt;label for="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"&gt;&amp;#8853;&lt;/label&gt;
&lt;input type="checkbox" id="mn-demo" class="margin-toggle"/&gt;
&lt;span class="marginnote"&gt;
  This is a margin note. Notice there isn’t a number preceding the note.
&lt;/span&gt;</code></pre>

After being acquired by Facebook in 2014, its numbers increased, and now, over two billion users make use of WhatsApp every month.</p><p>Hackers have introduced a new verification scam which put the billions of WhatsApp users at risk. It is a clever hack which is why experts fear that a lot of users will fall for it.</p><p>Usually, the hackers pose as friends and try to convince you to send them your login code. Other times they pose as the WhatsApp Technical Team using the WhatsApp logo so they look legit enough. These hackers send messages to their targets, telling them that they need to verify their WhatsApp account.</p><p>The WhatsApp verification scam not only put users at risk of losing their personal details, but they can also lose their entire if they give out their login code. With the login code, the hackers will be able to send and read messages with the victims’ accounts.</p><p>Considering how frequent WhatsApp requires updating, most users will be unsuspicious of these messages. Users have been advised against falling victims to such scam as the WhatsApp Technical Team do not message users on the WhatsApp platform.</p><p>This was made known via a Whatsapp blog, <a href="https://wabetainfo.com/">WABetaInfo</a>. They dismissed the messages as fake and if WhatsApp were to message users, there will be a green verified indicator for authenticity.

from this messy, massive data and maximize my data value?</strong><strong></strong></h2>



<p>With the development of cloud computing, more and more enterprises are considering building their own IT business systems and enterprise application platforms on the cloud to realize an agile, efficient and cost-controllable new IT architecture through rapidly evolving big data technology and its scalable distributed architecture.</p>







<p><strong>Challenges</strong><strong></strong></p>



<ul><li>How can the timeliness of analysis be guaranteed when the scale of data constantly increases?</li><li> How can we achieve cost optimization?</li><li>How can we achieve unified data management and enable cross-departmental collaboration?</li><li>How does the technical architecture meet future challenges?</li></ul>







<h2><strong>These Are the 4 Key Elements to Evaluate When Selecting a Cloud Big Data Analysis Service</strong></h2>







<p><strong><em>1: Engine Analysis</em></strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Performance Guarantee:</strong> In the era of big data, the explosive growth in the scale of enterprise data has not only brought about the expansion of data magnitudes from TB to PB, it has also increased data complexity. In the pursuit of lean data analysis, enterprises must evaluate whether an analysis engine can provide high concurrency and excellent analysis capability when working with massive data volumes. </p>



<p>Enterprises need to consider an engineâ€™s performance according to both their existing and future needs. While evaluating the concurrency and performance of third-party software, enterprises should also investigate the degree of integration with cloud services, such as computing and storage.</p>







<p><strong>Cost Control:</strong> According to the results of the <em>RightScale 2019 State of the Cloud Report from Flexera</em>, about 35% of costs for enterprise cloud services are wasted. The reasons for such huge waste often includes over-allocation, idle resources, and all-day operation of virtual machines. </p>



<p>At present, there are many cloud cost management software options on the market, such as Nutanix Beam, Turbonomic, ParkMyCloud, and more. Most cloud vendors also have corresponding native services, such as Azure Cost Management and Amazon CloudWatch.</p>



<p>Computing resources often account for a heavy part of the cost for big data analysis services on the cloud. The most common cost control mechanism is to manually monitor and adjust those resources through third-party cloud cost management software, while another option is for the big data analysis service to actively conduct intelligent adjustments internally.</p>







<p><strong><em>2: Data Management</em></strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Unified Business Logic:</strong> With the growth of data practitioners and data applications, each business line is building its own data system to drive business growth. Based on user preferences, different business units supported by IT use different BI tools and data marts for their business analysis. </p>



<p>Due to each data platformâ€™s construction and different departmental requirements, each BI tool needs to develop semantic information separately, which can easily create isolated islands of data analysis.</p>



<p>If there is no consensus on data definitions and measurement standards, that lack of unified analysis means an analyst cannot see the whole picture of the business. </p>



<p>Their data analysis results will be undermined and their efforts will eventually be wasted. It is especially important for data management that the enterprise understands how to avoid data silos and enable data consumers from different business departments to form a unified understanding and cognition of data resources.</p>



<p>In order to build a unified big data analysis platform, consider whether the new products/services can be seamlessly integrated with your existing BI tools, provide friendly and standard interfaces, and match the usage habits and analysis efficiency of different business departments, as well as whether it can help build a unified semantic layer to share business logic.</p>







<p><strong>Security Policy:</strong> As more and more enterprises plan to store data on big data platforms to form a unified data lake, personal identity information (PII), detailed financial data and other types of proprietary and protected data will be centralized on the big data platform, and so the CIO is bound to pay more and more attention to security policies, data access control and audit requirements. </p>



<p>In order to help different users realize different data views on a unified data service, data analysis technology on the cloud needs to be able to provide fine-grained access control to ensure data privacy to the greatest extent while still providing a unified and efficient data platform. </p>



<p>If the security policy can be unified, that is, users and data access management can be uniformly configured in the data asset layer of the big data platform and act on all upper-level business applications, IT will not need to configure additional data access control for lower-level systems.</p>







<p><strong><em>3: Technical Architecture</em></strong><br></p>



<p><strong>Cloud Native Architecture: </strong>Enterprises need to be forward-looking when designing technology architecture, that is, the technology architecture should not only be able to face the immediate challenges but also be flexible enough to face future unknown challenges. </p>



<p>Gartner’s analysis report <em>How to use Semantics to Drive the Business Value of Your Data</em> points out that the deployment and innovation of database management systems are increasingly giving priority to cloud deployment or only offering cloud deployment.</p>



<p>The concept of “cloud native” has been used since it was put forward in 2013. Cloud native refers to the adoption of technologies and management methods specially optimized for agile delivery models on the cloud to achieve efficient and continuous service capabilities. </p>



<p>More and more enterprises prefer a cloud native architecture that can make full use of the open cloud computing technology ecosystem, reduce delivery risks and better cope with future unknown challenges.</p>







<p><strong><em>4: Technical Ecosystem</em></strong></p>



<p>At present, there are many mature solutions in the enterprise data analysis ecosystem, including cloud platform, data source, data processing, data analysis, etc. An open big data architecture enables enterprises to make full use of their advantages to form an end-to-end technical architecture. </p>



<p>The openness of a data analysis service can be evaluated through API support with mainstream software and integration with mainstream data processing frameworks.</p>

			<p><span>Y</span>ou might imagine that in the midst of a global pandemic and all of its social and economic fallout that our minds would be laser-focused on immediate, Earthly woes. But apparently not entirely. A case in point is the recent virus-like spread of news headlines to the effect that there should be “at least 36 alien civilizations” in our galaxy. Not 10, not a thousand, or a billion, but 36. There you have it, three dozen other sets of intelligent life dotting our cosmic neighborhood, so stick that in your pipe and smoke it.</p><p>It’s at times like these that you can almost hear the collective sigh from astronomers and astrobiologists who realize that they have to roll up their sleeves to gently, politely, carefully try to explain why these headlines are, shall we say, of the same nature as the matter that emanates from ruminant digestive systems.</p><blockquote><p>Charting the development of civilizations as a simple function of the age of life on a planet seems positively ludicrous.</p> </blockquote><p>But I’m getting ahead of the arc here. Right now, in science, the question of whether we are alone in the universe or not is crying out for some kind of answer. Perhaps more so than at any time in recorded human history. There is a confluence of reasons for this sense of urgency and importance. For one thing we now know that planets are <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-3881/ab88b0" target="_blank">fantastically abundant</a> in the universe and are potentially the best incubators of the complex chemistry associated with life as we understand it. We’re also getting closer to being able to evaluate some of these other worlds, these exoplanets, with a fidelity of data that could reveal rudimentary signatures of life, through its chemistry and the changes it wreaks on a planetary environment. Simultaneously there is a resurgence of interest in the quest to look for evidence not just of life but of technological life; either emitting structured information in radio waves or laser pulses, or sculpting its surroundings in ways that reflect intent and sophistication.<br></p><p>Consequently, many scientists are actively looking for ways to incorporate even the tiniest hints or clues that come from new data or insights to see if we can’t come up with statistically meaningful statements about the likelihood of life elsewhere—be it microbes or civilizations. In that sense (and I count myself in this category), we are the kids shaking the nicely wrapped presents to see if we can tell what we’re getting. The problem is that the wrapping may not come off for a long time, and that all of our guesses rest on fundamental assumptions—on prior knowledge or expectations that are themselves possibly highly biased and unusual.</p><div>

</article>
</div><p>It is those assumptions that gets us back to the headline-grabbing statements about 36 alien civilizations. These headlines are based on a new <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.03968" target="_blank">study</a> by two respectable scientists, Tom Westby and Christopher Conselice at the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom. What these researchers actually say is that, based on a very specific calculation (that I’ll come to shortly) there is an argument to be made for the possible existence of anywhere between about half a dozen to over 200 civilizations capable of communication in our galaxy.</p><p>Arriving at those figures involves a number of steps. Some are to do with a detailed astrophysical analysis to evaluate the likely number of stars and planetary systems of particular ages and elemental compositions. It turns out, for example, that stars in our galaxy are, on average, about 9.8 billion years old—not surprisingly matching the age of the era during which most stars were formed.</p><p>But other steps involve assumptions that are extremely tricky to justify, and highly contentious. This is not to unduly criticize the study, because it is entirely open and honest about these assumptions and is a stimulating contribution to these questions. Nonetheless, the assumptions are the weak link, as are similar ones in almost every paper ever written on this topic.</p><p>In this case two “principles” are suggested: a Weak Astrobiological Copernican Principle and a Strong Astrobiological Copernican Principle. The weak one is a scenario where, because of what we witness on Earth, it is assumed that planets only form intelligent life after they reach an age of 5 billion years. The strong one says that intelligent life has to form between 4.5 and 5.5 billion years into a planet’s existence, as it seems to have on Earth. The justification for choosing these figures is that if Earth is not special (as the modern form of the Copernican Principle would have it) then we would expect other life-bearing worlds to follow suit on average. The estimated number of alien civilizations derives from these constraints, after combination with the computed statistics of exoplanets and their properties.</p><p>This is also precisely where scientific feathers get righteously ruffled. The most direct technical rebuttal to these proposed assumptions and principles is that we on Earth suffer from powerful “winner bias.” If, for example, intelligence came along much earlier or much later it would look at its history and also select its time of existence as “the most likely.”</p><blockquote><p>The impetus of life toward intelligence over evolutionary time is, at best, a hypothesis.</p> </blockquote><p>That’s a thorny problem. But we already knew it was a problem, and there has been <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/109/2/395" target="_blank">sophisticated work</a> done to deploy the tools of so-called Bayesian probability to try <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/117/22/11995" target="_blank">to account</a> for precisely this kind of bias. The results of all of those works tell us that we are truly, quantifiably ignorant about life’s most probable trajectory, and that our Earth-based data points have very limited discriminatory power.<br></p><p>The other rebuttal, that is in many ways far more interesting, is to do with our impressive ignorance about the very nature of life itself, and the nature of the phenomenon we blithely call “intelligence.” Because of that ignorance, charting the development of civilizations as a simple function of the age of life on a planet seems positively ludicrous.</p><p>What we do have is an emerging sense that life and its planetary environment are inextricably entwined. Every piece of Earth’s deep environmental history is a complicated story of the interactions and interdependencies of life and planet; of geochemistry and biogeochemistry. As a result, the trajectory of life here may only be partially reproducible anywhere else in the cosmos—even assuming the same chemical toolkit, the same information-bearing molecular structures and biochemistry, and the same rules of selection and evolution.</p><p>The nature of intelligence, or technological capacity, also tends to be conflated with the idea that life, on average, seems to become more complex over time. It has been posited that the improvements of prediction that complexity enables (the projection abilities of neural nets and brains) is one item at the root of this tendency. If an organism can guess the future better it ought to survive better. But, of course, there are living forms, from bacteria to plant life, that have remained largely unchanged for hundreds of millions, even billions, of years. If something works in biology there seems to be little need for it to change. The impetus of life toward intelligence over evolutionary time is, at best, a hypothesis.</p><p>In short, any assumptions about properties like intelligence or agency that we make based on what we currently know about life on Earth are on exceedingly shaky ground. To import those assumptions to quantitative analyses of the likelihood of civilizations elsewhere seems like a stretch in most cases. Although there is value to the intellectual exercise as preparation for when the time comes that we, perhaps, have more data to go by.</p><p>And perhaps too there is value to anything that, in the days and nights of the coming months, causes us to momentarily pause and think about the bigger picture. To find a little respite by contemplating the endlessly tumbling stories of societies and civilizations as they unfold across cosmic time.</p> <p><i>Caleb Scharf is an astrophysicist, the Director of Astrobiology at Columbia University in New York, and a founder of yhousenyc.org, an institute that studies human and machine consciousness.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
                    
                    <p>Previous: Part 9 - <a href="https://techplanet.today/post/machine-learning-foundations-part-9-using-the-sequencing-apis" rel="nofollow noopener">Using the Sequencing APIs</a></p>
<p>Over the last few parts, we haven't done much machine learning. Instead, we looked at how you can preprocess text data to get it ready for training machine learning models. In this part, you're going to put that knowledge to use in training a text classifier, a model, which, when given a piece of text, will understand the contents of that text.</p>
<p>You'll be working with the Sarcasm in News Headlines data set by Rishabh Misra, which is available on his website <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/rmisra/news-headlines-dataset-for-sarcasm-detection/home" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">here</a>. This is a really fun data set, which collects news headlines from normal news sources, as well as some more comedic ones from spoof news sites.</p>
<p>The data set is a JSON file with three columns. The <code>is_sarcastic</code> one is 1 if the record is sarcastic. Otherwise, it's 0. The <code>headline</code> is the headline of the article, and the <code>article_link</code> is a URL to the text of the article. We're just going to deal with the headlines here. So we have a super easy data set to work with. The headline is our feature, and the <code>is_sarcastic</code> is our label.</p>
<p>The data in JSON looks a bit like this.</p>
<pre>{
    "article_link": "https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/versace-black-code_us_5861fbefe4b0de3a08f600d5",
    "headline": "former versace store clerk sues over secret 'black code' for minority shoppers",
    "is_sarcastic": 0
}</pre>
<p>Each entry is a JSON field with the name-value pairs showing the column and associated data.</p>
<p>Here's the code to load it in Python when it's structured like that.</p>
<pre>import json

with open("sarcasm.json", 'r') as f:
    datastore = json.load(f)<br>
sentences = [] 
labels = []
urls = []
for item in datastore:
    sentences.append(item['headline'])
    labels.append(item['is_sarcastic'])
    urls.append(item['article_link'])</pre>
<p>I'll go through this piece by piece. First, we'll <code>import json</code> so that we can use the json parsers in Python. Then we'll open the <code>sarcasm.json</code> file.&nbsp; Using <code>json.load()</code>, we can load and parse the entire thing. I'll initialize arrays for the sentences, labels, and URLs. And I can now simply iterate through the datastore. And, for each item, I can append its headline, the sarcasm label, and URL to the appropriate array.</p>
<p>And that's it for loading the data. In previous parts, you may recall that we had hard-coded sentences into an array of strings. We now have exactly the same data structure for the headline sentences, despite that there are now over 25,000 of them. So, for the next code, despite us using this real data set, it will look very familiar. So let's dive in.</p>
<p>So here's the code to tokenize and sequence the sarcasm data set.</p>
<pre>from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text import Tokenizer
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.sequence import pad_sequences
tokenizer = Tokenizer(oov_token="")
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences)
word_index = tokenizer.word_index<br>
print(len(word_index))
print(word_index)<br>
sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences)
padded = pad_sequences(sequences, padding='post')<br>
print(padded[0])
print(padded.shape)</pre>
<p>We create a tokenizer and fit it on the sentences. In this case, the sentences are the large array of 25,000-plus sentences that we read from the sarcasm data set. We can use the tokenizer to show us the <code>word_index</code> so we can see what words it learned from the data set.&nbsp;And here's an example of some of the words.</p>
<pre>... 'blowing': 4064, 'packed': 4065, 'deficit': 4066, 'essential': 4067, 'explaining': 4068, 'pollution': 4069, 'braces': 4070, 'protester': 4071, 'uncle': 4072 ...</pre>
<p>Remember from earlier that the words with the lower number tokens are the ones that are more common, and the ones with the higher numbers, was less commonly used in the data set. So, of all of the words here, hurting is the one that was found most often.</p>
<p>We can now turn all of our sentences into sequences where, instead of words, we have the tokens representing those words. We'll pad them post, which means that all of the sentences will be the length of whatever the longest one is. And anything shorter than that will be padded with zeros at the end of the sentences in order to keep them all the same length. If we want to inspect them, we can then print out one of them, and we can print out the shape of the entire padded data structure. You'll see output like this.</p>
<pre>[  308 15115   679  3337  2298    48   382  2576 15116     6  2577  8434
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0     0
     0     0     0     0]<p>(26709, 40)</p></pre>
<p>This is the first sentence in our corpus after tokenizing and padding. It's a shorter sentence. So it ends with a bunch of zeros. And this is the shape of the data structure for the padding. This tells us that we have 26,709 padded sentences, and each of these is 40 values long.</p>
<p>With just a few lines of code, you've loaded the data from sarcasm into sentence arrays, tokenized, and padded them.</p>
<p>First, in the code, you'll see a number of commonly used variables. Each of these will be used throughout the code. You've seen many of them so far, but others, like the embedding dimension, will be clear later. The <code>training_size</code> of 20,000 will be used next.</p>
<pre>vocab_size = 10000
embedding_dim = 16
max_length = 100
trunc_type='post'
padding_type='post'
oov_tok = ""
training_size = 20000</pre>
<p>We have a corpus of many thousands of sentences and labels. And, moments ago, we specified 20,000 as the <code>training_size</code>. So that many sentences and labels will be the training set. And we'll hold back the other 6,000 or so as a validation set.</p>
<p>So our <code>training_sentences</code> will be the complete corpus from 0 to the <code>training_size</code>. And our <code>testing_sentences</code> will be from the <code>training_size</code> to the end of the set. We can do similar with the labels. The training will be the first batch, and the testing will be the last ones.</p>
<pre>training_sentences = sentences[0:training_size]
testing_sentences = sentences[training_size:]
training_labels = labels[0:training_size]
testing_labels = labels[training_size:]</pre>
<p>As we've split the data into training and testing sets, we should do the same for the padded sets, instead of having that one large master one that we had earlier on.</p>
<pre>tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=vocab_size, oov_token=oov_tok)
tokenizer.fit_on_texts(training_sentences)

word_index = tokenizer.word_index

training_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(training_sentences)
training_padded = pad_sequences(training_sequences, maxlen=max_length, padding=padding_type, truncating=trunc_type)

testing_sequences = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(testing_sentences)
testing_padded = pad_sequences(testing_sequences, maxlen=max_length, padding=padding_type, truncating=trunc_type)</pre>
<p>First, we'll create a tokenizer, and we'll specify the number of words that we want and what the out-of-vocabulary token should be. We'll fit the tokenizer to just the training_sentence corpus. This will help us accurately reflect any real-world usage. Our testing_sentences can be tested against the vocab that was learned from the training set. Now we can create a set of <code>training_sequences</code> from just the <code>training_sentences</code>. And we can pad these to get a set of padded training sentences. And then we can just do the same thing for the <code>testing_sentences</code> and for all the labels.</p>
<p>So before we can train a model with this, let's take a look at the concept of embeddings, which help us turn the sentiment of a word into a number in much the same way as we tokenized words earlier. In this case, an embedding is a vector pointing in a direction, and we can use those directions to establish meanings in words. I know this is all very vague. So let me explain it visually.</p>
<p>For example, consider the words <strong>bad</strong> and <strong>good</strong>. Now we know they have opposite meanings. So we could draw them as arrows pointing in opposite directions.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f49f02367.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f49f02367.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="826" height="91"> We could then describe the word <strong>meh</strong> as being sort of bad, but not really that bad. So it might be an arrow like this. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f4c9ea586.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f4c9ea586.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="797" height="349">And then the phrase not bad, it's not as strong as good, but it's more or less in the same direction as good. So we could draw it with an arrow like this.<img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f501a791f.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f501a791f.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="800" height="343"> If we then plot these on a chart, we could then get coordinates for these arrows. These coordinates could then be seen as embeddings for the sentiment of those words. <img src="https://techplanet.today/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f5343248c.webp" data-src="/storage/posts/2020/06/5ef4f5343248c.webp" alt="Machine Learning Foundations: Part 10 - Using NLP to build a sarcasm classifier" width="969" height="491">There's no absolute meaning, but, relative to each other, we can establish sentiment.</p>
<p>To do this in code, we can simply use a Keras layer called an Embedding.</p>
<pre>model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=max_length),
    tf.keras.layers.GlobalAveragePooling1D(),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(24, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])
model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',optimizer='adam',metrics=['accuracy'])</pre>
<p>Our Embedding should be defined as a vector for every word. So we're going to take vocab-sized words and then specify how many dimensions we want the arrow direction to use.&nbsp; In this case, it's 16 that we created earlier. So the Embedding layer will learn 10,016 dimension vectors where the direction of the vector establishes the sentiment of the word. By matching the words to the labels, it'll have a direction that it can then start learning from.</p>
<p>Once we've defined the model, we can then train it like this.</p>
<pre>num_epochs = 30
history = model.fit(training_padded, training_labels, epochs=num_epochs, validation_data=(testing_padded, testing_labels), verbose=2)</pre>
<p>We simply specify the training_padded features and labels, as well as the validation ones.</p>
<p>Now you can try it for yourself. Here's the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoo.gle%2F3d6sIJY&amp;redir_token=ONe-_plC_prURgXQYxiQIX-HJVJ8MTU5MzE4OTQ0OEAxNTkzMTAzMDQ4&amp;event=video_description&amp;v=-8XmD2zsFBI" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">URL</a>.</p>
<p>Hopefully that was an interesting exploration for you into the beginnings of NLP with TensorFlow. And that brings us to the end of this 10-part series on foundations of machine learning. I hope you've enjoyed these series, and I hope you've been able to learn from them.</p>

<p>We had the Tamagotchi, a virtual pet that no one could ever keep alive:</p>

<p>The Furby, which still gives people nightmares today:</p>

<p>And of course, the Oregon Trail, a game that will forever define a generation:</p>

<p>But there was one fad I remember that not only took our school by storm, but schools all across the country as well. It grew so feverish that after a few months, schools had to actually ban this activity because too many students were getting obsessed with it.</p>
<p>If you were an ‘80s or ‘90s kid, chances are you’ll remember it too.</p>
<p>I’m referring to the infamous world of pogs:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165927/A04-Pogs-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>For those that didn’t get to experience this craze, I’ll briefly break it down for you.</p>
<p>Pogs were these thin, circular discs that were largely made from one of three materials: paper, aluminum, or plastic.<span title="Some kids had crazy titanium ones, but for those of us that weren’t born into extreme wealth, it wasn’t an option.">1</span> Each pog had a “face” side that had some sort of cool, colorful design on it, and a “back” side that was left blank.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165932/A05-Front-and-Back-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>The game itself was super simple, which made it ideal for 2nd graders across the world.</p>
<p>Each round, the players would contribute a few paper pogs, put them face down, and stack them up into one long cylinder. This is the “ante,” or the prize that the players are looking to win.</p>
<p>Then using a special, denser pog that was either made from aluminum or plastic (known as a “slammer” and “pounder,” respectively), each player would try to slam it on the stack, and flip over as many paper pogs as possible. Whichever pogs are successfully turned over would be the prizes they win.</p>

<p>That’s the whole game in a nutshell. Essentially, it’s slapping dense discs onto a stack of lesser dense discs, hoping to turn over as much of them as possible before the recess bell rings. Seems pretty harmless, right?</p>
<p>Well… there was one component to the game that made it a bit problematic for child psychology.</p>
<p>Before any game starts, you have to declare whether you’re playing “for fun” or “for keeps.” “For fun” means that you’re not actually keeping the pogs you turn over, and are returning them back to their original owners at the end of each match. “For keeps,” of course, means that you now own the pogs you turn over successfully, meaning that someone must lose something if another person wins.</p>
<p>Basically, a nice little gambling ring was growing amongst us starry-eyed 2nd graders.</p>

<p>Pogs originally started off as a little recess activity, but began morphing into something far greater.</p>
<p>Kids began comparing each other to how many pogs they had, and started forming groups based on the types of pogs that were owned and won. The kids with gold-plated, shiny pounders kept winning, so they needed to up the stakes and play for higher prizes. The kids that only had paper discs would be off in the sandbox being peasants.</p>
<p>Pogs became the shared currency of the school. Kids were trading their fruit rollups for slammers, their Lunchables for pounders. Kids were literally getting into fist fights over them. And of course, if you didn’t play pogs at all, you might as well be an invisible node of society. All that mattered was how many of them you had, and if you had the right equipment to win even more.</p>

<p>Eventually, the school staff saw enough crazed, disc-slamming kids in the hallways and put an end to the whole thing. They justified the ban by saying it was a form of gambling, but they probably just wanted to see things come back to normal for a bit.</p>
<p>The irony, of course, was that those adults were playing a very similar game in their own lives as well.</p>
<p>It’s interesting how money is accepted as an inevitable force in our lives, yet when we take out the concept and wrap it in unfamiliar packaging, it seems weird and dumb.</p>
<p>To the school staff, the whole pogs phenomenon probably seemed silly because they couldn’t understand what could be so compelling about flipping over paper and metal discs. But they wouldn’t think twice at the thought of coming into an office everyday, flipping over documents, and depositing a bi-weekly paper check in a metal machine.</p>
<p>In essence, the kids were doing the same thing the adults were doing: they were accumulating value in the form of a communal good. But because it took the form of something unrecognizable, it was considered dumb rather than profound. In the eyes of the adults, pogs were shittily constructed paper discs that had no intrinsic value, and only held importance because the kids themselves thought they were.</p>
<p>Well, those kids could say the same thing about the way we regard our own currency as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165955/B01-Trading-Money-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>The most fascinating thing about the pogs phenomenon is how closely it mirrors the story of money, and how that concept naturally manifested in children.</p>
<p>On one side you have paper, aluminum, and plastic discs that have no inherent value – they can’t be eaten, worn, or slept on. On their own, they’re useless.</p>
<p>On the other side you have paper bills, metal coins, and digits on a screen that can’t be used as ends in themselves either. They’re just as useless.</p>
<p>Yet in both scenarios, a united story emerged that turned an intrinsically useless thing into the distributor of status, value, and prestige.</p>
<p>How in the world does this happen?</p>
<p>How does something with no intrinsic value become the universal determinant of value? And what are the implications this has on human behavior as a whole?</p>
<p>Discussions of money usually come with the implicit understanding that money is valuable, so they revolve around how one could accumulate more of it, or why it introduces <a href="https://moretothat.com/money/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">all kinds of strange behaviors</a>. But in this post, we’re going to take one step back and actually look at the concept of money itself: why we need it to represent value, how it impacts our goals, and how it reconstructs our idea of individuality.</p>
<p>This is a dive into the philosophy of money. It’s a look into humanity’s greatest idea, its greatest paradox, and the story that forever changed human behavior.</p>
<p>Let’s begin.</p>
<h3>Money and The Great Abstraction</h3>
<p>Everything starts with the fact that money has no intrinsic value.</p>
<p>I’m going to explain why this is, but in order to do so, I need to first introduce my favorite game show ever:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10165959/C01-The-Price-Is-Right-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>The Price Is Right is a brilliant TV show where hyped-up contestants play a series of pricing estimation games. Essentially, whoever can guess the price of random shit better than the next person will find their way to a final showcase, where they can win a combination of a potted plant, a trip to Detroit, and a brand… new…. CAR!!!</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170004/C02-Freaking-Out-Over-Car-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>One of my favorite mini-games on the show was the Bonus Game, where the contestant must guess whether or not the real price of an item is higher or lower than what is displayed to the public.</p>
<p>And the best part?</p>
<p>The audience also gets to chime in and scream their opinions at the contestant, who then has to sort through a blend of aggressive commands to get to her final answer.</p>
<p>Here’s an amazing clip of the game in action:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/429124077" width="650" height="406" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>First off, Bob Barker had jokes for days.</p>
<p>But second, and more important:</p>
<p>This game is a perfect example of the discrepancy between subjective value and objective reality.</p>
<p>When people in the audience are <em>screaming</em> their opinions of what the price of an alarm clock is, what they are doing is making a <span><strong>value assessment</strong></span> about the object in question. Each person’s idea of that clock’s value is anchored to a personal experience one has with that item, and that could be based on a host of factors.</p>
<p><em>Am I using that alarm clock now? If not, how much is the one I’m currently using? Does that featured clock look like it’d be of better quality? Wait… why do I even care about this damn clock in the first place?</em></p>
<p>From the contestant’s point of view, the audience members sound like this:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170008/C03-Higher-Lower-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>But to each audience member, every shout is guided by a judgment that is formed by personal experience, desire, and need:</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170013/C04-Audience-Members-Value-Assessment-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>Throughout all this, however, the clock simply exists. It is a collection of atoms and molecules that have been assembled to take this form, and there’s no value that is inherent in its chemical makeup. The only function it has is the one we assign it. We would primarily use it to wake up in the morning, but if there was a scary cockroach nearby that we wanted to get rid of, we could use the clock as an anvil too.</p>
<p>This creates a scenario where reality simply is, but the value we assign it will vary based upon the individual that interacts with it. And as illustrated in The Price Is Right, that value is spread across <span><strong>a spectrum of infinite wants and experiences</strong></span>, where one person would be willing to give up more than her neighbor, and vice versa.</p>
<p>For any one item of reality, there will be all kinds of value assessments attached to it, none of which are expected to be the same.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170024/C05-Alarm-Clock-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>So we need to form an intermediary between reality and value that could bridge the gap between the two. A way to standardize infinite value assessments into something understandable and transferable.</p>
<p>That third-party, of course, is money.</p>
<p><a href="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge.png"><img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge.png" alt="" width="1500" height="1100" srcset="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge.png 1500w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-300x220.png 300w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-1024x751.png 1024w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-768x563.png 768w, https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/moretothat.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/10170028/C06-Money-Bridge-610x447.png 610w" sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px"></a></p>
<p>Money’s greatest achievement is its ability to standardize value across otherwise incomparable realities. For example, there’s no way I could tell you how many clocks I’d give for your car, or how many clocks I’d give for your house. But communicate those objects of desire through the language of money, and I’ll be able to calculate some relationship between the two.</p>
<p>This ability to create value relationships between every object or service is what allowed money to build a web through every corner of life. Before money, goods stood on their own because they were simply bartered for another object of desire. But after money, the value of goods were always calculated based on a third-party: some currency that was agreed upon by all the members of that society.</p>
<p>The question here then becomes: <em>how was that currency determined?</em></p>
<p>In money’s early history, it needed to have some sort of value inherent in it for people to trust it as an intermediary.</p>
<p>Its first iteration appeared in Sumer around 3,000 BC, where it manifested in the …</p></div></div>

				<p>Laura Deming is a biologist and founder of The Longevity Fund, the first VC firm to focus on companies that work on extending healthy human lifespan and addressing age-related diseases through biotechnology. She grew her roots in biology as a homeschooling student in New Zealand, and moved to the US to work in a <a href="https://hillblomcenter.ucsf.edu/#:~:text=The%20mission%20of%20the%20Hillblom,diseases%20have%20similar%20molecular%20causes.">UCSF biology lab</a> at age 12. By age 14, she was a student at MIT, then became a <a href="https://thielfellowship.org/">Thiel Fellow</a>. We asked Laura to share how her education prepared her to lead and build today.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/2020/06/Frame-2.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Frame-2.png 600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Frame-2.png 1000w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/Frame-2.png 1600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1754/2020/06/Frame-2.png 1754w"><figcaption>Laura Deming.

I normally have a few key focuses at work (right now, immune aging from a bunch of different angles), and then a billion other small ideas that float in and out of my cranium. My most persistent focus is something that I can’t talk about yet because it would sound slightly insane, but right now, I’m pursuing these more coherent questions: &nbsp;<br></p><ol><li>Is there a flywheel effect with biological tools? Will biological discoveries become the tools for next-generation discovery? How might we predict progress in biology?</li><li>Why does it normally take about a year for the best proto-entrepreneurs I know to reach full conviction about starting a company? What are ways to accelerate that process?</li><li>Is there an immortal cell that doesn’t replicate anywhere on earth? (We presumably wouldn’t see it if there was.)</li></ol><p>I’m really obsessed with <a href="http://book.bionumbers.org/">Cell Biology by the Numbers</a>. I think quantitative intuitive models of biology are the best thing ever. Also <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/video/nima-arkani-hamed-morality-fundamental-physics">this Nima Arkani-Hamed</a> video is literally the best thing ever.</p><h3 id="what-was-your-education-like">What was your education like?</h3><p>I grew up homeschooled in NZ with a hilariously small amount of context for what the real world was like. In retrospect, it was totally ideal. I had two strong memes deeply implanted in my cranium early in life - <em>I love science </em>and <em>it’s my job to do something really important </em>and<em> I can do it, too. </em>I have no clue who I’d be without those memes, and I’m also not sure that the latter was actually true! My dad just always told me that I was exceptional and could work out a way whatever I wanted to do in the world and I believed him. I still do, in a funny way, despite about a decade of evidence to the contrary and realizing how actually hard it is to make drugs for complex diseases. It’s extraordinarily sad how many otherwise brilliant kids might not do things they could because they don’t have a similarly supportive environment — I’m really excited for things like <a href="https://dcgross.com/">Daniel Gross</a>’s <a href="https://pioneer.app/">Pioneer</a> for that reason. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/2020/06/image.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/image.png 600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/image.png 1000w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/image.png 1600w, https://blog.withprimer.com/content/images/size/w2000/2020/06/image.png 2000w"><figcaption>Laura as a child, drawing DNA on the pavement outside of her house in chalk, an anecdote from a talk that she gave for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YwslKJut8eM">TedxYouth@Tallinn</a>.

And then starting to think more independently in college, and to try to figure out what problems I wanted to work on. But I had this moment around that time where a friend and I were driving to a camping site, and I was trying to explain a math concept to him, and he abruptly turned to me and said “I’m feeling very frustrated right now because you honestly have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.”<em> </em></p><p>It’s really hard to explain without context how actually useful that comment was. As he explained it, I was just parroting off the definition of something. The real way to understand things is to be able to see, explore, feel the concept from a bunch of different angles, and to be able to rigorously prove things about it. I still struggle with the latter, but having an intuition for what <em>real, deep </em>understanding of a concept looks like has been a great guidepost. For example, I realized I didn’t understand what entropy was, and now kind of do, after a summer of being in near tears with frustration about it. </p><h3 id="where-and-when-did-your-mission-to-improve-longevity-originate">Where and when did your mission to improve longevity originate?</h3><p>It’s funny, because I get asked that question a lot. I think of it like this: if you were to watch a million people jump off a bridge every day and just suffer in a really extreme way throughout all of it, How would we respond as a society? An overwhelming number of people would be inspired to take action and help. When you think of it in acute, immediate terms, viscerally shocking and moving. But with longevity and other deeply existential problems, the horror of what’s happening has been tragically normalized.</p><p>I really just wanted to work on the biggest problem possible. At first I thought that was cancer, but after a variety of experiences, aging just seemed like a bigger deal.</p><p>I have a much less antagonistic relationship with death now than I did when I was a kid. I understand more that we are a species, that there’s something beyond us as individuals — but despite that, I absolutely cannot square the idea of sobbing when a relative gets cancer and then being totally fine with another debilitating degenerative disease also caused by aging that we somehow have collectively decided is natural and normal.</p><h3 id="how-has-the-way-you-learned-as-a-kid-shaped-the-way-you-learn-and-make-decisions-at-the-helm-of-the-longevity-fund">How has the way you learned as a kid shaped the way you learn and make decisions at the helm of The Longevity Fund?</h3><p>I’ve had to un-learn a bunch of stuff I learned when I first came to the professional world. As a kid, I was deeply joyous about science. I loved it directly and with a passion, and I absolutely believed I was going to grow up to be like Michael Faraday (his story about <a href="https://artsandculture.google.com/exhibit/people-of-science-michael-faraday-the-royal-society/HQLyLIo6MWpoKw?hl=en">getting an apprenticeship with Humphrey Davy</a> is amazing, by the way). When I entered the world of finance with my fund, I was totally scared to seem like I didn’t know what I was doing, and I felt like it was really important to hide who I was to seem more ‘adult’. Now, in retrospect, I think that was both understandable and a bit of a mistake.</p><p>One thing I learned as a kid that I keep on forgetting so easily is how not to care about what anyone else thinks (with a few close exceptions). It’s funny - even in Silicon Valley, hypothetically the vanguard of independent thought, I feel like that’s extremely hard to do. In part, because what other people think constrains your access to resources. So it’s an interesting balance. </p><h3 id="i-ve-heard-you-talk-about-your-dad-telling-you-at-12-years-old-to-make-sure-that-everyone-was-a-little-bit-happier-because-you-were-in-the-lab-each-day-what-role-did-your-parents-play-in-your-life-and-education">I’ve heard you talk about your dad telling you at 12 years old to make sure that everyone was a little bit happier because you were in the lab each day. What role did your parents play in your life and education?</h3><p>Oh, man. My Dad had so much good advice as a kid — I really felt like I got a cheat code to life early on. It was like being Ben Franklin’s daughter or something. I’m probably exaggerating, but it felt that way. </p><p>One thing he told me was ‘action comes before motivation’ - that’s always been an incredibly powerful thing in my life. He taught me a lot about putting your head down and working hard and not believing anyone who tells you you are great, having that come mostly from your own self-judgment. Being extremely humble around people who know more, finding any way on earth to help them. </p><p>My dad also taught me a lot about humor and how ridiculous the world was in so many different ways. Almost too much - I think I take things more seriously now. But it’s kind of the Mark Twain effect - the world and everyone in it is a hilarious, self-sabotaging, foolhardy place that is also one of the most deeply joyous and interesting things going on in the galaxy. He used to say you can either look at what’s going on in the world and cry or laugh. Why not pick the latter?</p><p>My mom taught me about kindness and empathy and wanting to help others. She’s probably the most giving person I know. </p><p>When I first met Cynthia Kenyon, who literally changed my and many other lives – she’s amazing – I had this very extreme mental conceit that I would beg her to scrub floors in her lab and somehow work my way up on the academic ladder. I was 12. She very kindly offered for me to just work in her lab as a normal intern, which was so kind in retrospect. It changed my life, to be taken seriously like that at a young age. </p><h3 id="i-love-how-you-describe-the-way-the-longevity-fund-removes-limits-on-who-can-participate-in-biomedical-entrepreneurship-how-can-we-translate-some-of-what-you-ve-learned-about-diverse-participation-in-science-to-the-way-that-kids-learn">I love how you describe the way The Longevity Fund removes limits on who can participate in biomedical entrepreneurship. How can we translate some of what you’ve learned about diverse participation in science to the way that kids learn?</h3><p>I think there’s something about being absolutely delighted when you meet someone who doesn’t know something. That feeling is the best thing in the world because <em>you get to be the first person to tell them about some incredibly cool natural phenomenon</em>. That’s pretty great. I still remember being a preteen in Cynthia’s lab when Marc McCormick described how SVMs (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine">Support Vector Machines</a>) worked for handwriting recognition in the postal system. He was just so good at explaining things, and that really stuck. Encourage people to own ideas, be skeptical of them, and learn to delight in poking holes in things.<br></p><p>When thinking about diverse participation, it’s funny – before I came to the Valley, I had absolutely no idea that being a girl was in any way a handicap. To me, it was an obvious advantage – in a sea of people who all looked the same way, I’d stick out like a sore thumb! If I could make it, wouldn’t I obviously be an amazing role model? Being in the valley for a while, it kind of wore off, and the more articles I read about how much it sucked to be a girl in science, the more I believed it. I’m not sure what to think about all of that, really. </p><h3 id="what-s-something-you-believe-that-most-people-don-t">What’s something you believe that most people don’t?</h3><p>I can give you a few!</p><ol><li>That we will see the first drug to measurably affect <a href="https://publichealth.wustl.edu/heatlhspan-is-more-important-than-lifespan-so-why-dont-more-people-know-about-it/">human healthspan</a> tested in the next decade, and that this is one of the biggest deals in how we thinking about disease.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
        <p>Note: This is an old post originally from the documentation of the <a href="https://github.com/ollef/sixten">Sixten</a> programming language, that I've touched up and fleshed out. After the time that it was written I've found out about <a href="https://github.com/salsa-rs/salsa">Salsa</a>, a Rust library with very similar goals to my Rock library, which is definitely worth checking out as well!</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Compilers are no longer just black boxes that take a bunch of source files and produce assembly code. We expect them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Be incremental, meaning that if we recompile a project after having made a few changes we only recompile what is affected by the changes.</li>
<li>Provide editor tooling, e.g. through a <a href="https://langserver.org/">language server</a>, supporting functionality like going to definition, finding the type of the expression at a specific location, and showing error messages on the fly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is what Anders Hejlsberg talks about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wSdV1M7n4gQ">his video on modern compiler construction</a> that some of you might have seen.</p>
<p>In this post I will cover how this is achieved in <a href="https://github.com/ollef/sixten">Sixten</a> by building the compiler around a query system.</p>
<p>For those of you that don't know, Sixten is an experimental functional programming language created to give the programmer more control over memory layout and boxing than most other high-level languages do. The most recent development of Sixten is being done in the <a href="https://github.com/ollef/sixty">Sixty</a> repository, and is completely query-based. Here's a little video giving a taste of what its language server can do, showing type-based completions:</p>

<h2 id="traditional-pipeline-based-compiler-architectures">Traditional pipeline-based compiler architectures</h2>
<p>A traditional compiler pipeline might look a bit like this:</p>
<div id="cb1"><pre><code><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1"></a>+-----------+            +-----+                +--------+               +--------+</span>

<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3"></a>|source text|---parse---&gt;| AST |---typecheck-+-&gt;|core AST|---generate---&gt;|assembly|</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4"></a>|           |            |     |       ^        |        |               |        |</span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5"></a>+-----------+            +-----+       |        +--------+               +---------</span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6"></a>                                       |</span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7"></a>                                 read and write</span>
<span id="cb1-8"><a href="#cb1-8"></a>                                     types</span>
<span id="cb1-9"><a href="#cb1-9"></a>                                       |</span>
<span id="cb1-10"><a href="#cb1-10"></a>                                       v</span>
<span id="cb1-11"><a href="#cb1-11"></a>                                  +----------+</span>
<span id="cb1-12"><a href="#cb1-12"></a>                                  |          |</span>
<span id="cb1-13"><a href="#cb1-13"></a>                                  |type table|</span>
<span id="cb1-14"><a href="#cb1-14"></a>                                  |          |</span>
<span id="cb1-15"><a href="#cb1-15"></a>                                  +----------+</span></code></pre></div>
<p>There are many variations, and often more steps and intermediate representations than in the illustration, but the idea stays the same:</p>
<p>We push source text down a pipeline and run a fixed set of transformations until we finally output assembly code or some other target language. Along the way we often need to read and update some state. For example, we might update a type table during type checking so we can later look up the type of entities that the code refers to.</p>
<p>Traditional compiler pipelines are probably quite familiar to many of us, but how query-based compilers should be architected might not be as well-known. Here I will describe one way to do it.</p>
<h2 id="going-from-pipeline-to-queries">Going from pipeline to queries</h2>
<p>What does it take to get the type of a qualified name, such as <code>"Data.List.map"</code>? In a pipeline-based architecture we would just look it up in the type table. With queries, we have to think differently. Instead of relying on having updated some piece of state, we do it as if it was done from scratch.</p>
<p>As a first iteration, we do it <em>completely</em> from scratch. It might look a little bit like this:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1"></a><span>fetchType ::</span> <span>QualifiedName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2"></a>fetchType (<span>QualifiedName</span> moduleName name) <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3"></a>  fileName <span>&lt;-</span> moduleFileName moduleName</span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4"></a>  sourceCode <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> fileName</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><a href="#cb2-5"></a>  parsedModule <span>&lt;-</span> parseModule sourceCode</span>
<span id="cb2-6"><a href="#cb2-6"></a>  resolvedModule <span>&lt;-</span> resolveNames parsedModule</span>
<span id="cb2-7"><a href="#cb2-7"></a>  <span>let</span> definition <span>=</span> <span>lookup</span> name resolvedModule</span>
<span id="cb2-8"><a href="#cb2-8"></a>  inferDefinitionType definition</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We first find out what file the name comes from, which might be <code>Data/List.vix</code> for <code>Data.List</code>, then read the contents of the file, parse it, perhaps we do name resolution to find out what the names in the code refer to given what is imported, and last we look up the name-resolved definition and type check it, returning its type.</p>
<p>All this for just for getting the type of an identifier? It seems ridiculous because looking up the type of a name is something we'll do loads of times during the type checking of a module. Luckily we're not done yet.</p>
<p>Let's first refactor the code into smaller functions:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><a href="#cb3-1"></a><span>fetchParsedModule ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>ParsedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><a href="#cb3-2"></a>fetchParsedModule moduleName <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><a href="#cb3-3"></a>  fileName <span>&lt;-</span> moduleFileName moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-4"><a href="#cb3-4"></a>  sourceCode <span>&lt;-</span> <span>readFile</span> fileName</span>
<span id="cb3-5"><a href="#cb3-5"></a>  parseModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-6"><a href="#cb3-6"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-7"><a href="#cb3-7"></a><span>fetchResolvedModule ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>ResolvedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8"><a href="#cb3-8"></a>fetchResolvedModule moduleName <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-9"><a href="#cb3-9"></a>  parsedModule <span>&lt;-</span> fetchParsedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-10"><a href="#cb3-10"></a>  resolveNames parsedModule</span>
<span id="cb3-11"><a href="#cb3-11"></a></span>
<span id="cb3-12"><a href="#cb3-12"></a><span>fetchType ::</span> <span>QualifiedName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> <span>Type</span></span>
<span id="cb3-13"><a href="#cb3-13"></a>fetchType (<span>QualifiedName</span> moduleName name) <span>=</span> <span>do</span></span>
<span id="cb3-14"><a href="#cb3-14"></a>  resolvedModule <span>&lt;-</span> fetchResolvedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb3-15"><a href="#cb3-15"></a>  <span>let</span> definition <span>=</span> <span>lookup</span> name resolvedModule</span>

<p>Note that each of the functions do everything from scratch on their own, i.e. they're each doing a (longer and longer) prefix of the work you'd do in a pipeline. I've found this to be a common pattern in my query-based compilers.</p>
<p>One way to make this efficient would be to add a memoisation layer around each function. That way, we do some expensive work the first time we invoke a function with a specific argument, but subsequent calls are cheap as they can return the cached result.</p>
<p>This is essentially what we'll do, but we won't use a separate cache per function, but instead have a central cache, indexed by the query. This functionality is provided by <a href="https://github.com/ollef/rock">Rock</a>, a library that packages up some functionality for creating query-based compilers.</p>
<h2 id="the-rock-library">The Rock library</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/ollef/rock">Rock</a> is an experimental library heavily inspired by <a href="https://github.com/ndmitchell/shake">Shake</a> and the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/build-systems-la-carte/">Build systems à la carte paper</a>. It essentially implements a build system framework, like <code>make</code>.</p>
<p>Build systems have a lot in common with modern compilers since we want them to be incremental, i.e. to take advantage of previous build results when building anew with few changes. But there's also a difference: Most build systems don't care about the <em>types</em> of their queries since they work at the level of files and file systems.</p>
<p><em>Build systems à la carte</em> is closer to what we want. There the user writes a bunch of computations, <em>tasks</em>, choosing a suitable type for keys and a type for values. The tasks are formulated assuming they're run in an environment where there is a function <code>fetch</code> of type <code>Key -&gt; Task Value</code>, where <code>Task</code> is a type for describing build system rules, that can be used to fetch the value of a dependency with a specific key. In our above example, the key type might look like this:</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><a href="#cb4-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Key</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2"><a href="#cb4-2"></a>  <span>=</span> <span>ParsedModuleKey</span> <span>ModuleName</span></span>
<span id="cb4-3"><a href="#cb4-3"></a>  <span>|</span> <span>ResolvedModuleKey</span> <span>ModuleName</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4"><a href="#cb4-4"></a>  <span>|</span> <span>TypeKey</span> <span>QualifiedName</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The build system has control over what code runs when we do a <code>fetch</code>, so by varying that it can do fine-grained dependency tracking, memoisation, and incremental updates.</p>
<p><em>Build systems à la carte</em> is also about exploring what kind of build systems we get when we vary what <code>Task</code> is allowed to do, e.g. if it's a <code>Monad</code> or <code>Applicative</code>. In Rock, we're not exploring <em>that</em>, so our <code>Task</code> is a thin layer on top of <code>IO</code>.</p>
<p>A problem that pops up now, however, is that there's no satisfactory type for <code>Value</code>. We want <code>fetch (ParsedModuleKey "Data.List")</code> to return a <code>ParsedModule</code>, while <code>fetch (TypeKey "Data.List.map")</code> should return something of type <code>Type</code>.</p>
<h3 id="indexed-queries">Indexed queries</h3>
<p>Rock allows us to index the key type by the return type of the query. The <code>Key</code> type in our running example becomes the following <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_algebraic_data_type">GADT</a>:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><a href="#cb5-1"></a><span>data</span> <span>Key</span> a <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><a href="#cb5-2"></a>  <span>ParsedModuleKey</span><span> ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Key</span> <span>ParsedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb5-3"><a href="#cb5-3"></a>  <span>ResolvedModuleKey</span><span> ::</span> <span>ModuleName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Key</span> <span>ResolvedModule</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4"><a href="#cb5-4"></a>  <span>TypeKey</span><span> ::</span> <span>QualifiedName</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Key</span> <span>Type</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>fetch</code> function gets the type <code>forall a. Key a -&gt; Task a</code>, so we get a <code>ParsedModule</code> when we run <code>fetch (ParsedModuleKey "Data.List")</code>, like we wanted, because the return type depends on the key we use.</p>
<p>Now that we know what <code>fetch</code> should look like, it's also worth revealing what the <code>Task</code> type looks like in Rock, more concretely. As mentioned, it's a thin layer around <code>IO</code>, providing a way to <code>fetch</code> <code>key</code>s (like <code>Key</code> above):</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><a href="#cb6-1"></a><span>newtype</span> <span>Task</span> key a <span>=</span> <span>Task</span> {<span> unTask ::</span> <span>ReaderT</span> (<span>Fetch</span> key) <span>IO</span> a }</span>
<span id="cb6-2"><a href="#cb6-2"></a><span>newtype</span> <span>Fetch</span> key <span>=</span> <span>Fetch</span> (<span>forall</span> a<span>.</span> key a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>IO</span> a)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The rules of our compiler, i.e. its "Makefile", then becomes the following function, reusing the functions from above:</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><a href="#cb7-1"></a><span>rules ::</span> <span>Key</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Task</span> a</span>
<span id="cb7-2"><a href="#cb7-2"></a>rules key <span>=</span> <span>case</span> key <span>of</span></span>
<span id="cb7-3"><a href="#cb7-3"></a>  <span>ParsedModuleKey</span> moduleName <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-4"><a href="#cb7-4"></a>    fetchParsedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb7-5"><a href="#cb7-5"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><a href="#cb7-6"></a>  <span>ResolvedModuleKey</span> moduleName <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-7"><a href="#cb7-7"></a>    fetchResolvedModule moduleName</span>
<span id="cb7-8"><a href="#cb7-8"></a></span>
<span id="cb7-9"><a href="#cb7-9"></a>  <span>TypeKey</span> qualifiedName <span>-&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb7-10"><a href="#cb7-10"></a>    fetchType qualifiedName</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="caching">Caching</h3>
<p>The most basic way to run a <code>Task</code> in Rock is to directly call the <code>rules</code> function when a <code>Task</code> fetches a key. This results in an inefficient build system that recomputes every query from scratch.</p>
<p>But the <code>Rock</code> library lets us layer more functionality onto our <code>rules</code> function, and one thing that we can add is memoisation. If we do that Rock caches the result of each fetched key by storing the key-value pairs of already performed fetches in a <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/dependent-hashmap">dependent hashmap</a>. This way, we perform each query at most once during a single run of the compiler.</p>
<h3 id="verifying-dependencies-and-reusing-state">Verifying dependencies and reusing state</h3>
<p>Another kind of functionality that can be layered onto the <code>rules</code> function is incremental updates. When it's used, Rock keeps track of what dependencies a task used when it was executed (much like Shake) in a table, i.e. what keys it fetched and what the values were. Using this information it's able to determine when it's safe to reuse the cache <em>from a previous run of the compiler</em> even though there might be changes in other parts of the dependency graph.</p>
<p>This fine-grained dependency tracking also allows reusing the cache when a dependency of a task changes in a way that has no effect. For example, whitespace changes might trigger a re-parse, but since the AST is the same, the cache can be reused in queries that depend on the …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As startups become viral, we see MVP and Beta versions everywhere. However, a lot of founders misuse these terms. Some even use them as synonyms. In this article, we will explain what MVP and Beta are and also the differences between them. Let's start with MVP:</p><h2>Minimum Viable Product</h2><p>Minimum Viable Product, (MVP) is often misused by a lot of people. To be clear,&nbsp;<strong>MVP is not a prototype, not a beta version, but rather an experiment</strong>&nbsp;designed to test your value proposition’s assumptions by measuring behavior and learning from the results. For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy9nSnalvPc">this video</a>&nbsp;of Dropbox is their MVP. It is a banal video that lasts 3 minutes. But it is a video that was made for early adopters of Dropbox. It is clear what it does, its features, and its benefits for the early adopters. At the time there was no service like Dropbox so founders wanted to test if there is an audience that faces the same problem so they, hopefully, sell it to them. After this video, there was a crowd waiting for Dropbox to launch so the video worked well for founders to understand if there is a demand for their product. The experiment was successful. Another great example is&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991127151543/http://www.zappos.com/">Zappos' MVP from 1999</a>. Their MVP was a simple landing page where you can understand that Zappos is an online shoe store and their unique selling point is being the world's largest shoe store. With this landing page, they experiment to validate their idea. They posted their landing page on websites that are relevant to online shopping and bought some ads. After all, they validated the idea: There was an audience that wants to buy shoes online!</p><p><img src="https://tractific.com/res/images/5eea4454a93dd3d3b38982db_1.png" alt="MVP Presentation"><span>From Drew Houston's presentation on their MVP.</span></p><h3>Key takeaway:</h3><ul><li>MVP is an experiment designed to validate your idea.</li><li>MVP can be in a lot of forms like a landing page or a video.</li><li>MVP must explain what does the product does and who is the product for.</li></ul><h2>Beta</h2><p>On the other hand, the beta version is launched after the idea is validated and an amount of contact is collected. Beta is no longer an experiment, it is a product with fewer features. You can launch beta after collecting emails of potential customers with your MVP version. What you should focus on beta are feedbacks and feature requests you receive from beta users. To use the power of word-of-mouth, you should treat your beta users as royalty. You should contact them often and ask them about their experience.</p><h3>An example of the beta process:</h3><ul><li>project planning</li><li>participant recruitment</li><li>product distribution</li><li>collecting feedback</li><li>analyzing feedback</li><li>drawing a conclusion</li></ul><p>After completing a cycle of this process you should go back and start the next cycle until you are sure about your beta and ready to launch the full version.</p><h2>Differences</h2><h3>Nature of the product</h3><p>In MVP you are possibly not building even a version of the product, but in beta, you are coming out with a product version based on your learning/ insights until then.</p><h3>Goals</h3><p>In MVP your goal is to validate your idea and to decide whether to develop the product or not. In the beta version, your goal is to collect feedback and add features.</p><h3>Target group</h3><p>In MVP your target group is early adopters who, have a pain point that you can solve. In the beta version, your target group is beta testers, who can find bugs and next features</p><h3>Minimalism</h3><p>A lot of entrepreneurs wait until they develop the best to launch their MVP. However, this approach is against the nature of the MVP. Your MVP should only validate the idea, whereas your beta version should have features that can keep your potential customers in your product long enough to find bugs and give feedback.</p><p><img src="https://tractific.com/res/images/5eea4454a93dd3d3b38982db_2.png" alt="MVP vs Beta Pyramid"></p><h2>TL; DR,</h2><p>MVP and beta are two different things. They cannot be used as synonyms. MVP is an experiment to validate an idea, whereas the beta version is to collect feedback before launch. Knowing the difference and using them appropriately will help you communicate the product roadmap better with team members and early users.</p><p><em>Stay Optimized!</em></p></div><p>Join early Tractific users getting product updates, blog posts, and free access to beta.</p></div>]]>

For this release, we upgraded real-time shadows, implemented 3 new shader nodes recently introduced in Blender, added and improved some puzzles such as for muting/unmuting videos and selecting the active camera, extended the functionality of the performance tools, enabled auto-merging and backuping HTML/CSS/JS files when updating apps, further expanded the User Manual, and made many other feature and stability  improvements the full list if of which you can find below. Enjoy!</p><h2>Shadows</h2><p>Various types of shadows are offered in Blender settings. Selecting between these types allows you to trade off between quality and performance.</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/shadow-filtering-modes-blender.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>In total 6 modes are available. Some of which were implemented earlier and some are new:</p><ul><li><strong>Basic</strong>: unfiltered pixelated shadows (fastest).</li><li><strong>Bilinear</strong>: slightly smoothed pixels.</li><li><strong>PCF</strong>: stands for Percentage Closer Filtering. Uses multiple shadow map lookups for smoothing.</li><li><strong>PCF (Bilinear)</strong>: additionally uses bilinear interpolation for each lookup.</li><li><strong>PCF (Poisson Disk)</strong>: this was made the default setting because it corresponds the most to what you see in the 3D editor viewport. It uses pseudo random Poisson disk lookups to eliminate shadow pixelation.</li><li><strong>ESM</strong>: stands for Exponential Shadow Maps. Shadows are smoothest but light leaks are possible. Use ESM Bias setting on lamps to remove light leaks artefacts.</li></ul><p>PCF (Poisson Disk) and ESM techniques offer best quality at the expense of mediocre performance.</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/esm-shadows-blender.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/esm-shadows-blender.jpg 819w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/esm-shadows-blender-300x138.jpg 300w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/esm-shadows-blender-768x354.jpg 768w, https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/esm-shadows-blender-600x277.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 819px) 100vw, 819px"></figure></div><p>In addition, we improved the quality shadows by reducing artifacts as a result of better shadow volume calculations. Particularly, most shadow artifacts in ESM mode were removed.</p><p>Finally, the documentation on shadows has been significantly expanded and updated. This chapter now includes&nbsp;<strong>Troubleshooting</strong>&nbsp;information to help you get rid of shadow artifacts such as on the image below. See it <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/docs/manual/en/blender/Shadows.html#troubleshooting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/self-shadow-artefacts.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><h2>Blender Nodes</h2><p>Normal maps now correctly work with gltf-compliant materials.</p><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/new-nodes-blender.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>Blender’s newly introduced&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/input/vertex_color.html" target="_blank">Vertex Color</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/input/tangent.html" target="_blank">Tangent</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/render/shader_nodes/vector/vector_rotate.html" target="_blank">Vector Rotate</a>&nbsp;nodes are now supported by Verge3D including all their switches.</p><h2>Puzzles</h2><p>The&nbsp;<strong>mute</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>unmute</strong>&nbsp;puzzles are available for sound and video. Particularly, you can use these puzzles to auto-play videos without direct user action (muted videos can be auto-played).</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/mute-unmute-sound-video-puzzles.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>Zero is now used in the&nbsp;<strong>number</strong>&nbsp;puzzle by default.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>disable rendering / anti-alias</strong>&nbsp;puzzle no longer causes annotations to jitter. Also this puzzle now works faster, and the anti-alias checkbox is enabled by default.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>when moved</strong>&nbsp;puzzle is now more responsive thanks to under-the-hood overhauling and optimizations. The&nbsp;<strong>period</strong>&nbsp;parameter was removed from this puzzle, and the&nbsp;<strong>delta</strong> parameter was replaced by&nbsp;<strong>velocity</strong>&nbsp;(measured in units per second).</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/when-moved-puzzle.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><p>The new&nbsp;<strong>active camera</strong>&nbsp;puzzle will help in cases when you switch between cameras.</p><div><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/active-camera-puzzle.jpg" alt=""></figure></div><h2>Performance Profiling Tools</h2><p>The performance profiling puzzle now displays more information. Particularly, the dimensions of textures and render targets are displayed in sorted order to help you identify the largest textures and focus on their optimization. Also the information about lighting and shadows is shown, as well as the information about the pixel ratio, and all post-processing passes used in the scene.</p><p>It is now possible to print the performance profile without any puzzle by quickly pressing key P 3 times (that is P P P).</p><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/fps-counter.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>An FPS counter can now be shown with JavaScript API method&nbsp;<strong>showFPS()</strong>&nbsp;and hidden with&nbsp;<strong>hideFPS()</strong>. The FPS counter can also be revealed through hotkeys F F F.</p><h2>Installation</h2><p>Unicode is now supported by the installer. This particularly allows you to install Verge3D in a folder named with non-Latin characters.</p><p>The default name for the installation folder changed from simply&nbsp;<strong>verge3d</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>verge3d_blender</strong>. So you no longer need to type a different name when you install different versions on the same computer. Be sure to update your scripts etc for the new path.</p><h2>Updating and Backups</h2><p>The App Manager will now try to automatically merge your changes made in HTML/CSS/JS files if there are any changes in the application templates. To do so, it uses an algorithm found in <strong>git</strong> and other version control systems. If merging is not possible, the algorithm falls back to the old behavior, simply overriding the application files.</p><figure><img src="https://www.soft8soft.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/app_updater.jpg" alt=""></figure><p>This merging/overriding mechanism is now enabled by default, yet can be turned off in the update dialog window. All HTML/CSS/JS files of stock Verge3D demos have been updated using this feature.</p><p>To prevent possible loss of data in the case you changed the default HTML/CSS/JS files but auto-merging has failed, backups will be made during updating by copying files to&nbsp;<strong>your_app/v3d_app_data/update_backup</strong>&nbsp;folder.</p><p>Also the Puzzles editor’s backups were moved in this folder, i.e.:&nbsp;<strong>your_app/v3d_app_data/puzzles_backup</strong>.</p><p><strong>Warning</strong>: the merging feature will start working from the second app update. For the first time it will work in the “overwrite” mode (backups will still be made).</p><h2>Other Features</h2><p>We added the “Swiss Army Knife” application, which our&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMnTV0uuRMhRH6p4DSW-AEcQZEulzm461" target="_blank">new YouTube tutorial series</a>&nbsp;is based on, to Verge3D distribution.</p><figure><p> <iframe title="Verge3D for Blender Basics" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLMnTV0uuRMhRH6p4DSW-AEcQZEulzm461" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><p>The AR demos&nbsp;<strong>Augmented Reality</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Industrial Robot</strong>&nbsp;now work properly in&nbsp;<a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/webxr-viewer/id1295998056" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mozilla WebXR</a>&nbsp;browser on iOS.</p><p>The ECMAScript6 version of the Verge3D runtime (<strong>v3d.module.js</strong>, available only to Enterprise users) now works properly with all Verge3D scenes.</p><p>You  can now work on 32-bit Windows with Verge3D.</p><p>Annotations (if any) are no longer displayed by the Puzzles editor after the viewport window is closed.</p><p>Shader compilation callbacks can now be added to the&nbsp;<code>App.compileCallbacks</code>&nbsp;array (similarly to&nbsp;<code>App.renderCallbacks</code>). It is recommended to enable post-processing or add fog inside these functions (one callback per loaded scene). See the usage example <a href="https://www.soft8soft.com/docs/api/en/extras/App.html#compileCallbacks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p><p>The <a href="https://github.com/Soft8Soft/verge3d-blender-addon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub</a> version of Verge3D add-on now works again.</p><h2>Bug Fixes</h2><p>We fixed a bug related to JavaScript being generated in incorrect order from multiple Puzzles editor tabs.</p><p>We fixed the crash “too many attributes” when morph targets are combined with skinning in the same object.</p><p>We fixed the issue related to the export of glTF-compliant materials from the engine (using the methods of JavaScript class&nbsp;<strong>GLTFExporter</strong>).</p><h2>Documentation</h2><p>New chapter&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.soft8soft.com/docs/manual/en/introduction/Performance-Bottlenecks.html" target="_blank">Spotting</a> <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.soft8soft.com/docs/manual/en/introduction/Performance-Bottlenecks.html" target="_blank">Performance Bottlenecks</a>&nbsp;is available in the User Manual.

  <article>
    <p>This article is going to explore using <a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston">winston</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch">Elasticsearch</a> to do
“structured logging” in Node.js.  The basic idea is that we want to write logs
with some metadata attached to them, beyond just a timestamp, a level, and a message.</p>

<p>The traditional “twelve factors” approach to logging is just to write your logs
to stdout, and let some extrenal process deal with logging.  For example, you
might use fluentd to read stdout on all your processes and write the results
into Elasticsearch.  This works well, and it works across different projects
written in different languages.  But, with a little extra work, we can write
some extra information into those logs.</p>

<p>For example, for every request we could write the URL of the request to the log
as <code>request.url</code>, and then write the response time in milliseconds as
<code>response.responseTime</code>, and now it’s a simple mater to generate an
Elasticsearch graph showing our average and max response time to HTTP requests,
or even to write a query which finds the top ten slowest routes in our system.
Or we could write a <code>user</code> field to the log on every request, so we can figure
out which users in our system are most active.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="structured-logging-with-winston">Structured logging with Winston</h2>

<p>We’re going to use winston as the heart of our logging engine.  Firsts, let’s
play around a little with winston so you can get a quick idea of what we can do:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>winston</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>winston</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>logger</span> <span>=</span> <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>createLogger</span><span>();</span>

<span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>info</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>Hello world!</span><span>'</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And if you try running this, you’ll get:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>[</span>winston] Attempt to write logs with no transports <span>{</span><span>"level"</span>:<span>"info"</span>,<span>"message"</span>:<span>"Hello world!"</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Ok, that didn’t go so well.  What’s all this about transports?</p>

<p>Basically, you can think of winston as a stream; you write logs into it, and it
streams out log events to one or more “transports”.  In fact, Transport
<a href="https://github.com/winstonjs/winston-transport/blob/master/index.d.ts#L11">just extends <code>stream.Writable</code></a>.
Let’s add a console transport so we can see logs on stdout:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>winston</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>winston</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>logger</span> <span>=</span> <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>createLogger</span><span>({</span>
    <span>transports</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>transports</span><span>.</span><span>Console</span><span>({}),</span>
    <span>]</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>info</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>Hello world!</span><span>'</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now we get:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>{</span><span>"level"</span>:<span>"info"</span>,<span>"message"</span>:<span>"Hello world!"</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is a little bit better, but we’re still looking at a raw JSON event.  In
additon to “transports”, winston has this concept called a “format”.  You can add
a format (or multiple formats via <code>winston.format.combine()</code>) to a transport.
Each format will receive a copy of each event before it’s passed to the transport,
and can modify fields, or even add or remove fields.  Let’s add some formats
to our logger to print out pretty messages to the console:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>winston</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>winston</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>debugFormat</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>winston-format-debug</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
<span>const</span> <span>logger</span> <span>=</span> <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>createLogger</span><span>({</span>
    <span>transports</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>new</span> <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>transports</span><span>.</span><span>Console</span><span>({</span>
            <span>format</span><span>:</span> <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>.</span><span>combine</span><span>(</span>
                <span>winston</span><span>.</span><span>format</span><span>.</span><span>colorize</span><span>({</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>true</span> <span>}),</span>
                <span>debugFormat</span><span>({</span>
                    <span>colorizeMessage</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span> <span>// Already colored by `winston.format.colorize`.</span>
                <span>})</span>
            <span>)</span>
        <span>}),</span>
    <span>]</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>info</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>Hello world!</span><span>'</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you run this, you’ll get:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Jun 24 14:27:38 node[94522] INFO:    Hello world!
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>So now we have something “human readable”.</p>

<p>We’ve already seen that we can add a “message” and a “level” to a log event.
What else can we add? It turns out we can add whatever we like. If we try:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>info</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>Hello world!</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>test</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>This is a test</span><span>'</span><span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This will output:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Jun 24 14:29:18 node[94522] ERROR:   Hello world!
    <span>test</span>: <span>"This is a test"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can add any literally any fields we want here. It’s up to the format and the
transport to decide what to do with those fields.  Formats can also modify fields.
You could write, for example a <a href="https://github.com/jwalton/node-jwalton-logger/blob/master/src/logging/format/prefixFormat.ts">format to prefix all the “tags” in an event onto “message”</a>
to show them in stdout, or a <a href="https://github.com/jwalton/node-jwalton-logger/blob/master/src/logging/format/requestFormat.ts">format to replace a <code>request</code> object with a pretty-printed string</a>.</p>

<h2 id="from-winston-to-elasticsearch">From Winston to Elasticsearch</h2>

<p>To get our logs out to elasticsearch, we need to do a few things.  First, we
need to decide exactly what fields we want to store in elasticsearch, and write
a template for our index.  This helps Elasticsearch figure out what type each
value in our log entry is.  Also we set <code>number_of_shards: 1</code> here - these are
just logs, so there’s no real need to duplicate these across multiple shards or
replicas.  Also, Elasticsearch generates an index for every field in every message,
so we want to limit what we send to Elasticsearch to something “well defined” to
stop our memory usage from spiraling out of control.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// elasticsearchTemplate.ts</span>

<p>Finally we can create an elasticsearch transport to add to our logger, to
actually get our logs to elasticsearch.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>LogData</span><span>,</span> <span>ElasticsearchTransport</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>winston-elasticsearch</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>elasticsearchTemplate</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>./elasticsearchTemplate</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>esFormat</span> <span>from</span> <span>'</span><span>./format/esFormat</span><span>'</span><span>;</span>

<span>// Set ELASTICSEARCH_URLS to a list of URLs to connect to, e.g. "http://elasticsearch:9200".</span>
<span>const</span> <span>{</span> <span>ELASTICSEARCH_URLS</span> <span>}</span> <span>=</span> <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>env</span><span>;</span>

<span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>ELASTICSEARCH_URLS</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>// winston-elasticsearch automatically moves a bunch of the log data into</span>
    <span>// a field called "meta".  This undoes this and moves it all back...</span>
    <span>function</span> <span>esTransformer</span><span>({</span> <span>message</span><span>,</span> <span>level</span><span>,</span> <span>timestamp</span><span>,</span> <span>meta</span> <span>}:</span> <span>LogData</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>{</span> <span>message</span><span>,</span> <span>level</span><span>,</span> <span>timestamp</span><span>,</span> <span>...</span><span>meta</span> <span>};</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>const</span> <span>esTransport</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>ElasticsearchTransport</span><span>({</span>
        <span>transformer</span><span>:</span> <span>esTransformer</span><span>,</span>
        <span>clientOpts</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>nodes</span> <span>}</span> <span>as</span> <span>any</span><span>,</span>

        <span>format</span><span>:</span> <span>esFormat</span><span>(),</span>
    <span>});</span>

    <span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>esTransport</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And now anything we log will be automatically sent to elasticsearch, in full
structured glory.</p>

<h2 id="caveats">Caveats</h2>

<p>One thing be aware of with this approach.  Notice if you do something like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>error</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>Ohs noes!</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span><span>});</span>
<span>process</span><span>.</span><span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here there’s no chance for the elasticsearch transport to send a network request
to elasticsearch before you <code>process.exit(1)</code>, so your error log is not going
to go anywhere.  You can get around this by using the <code>callback</code> form of <code>logger.log</code>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>logger</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>({</span><span>level</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>error</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>message</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>Ohs noes!</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>err</span><span>},</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>process</span><span>.</span><span>exit</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>But, also, if your node.js process crashes beacuse of an uncaught
exception or because it runs out of memory, it will print an …</p></article></div></div></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
<p>The first time I used <a href="https://asgi.readthedocs.io/">ASGI</a>(<em>Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface</em>) was through <a href="https://github.com/django/channels">Channels</a> 1.0 when ASGI spec was still a draft. It was my first interview project which helped me get my current job at <a href="https://fellow.app/">Fellow</a>. It felt magical at that time how easy it is to add WebSocket functionality to my Django app and handles authentication and other Django related things for me seamlessly.</p>

<p>ASGI specification is now at version 3 at the time of writing and both ASGI and Channels became part of Django Software Foundation. Compared to the draft version, it has matured a lot with added lifecycle calls and better application format, etc. Most excitingly, a healthy and fast-growing community is forming and we are seeing more and more ASGI servers running in production environments. At my company, we are serving a few million requests per day through ASGI running on <a href="https://github.com/django/daphne">Daphne</a>, Netflix’s <a href="https://netflixtechblog.com/introducing-dispatch-da4b8a2a8072">Dispatch</a> is based on <a href="https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/">FastAPI</a>, a popular ASGI web application framework, and apparently, Microsoft is <a href="https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/26">using it</a> too.</p>

<p>I would humbly advise anyone building web services in Python to learn about ASGI. And the best way to learn something is to built things with it, so in this blog post, I’ll walk through the steps to build a micro web application framework that speaks ASGI. I hope it can help explain how ASGI works.</p>


<p>Before writing the first line of code, we need to have a basic understanding of what ASGI is and what we are building towards.</p>
<h2 id="how-asgi-works">How ASGI works</h2>
<p>Here’s a simple diagram showing how ASGI works at a high level.</p>
<pre><code>graph TD
	A[Client] --&gt;|HTTP, WebSocket, ...| B(ASGI Server)
	B --&gt; |scope, send, receive| C(ASGI application)
</code></pre>
<p>To put it in simple words, A browser(client), establishes a connection to ASGI server with a certain type of request (HTTP or WebSocket), the ASGI server then calls ASGI  application with information about the connection, encapsulated in a python dictionary called <code>scope</code>, and two callbacks, named <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code>, that the application can use to send and receive messages between server and client.</p>

<p>Here’s an example HTTP request scope</p>

<p>You might notice that <code>scope</code> is not too different from a WSGI <code>environ</code>. In fact, ASGI interface is very similar to WSGI interface, but instead of getting a <code>environ</code> and <code>start_response</code> to send headers and using the return value of WSGI application as the response body, ASGI interfaces with the connection and allows us to receive and send messages multiple times during the lifecycle of the connection <strong>asynchronously</strong> until the connection is closed.  This allows a nice interface for both WebSocket and HTTP.</p>

<p>It’s also totally possible to wrap a WSGI application inside an ASGI application, just prepare a WSGI <code>environ</code> and <code>start_response</code> based on <code>scope</code>, <code>receive</code>, and <code>send</code> then call the WSGI application and it would work. If you delegate that call into a thread pool or something similar, you just made your WSGI application asynchronous. This is roughly how Channels wraps around Django.</p>

<h2 id="define-asgi-framework">Define ASGI framework</h2>
<p>When I say ASGI framework I refer it as a framework that makes building ASGI application easier and this does not include the ASGI server part. I’m mentioning this because some of the earlier Python asynchronous web frameworks have their own server implementation that also takes over tasks such as parsing  HTTP requests, handles network connections, etc. We are not doing those in ASGI web framework. As a spiritual successor to WSGI, where web servers, such as Gunicorn and uwsgi, and web frameworks, such as Flask and Django, are separated, ASGI has this separation too.</p>

<p>So, what does an ASGI application look like?</p>

<h3 id="asgi-hello-world">ASGI Hello World</h3>
<p>A simple ASGI hello world application can be written as:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>async</span> <span>def</span> <span>application</span><span>(</span><span>scope</span><span>,</span> <span>receive</span><span>,</span> <span>send</span><span>):</span>
    <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>scope</span><span>[</span><span>"path"</span><span>].</span><span>split</span><span>(</span><span>"/"</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>)[</span><span>-</span><span>1</span><span>]</span> <span>or</span> <span>"world"</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>send</span><span>(</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http.response.start"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"status"</span><span>:</span> <span>200</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"headers"</span><span>:</span> <span>[[</span><span>b"content-type"</span><span>,</span> <span>b"text/plain"</span><span>],],</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>)</span>
    <span>await</span> <span>send</span><span>(</span>
        <span>{</span>
            <span>"type"</span><span>:</span> <span>"http.response.body"</span><span>,</span>
            <span>"body"</span><span>:</span> <span>f"Hello, </span><span>{</span><span>name</span><span>}</span><span>!"</span><span>.</span><span>encode</span><span>(),</span>
            <span>"more_body"</span><span>:</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p><code>http.response.start</code> starts an HTTP response sending status code and response headers. In this example, it responds with the 200 OK status code and  has <code>content-type</code> set to <code>text/plain</code> in the headers.  <code>http.response.body</code> sends the response body, the <code>more_body</code> key tells the server if the response is finished. ASGI server might use this to know if a connection should be closed or automatically decide between a <code>content-length</code> header or a chunked encoding.</p>

<p>We can run the application with <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/">uvicorn</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>uvicorn asgi-hello:application
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>And you should be able to visit <code>http://localhost:8000/</code> and get <code>Hello, world</code>.Visiting <code>http://localhost:8000/tom</code> would get you <code>Hello, tom</code>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>By the way, uvicorn is pretty fast, a simple benchmark with <code>wrk -d10s http://localhost:8000/hi</code> on a 2018 lowest spec MacBook Air yields <code>Requests/sec:  27857.87</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Although this approach works with a simple hello world example, it’s not exactly convenient to write a more complex application this way. For one, it doesn’t do routing, if you want to respond differently for different paths, you’ll probably end up with a huge  <code>if ... else if ... else</code> clause. Secondly, having to write the ASGI message every time in the form of a python dict is quite arduous. Third, in a complex application, it gets harder to track the status of the connection, such as is the response started, is the response ended, should I start the response here, etc.</p>

<h3 id="goal">Goal</h3>
<p>With the new framework, I hope to be able to write an ASGI application like this:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>asyncio</span>
<span>from</span> <span>aaf</span> <span>import</span> <span>aaf</span> <span># Another ASGI framework
</span><span>from</span> <span>aaf.routing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Router</span>

<span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>aaf</span><span>([</span><span>router</span><span>])</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>I hope this snippet of how I want the framework to look like is self-explanatory. But here are some of the key things I want to achieve:</p>
<ol>
  <li>It should be able to handle HTTP response declaratively and imperatively.</li>
  <li>It should support Flask style routing with parameter parsing.</li>
</ol>


<h2 id="connection-class">Connection class</h2>
<p>The <code>Connection</code> class will represent an ASGI HTTP or WebSocket connection. It’s a class that encapsulates the three basic elements in ASGI, namely <code>scope</code>, <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code>, and expose some convenient methods and properties so that users don’t need to verbosely write out all the ASGI messages and parse everything, such as cookies and headers, from <code>scope</code>. But it should allow users to access the original <code>scope</code>, <code>send</code> and <code>receive</code> when they want to, so that the composability of ASGI applications is maintained. For example, it should allow user to delegate certain <code>connection</code>s to another ASGI application by calling <code>another_asgi_app(connection.scope, connectionn.asgi_send, connection.asgi_receive)</code>.</p>

<p>Here’s a simple implementation of the <code>Connection</code> class.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>from</span> <span>enum</span> <span>import</span> <span>Enum</span>

        <blockquote><p>Test-driven development was supposed to eliminate the need for independent testing. Alas, it doesn’t go far enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>Test-driven development (TDD) earned a reputation of making software more robust. Does that mean you can fire all the testers? Spoiler: No.</p>
<p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestDrivenDevelopment.html" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Test-driven development</a> is a method for writing software in small chunks. You start with a test, then write functional code to make the test pass, and finally refactor the functional code to clean it up. The idea of TDD was proposed by <a href="https://amzn.to/3doabIA" target="blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kent Beck</a> in the early 1990s, as part of Extreme Programming, an Agile software development methodology.</p>
<p>TDD is sometimes summarized as “Red, Green, Refactor.” The interfaces on many testing harnesses, such as JUnit (for Java) and NUnit (for .NET), show red lights when tests fail and green lights when tests pass. There’s another step to consider, however. You need to think about the desired behavior and carve out a small chunk of code – typically five lines – to implement next.</p>
<p>As proposed by Beck, in TDD you never write functional code until you have a failing test. Yet, it takes practice to learn to write the tests first (rather than after the fact); developers often have trouble shifting their habitual way of working. Writing the tests before the functional code just feels <em>wrong.</em> You do get used to it, though it may take months; by then it starts feeling <em>right</em>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/what-is-test-driven-development-tdd/">biggest benefit of TDD</a> is that it removes the fear of breaking your code. As you add unit tests and functional code, you also build <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/dont-fail-your-next-interview-know-what-differentiates-regression-testing-from-retesting/">a library of regression tests</a> that you run frequently. When you add a new feature, fix a bug, or refactor to clean up your code, running the tests again reassures you that you didn’t break anything. Or at least it confirms that you didn’t break any of the tests that <em>you</em> wrote.</p>
<h3>What do testers bring to the table?</h3>
<p>Software managers are sometimes tempted to eliminate or reduce software QA departments when the coders adopt TDD, on the grounds that the programmers are also writing tests. That decision usually is a mistake, because <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/five-must-have-skills-to-look-for-in-a-qa-tester/">testers provide value</a> outside of the developers’ unit tests.</p>
<p>Unit tests are only one of the kinds of tests needed to adequately cover modern code. TDD developers rarely write end-to-end integration tests. They may avoid writing unit tests that require significant setup or that rely on other software components, such as a populated database.</p>
<p>Dedicated testers are more likely than coders to take the time to perform exploratory (ad-hoc) testing, which can find bugs that weren’t imagined during the development of the code. Testers also come to the product with fresh eyes compared to the coders who have been immersed in the software for long hours.</p>
<p>Additionally, software developers often are not interested in setting up CI/CD tooling or in organizing the team’s tests into a master regression test. Testers consider all of that to be part of the job. Developers may not be involved in implementing shift left testing beyond TDD. &nbsp;For shift left testing, testers can gather information, help with requirements management, and help to define the acceptance criteria, before a single test or line of functional code is complete.</p>
<h3>What bugs do testers find that TDD doesn’t?</h3>
<p>Security is one large, important testing area that isn’t normally addressed by writing unit tests. Testers look for security flaws with automated vulnerability testing tools, manual security assessments, penetration tests, security audits, and security reviews.</p>
<p>It’s difficult for developers to write <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/the-challenges-of-testing-guis/">unit tests to test GUIs</a>. Instead, testers use automation tools specific to the supported application environments, such as browsers, desktop applications, and mobile apps.</p>
<p>Developers can have a hard time with hardware-dependent bugs, as the dominant way of working is for a coder to work on a single machine. QA departments often collect rooms full of varied computers and devices, as well as images of many operating system versions. An alternative way of testing on many different model devices is to use a crowd-sourced testing service.</p>
<p>While TDD can theoretically catch bugs in edge cases, they are called “edge cases” for a good reason. When a coder designs the tests for a function point, obscure edge cases may escape notice in the heat of the moment. Testers are more likely to find these than are the coders who wrote the software.</p>
<p>Similarly, cross-module flaws can sometimes escape scrutiny in unit tests. They can easily arise when one programmer misunderstands the interface or boundary conditions of another programmer’s module. Cross-module bugs are often found during end-to-end testing and ad-hoc testing.</p>
<p>In summary, while there’s a lot to be said for TDD as a development practice, it doesn’t usually provide complete test coverage of your code. For that, you still need testers.</p>
<blockquote><p>Whoever writes the test cases, it makes sense to follow established guidelines. <a href="https://www.functionize.com/project/best-practices-for-effective-test-case-writing/">These</a> might help.</p></blockquote>

					<p><em>Based on my lecture at Topos House, San Francisco on February 29, 2020.</em></p>
<p>Not all fields of knowledge exist yet. If you tried to study biochemistry in 1820, you’d have a lot of trouble: the field had yet to cohere. Do we think that all the biochemistries of the world have been discovered? If we did back then, we’d be wrong. For those seeking a safe career, sticking to the established fields is probably the right move. But for those interested in pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge, it will sometimes be better to work in a field that has not yet cohered, or in a field on the cusp of crystallizing. Often the best intellectual opportunities — if you want to be a breakthrough researcher — and the largest economic opportunities — if you want to build a great company — are going to be precisely in those areas about to crystallize into a new field.</p>
<p>If you went into biochemistry when biochemistry was emerging, your name might be in a textbook today. You didn’t have to be brilliant; you just had to pick your problem well. The greatest difficulty would be in figuring out who to learn from. Before you figure out where and how to learn, you have to decide <a href="http://samoburja.com/on-the-loss-and-preservation-of-knowledge/">who has the knowledge</a> you seek. When the field of biochemistry was on the cusp of crystallizing, for example, you would have looked to experts in the fields of biology and chemistry. But as an outsider, who are you to evaluate the quality of a field? Just because a field claims to exist, doesn’t mean it exists.</p>
<h3>Evaluating Existing Fields</h3>
<p>One thing you can do is look at how a field performs on its own criteria. Take the replication crisis in academic psychology for example. In academic science, replicability has been one of the gold standards both for internal bureaucratic targets and also for the layman’s understanding of the philosophy of science. Philosophy of science might not seem very important, but it is key to figuring out how we know what we know, and what is good science as opposed to bad science. There is, in fact, no consensus philosophy of science, which means that there is no canonical science of science.</p>
<p>But surely scientists must know how science works? Well, scientists might know how science works in the way that birds know how aerodynamics works. They know it, but not at all on a conscious level — they just fly. Even if birds could speak, their answers might be quite useless, even to baby birds. Their knowledge is not formatted for scientific understanding; it remains locked away as a type of <a href="http://samoburja.com/intellectual-dark-matter/">intellectual dark matter</a>. If you are deciding whether to enter a field in which you are not yet an expert, you need a more precise epistemic foundation than a bird’s intuition, especially when deciding where expertise truly resides.</p>
<p>A thought experiment: say you had five experimental planes in front of you. How do you decide which one to board? Is it the wooden one, the bamboo one, the steel one, the large one with smoke-puffing engines, or the modest one made by the bicycle shop owners? The Wright brothers were bicycle shop owners, and they built a janky-looking machine. Plenty of the other early flying machines looked vastly more impressive than theirs, but they didn’t fly. In the case of deciding which of these early flying machines to board, relying on institutional claims to epistemic authority would not work—not even the ones made by Harvard professors could fly.</p>
<p>When making such decisions, you cannot assume that the members of prestigious institutions of your society are experts simply because they claim to be experts. They would claim to be experts whether they were or weren’t! In any period of human history, if you examine how institutions portray their own expertise, they always portray themselves as tremendously knowledgeable with impeccable foundations. In the rare cases where they do admit to not knowing something they propose it to be either unknowable or, to be knowable—but only if you give them more funding. The Catholic Church would claim this when it came to metaphysics and the question of salvation. Today, the Church of Scientology claims that Scientology is at the productive frontier of psychology, that they’ve disproven psychiatry, and that they have these cutting-edge, electronic brain-measuring devices. And so would a university cognitive science department.</p>
<p>We all make choices using dumb heuristics, but importantly, they are often good enough for everyday life. If you choose to study history at Oxford because the buildings look old, you’ll likely do pretty well. Rules of thumb such as “Are the buildings old?” can have a valid core. The heuristic isn’t a bad one for the prospective historian to use: old buildings often come with libraries well-stocked with old books. But does this heuristic hold in other cases?</p>
<p>Say you are deciding between Harvard and MIT for studying astrophysics, and you view Harvard as the better pick. Why do you believe this? Is it because Harvard has older-looking buildings? We can imagine that some prospective astrophysicists, too, are swayed by Harvard’s historic appearance. Much of academia, in fact, functions on such <a href="http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/51/2/CargoCult.htm">cargo cult</a> heuristics. Maybe one <i>should</i> study astrophysics at Harvard, rather than MIT. But if this is so, then it’s right by accident: the “old buildings” heuristic doesn’t apply to astrophysics. It is thus a mistake to rely on it—a broken clock is right for two moments a day, and wrong in all others. Your life has many important moments.</p>
<p>Because there is no consensus philosophy of science—no science of science—if you want to go into a more established field, you have to rely either on institutions, or your own evaluation of individual researchers. What you must do, then, is form your own judgments of the claims to intellectual authority made by particular institutions, or the quality of thinking of possibly exceptional individuals. But what if you want to go into a less established field?</p>
<h3>Communities of Practice</h3>
<p>For those considering entering a new field, there are several ways to acquire deep expertise. Firstly, there is the <a href="https://wenger-trayner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/07-Brief-introduction-to-communities-of-practice.pdf">community of practice</a>—imagine a hobbyist society or hacktivist collective, for example. People gravitate towards these communities chiefly for friendship and community, and proceed to enthuse together over their community’s mechanism of practice, channeling this shared energy into competition for status, acceptance, and love. Thus, communities of practice tend to have a social pressure towards excellence. This often makes joining one one of the best ways to acquire knowledge.</p>
<p>History is full of examples of communities of practice, from the circles of philosophers of Ancient Greece, to the guilds of medieval Europe, to Meetup.com. The Royal Society was originally a group of bored 17th century British aristocrats who wanted to stay far away from politics in the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B005KLSWDQ/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1">aftermath of the English Civil war</a> to pursue knowledge of nature together. One can imagine them <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabinet_of_curiosities">showing off</a> their fanciful etchings and astronomical instruments, or one-upping each other with exotic mineral samples brought from far-flung corners of the globe. A side effect of this competition was science: we learned things about geology, astronomy, entomology, and so on. Thanks to this, Charles Darwin had access to a dataset describing the taxonomy and habitats of insects and plants from all over the world, which provided much of the evidence for his theories of natural selection. Were that prior work not done, Darwin’s theories would have been mere conjecture, difficult to establish as authoritative contributions to our understanding of the mechanisms of nature.</p>
<p>So seek out communities of practice; find out who is excited by what you want to learn. This community may or may not be very well-connected, but above all it should be relatively narrowly focused on the practice of some activity that its members constantly relate to. Without this focus, the community won’t have highly-trained internal heuristics—better heuristics than the age of buildings!—to identify who really knows what they’re talking about.</p>
<p>Communities of practice are not perfect, but you can almost always rely on them in some way. Some of them may be fraudulent or confused, but you’re certainly better off joining one than attempting to be a pure individualist. There are likely entire communities out there centered on what you wish to study. Find them. Think about who would have the socioeconomic leisure to run such a community, and what they’d call themselves. Maybe you will find them at a university among college students, maybe on the internet. Perhaps you will find them among the modern equivalent of bored aristocrats—angel investors, perhaps. Smart, bored rich people will always find a hobby. It’s only a question of what that hobby is—is it what you’re searching for?</p>
<h3>Master-Apprentice Relationships</h3>
<p>Aside from communities of practice, another indispensable mechanism of transferring deep expertise is the master-apprentice relationship. In medieval European guilds, the master-apprentice relationship formed a strong contract. Instead of owing $90,000 of student debt and receiving a diploma, you instead would sign yourself up for service to a particular master for around seven or eight years. And at the end, they would essentially grant you their business. Their retirement plan would be <i>you</i>. Can you imagine how different your relationship with your doctoral advisor would be if you personally constituted their retirement plan? Their incentives would be much better aligned, to say the least.</p>
<p>A weaker, non-economic version of the<a href="https://youtu.be/ribdRDO75Rk"> master-apprentice relationship</a> does still apply for professors and thinkers who care about their legacy. And if a field has clearly identifiable experts, it is extremely valuable to work with the best person you can, in the hopes of forming a relationship with them. You should approach them and offer to proofread their papers, or even offer to make their coffee. Getting to work with them for a few hours a day …</p></div></div></div>

<p>Today’s guest on the EdTech Startup Show is Mike Teng.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mike Teng is the CEO and co-founder of Swing Education, a tech-enabled marketplace business that matches substitute teachers with schools in need. He was a software engineer in the private sector and then the tech director at a K-12 charter school network. He and two of his friends who are now co-founders saw the need for fill rates of substitute teachers in districts and decided to start Swing education.</p>



<p>Swing Education helps schools and districts find and schedule substitute teachers. They have also recently added tutoring with the same teachers in their classrooms. &nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>During this episode, Mike and I discuss:</strong></h2>



<ul><li>How Mike saw a problem with fill rates of substitute teachers with his co-founders who convinced him to leave his nonprofit work to start Swing Education.</li><li>He explains the challenges they went through getting their software out there and how they navigated the pricing model.&nbsp;</li><li>The cultural value in education organizations that makes decision making consensus-driven and leads to inefficiency when it comes to sales.&nbsp;</li><li>He explains how they are trying to capture and utilize the on-demand teachers workforce that exists.&nbsp;</li><li>How they convince school districts to buy into their program throughout the 50 states.</li><li>How tutoring has worked for them as an addition to their existing business in a highly competitive space.</li><li>How to implement investments correctly as a new founder by making the right decision.</li><li>How empathy learned in parenting translates to good leadership.</li><li>He explains how to eliminate time spent making phone calls without sacrificing good relationships in a business.</li><li>Mike encourages people to learn more about the Black Lives Matter social justice movement.&nbsp;</li></ul>

<p>When you encounter new information but have yet to form a belief about it, what’s the immediate response? Do you hold it up in your mental spotlight and subject it to a critical analysis? Do you suspend your belief until you’ve either confirmed or denied it?</p>



<p>We have <a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/the-price-of-attention/">limited time and mental resources</a> to properly evaluate everything that impinges on our mind. We don’t stop to <a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/trust-the-internet/">fact-check every headline</a> that passes us by on social media, or every claim made by certain news outlets, or each idea presented in a book.</p>



<p>What happens to those things that we encounter but don’t critically analyse? Research suggests that they can slip by into our truth baskets. Once there, they can persist rather stubbornly.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/the-ethics-of-belief/">Believing</a>, it turns out, is the easy part. The second step is where things get tricky.</p>



<h2>The Library of Belief</h2>



<p>Rene Descartes wrote, <em>“All that the intellect does is to enable me to perceive, without affirming or denying anything, the ideas which are subjects for possible judgments.”</em></p>



<p>To Descartes, the mind is supposed to hold ideas up to be examined, to keep them in limbo until a <a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/betting-on-an-uncertain-future/">decision</a> about their accuracy is made.</p>



<p>Baruch Spinoza had a different idea. He thought that by perceiving or comprehending something we implicitly believe it first, and only through an extra step can we disconfirm it.</p>



<p>William James, writing of Spinoza’s position, said, <em>“All propositions, whether attributive or existential, are believed through the very fact of being conceived.”</em></p>



<p>In this account, if we don’t have the time or energy to critically consider the information impinging on our mind, we’re at risk of accepting it as true. Belief is the first step, evaluation the second.</p>



<p>Psychologist <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1991-17453-001">Dan Gilbert</a> uses a library metaphor to understand the two ideas.</p>



<p>Imagine you have a library, most of the books are nonfiction, but there are a few fiction in there too. To distinguish between them, you decide to tag the spines of the books, using one of two systems.</p>



<ul><li>In Descartes’ system, you place a red tag on the fiction books and a blue tag on the nonfiction.</li><li>In Spinoza’s system, you only place a red tag on the nonfiction.</li></ul>



<p>Both systems function effectively in that you can tell apart the nonfiction and fiction books. Spinoza’s system actually saves you time from not having to label every book.</p>



<p>However, what happens when new books arrive?</p>



<ul><li>In Descartes’ system, the new book doesn’t have a label, so even if you don’t read and label it right away, it will stand out amongst all the other labelled books.</li><li>In Spinoza’s system, the new book lacks a label, just like all your nonfiction books. If you don’t examine it then and there, it appears like a nonfiction book when you look for it later.</li></ul>



<p>When new books are being fed into the library, Spinoza’s system can break down.</p>



<p>Perhaps if you are already familiar with the book, you can label it true or false right away. But unfamiliar books need to be reviewed, and what if you don’t have the time to look through them all? What if new books are coming in too quickly for you to evaluate them one by one?</p>



<p>Then some fiction books will look like nonfiction books.</p>



<p>Does the mind sort through incoming information and ideas more like Descartes or Spinoza’s systems? Gilbert ran several studies that found Spinoza’s system to be more accurate.</p>



<h2>How To Make Someone Believe Something</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://wjh-www.harvard.edu/~dtg/Gilbert%20et%20al%20(UNBELIEVING).pdf">1990 study</a>, Gilbert told participants statements such as <em>“A monishna is an armadillo,”</em> and followed that up by telling them if the statement was <a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/gut-reaction/">true or false</a>.</p>



<p>On some trials, there was a tone immediately after hearing the validity of the statement, disrupting the participants thought processes. This disruption caused them to mislabel false statements as true, <strong>but not true statements as false</strong>.</p>



<p>If information remained neutral until we have confirmed or denied it, then we either shouldn’t make these mistakes and be able to recognise ideas that haven’t been tested; or mistakes should be made in both directions—false become true, and true become false. That didn’t happen.</p>



<p>In other <a href="http://www.danielgilbert.com/Gilbert%20et%20al%20(EVERYTHING%20YOU%20READ).pdf">studies</a>, he gave participants statements about a crime. The information was clearly labelled as reliable or false based on its colour, and so was identifiable at the same time as it was read. The information either exacerbated or lessened the extent of the crime.</p>



<p>On some trials, participants had a number task to do as they tried to read the information. The added mental <a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/happiness-is-a-product-of-effort/">effort</a> caused false information to seep through as true, but didn’t cause the true information to be labelled false.</p>



<p>When asked to sentence the criminal, those who read the exacerbating false information gave sentences nearly twice as long as those who read the extenuating false information, even though they should both have been ignoring it.</p>



<p>Gilbert concludes:</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“Findings from a multitude of research literatures converge on a single point: People are credulous creatures who find it very easy to believe and very difficult to doubt. In fact, believing is so easy, and perhaps so inevitable, that it may be more like involuntary comprehension than it is like rational assessment.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>New information is <strong>believed first, refuted second</strong>. But if something disrupts that refutation, whether by taxing our mental resources or some other reluctance on our part, false information can pass by unnoticed.</p>



<p>Consider reading a book, or scrolling through social media. You’re exposed to a lot of information, and it’s unreasonable to fact check every claim or critique every idea. It’s difficult to  know what of this information might leave its mark on your memory without going through the evaluation phase.</p>



<h2><strong>First Impressions Are Lasting Impressions</strong></h2>



<p>If we accept information as true until we find a reason to discredit it, we need to be good at recognising when it’s been discredited. It raises the value of humility and a slight scepticism of our own ideas.</p>



<p>Here, too, research often finds us wanting.</p>



<p>Initial pieces of information often form the base from which we branch out and evaluate others. First impressions guide us more in our interpretations of new evidence, than new evidence guides us in evaluating our old ideas.</p>



<p>In 1946, <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1946-04654-001">Solomon Asch</a> played around with the order of lists. Take a look at these descriptions of Ben and Alan, and consider what you think of them:</p>



<ul><li>Ben: intelligent, industrious, impulsive, critical, stubborn, envious</li><li>Alan: envious, stubborn, critical, impulsive, industrious, intelligent</li></ul>



<p>You probably noticed they’re the same descriptors, yet even so, Ben came off best. The first characterisations form the basis that the latter slightly adjust.</p>



<p>Many of our social interactions work this way. We meet someone who seems grumpy on a first encounter, and assume it’s a general disposition. Even if they seem pleasant on a second encounter, it doesn’t completely nullify that first impression.</p>



<p>Now consider someone with no opinion or knowledge of a hotly debated and complex issue. First, they see some statistics and hear a brief argument, and not having anything to compare it to or any obvious reason to reject it, they let it sink into their mind—believing is the default.</p>



<p>Might that initial impression influence how willing they are to accept other arguments or interpret different statistics? They might, of course, spend the time and exert the effort to properly evaluate different claims and reject their first hypothesis.</p>



<p>But believing is easy and first impressions endearing, validation requires time and energy and an openness to being wrong that I fear makes it the less common route.</p>



<h2>Finding Support for Your Beliefs</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a> is now one of the more well-known topics in psychology. We<a href="https://www.sambrinson.com/finding-what-youre-looking-for/"> look for and readily accept</a> information that supports our ideas and beliefs.</p>



<p>Tom Gilovich <a href="https://amzn.to/2Ntl3dy">writes</a> that when we are evaluating agreeable positions, we ask ourselves <em>“<strong>can</strong> I believe this?”</em> However, when we are evaluating unagreeable positions we ask <em>“<strong>must</strong> I believe this?”</em></p>



<p>This makes us lenient towards acceptable ideas and critical of those we don’t align with. When approaching ideas you don’t agree with, you look around for any reason to invalidate it. When you find ideas you agree with, you look only for the minimal requirements.</p>



<blockquote><p><em>“By framing the question in such ways … we can often believe what we prefer to believe, and satisfy ourselves that we have an objective basis for doing so.”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Gilovich ran an <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/014616702236869">experiment</a> using different versions of the classic Wason task. In the original task, you are shown four cards, each has a number on one side and a colour on the opposite, as shown here:</p>



<figure><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Wason_selection_task_cards.svg/1200px-Wason_selection_task_cards.svg.png" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1e/Wason_selection_task_cards.svg/1200px-Wason_selection_task_cards.svg.png"></figure>



<p>The task is to pick which cards you need to flip over to prove the rule that all even numbers have red on the other side.</p>



<p>Most people look only to <strong>confirm</strong> the rule, so they turn over the 8, because it must show red on the other side. However, the orange is also necessary—if it has an even number on the other side, it would <strong>prove the rule false</strong>.</p>



<p>Only about 20% answer both the 8 and the orange card. But by changing the options slightly Gilovich had it up around 52%.</p>



<p>Instead of using numbers and colours, Gilovich used negative stereotypes. When people belonged to the stereotypical group, they looked for the information that would prove the rule false, as that would save their image of themselves.</p>



<p>Because they didn’t want to believe the rule, they asked: <em>“must I believe this?”</em> They looked for any piece of evidence that might disconfirm it. When it’s just numbers and colours, people don’t have the same incentive, they simply ask <em>“can I believe this?”</em></p>



<p>There is some rationality to this. Why investigate what already makes sense to you? Why spend time and effort evaluating information that works cohesively with your existing knowledge? <strong>Why question something unless it raises a question?</strong></p>



<p>Unfortunately, given that believing is easy and initial opinions held onto in the face of discrepant information, questioning what we …</p></div></div>

<p>In machine learning we are often trying to get some algorithm or learning system to understand abstract attributes of a data distribution of interest. In our case, seismic data from a wide variety of geologic contexts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is often the case that labels for a given task are hard to come by. Take first break picking in seismic data: given a set of geophones laid out in a line which have recorded seismic data from a source of vibration, we would like to label the first-arrival of the seismic energy for each trace.</p>
<p>Let’s take a look at a typical noisy seismic image:</p>
<p><img src="https://brantondemoss.com/writing/seismicgan/noisyseismic.png"> <em>We identify the first arrival for each seismic trace with a red dot <span></span></em></p>
<p>While we can train a neural network to estimate these arrivals when available, often no human-labeled first breaks are available, even if interesting raw seismic data is. In cases like these we still want our neural network to learn <em>something</em> from the data, even if the exact task-label is unavailable.</p>
<p>The data itself contains a wealth of geologic information which the neural network could likely extract to improve its internal representation of seismic data in general. We would like to find a way to train the neural network on the raw data without labels, and still have it learn meaningful features and representations which it could transfer to other downstream tasks like first break picking.</p>
<h2 id="autoencoders">Autoencoders</h2>
<p>This is the general idea behind autoencoders, a class of neural networks which attempt to estimate their own input, and in which the data is forced through a network with a <em>bottleneck layer</em> in the middle, such that the dimension of the bottleneck (usually denoted <span>\(\vec{z}\)</span>) is much lower than the dimension of the input data, <span>\(\vec{x}\)</span>: <span>\(\text{dim}(\vec{z}) \ll \text{dim}(\vec{x})\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="https://brantondemoss.com/writing/seismicgan/autoencoder.png"> <em>Autoencoder network diagram<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a></em></p>
<p>In its simplest form, the loss function of a vanilla autoencoder measures how well the input data matches the reconstructed image: <span>\(L(\vec{x}) = (\vec{x} - \vec{x}')^2\)</span>. By forcing the data to flow through the bottleneck layer, we force the neural network to learn an efficient encoding of the data to some <em>latent space</em>, <span>\(\vec{z}\)</span>, and an efficient decoding from the latent space back to the initial distribution. We call the portions of the network before and after the compact latent space the encoder and decoder, respectively.</p>
<p>By training an autoencoder on all of our data, even where labels are unavailable, we hope that the network learns powerful internal representations, which we can then transfer to another network trained for a particular final task. This kind of pre-training and transfer is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning">Transfer Learning</a>.</p>
<h2 id="latent-space">Latent Space</h2>
<p>Before diving in to how we’ll take advantage of transfer learning to help solve our first-break picking task, it’s interesting to discuss the concept of the latent space introduced with autoencoders.</p>
<p><img src="https://brantondemoss.com/writing/seismicgan/vibrating.gif"> <em>Vibrating strings<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a></em></p>
<p>Latent means “hidden”: in machine learning a latent space refers to a space in which dimensions represent abstract features, rather than encoding literal spatial properties. In physics, for example, one can model an arbitrary vibrating string state as a point in Hilbert Space where each dimension corresponds to an overtone of the string - Hilbert Space can be considered as a kind of latent space.</p>
<p>If we imagine training an autoencoder on images of cars perhaps its latent space would come to represent different manufacturers, so that dimension one is Honda, and dimension two is Ford, and so on. Then the decoder takes the latent space representation and produces the image which was most likely to be encoded into that latent description.</p>
<p>In a typical convolutional neural net for image classification, we can think of the final convolutional layer as the latent space - a space of learned features that are relevant to classifying our image, with the final fully connected layer approximating a <em>decision boundary in the latent space</em> for classification.</p>
<p><img src="https://brantondemoss.com/writing/seismicgan/cnnclassification.png"> <em>Typical CNN classifier network diagram<a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a></em></p>
<h2 id="gans">GANs</h2>
<p>Generative Adversarial Networks<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>, or GANs, are a kind of generative algorithm that learns to generate samples from a data distribution in a unique way. There is a Generator, <span>\(G\)</span>, and a Discriminator, <span>\(D\)</span>, each of which are usually implemented as a neural network. The Generator’s goal is to produce realistic seeming samples of the underlying distribution (this could be handwritten digits, human faces, anything…) and the Discriminator’s goal is to learn to distinguish real samples from samples generated by the Generator. By pitting the two against each other in a game, their competition drives the Generator to produce realistic samples to fool the Discriminator.</p>
<p>Formally, let <span>\(G(\vec{z})\)</span> be a sample produced by the Generator (later we will address what <span>\(\vec{z}\)</span>, <span>\(G\)</span>’s input is), and let <span>\(D(\vec{x})\)</span> be the Discriminator’s opinion about the probability that its input is a real sample, so that <span>\(D \in [0,1]\)</span>. We want <span>\(G(\vec{z}) \sim \vec{x}\)</span>. Let <span>\(E_{p(\vec{x})}\)</span> represent an expectation over a distribution <span>\(p(\vec{x})\)</span>, then the GAN loss function is:</p>
<p><span>\[
\underset{G}{\text{min}} \, \underset{D}{\text{max}} \left( E_{p(\vec{x})} \left [ \log(D(\vec{x}))\right] + E_{p(\vec{z})} \left[ \log(1-D(G(z)))\right] \right )
\]</span></p>
<p>Unpacking this, notice that <span>\(D\)</span> is trying to <em>maximize</em> the probability of true samples, while <span>\(G\)</span> is trying to <em>minimize</em> <span>\(\log(1-D(G(\vec{z})))\)</span>, which amounts to maximizing <span>\(D\)</span>’s classification error. The loss function actually encodes a zero-sum minimax game!</p>
<p>Note also that we did not specify what the input to <span>\(G\)</span> is. We feed it Gaussian noise, and as if it were the decoder in an autoencoder, we can think of its input as noise in a latent space. By carefully training <span>\(G\)</span> and <span>\(D\)</span> in turn, <span>\(G\)</span> eventually learns to produce quite realistic-seeming samples from the true distribution of data, receiving only noise as input.</p>
<p>Since the whole network is a differentiable (and therefore continuous) function with respect to its input, which we interpret as a latent space, we can take continuous walks through the latent space and watch as the generator produces continuously varying images which seem to semantically interpolate through abstract features. A popular GAN training set is human faces, so that a walk through latent space produces these unsettling GIFs:</p>
<p><img src="https://brantondemoss.com/writing/seismicgan/nvidiafacegan.gif"> <em>Continuous walk through latent space in Nvidia’s GAN<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a></em></p>
<h2 id="seismic-gan">Seismic GAN</h2>
<p>As a powerful general-purpose generative model, we can train a GAN on all kinds of seismic data without the need to worry about task-specific labels!</p>
<p>Training GANs, however, is notoriously tricky. Everyone’s experience seems somewhat different, but a <a href="https://github.com/soumith/ganhacks">whole slew</a> of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.11096.pdf#page=23">tricks</a> are known to help stabilize GAN convergence. Personally, I found Spectral Normalization<a href="#fn6" id="fnref6" role="doc-noteref"><sup>6</sup></a> and avoiding sigmoid activation in the output layer due to clipping<a href="#fn7" id="fnref7" role="doc-noteref"><sup>7</sup></a> (do BCE directly on the logits) to be the most beneficial hacks, but YMMV.</p>
<p>Finally with our trained generator and discriminator, we can transfer their learned weights to other networks for downstream task finetuning! But before that, let’s take a look at some generated samples by walking through latent space à la the face GANs. We get some beautiful generated “dreams” of seismic data:</p>

<p>Apple’s strategy for years has been to <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2013/10/23/iwork-13-a-huge-regression/">trade desktop power for cross-device feature parity</a>. As expected, <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur-preview/">macOS Big Sur</a> continues this trend, emphasizing a consistent user interface across devices, and focusing on cross-device development technologies like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/xcode/swiftui/">SwiftUI</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">Catalyst</a>.</p>

<p>Personally, I wish Apple had different priorities. I’d like to see more apps like <a href="https://www.sketch.com/">Sketch</a>, an industry-leading creative app that’s built top to bottom on Apple technologies. But Sketch was released in 2010, and Apple hasn’t created any new frameworks like <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coregraphics">Core Graphics</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/coreimage">Core Image</a> that support these kinds of apps in over a decade. So I wasn’t holding my breath for them to announce anything new for these kinds of apps at <a href="https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/">WWDC</a> this year.</p>

<p>Since Apple isn’t prioritizing powerful desktop apps with their own technologies, that means supporting these use cases mostly falls on third parties. This is where companies like <a href="https://creativecloud.adobe.com/?promoid=29NMCNT6&amp;mv=other">Adobe</a>, <a href="https://www.avid.com/">Avid</a>, <a href="https://www.maxonlift.com/">Maxon</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/">Microsoft</a> come in. While Apple’s priorities regarding their own technologies have been clear for awhile now, what hasn’t been clear is their priorities for third-party apps, in particular, ones that aren’t sandboxed. The trend for the last few years has been making it harder to develop these kinds of apps for macOS. <a href="https://www.felix-schwarz.org/blog/2018/08/new-apple-event-apis-in-macos-mojave">AEpocalypse</a> (2018), <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/07/23/annoying-catalina-security-features/">Catalina’s security features</a> (2019), and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/notarizing_macos_software_before_distribution">Notarization</a> (2018) are all examples of this trend.</p>

<p>The overarching reason behind the changes that make developing these kinds of apps harder is “Security”. And unlike cross-device feature parity, it’s unclear exactly where this all ends. Because after all, the most secure system there is is the one that doesn’t run any software at all. That’s why it’s such a pleasant surprise, that, as far as I can tell, Apple has done everything they can to make Big Sur, and the accompanying transition to <a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/">Apple Silicon</a>, as seamless as possible, even for apps that aren’t sandboxed.</p>

<p>Some were predicting that Macs on Apple Silicon wouldn’t even run apps from outside of the Mac App Store, that didn’t happen. It <a href="https://shapeof.com/archives/2020/6/educated_guesses_about_a_mac_transition_to_arm.html">seemed more likely</a> that Apple would drop <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenCL">OpenCL</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenGL">OpenGL</a>, but those are <a href="https://twitter.com/colincornaby/status/1275153748348682240">sticking along for the ride</a>. No details were known about whether there would be an emulation layer, like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_%28software%29">original Rosetta</a> from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple's_transition_to_Intel_processors">2006 Intel transition</a>, Apple appears to have gone above in beyond with <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_silicon/about_the_rosetta_translation_environment">Rosetta 2</a>, which supports plug-ins like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_Studio_Technology">VSTis</a>, giving lots of options for migration paths for powerful modular software.</p>

<p>I’m still frustrated that there probably won’t be another Sketch for the foreseeable future, but that ship sailed a long time ago. And no other platform has a Sketch either, an industry defining app that’s a platform exclusive, so while Apple has lost a unique advantage that only they had, they haven’t lost anything that other platforms already have. Other platforms can run powerful modular software that’s distributed outside the Mac App Store, but today, so can new Macs running Big Sur. Here’s to hoping that the dust has settled, and the last of the restrictions on third-party apps are behind us now.</p>

<p><span itemprop="articleBody"><p>Anyone who has written more than a hello world program should have used a debugger at some point (if you haven’t, drop what you’re doing and learn how to use one). However, although these tools are in such widespread use, there aren’t a lot of resources which tell you how they work and how to write one<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>, especially when compared to other toolchain technologies like compilers. In this post series we’ll learn what makes debuggers tick and write one for debugging Linux programs.</p>
<p>We’ll support the following features:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch, halt, and continue execution</li>
<li>Set breakpoints on
<ul>
<li>Memory addresses</li>
<li>Source code lines</li>
<li>Function entry</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Read and write registers and memory</li>
<li>Single stepping
<ul>
<li>Instruction</li>
<li>Step in</li>
<li>Step out</li>
<li>Step over</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Print current source location</li>
<li>Print backtrace</li>
<li>Print values of simple variables</li>
</ul>
<p>In the final part I’ll also outline how you could add the following to your debugger:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remote debugging</li>
<li>Shared library and dynamic loading support</li>
<li>Expression evaluation</li>
<li>Multi-threaded debugging support</li>
</ul>
<p>I’ll be focusing on C and C++ for this project, but it should work just as well with any language which compiles down to machine code and outputs standard DWARF debug information (if you don’t know what that is yet, don’t worry, this will be covered soon). Additionally, my focus will be on just getting something up and running which works most of the time, so things like robust error handling will be eschewed in favour of simplicity.</p>

<h3 id="getting-set-up">Getting set up</h3>
<p>Before we jump into things, let’s get our environment set up. I’ll be using two dependencies in this tutorial: <a href="https://github.com/antirez/linenoise">Linenoise</a> for handling our command line input, and <a href="https://github.com/TartanLlama/libelfin/tree/fbreg">libelfin</a> for parsing the debug information. You could use the more traditional libdwarf instead of libelfin, but the interface is nowhere near as nice, and libelfin also provides a mostly complete DWARF expression evaluator, which will save you a lot of time if you want to read variables. Make sure that you use the fbreg branch of my fork of libelfin, as it hacks on some extra support for reading variables on x86.</p>
<p>Once you’ve either installed these on your system, or got them building as dependencies with whatever build system you prefer, it’s time to get started. I just set them to build along with the rest of my code in my CMake files.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="launching-the-executable">Launching the executable</h3>
<p>Before we actually debug anything, we’ll need to launch the debugee program. We’ll do this with the classic fork/exec pattern.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> <span>argc</span><span>,</span> <span>char</span><span>*</span> <span>argv</span><span>[])</span> <span>{</span>

</span>        <span>//execute debugger
</span>    <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>We call <code>fork</code> and this causes our program to split into two processes. If we are in the child process, <code>fork</code> returns <code>0</code>, and if we are in the parent process, it returns the process ID of the child process.</p>
<p>If we’re in the child process, we want to replace whatever we’re currently executing with the program we want to debug.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp">   <span>ptrace</span><span>(</span><span>PTRACE_TRACEME</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>,</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>);</span>
   <span>execl</span><span>(</span><span>prog</span><span>,</span> <span>prog</span><span>,</span> <span>nullptr</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>Here we have our first encounter with <code>ptrace</code>, which is going to become our best friend when writing our debugger. <code>ptrace</code> allows us to observe and control the execution of another process by reading registers, reading memory, single stepping and more. The API is very ugly; it’s a single function which you provide with an enumerator value for what you want to do, and then some arguments which will either be used or ignored depending on which value you supply. The signature looks like this:</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>long</span> <span>ptrace</span><span>(</span><span>enum</span> <span>__ptrace_request</span> <span>request</span><span>,</span> <span>pid_t</span> <span>pid</span><span>,</span>
            <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>addr</span><span>,</span> <span>void</span> <span>*</span><span>data</span><span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
<p><code>request</code> is what we would like to do to the traced process; <code>pid</code> is the process ID of the traced process; <code>addr</code> is a memory address, which is used in some calls to designate an address in the tracee; and <code>data</code> is some request-specific resource. The return value often gives error information, so you probably want to check that in your real code; I’m just omitting it for brevity. You can have a look at the man pages for more information.</p>
<p>The request we send in the above code, <code>PTRACE_TRACEME</code>, indicates that this process should allow its parent to trace it. All of the other arguments are ignored, because API design isn’t important /s.</p>
<p>Next, we call <code>execl</code>, which is one of the many <code>exec</code> flavours. We execute the given program, passing the name of it as a command-line argument and a <code>nullptr</code> to terminate the list. You can pass any other arguments needed to execute your program here if you like.</p>
<p>After we’ve done this, we’re finished with the child process; we’ll just let it keep running until we’re finished with it.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="adding-our-debugger-loop">Adding our debugger loop</h3>
<p>Now that we’ve launched the child process, we want to be able to interact with it. For this, we’ll create a <code>debugger</code> class, give it a loop for listening to user input, and launch that from our parent fork of our <code>main</code> function.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>else</span> <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>pid</span> <span>&gt;=</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span>  <span>{</span>

<p>In our <code>run</code> function, we need to wait until the child process has finished launching, then just keep on getting input from linenoise until we get an EOF (ctrl+d).</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>debugger</span><span>::</span><span>run</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>When the traced process is launched, it will be sent a <code>SIGTRAP</code> signal, which is a trace or breakpoint trap. We can wait until this signal is sent using the <code>waitpid</code> function.</p>
<p>After we know the process is ready to be debugged, we listen for user input. The <code>linenoise</code> function takes a prompt to display and handles user input by itself. This means we get a nice command line with history and navigation commands without doing much work at all. When we get the input, we give the command to a <code>handle_command</code> function which we’ll write shortly, then we add this command to the linenoise history and free the resource.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="handling-input">Handling input</h3>
<p>Our commands will follow a similar format to gdb and lldb. To continue the program, a user will type <code>continue</code> or <code>cont</code> or even just <code>c</code>. If they want to set a breakpoint on an address, they’ll write <code>break 0xDEADBEEF</code>, where <code>0xDEADBEEF</code> is the desired address in hexadecimal format. Let’s add support for these commands.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>debugger</span><span>::</span><span>handle_command</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>line</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>We’ll add <code>continue_execution</code> to the <code>debugger</code> class.</p>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>void</span> <span>debugger</span><span>::</span><span>continue_execution</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
<p>For now our <code>continue_execution</code> function will just use <code>ptrace</code> to tell the process to continue, then <code>waitpid</code> until it’s signalled.</p>

<h3 id="finishing-up">Finishing up</h3>
<p>Now you should be able to compile some C or C++ program, run it through your debugger, see it halting on entry, and be able to continue execution from your debugger. In the next part we’ll learn how to get our debugger to set breakpoints. If you come across any issues, please let me know in the comments!</p>

<p>What you notice on social media is that people copy each other a lot. We do this in all aspects of life, but within the constraints of social media, it is especially noticeable. Most social media gives you a format to do what you want with. We naturally copy each other.</p>



<p>Social networks want you to create content and stay on the platform. You want social networks to entertain you and raise your status. These incentives are connected. The more content you create, the more likely you create entertaining content. The more entertaining content you create (or watch), the more likely you will stick around. TikTok has succeeded here. They designed a platform that creates massive amounts of entertaining content. How have they done it?</p>



<p>Unlike other platforms, the entire content creation process happens within TikTok. More importantly, they have built copying into the platform itself. By combining these two features, TikTok created a dominant position in mobile video.</p>



<h3>Making it Easy to Create Content</h3>



<blockquote><p>If you want to build a new user-generated content platform or social network then the content has to be <em>extremely</em> light. The content creation AND consumption need to happen within seconds, not minutes.</p><cite>Alex Zhu (Former Head of TikTok)</cite></blockquote>



<p>It must be easy to create content for it to be easy to copy content.</p>



<div><figure><img data-attachment-id="203" data-permalink="https://ianvanagas.com/screenshot_20200618-143004/" data-orig-file="https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png" data-orig-size="1100,2048" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="screenshot_20200618-143004" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=161" data-large-file="https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=550" src="https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=550" alt="" width="319" height="593" srcset="https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=550 550w, https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=319 319w, https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=638 638w, https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=81 81w, https://ianvanagas.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/screenshot_20200618-143004.png?w=161 161w" sizes="(max-width: 319px) 100vw, 319px"><figcaption>All the tools needed to create content are within the camera.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Video has long been a medium with two sides of production. On one side, you have unedited video for social media such as Twitter, Facebook, or Instagram. On the other, you have edited and produced as you see on YouTube and Twitch.</p>



<p>TikTok found a middle ground. It allows users to create lightly edited videos within the app. Much of the “editing” happens in reshooting. Videos are short enough that they can be reshot until it is right. Other features like timers, trimming, and effects (like green screen) are all built-in as well.</p>



<p>You don’t need anything except your phone to make content. No computer, no editing software, no fancy camera gear. Most content is shot with the front-facing camera.</p>



<p>Anyone can create content on TikTok without much effort. What you do or say is much more valuable than what your video looks like. The level of entertainment in your video isn’t driven by the quality of your editing or gear, it is driven by the quality of your content.</p>



<p>The built-in features make content creation easy, leading to large amounts of content being created, but content also has to be entertaining. Here is where TikTok innovates: they build copying into the platform itself. </p>



<h3>Building Copying into the Creation Process</h3>



<p>Creating entertaining content is hard. When you can film anything, what is entertaining? TikTok solves this by giving users templates to create entertaining content through the memes, trends, and sound on their platform.</p>

<p>Video is a powerful medium because it is information-dense. You can copy a dance or meme just by watching it. It is obvious that shorter videos are easier to copy, there are fewer variables. When on TikTok, you see memes repeated and understand the format. Future memes in that format will gain from your familiarity.</p>



<p>The creation process is tied to the viewing process. When you watch something entertaining and think “I have an idea,” it is two clicks to start filming your idea. No platform makes it easier.</p>



<p>One of the largest drivers of building familiarity is music and audio tracks. The audio provides a repeatable format for content. Similar to how memes on Reddit or Instagram use visual formats, TikTok uses audio. <strong>The difference is that Instagram and Reddit do not make making memes easy. </strong>You have to know the format, find a site to create the meme (or Photoshop it) then come back to the site and upload. When you click a sound on TikTok it shows all the videos created with that sound and provides a big button promoting creation.</p>



<blockquote><p>Musical.ly (the predecessor to TikTok) uses music as a raw material. Music is not the end product. It’s a raw material. In contrast, the end product on Spotify, Pandora, etc. is music. </p><cite>Alex Zhu</cite></blockquote>



<p>The most popular sounds have tens of thousands of videos. TikTok has made music the template. It turns out it is a very good one. We get music stuck in our head all the time, how often does a meme or image get stuck in your head? Not very often. TikTok songs have dominated the top music charts for the last 2 years (and you may have not even realized that).</p>



<p>TikTok adjusts its algorithm for you based on what you enjoy. Videos in familiar formats will show up over and over. This is possible because popular formats have lots of content in each. The combination of easy creation and copied formats leads to large amounts of personally entertaining content for you.</p>



<h3>Culture of Copying</h3>



<p>Copying people on other platforms is often looked down upon. You lose status if you copy too much. On TikTok, it is promoted, everyone does it. It is a natural assumption that you copy everyone and everyone copies you.</p>

<p>Other platforms focus on following people or accounts. TikTok focuses much more on trends and memes. If you like a video with a certain trend, you will likely see more videos from that trend in the future. Everyone’s TikTok experience consists of different videos grouped into trends and memes. That is only possible because copying creates lots of content in each trend.</p>



<p>Other platforms have accepted the idea of sharing. When you want to share someone else’s tweet, you retweet it. When you want to share someone else’s Facebook post, you share it. TikTok doesn’t allow this, which is intentional. Content on TikTok can be shared, but new content must be added on top to do it.</p>



<p>For example, TikTok has a feature called a duet which allows users to show their video next to a video already posted. Another feature allows creators to reply to comments as a standalone TikTok. You even see TikToks on top of other TikToks using the green screen feature.</p>



<p>Every feature on TikTok drives towards making more content, this turns users from passive consumers to active creators. Everyone copies, so you should too. Users that create content are always more valuable than users that only consume. TikTok does a better job at this than any other platform.</p>



<h3>The Future of TikTok and Copying Content</h3>



<p>TikTok focuses on creation rather than engagement. Other platforms assume experts and professionals create the best content. TikTok assumes that entertaining content can come from anywhere.</p>



<p>If content can come from anywhere, then everyone must have the ability to create. Expect to see platforms controlling more of the creation process and making it easier for everyone to create content. Stories is an example of this. Posts are polished, stories less so; therefore, people will post more stories.</p>



<p>TikTok makes it okay to hop on the bandwagon. They built a platform that acknowledges that new content is built from old content. Users want to copy each other, so let them. Anyone can be successful on TikTok by copying the people around them.</p>



<p>The structure of other platforms makes it difficult for them to compete. They depend on the idea that content deserves to be reshared rather than copied. Resharing isn’t copying, it isn’t creating something new. It is boosting someone else’s work. TikTok forces users to create new content whenever they want to interact with other content (trends, duets, comment replies).</p>



<p>TikTok has aligned incentives. It creates a massive amount of entertaining content in a way that no existing platform can copy. I expect it to have a dominant position in social media for many years to come.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/question-productivity-coronavirus/">COVID-19 crisis</a> has created many concerns that had to be addressed immediately; from employee health to supply chain shortages, many companies began this pandemic in a scramble.</p><p>When the dust settles, our companies may look different: businesses have fewer staff doing different kinds of product delivery in order to maintain social distancing, for instance. Companies delivering services have transitioned to working from home, and businesses are adjusting their expectations due to many increased caregiving duties for parents in their employ.</p><p>What all of this boils down to is the fact that, even when business is ramping back up in many places, there may be persistent issues of low productivity, at least compared to pre-pandemic levels of production. This in itself may feel like a cause for alarm, but recognizing the sources of low productivity during and after a crisis can be key to understanding and responding to this change.</p><h2 id="factors-causing-low-productivity">Factors Causing Low Productivity</h2><p>While no crisis is identical, there are a few different ways that productivity can be affected during this time. To focus, let's look specifically at how low productivity applies to your employees, since there are at least three different sources of low productivity, each of which requires a different response.</p><p>Many companies rely on a variety of vendors, suppliers, and outsourcing along the process for creating their goods and services. During this time, lack of productivity in any of your vendors and outsourcing creates bottlenecks for your employees. The factors you need to address on this front include creating clear communication with your employees; if they can't get the external roadblocks out of their way, they'll feel discouraged. As a company owner or upper management, it's in your best interest to <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22317168">identify these issues early</a> and work toward resolution. At the same time, set reasonable expectations with your team, since you don't want them to feel low morale over reduced productivity when they cannot change that circumstance.</p><h3 id="external-personal-life-factors">External, Personal-Life Factors</h3><p>Right now, as in other crises, many employees are splitting their time between childcare at home and working from home. This may create challenges for typical productivity, especially if your schedule is rigid to the M-F, 9-5 workday. Realistically, two-income households or single parents are going to have to care for their children during that time, and they may alternate as best they can to both do their jobs and care for their child or children.</p><p>Issues of this sort arise even when there is no crisis, such as when a child goes through a major illness that necessitates time away from work. When possible, addressing external personal-life factors in productivity should be done with compassion and empathy. A collaborative solution with someone who is usually a high performer tends to win you loyalty as an employer, so consider carefully how you address this kind of low productivity.</p><h3 id="internal-morale-driven-factors">Internal Morale-Driven Factors</h3><p>Another concerning element of low productivity comes from the upheaval of a crisis and its effect on the mental health of a worker. Being unusually distractable, fearful, or without focus is natural during a crisis, but it is a frustrating outcome when there are no other external factors preventing productivity. For typically-productive employees, this is another source of low productivity worth approaching with a spirit of experimentation. Helping your team find what will help them manage their anxieties through an Employee Assistance Program or other resource can be helpful, as can offering the option for a lower-hour workweek during this time or moving forward.</p><h2 id="addressing-low-productivity-in-a-nuanced-professional-way">Addressing Low Productivity in a Nuanced, Professional Way</h2><p>Each of these sources of low productivity merits a different response, but none of them are quite the typical "low performer" approach that you might take during business as usual. Instead, see if there is something to learn from the situation and a way to salvage the relationship with the employee. Human resources are very valuable, and returning to high productivity is possible in many cases.</p><h3 id="collaboratively-set-goals-and-make-changes">Collaboratively Set Goals and Make Changes</h3><p>When external factors are a major source of low productivity, working with your employees to create plans of action can be very empowering. Use these meetings to discuss what steps you'll put in place to overcome external supply chain issues, for instance, or what workplace flexibility will help them balance childcare with work. Making this collaborative instead of top-down helps each solution actually fit the issue that's occurring. It also builds trust and rapport.</p><h3 id="discuss-timelines-for-removing-barriers-to-productivity">Discuss Timelines for Removing Barriers to Productivity</h3><p>With internal or personal-life-related barriers to productivity, a gentle conversation about when these barriers can be removed and steps to take can be helpful. Your employees may need time to find childcare, <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6339264/">work with a therapist</a> to address causes of anxiety, or to shift their schedule such that they can take advantage of their best mental acuity. By letting them help you set the timeline for when they will have these things in place, even in a time of uncertainty, it gives you natural check-in points where you can address any persistent issues and reformulate a new plan if needed.</p><h3 id="offer-new-workplace-flexibility-in-order-to-work-toward-better-productivity">Offer New Workplace Flexibility In Order to Work Toward Better Productivity</h3><p>One of the paths to handling all forms of low productivity is to rethink rigid scheduling. Many employees may find that their home life works more smoothly with a schedule that is skewed toward late nights, weekends, or staggered work in two-hour bursts. This is a time when making these concessions may be not only a good idea, but necessary to improve productivity. If, for instance, a two-income household can stagger their work time so as to have an adult "off work" to care for their children at all times, the quality of both people's work will go up.</p><p>You also may find that switching from traditional jobs to 30 hour a week positions grants flexibility and allows your employees to work less, giving them more time to exercise, cook, care for others, and generally feel balanced. Lower stress ends up making their 30 hours very productive, leading to a per-hour productivity increase for you and your business.</p>

                    <p>Many people ask what's a Pull Request. Being straightforward, a Pull Request is the name of a GitHub feature that aims to easy the&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/everything-about-code-review-from-peer-review-to-automated-code-review">code review</a>&nbsp;process by improving its experience. Before this feature, software engineers and developers used to send patches of code by email. Patches are files containing code changes (both removed and added code) condensed in a format that developers can apply them on a codebase.</p>
                    <p>Linux development used to share patch files via email. As new tools came out, the process of development modernized itself. Some tools call it Merge Request, or Change Request. In practice, the same thing: an evolution of email threads with patches attached to it. And Linux now uses Pull Requests to develop the operational system.</p>
                    <p>The Pull Request feature is hugely influenced by open-source philosophy. That’s why it is used by modern companies to promote collaboration and a sense of community among peers.</p>

                    <h2>Roles involved in a Pull Request</h2>
                    <p>As it is a kind of peer review, the primary people involved in a Pull Request are Software Engineers or Developers. However, other roles can benefit from practice.</p>
                    <p><a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/5-responsibilities-of-a-tech-lead-and-17-metrics-to-track-their-performance">Tech Leads</a>&nbsp;should review pull requests in a less intrusive or blocking approach. By overseeing the team’s work, tech leads can understand technical deficits, or spot technical misguidance. It’s their work to keep an eye on the produced code and make sure it meets conventions and standards.</p>
                    <p>Team Leads can look at the comments for engagement and lack of specific knowledge. Besides, comments reveal how people communicate. A&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/how-to-improve-your-communication-skills-on-code-review-in-8-bullets">non-violent language</a>&nbsp;and a mentoring mindset (the one that stands for questioning and teaching instead of pointing fingers) can reflect in a more harmonious work environment.</p>
                    <p>As the hierarchy counts, sometimes engineers tend to avoid discussions or even feel uncomfortable when leaders actively take part in the review process. That’s why Engineering Managers or CTOs are not encouraged to participate, although overseeing can bring lots of benefits, including the mitigation of risks.</p>
                    <p>Non-technical roles are welcomed in the pull requests as well. UI or UX Designers, for instance, play an essential part in reducing the feedback cycle. As they can see screenshots, run the code (even test some variations if they code) in their machine, they can aggregate a lot of the process.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h2>Pull Request best practices</h2>
                    <p>The Pull Request itself has lots of best practices. They aren’t restricted to the tool, like GitHub or GitLab, but they extend to the individual, team, and technology. Plus, they can happen before, during, or after the creation of a pull request.</p>
                    <p>The best practices that come before opening a pull request intend to lessen the communication noise, making it more straightforward to review and accelerate the feedback loop. In this category,&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/what-is-a-linter-and-why-your-team-should-use-it">linters</a>&nbsp;are one of the most known and recommended.</p>
                    <p>They can analyze static code, and look for optimization, code smells, security issues, and many other checks. Depending on the language or framework, there may be a linter for specific tests. Here a brief list of&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.sourcelevel.io/engines/">some existing engines</a>.</p>
                    <p>Softwares used during the development process can have their best practices too. It’s the case of&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/7-git-best-practices-to-start-using-in-your-next-commit">git</a>.</p>
                    <p>During the review process, it’s crucial to establish a&nbsp;<a href="https://sourcelevel.io/blog/how-to-improve-your-communication-skills-on-code-review-in-8-bullets">non-violent communication</a>, as it promotes a healthy place for collaboration of all peers.</p>

                            <p>A Pull Request Checklist is never complete. The following topics are an excellent start for those that had nothing. However, it’s crucial for your team to adapt accordingly to its needs.</p>
                            <p>It’s recommended to review the items periodically, so the team can remove deprecated ones, and polish those that remain in the list.</p>
                            <p>This document organizes the checklist in three categories to better understand when to perform each action.</p>
                            <p>Following this checklist seems unpractical for the long run since every reviewer should adopt it for each pull request examined. It’s excellent for beginners, though, that are not confident or aware of what to look for in code reviews.</p>

                    <h3>Before opening the Pull Request</h3>
                    <p>Software Engineers and Developers should perform the items listed below every time they open a new pull request. The checklist aims to reduce the noise among the author and their reviewers. Besides, it also increases the overall quality of the codebase and avoids new bugs.</p>
                    <p>For more details on the items, you can read more about[[what to check before assigning a Pull Request]](/blog/10-items-to-check-before-assigning-a-pull-request-to-someone-plus-a-bonus).</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>☑️ Name the branch accordingly to the team’s convention</li>
                        <li>☑️ Explicit whether the Pull Request is a draft (or WIP)</li>
                        <li>☑️ Go through the changed code looking for typos, TODOs, commented LOCs, debugging pieces of code, trailing whitespaces, etc.</li>
                        <li>☑️ Make sure objects, structures, and variables have semantic names</li>
                        <li>☑️ Run the proper linters, and fix the pointed issues that make sense</li>
                        <li>☑️ Squad, edit or reorder the commits to make it look like a story (or a task list)</li>
                        <li>☑️ Cherry-pick non-related commits to a specific branch</li>
                        <li>☑️ Optimize SQL queries to fetch only relevant table columns, avoiding n+1, or fetching unused relations</li>
                        <li>☑️ Rebase your branch onto master and upstream branch</li>
                        <li>☑️ Enrich the description with detailed descriptions, explaining the motivation, and the solution. Add media like screenshots, gifs, or even small videos. Tag it following the team’s convention.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Additionally, right after opening the pull request, comment inline any interesting fact or piece of code that you feed the urge to share. For example, you may point out a new API method that got you impressed with or a programming language feature that you’ve just learned.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h3>Reviewing a Pull Request</h3>
                    <p>Take time to review a pull request properly. Reviewing code is not just about pointing fingers. It’s also an opportunity to learn from others.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>☑️ Does the code work? Check whether function and logic are correct.</li>
                        <li>☑️ Are functions, methods, and variables adequately named?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Are names semantic and meaningful for your business?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is it well tested?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Are there unit tests, and they have good quality? Do they test the functionality?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Do tests reach acceptable coverage for your project?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is the code clear and easy to understand?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Does it meet the team’s guidelines and style guides?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is there any duplicated code?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is there any commented or unnecessary code?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Does the code take the most out of frameworks and language? Is there any custom implementation of native or already-existing functions?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Are there code smells, grey areas, or bug-prone?</li>
                        <li>☑️ Is documentation on functions, methods, classes, contexts, and behaviors adequate?</li>

                    <h3>Receiving reviews in a Pull Request</h3>
                    <p>Pull Request benefits from collaboration. So, it’s crucial to detail the change to the team. With a better idea of the business and development contexts, they can understand and better review your code.</p>
                    <p>If it’s a work in progress, make sure to make it explicit. You can use checkboxes or bullet lists to display the tasks that need to be done. Then, follow the following guidelines:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>☑️ Reply to the given feedback with your thoughts on the pointed issue. It can be an emoji or a single sentence.</li>
                        <li>☑️ Use and abuse some pull request features, like sharing specific code lines, diffs, and links to make your point</li>
                        <li>☑️ When commenting, link the “commit sha” to illustrate how and where is the related change.</li>

                    <p>Pull Request metrics are actionable indicators used for managing software engineering teams. They differ from Agile Metrics as they don’t reflect the whole process, but fundamental elements of software development.

Relay executes workflows, which consist of multiple related steps, to perform actions like opening Jira tickets, merging pull requests, or even deploying an application to a Kubernetes cluster.</p><p id="76a9">Relay is built on containerization and leverages <a href="https://tekton.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tekton</a> to execute workflows. Each step in a Relay workflow runs an <a href="https://opencontainers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OCI</a>-compatible container image. Unlike conventional workflow automation tools, this gives you the ability to make your own completely custom steps; you’re not restricted to our curated steps or even to a particular programming language.</p><p id="d57a">When we set out to implement triggers to automatically run workflows from event data, we wanted to make sure you’d have similar flexibility as within a workflow to receive external data. We decided to provide three initial options: schedule triggers, which run your workflows on a specified interval; push triggers, which allow your services to directly send data to Relay; and webhook triggers, which integrate with lots of external services that can push event data to arbitrary HTTP endpoints.</p><p id="525d">Webhook triggers presented the biggest technical challenge to implement, as every service provides slightly different payloads representing their events. Keeping with our container-based approach, we let you define webhook triggers by running your own web server in a container you provide to us. In this post, we’ll walk through how we implemented our webhook trigger handling using <a href="https://knative.dev/docs/serving/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knative Serving</a> and the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/topics/install/install-ambassador-oss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador API Gateway</a>.</p><p id="3b33">You can see <a href="https://github.com/relay-integrations/relay-pagerduty/blob/master/triggers/pagerduty-trigger-incident-triggered/handler.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an example of a complete webhook trigger implementation</a> in our PagerDuty integration.</p><p id="c33e">We chose Knative Serving as a reverse proxy for webhook triggers. We could have configured a Kubernetes deployment for each webhook trigger, but we felt the resource burden on our cluster would be too high to have every customer pod running all the time.</p><p id="83a2">Knative Serving’s unique model uses an activator and autoscaler to dynamically provision pods when it receives requests. A rough state machine for a Knative service looks like:</p><ol><li id="2b52">When a service is created or updated, a revision is created initially in an inactive state. This corresponds to a Kubernetes deployment scaled to zero pods. In this inactive state, HTTP requests are routed to the Knative activator.</li><li id="a376">When an HTTP request is received for the service, the Knative activator queues the request and switches the current revision to an active state. Knative then scales the deployment up and switches the service to route to the deployment’s pods. Once the service is pointing at the deployment, the queued HTTP request is dispatched.</li><li id="e2bd">The Knative autoscaler monitors inbound request rate and scales the deployment as needed.</li><li id="d7e2">If the service doesn’t receive any HTTP requests after a configured timeout, the deployment is scaled back to zero, the revision is marked as inactive, and the service is switched back to the activator.</li><li id="e36d">Repeat from the beginning!</li></ol><p id="6a1c">For a cached container image, the whole activation process generally takes less than 2 seconds, quickly enough for our webhook handling use case. And for webhook triggers that only receive events every few minutes or less frequently, it saves us considerable cluster resources.</p><p id="a166">Installing Knative Serving is straightforward. You need their <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CRDs</a> and core components like the activator. Here we’ll use version 0.13.0, but check their <a href="https://knative.dev/docs/install/any-kubernetes-cluster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">installation instructions</a> for the latest version.</p><pre><span id="7fad">$ kubectl apply -f <a href="https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.13.0/serving-crds.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.13.0/serving-crds.yaml</a><br>$ kubectl apply -f <a href="https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.13.0/serving-core.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/knative/serving/releases/download/v0.13.0/serving-core.yaml</a></span></pre><p id="526b">Then you need to pick a networking layer, or gateway, to route requests.</p><p id="ce98">Like most Knative Serving users, we started by evaluating <a href="https://istio.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Istio</a>, a popular service mesh and ingress gateway offering for Kubernetes. However, Istio’s focus on connecting microservices didn’t really support our use case:</p><ol><li id="bb0c">We didn’t need the service mesh component of Istio at all, only its Envoy gateway. A complete Istio installation on our cluster consumed a lot of resources, most of which were ultimately going to waste.</li><li id="fcb1">Because we’re configuring webhook triggers dynamically from our database, we put our own reverse proxy in front of Knative Serving. It is difficult (although not impossible) to change the behavior of Istio to run as an internal-facing service instead of a public gateway.</li></ol><p id="8449">Most other networking layer options for Knative Serving were positioned more strongly as ingress gateways, focusing mainly on exposing services directly to the internet.</p><p id="6d47">Ultimately we settled on Ambassador because its lightweight single-container model made deploying it for our internal use case easy.</p><p id="dab8">For Relay, we use a custom Helm chart to set up the Ambassador API Gateway. We have a single deployment, an optional <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">horizontal pod autoscaler</a>, a service account with corresponding role bindings, and finally a ClusterIP service to use as the target networking layer for Knative.</p><p id="30e8">Our deployment YAML is largely the same as the one from the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/topics/install/install-ambassador-oss/#1-deploying-the-ambassador-api-gateway" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador installation instructions</a> in <code>ambassador-rbac.yaml</code>. However, we must explicitly enable Knative support:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="2cb9">Likewise, our service account and role bindings are similar to those in <code>ambassador-rbac.yaml</code>, but use <code>{{ .Release.Namespace }}</code> instead of <code>default</code>.</p><p id="d788">For the gateway service, note especially:</p><ol><li id="cd94">The <code>app.kubernetes.io/component</code> label must be present and set exactly to the value <code>ambassador-service</code> or Ambassador won’t pick it up to set the Knative service target correctly.</li><li id="7097">We use <code>type: ClusterIP</code> to make the service cluster-local. This instance of Ambassador won’t be reachable from the internet.</li></ol><figure><div></div></figure><p id="64eb">As a reference, you can find <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/relay-helm-ambassador-knative" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our entire Ambassador Helm chart on GitHub</a>.</p><p id="f282">Finally, we need to configure Knative to use cluster-local routing and Ambassador as its default gateway. Simply apply this manifest to your cluster using <code>kubectl apply</code>:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="7fb6">Now you can create a cluster-local Knative service. Use <code>kubectl apply</code> on a manifest like this:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="946e">Within a few seconds, Ambassador will process the service and set up a mapping for it. Assuming you installed Ambassador to the <code>ambassador</code> namespace, you’ll see this service when you run <code>kubectl get svc</code>:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="5ec0">If you don’t see the service pointed at your Ambassador deployment, inspect the Knative service and ingress using <code>kubectl describe ksvc my-test-service</code> and <code>kubectl describe king my-test-service</code>. The status conditions and events should provide useful hints to remediate any problems.</p><p id="ecb0">Now we can try sending a request to the service by running a one-off pod:</p><pre><span id="cd00">$ kubectl run \<br>    --generator=run-pod/v1 internal-requester \<br>    --image=alpine --rm -ti --attach --restart=Never \<br>    -- wget -q -O - <a href="http://my-test-service.default.svc.cluster.local/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://my-test-service.default.svc.cluster.local</a><br>Hello World!<br>pod "internal-requester" deleted</span></pre><p id="8839">Yay! Your service works. You’ll also see a pod running to handle the request you just made. If you don’t make any more requests, within a few minutes, that pod will be automatically terminated.</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="63ca">You can view all the mappings Ambassador has configured for your Knative services by forwarding the admin endpoint of your deployment:</p><pre><span id="6e83">$ kubectl port-forward -n ambassador deployment/ambassador 8877<br>Forwarding from 127.0.0.1:8877 -&gt; 8877<br>Forwarding from [::1]:8877 -&gt; 8877</span></pre><p id="2f40">Then navigate to <a href="http://localhost:8877/ambassador/v0/diag/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://localhost:8877/ambassador/v0/diag/</a>.</p><p id="0b02">For Relay, we manage our Knative services by writing out a higher-level CRD that <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/relay-core" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our operator processes</a>. This lets us perform lifecycle management operations more efficiently. For example, we create and clean up webhook triggers and workflow runs in batches we call tenants. We get a ton of value from the combination of Tekton, Knative, Ambassador, and our own operator, with relatively little cluster resource overhead.</p><p id="39f1">The <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.getambassador.io/self-serverless-why-run-knative-functions-on-your-kubernetes-cluster-4914c706a083">developer use cases for Knative</a> fall into three categories:</p><ol><li id="025c"><strong>Replace glue/aggregation functions with Knative<br></strong>Function as a Service (FaaS) offerings have become popular as a way to deploy and run services that “glue” functionality together. The main challenge for development teams is that the workflow for deploying cloud-based FaaS is different than that for Kubenetes. If you’ve already invested in training engineers to work with Kubernetes, then the added time and money to train them is extraneous.</li><li id="83c3"><strong>Build smaller microservices as functions<br></strong>Some simple functions are event-driven and provisioning (or running) an entire microservice/app framework seems unnecessary. Knative provides “just enough” framework to deploy and manage the lifecycle of a very simple microservice or “nanoservice” using the primitives provided within modern language stacks.</li><li id="b407"><strong>Deploy high-volume functions, cost-effectively<br></strong>Pay-as-you go serverless offerings can be very cost-effective for certain use cases. For longer-running or high-volume functions, pay-as-you-go isn’t as practical. Running Knative on your own hardware, or even running this via Kubernetes deployed on cloud VMs, can enable the easier costing of execution when you know that you will be running a service that has high-volume traffic.</li></ol><p id="7ba9">Running on-demand microservices in your infrastructure is easier now than ever before. With the help of Knative and Ambassador, you can drastically reduce costs and resource utilization while maintaining clean separations of APIs across your environment.</p><p id="05c9">At the frontier of cloud-native experience, Knative also unlocks some very exciting opportunities that haven’t been practical in conventional deployment environments. In this post, we explored low-trust user-defined workloads using custom containers as one example, but there are many more!</p><ul><li id="7ae9">Install the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/tutorials/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ambassador Edge Stack</a>.</li><li id="2264">Install <a href="https://knative.dev/docs/install/any-kubernetes-cluster/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Knative with Ambassador</a>.</li><li id="d1b5">Read the <a href="https://www.getambassador.io/docs/latest/howtos/knative/#using-knative-and-ambassador" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation for using Knative and Ambassador</a>.</li><li id="d8f4"><a href="https://www.getambassador.io/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Contact the Ambassador team </a>to learn more about using Ambassador with Knative.</li><li id="6d68">Sign up for <a href="https://relay.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Relay</a> to try webhook triggers yourself.</li></ul></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><span><span>So FPS is, as it were, a total score, the number of images&nbsp;<em>per second.</em></span>&nbsp;<span>Since this does not say anything about the distribution of the images&nbsp;<em>within</em>&nbsp;that second, the fps score is unable to say anything about how smooth the experience actually is for the player.</span></span></span></p><p><span><span>
<p><span>It is therefore more interesting to look at the time it takes to render each frame (image).</span>&nbsp;<span>These are also known as&nbsp;<em>frame times</em>&nbsp;, and they are measured in milliseconds.</span>&nbsp;<span>A millisecond is one thousandth of a second and is often shortened to&nbsp;<em>ms</em>&nbsp;.</span>&nbsp;<span>Because the images follow each other very quickly in an animation, this unit makes more sense than noting&nbsp;<em>0.001 seconds.</em></span></p>
<p><span><em>If you want 60 fps without stutters at all times, no frame should take longer than 16.67 milliseconds to calculate and be displayed on your screen.</em></span><span>For 30 fps, your system can take it easy;</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>there is a whopping 33.3 milliseconds.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>If you want to get 100 fps, that's just 10 milliseconds - less than a third of the time!</span></p>
<h2>
<span>The Achilles heel of the mean</span></h2>

<p><span>For frame times we therefore measure&nbsp;<em>per frame</em>&nbsp;the time it took to render that frame.</span>&nbsp;<span>Since each benchmark quickly takes a few minutes, we are talking about thousands of 'scores' (values).</span>&nbsp;<span>It would be very easy to calculate an average from all this data, but then we are effectively no further than with an FPS score;</span>&nbsp;<span>after all, an average says very little about the consistency and outliers within the series.</span></p>

<p><span>Which system is performing better now?</span>&nbsp;<span>If we look at the averages, both systems arrive at 30 fps.</span>&nbsp;<span>On this basis, we therefore see no difference.</span>&nbsp;<span>If we look at the graph, it is immediately clear that system B with its two outliers does not offer such a smooth experience as system A.</span></p>

<p><span>Now that we know that we should not focus on an average (fps), the question arises: what can be used?</span>&nbsp;<span>If we measure the frame times in a benchmark or test, and thereby collect&nbsp;<em>tens of thousands of</em>&nbsp;scores, how can these be made transparent?</span>&nbsp;<span>Making a graph for each second tested as above is a lot of work, and you probably already quit after ten pieces.</span>&nbsp;<span>To do this in a compact and efficient way, we use percentiles.</span></p>
<h2>
<span>Percentiles</span></h2>
<p><span>A percentile is a term from the statistic, and is calculated by ordering all frame times from lowest to highest and dividing it into 100 parts of equal size.</span>&nbsp;<span>That way you will get a better overview of the distribution of all data.</span>&nbsp;<span>For example, if it is the 60th percentile, then 60 percent of all frame times is equal to or less than this number, and 40 percent higher.</span>&nbsp;<span>If a test shows that the 90th percentile is 13.3 ms, 90 percent of all measured frames are ready in 13.3 ms or faster.</span></p>

<p><span>Do you remember the previous graph ?</span>&nbsp;<span>Below are a similar chart with again one second of test data on two systems.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F2N2NpGtN7Y/XsLjkzlz_fI/AAAAAAAAAOU/EphYXha3z80OskdkHMGyj0RnSz3fKuUkwCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082184_grafiek_pt4.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="300" data-original-width="600" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F2N2NpGtN7Y/XsLjkzlz_fI/AAAAAAAAAOU/EphYXha3z80OskdkHMGyj0RnSz3fKuUkwCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082184_grafiek_pt4.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span><span>The average of these two systems is again not that interesting, because they both achieve an average frame time of 33.3 ms which means 30 fps.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>We get a better overview if we sort all scores in the chart from low to high as below.</span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cu-6E-Pl064/XsLj3NTlsuI/AAAAAAAAAOc/DsCHPBElmeEXKTbwNTKx_2b77dGY1URfACLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082183_grafiek_pt3.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="301" data-original-width="600" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-Cu-6E-Pl064/XsLj3NTlsuI/AAAAAAAAAOc/DsCHPBElmeEXKTbwNTKx_2b77dGY1URfACLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082183_grafiek_pt3.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span><span><span>With the increasing frame times in this graph, the picture is a bit less chaotic than the previous graph.</span>&nbsp;<span>In the order from low to high, the best (lowest) frame times are therefore on the left, and the worst (which cause the annoying stutters) on the right.</span>&nbsp;<span>This is also how a percentile graph works, only percentiles are used for the horizontal axis.</span>&nbsp;<span>A line graph is also used instead of a bar chart (the 'bars').</span>&nbsp;<span>Then the graph will look like this:</span></span></span></p>
<p><a href="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OcVt3TaKBZ8/XsLkL28ON2I/AAAAAAAAAOk/owWLIe0h7IwuEYous2S02ImQK40ZuWBWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/082481_ms_perc1.jpg" imageanchor="1"><img data-original-height="323" data-original-width="600" height="344" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OcVt3TaKBZ8/XsLkL28ON2I/AAAAAAAAAOk/owWLIe0h7IwuEYous2S02ImQK40ZuWBWgCLcBGAsYHQ/s640/082481_ms_perc1.jpg" width="640"></a></p>
<p><span><span><span><span>We know that frame times are preferably as low as possible, but especially that we want to see as few high frame times as possible.</span>&nbsp;<span>That sounds like the same thing, but there is a difference.</span>&nbsp;<span>In the example above, the game runs at 30 fps and the monitor shows 30 images per second, so there is 33.3 ms time to prepare per frame.</span>&nbsp;<span>In that case, the frames that are ready in less time have no extra value, they are not shown before.</span>&nbsp;<span>If you want your game to run as fast as possible, low frame times are desirable, but even then consistency is also important for the best experience.</span>&nbsp;<span>The higher frame times on the right of the graph are the cases that disrupt the smooth experience.</span></span></span></span></p>
<h2>
<span>Low frame times, high percentiles</span></h2>
<p><span>When discussing frame times, the 95th, 99th and 99.9th percentile are commonly used values.</span>&nbsp;<span>Why?</span>&nbsp;<span>Because with this data, we can make a solid statement about how well a game or benchmark is running for most of the time.</span>&nbsp;<span>We are not just looking for the worst frame time, we want to know how consistent the experience is across the board.</span>&nbsp;<span>An incidental stutter is almost inevitable and often not fully predictable - and sometimes just a measurement error.</span></p>

<p><span>The 99th and 99.9th percentile is also regularly indicated with&nbsp;<em>1%</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>0.1%</em>&nbsp;<em>lows</em>&nbsp;at frame times&nbsp;<em>,</em>&nbsp;which is effectively the same (the 1 and 0.1 percent worst frame times) - it just rolls a bit easier.</span>&nbsp;<span>In addition, some publications convert the percentiles in frame times back to fps, in order to make the information more accessible.</span>&nbsp;<span>Many readers can usually imagine better at&nbsp;<em>75 fps</em>&nbsp;than at&nbsp;<em>13.3 ms</em>&nbsp;.</span>&nbsp;<span>In itself we understand that choice, but it should be kept in mind that 'in' 75 fps (a second with 75 frames) an inconsistent follow-up of frames can still take place.</span>&nbsp;<span>This mainly depends on which percentile it concerns: converted 75 fps as 99th percentile is much more consistent than as 90th percentile.</span></p>
<h2>
<span>Finally</span></h2>
<p><span>For those who examine frame times, a world of detailed information opens up.</span>&nbsp;<span>Compared to the&nbsp;<em>frames per second</em>&nbsp;measure, it is much more accurate to measure how smooth the animation is and how pleasant the gaming experience will be.</span>&nbsp;<span>Moreover, there are a variety of options for comparisons;</span>&nbsp;<span>not only determine what the better video card is, but also, for example, which processor is suitable for gaming, how much an overclocking on your cores or your memory makes, the difference between different driver versions and so on.</span></p>

<p><span>That the importance of frame times has been underlined with this article does not mean that the fps benchmark can be trashed.</span>&nbsp;<span>As long as frame times remain consistent, the proportions in relevant equations will remain the same</span></p>
<p><span><span>In this article we have talked about what exactly frame times mean, how they relate to fps, how the calculations are made, what the percentiles mean and how you can read and interpret all these test data.</span>&nbsp;<span>If you also want to get started and do these measurements on your own PC, programs such as&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=nl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://gpuopen.com/gaming-product/ocat/&amp;usg=ALkJrhh7ywfCE3ogo8D8QpExdhs-ba5knw">OCAT</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=nl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://www.nvidia.com/nl-nl/geforce/technologies/frameview/&amp;usg=ALkJrhh-nC6YtO_Hj4jx-GwmEb9dFzOe0g">FrameView are</a>&nbsp;good options for logging in, but especially&nbsp;<a href="https://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?depth=1&amp;hl=en&amp;prev=search&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;sl=nl&amp;sp=nmt4&amp;u=https://github.com/DevTechProfile/CapFrameX&amp;usg=ALkJrhj4raip_SAYtm11y0fc40AjzmlyRA">CapFrameX</a>&nbsp;is recommended to provide insight into the large amounts of data in an instant.</span></span></p>

                    <p>API keys, passwords, and customer data are accidentally posted to GitHub every day. </p><p>Hackers use these keys to login to servers, steal personal information, and rack up absurd AWS charges. GitHub leaks can cost a company thousands–or even millions–of dollars in damages. Open-source intelligence gathering on GitHub has become a powerful arrow in every security researcher's quiver: researchers from NC State even wrote an <a href="https://www.ndss-symposium.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/ndss2019_04B-3_Meli_paper.pdf">academic paper</a> on the subject. </p><p>This article, written for both bug bounty hunters and enterprise infosec teams, demonstrates common types of sensitive information (secrets) that users post to public GitHub repositories as well as heuristics for finding them. The techniques in this article can be applied to <a href="https://gist.github.com/">GitHub Gist</a> snippets, too.</p><p>In the last year, I've earned nearly $10,000 from bug bounty programs on <a href="https://hackerone.com/">HackerOne</a> without even visiting programs' websites thanks to these techniques. I've submitted over 30 Coordinated Disclosure reports to vulnerable corporations, including eight Fortune 500 companies. </p><p><strong>I've also released <a href="https://github.com/tillson/git-hound">GitHound</a>, an open-source tool designed to automate the process of finding keys across GitHub.</strong> GitHound isn't limited to a single user or organization: it sifts through all of GitHub, using Code Search queries as an entrypoint into repositories and then using context, regexes, and some other neat tricks to find secrets.</p><h2 id="github-code-search">GitHub Code Search</h2><p>Before we get into the automated tools and bug bounty strategies, let's talk about Code Search. </p><p>GitHub provides <a href="https://github.com/search">rich code searching</a> that scans public GitHub repositories (some content is omitted, <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-code#considerations-for-code-search">like forks and non-default branches</a>). Queries can be simple like <code>uberinternal.com</code> or can contain multi-word strings like &nbsp;<code>"Authorization: Bearer"</code>. Searches can even target specific files (<code>filename: vim_settings.xml</code>) or specific languages (<code>language:SQL</code>). Searches can also contain certain <a href="https://help.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/understanding-the-search-syntax">boolean qualifiers</a> like <code>NOT</code> and <code>&gt;</code>. </p><p>Knowing the rules of GitHub code search enables us to craft search dorks: queries that are designed to find sensitive information. GitHub dorks can be found online, but the best dorks are the ones that you create yourself.</p><p>For example, <code>filename: vim_settings.xml</code> (<a href="https://github.com/search?q=filename%3Avim_settings.xml&amp;type=Code">try it!</a>) targets <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/settings-tools-settings-repository.html">IntelliJ settings files</a><a>.</a> Interestingly, the <code>vim_settings.xml</code> file contains recent <strong>copy-pasted strings encoded in Base64</strong>. I recently made $2400 from a bug bounty with this dork: SaaS API keys and customer information were exposed in <code>vim_settings.xml</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://tillsongalloway.com/content/images/2020/05/vim_settings.png"></figure><p><code>vim_settings.xml</code> only contains recently copy-pasted strings, but we can exploit the repository's commit history to find the <strong>entire copy-paste history.</strong> Just clone the repository and run <a href="https://gist.github.com/tillson/620e8ef87bc057f25b0a27c423433fda">this 14-line script</a>, and the user's activity will be at your fingertips. GitHound also finds and scans base64 encoded strings for secrets, even in commit history.</p><p>By the way: with <a href="https://github.com/search?q=%22vim_settings.xml%22&amp;type=Commits">a GitHub commit search dork</a>, we can quickly scan all 500,000 of commits that edit <code>vim_settings.xml</code>.</p><figure><img src="https://tillsongalloway.com/content/images/2020/05/commits.png"></figure><h2 id="search-heuristics-for-bug-bounty-hunters">Search Heuristics for Bug Bounty Hunters</h2><p>GitHub dorks broadly find sensitive information, but<strong> what if we want to look for information about a specific company?</strong> GitHub has millions of repositories and even more files, so we'll need some heuristics to narrow down the search space. </p><p>To start finding sensitive information, identify a target. </p><p>I've found that the best way to start is to <strong>find domains or subdomains that identify corporate infrastructure.</strong> </p><p>Searching for <code>company.com</code> probably won't provide useful results: many companies release audited open-source projects that aren't likely to contain secrets. Less-used domains and subdomains are more interesting. This includes specific hosts like <code>jira.company.com</code> as well as more general second-level and lower-level domains. It's more efficient to find a pattern than a single domain: <code>corp.somecompany.com</code>, <code>somecompany.net</code>, or <code>companycorp.com</code> are more likely to appear only in an employee's configuration files. </p><p>The usual suspects for open-source intelligence and domain reconnaissance help here:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/TheRook/subbrute">Subbrute</a> - Python tool for brute-forcing subdomains</li><li><a href="https://www.threatcrowd.org/">ThreatCrowd</a> - Given a domain, find associated domains through multiple OSINT techniques</li><li><a href="https://censys.io/">Censys.io</a> - Given a domain, find SSL certificates using it</li></ul><p>GitHound can help with subdomain discovery too: add a custom regex <code>\.company\.com</code> and run GitHound with the <code>--regex-file</code> flag.</p><p>After finding a host or pattern to search, play around on GitHub search with it (I always do this before using automated tools). There are a few questions I like to ask myself here:</p><ol><li><strong>How many results came up?</strong> If there are over 100 pages, I'll likely need to find a better query to start with (GitHub limits code search results to 100 pages).</li><li><strong>What kind of results came up?</strong> If the results are mostly (intentionally) open-source projects and people using public APIs, then I may be able to refine the search to eliminate those.</li><li><strong>What happens if I change the language?</strong> <code>language:Shell</code> and <code>language:SQL</code> may have interesting results.</li><li><strong>Do these results reveal any other domains or hosts?</strong> Results in the first few pages will often include a reference to another domain (e.g. searching for <code>jira.uber.com</code> may reveal the existence of another domain entirely, like <code>uberinternal.com</code>).</li></ol><p>I spend most of my time in this step.</p><p>It's crucial that the search space is well-defined and accurate. Automated tools and manual searching will be faster and more accurate with the proper query.</p><p>Once I find results that seem interesting based on the criteria above, I run it through <a href="https://github.com/tillson/git-hound">GitHound</a><a> </a>with <code>--dig-files</code> and <code>--dig-commits</code> to look the entire repository and its history. </p><p><code>echo "uberinternal.com" | ./git-hound --dig-files --dig-commits</code></p><p><code>echo "uber.com" | ./git-hound --dig-files --language-file languages.txt --dig-commits</code></p><p><code>echo "uber.box.net" | ./git-hound --dig-files --dig-commits</code></p><p>GitHound also locates interesting files that simply searching won't find, like <code>.zip</code> or <code>.xlsx</code> files. Importantly, I also manually go through results since automated tools often miss customer information, sensitive code, and username/password combinations. Oftentimes, this will reveal more subdomains or other interesting patterns that will give me ideas for more search queries. It's important to remember that open-source intelligence is a recursive process.</p><p>This process almost always finds results. Leaks usually fall into one of these categories (ranked from most to least impactful):</p><ol><li><strong>SaaS API keys</strong> - Companies rarely impose IP restrictions on APIs. AWS, Slack, Google, and other API keys are liquid gold. These are usually found in config files, bash history files, and scripts.</li><li><strong>Server/database credentials</strong> - These are usually behind a firewall, so they're less impactful. Usually found in config files, bash history files, and scripts.</li><li><strong>Customer/employee information</strong> - These hide in XLSX, CSV, and XML files and range from emails all the way to billing information and employee performance reviews.</li><li><strong>Data science scripts</strong> - SQL queries, R scripts, and Jupyter projects can reveal sensitive information. These repos also tend to have "test data" files hanging around.</li><li><strong>Hostnames/metadata</strong> - The most common result. Most companies don't consider this a vulnerability, but they can help refine future searches</li></ol><h2 id="workflow-for-specific-api-providers">Workflow for Specific API Providers</h2><p>Dorks can also be created to target specific API providers and their endpoints. This is especially useful for companies creating automated checks for their users' API keys. With knowledge of an API key's <strong>context</strong> and <strong>syntax</strong>, the search space can be significantly reduced. </p><p>With knowledge of the specific API provider, we can obtain all of the keys that match the API provider's regex and are in an API call context and then we can check them for validity using an internal database or an API endpoint. </p><figure><img src="https://tillsongalloway.com/content/images/2020/05/graph.png"><figcaption>A workflow for finding secrets for a single API provider</figcaption></figure><p>For example, suppose a company (HalCorp) provides an API for users to read and write to their account. By making our own HalCorp account, we discover that API keys are in the form <code>[a-f]{4}-[a-f]{4}-[a-f]{4}</code>. </p><pre><code># Python
import halapi
api = halapi.API()
api.authenticate_by_key('REDACTED')

# REST API with curl
curl -X POST -H "HALCorp-Key: REDACTED" https://api.halcorp.biz/userinfo
</code></pre><p>Armed with this information, we can compose our own GitHub dorks for HalCorp API responses: </p><pre><code># Python
"authenticate_by_key" "halapi" language:python

# REST API
"HALCorp-Key"
</code></pre><p>With a tool like <a href="https://github.com/tillson/git-hound">GitHound</a><a>,</a> we can use regex matching to find strings that match the API key's regex and output them to a file:</p><p><code>echo "HALCorp-Key" | git-hound --dig-files --dig-commits --many-results --regex-file halcorp-api-keys.txt --results-only &gt; api_tokens.txt </code></p><p>Now that we have a file containing potential &nbsp;API tokens, and we can check these against a database for validity (<strong>do not do this if you don't have written permission from the API provider</strong>).</p><p>In the case of HalCorp, we can write a bash script that reads from stdin, checks the <code>api.halcorp.biz/userinfo</code> endpoint, and outputs the response.</p><p><code>cat api_tokens.txt | bash checktoken.bash</code></p><p>Although awareness of secret exposure on GitHub has increased, more and more sensitive data are published each day. </p><p>Amazon Web Services have begun <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-receive-notifications-when-your-aws-accounts-root-access-keys-are-used/">notifying users if their API keys are posted online</a>. GitHub has added <a href="https://github.com/features/security">security features</a> that scan public repositories for common keys. These solutions are merely bandaids, however. To limit secret leaks from source code, we must update API frameworks and DevOps methodologies to prevent API keys from being stored in Git/SVN repositories entirely. Software like <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/">Vault</a> safely stores production keys and some API providers, like Google Cloud Platform, have updated their libraries to force API keys to be stored in a file by default.</p><p>Fully eradicating exposure of sensitive information is a more difficult problem: how can customer information be fully detected? What if it's in a Word, Excel, or compiled file? More research must be conducted in this field to study the extent of the problem and its solution.</p>

				<p>You've probably heard of a Lean Startup approach to building a business, but what about a Lean DevOps approach to scaling your development team?</p><p>To explain the difference between traditional DevOps and Lean DevOps, let's start at a cloud's eye view and work our way down.</p><p>The definition of traditional DevOps, as defined by <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/#:~:text=DevOps%20is%20the%20combination%20of,development%20and%20infrastructure%20management%20processes.">AWS</a>, is:</p><blockquote>DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organization’s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes.</blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/traditional-devopscycle-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Lean DevOps makes a key distinction in the fact that it aims to not just bring velocity to the surface, but also simplicity. As such, Lean DevOps is defined as:</p><blockquote><em>Lean DevOps is a development philosophy that focuses on both velocity and simplicity via a combination of culture, best practices, and workflow automation tools.</em></blockquote><!--kg-card-begin: image--><figure><img src="https://cto.ai/blog/content/images/2020/06/lean-devops-cto.ai.png"></figure><!--kg-card-end: image--><p>Not only is traditional DevOps a major challenge for small companies trying to compete for skilled people, but those same startups also have the most promising opportunity to scale DevOps as part of their organizational structure and culture. In doing so, DevOps can be optimized using a lattice-style team philosophy where generalists and specialists are both leveraged and nurtured.</p><p>And Lean DevOps works. The <a href="https://puppet.com/resources/report/state-of-devops-report/">2019 State of DevOps Report</a> showed that companies who have high performing DevOps programs deploy software not only <strong>200 times more frequently</strong>, but also have <strong>2,555 times faster lead times</strong> for their projects.

		<p><strong>Note:</strong> This post is about the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp"><code>mellium.im/xmpp</code></a> project, an XMPP library
for <a href="https://golang.org/">Go</a>.

<p>Go is a great language if you need to get a project off the ground quickly. It
has its confusing aspects, and its type system allows for lots of abuse thanks
to <a href="https://blog.samwhited.com/2017/08/the-case-for-interface/">optional dynamic typing</a>, but overall it’s easy to read and easy to quickly
build projects that require clear code over absolute type safety.
Similarly, <!-- raw HTML omitted -->XMPP<!-- raw HTML omitted --><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> has its warts, but overall is the best choice to get a
chat product off the ground quickly if you want a system that’s well understood
and has a robust ecosystem and sustainable standards body.</p>
<p>Since Go shines at handling I/O bound services (like asynchronous network
protocols used for instant messaging), an XMPP library in Go seems like a great
fit.
There are a handful of libraries to handle XMPP already in existence, but most
of them are small high-level libraries designed only to work with the legacy
version of XMPP that was supported by Google Talk, or don’t follow Go idioms and
best practices.
When I started looking into a Go XMPP implementation around 5 years ago, there
wasn’t a low-level library meant to act as a building block from which higher
level systems could be created, and that’s what I wanted: the equivalent of the
standard libraries <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/net/http/"><code>net/http</code></a> but for XMPP.
This is why I created <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp"><code>mellium.im/xmpp</code></a>.
This post will be about some of the design decisions I made while building the
library, and about some of the trade offs made along the way.</p>
<h2 id="stream-features">Stream Features</h2>
<p>Let’s start by talking about feature negotiation.
An XMPP session can broadly be divided up into two parts: the synchronous
initial handshake, and the actual asynchronous session.
Within this initial handshake, a series of common features are negotiated in a
certain order.
For example, if TLS isn’t already in use, opportunistic TLS (StartTLS) might be
negotiated, followed by authentication.
This ends up being a loop where the server sends any features it wants to
advertise at the current moment (eg. just TLS) then the client chooses one to
negotiate and proceeds with that features specific negotiation steps.
Then the server sends another list (possibly with new features, eg. now that we
have TLS negotiated the server might advertise that authentication is now ready
to proceed) and the client selects one and moves forward.
This loop is easy enough to write in Go, but representing the features
themselves was tricky.
Features need to be able to encode the name they go by when the server lists
them and any information that should be included in that listing, they need to
be able to parse that payload from the clients side, and the actual negotiation
from the server and clients side needs to happen.
To handle this a struct containing three functions for listing features, parsing
the features list, and negotiating the features was created.
This means less boilerplate and more type safety than using an interface to
represent a stream feature.
It also makes it less likely that a user of this API will get confused and write
stateful stream features, but if necessary the functions can still close over
external state or resources (but don’t do this, you may think you need it, but
you’re almost certainly wrong).</p>
<pre><code>type StreamFeature struct {
	Name xml.Name

	Necessary SessionState
	Prohibited SessionState

	List func(ctx context.Context, e xmlstream.TokenWriter, start xml.StartElement) (req bool, err error)
	Parse func(ctx context.Context, r xml.TokenReader, start *xml.StartElement) (req bool, data interface{}, err error)
	Negotiate func(ctx context.Context, session *Session, data interface{}) (mask SessionState, rw io.ReadWriter, err error)
}
</code></pre><p>We also need to have a way to encode the order features should appear in (eg.
auth should not be attempted before TLS).
I decided that features would order themselves based on the state of the
session at the moment when feature negotiation happens.
The feature would say what properties of the session are or are not allowed, and
the thing doing negotiation can determine whether the session currently meets
those criteria.
Session state information only has 4 properties that are useful for session
negotiation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is a security layer in place (eg. TLS),</li>
<li>has authentication been performed,</li>
<li>is feature negotiation complete, and</li>
<li>was the session initiated by a remote entity?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are part of the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#SessionState"><code>SessionState</code></a> bits, so in the stream features we can
encode what bits are <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#StreamFeature.Necessary">necessary</a> and what bits are <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#StreamFeature.Necessary">prohibited</a> and the state
machine that handles session negotiation will be able to figure out when to
advertise or negotiate the feature using simple bit math.</p>
<pre><code>const (
	// Secure indicates that the underlying connection has been secured. For
	// instance, after STARTTLS has been performed or if a pre-secured connection
	// is being used such as websockets over HTTPS.
	Secure SessionState = 1 &lt;&lt; iota

	// Authn indicates that the session has been authenticated (probably with
	// SASL).
	Authn

	// Ready indicates that the session is fully negotiated and that XMPP stanzas
	// may be sent and received.
	Ready

	// Received indicates that the session was initiated by a foreign entity.
	Received

	…
)
</code></pre><h2 id="session-negotiation">Session Negotiation</h2>
<p>Once we have a set of features that we can negotiate, we need to do the actual
session negotiation.
Normally, XMPP negotiates a session over TCP using the features loop that we
already described, however, sometimes an alternative mechanism might be required
for negotiation such as the websocket subprotocol defined in <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7395">RFC 7395</a> or the
legacy <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0114.html">XEP-0114: Jabber Component Protocol</a>.
Generalizing session negotiation meant allowing the user to provide a special
negotiator function and writing a default one for the basic XMPP stream
negotiation protocol.</p>
<pre><code>type Negotiator func(ctx context.Context, session *Session, data interface{})
  (mask SessionState, rw io.ReadWriter, cache interface{}, err error)
</code></pre><p>Because the negotiator can’t change the session state if it’s written in another
package (since the session state bits aren’t exported), it returns any changes
it wants to be made to the session such as the new session state mask, or any
changes to the underlying reader and writer (eg. if we negotiate StartTLS it
might return a new reader and writer that speak TLS).
The internal code that calls the negotiator function can then create a new
session with the requested changes.</p>
<p>The builtin negotiator can be created with <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#NewNegotiator"><code>NewNegotiator</code></a> and supports
various options such as setting the stream language and copying the input and
output streams somewhere else (such as an XML console):</p>
<pre><code>// StreamConfig contains options for configuring the default Negotiator. 
type StreamConfig struct {
	// The native language of the stream.
	Lang string

	// S2S causes the negotiator to negotiate a server-to-server (s2s) connection.
	S2S bool

	// A list of stream features to attempt to negotiate.
	Features []StreamFeature

	// If set a copy of any reads from the session will be written to TeeIn and
	// any writes to the session will be written to TeeOut (similar to the tee(1)
	// command).
	// This can be used to build an "XML console", but users should be careful
	// since this bypasses TLS and could expose passwords and other sensitve data.
	TeeIn, TeeOut io.Writer
}

// NewNegotiator creates a Negotiator that uses a collection of StreamFeatures
// to negotiate an XMPP client-to-server (c2s) or server-to-server (s2s)
// session.
// If StartTLS is one of the supported stream features, the Negotiator attempts
// to negotiate it whether the server advertises support or not.
func NewNegotiator(cfg StreamConfig) Negotiator
</code></pre><p>It uses stream features as discussed in the previous
section, but custom negotiators could be written that use a different type for
stream features, making session negotiation and stream features entirely
modular.
You could replace them with your own implementations, and still use the <code>xmpp</code>
package to handle the lower level XMPP protocol.</p>
<p>An example of a custom stream negotiator can be found in the <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/component"><code>xmpp/component</code></a>
package which negotiates a <a href="https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0114.html">XEP-0114: Jabber Component Protocol</a>
connection.</p>
<h2 id="receiving-data">Receiving Data</h2>
<p>Once the session is negotiated, we need to be able to receive stanzas (the
primitive types of XMPP) and other top level XML elements over the session.
Because the main <code>xmpp</code> package is meant to be lower level than many other XMPP
libraries written for Go, it does not contain callbacks or any way to register
handlers for different types of top level XML element.</p>
<p>Instead, it contains a single <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#Session.Serve"><code>Session.Serve</code></a> method that decodes all incoming
XML tokens and delegates handling them to a single <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp#Handler"><code>Handler</code></a>.</p>
<pre><code>// A Handler triggers events or responds to incoming elements in an XML stream.
type Handler interface {
	HandleXMPP(t xmlstream.TokenReadEncoder, start *xml.StartElement) error
}
</code></pre><p>The <code>Serve</code> method also handles stanza semantics such as always responding to
IQs as required to be compliant with the XMPP protocol.
Because the handler is provided with a stream to use when writing back to the
session, the underlying library can man-in-the-middle the token stream and check
if an IQ response was written and automatically send one if not, or add required
IDs to stanzas that are missing them.</p>
<p>This design also keeps the number of methods on the session relatively low and
keeps the entire library more modular because we can delegate multiplexing
elements to more specific handlers to other packages such as the builtin
<a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/mux"><code>xmpp/mux</code></a> package.
If a user wants a more advanced multiplexer that buffers the stream and matches
stream elements based on <a href="https://relaxng.org/">RELAX NG</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20200320131503/http://www.jclark.com/xml/xmlns.htm">Clark notation</a>, or <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/all/">XPath</a>, they could
write it themselves and it would have all the same powers and access as the
built in muxer!
The <code>mux</code> package also provides more specific handlers for the basic XMPP stanza
types: <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/mellium.im/xmpp/mux#IQHandler"><code>IQHandler</code></a>, …</p></section></div>

<p>This post intends to showcase programming patterns, or <em>stuff</em>, which is common between Newsqueak, Alef, Plan9 C, Limbo, and Go.</p>
<p>All of these code snippets should be complete as shown and compilable/runnable in the state presented. The Alef examples might have subtle typos, but this is due to the fact I had to manually re-type them out from VirtualBox since I didn’t have copy/paste available to the guest.</p>
<p>Commentary has been inserted before examples where I believe it will be helpful.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>Articles or posts talking about Go’s predecessors have a habit of referring to the languages listed above, but can fail to provide concrete resources for seeing how these languages work. This post aims to provide a reference for such languages.</p>
<p>I find being able to play with languages and see complete programs showing how the language fits together as a whole rather than just small snippets extremely valuable for learning.</p>
<p>In particular with older languages, it can be difficult to find ways to practically experiment with the language and get a feel for the ergonomics of the error reporting, building of complex programs, etc. without having access to the compiler/interpreter/environment itself. As such, paths to being able to write in these languages have been provided for each language presented.</p>

<section data-level="1" id="camera-on-or-off-a-ux-approach-to-video-meeting-fatigue">

<section data-level="3" id="video-conferencing-is-the-new-office-living-room-dinner-table-doctors-office-"><h3>Video conferencing is the new office / living room / dinner table / doctors office...</h3>
<p>As the spaces of our social lives have transitioned to a limited number of software interfaces, fatigue and burnout has skyrocketed taxing our mental health and productivity. While video conferencing apps are keeping us employed and connected, they are not prepared to handle this mass shift in our daily routines and social interactions. </p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="what-makes-video-conferencing-so-different-"><h3>What makes video conferencing so different?</h3>
<p>When we spend our days sitting in our makeshift offices and personal spaces staring at our coworkers, friends, doctors, teachers and families (and don’t forget ourselves!) in little boxes on our screens we miss so much of the social experience of real face to face interactions. We’re unable to read body language, engage in normal social rituals, have serendipitous conversations—to move!</p>
<p>We’re also responding to a unending amount of new information that our brains need to process—our personal lives surrounding us at home, the apartments and houses of our coworkers and their personal lives happening around them, the host of distractions on our desktops and the lure of almost unnoticeable multitasking. </p>
<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/camera-ui.jpg" alt=""></p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="can-the-design-of-our-meeting-software-help-"><h3>Can the design of our meeting software help?</h3>
<p>As a UX designer working to build a video conferencing platform, it’s been crucial to acknowledge the limitations of the medium in hopes of easing some of the fatigue with features designed not to replicate in person communication but to uncover and build on the strengths of a relatively new space.    </p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="improving-our-new-space-the-meeting-room"><h3>Improving our new space - The meeting room</h3>
<p>We spend so much care and effort creating the physical spaces we occupy, and these spaces have a known effect on our mental health as well as our productivity, creativity and sociablility. A black box filled with poor quality images littered with icons can feel like spending all day in a messy room with no windows—of course we’re exhausted after a day of video meetings! But what can we do to make these new rooms feel like  sleek, light filled rooms with all the personal touches that we invest so much thought into? </p>
<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/camera-meetingroom.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>The furniture, if you will, of these new spaces is entirely different. Instead of tables, whiteboards and light switches we have new furniture that has to replicate everything else missing from in person interaction—all those icons littered about. Unmute is the desk of a virtual meeting room.</p>
<p>Designing meetings rooms for Team.video has strived to take into account interior design principles as well as UX best practices. Does a glaring red mute icon create more stress and visual clutter than it provides important functional information? Our process has been one of many iterations, focusing on light colors, subtle gradients and subdued accents.</p>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="camera-on-or-off-"><h3>Camera on or off?</h3>
<p>We’ve never been more aware of the green light at the top of our screens. In almost daily research sessions over the past few months I've yet to encounter a team that has found the golden solution to the camera on or off question. </p>
<p>Companies that had a camera on policy have switched to camera optional and those with a camera optional approach have switched to camera on. Some teams use cameras only for smaller meetings or only require those speaking to use video. </p>
<p>Camera off can feel less personal but also removes the need to process so many different faces and backgrounds at once. While being on camera for the majority of a day is incredibly exhausting and not always necessary for productive work meetings. </p>
<ul>
<li>There is probably no golden solution, but some design attention can greatly improve both sides of the coin. </li>
<li>A more aesthetically pleasing camera off view that still includes the face of a coworker and a signal when/that they are speaking. </li>
<li>Flexible layouts for different scenarios—one speaker, a handful of speakers, screenshare brainstorm etc. </li>
<li>The option to hide or minimize your own video. </li>
<li>Blurred or custom backgrounds for camera on mode—which can be a lot of fun and also a potential new distraction. </li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://team.video/uploads/cameraonoroff.png" alt=""></p>

</section>

<section data-level="3" id="meetings-start-very-abruptly"><h3>Meetings start VERY abruptly</h3>
<p>All of a sudden you’re face to face with an unfamiliar coworker, from your bedroom...and the person who called the meeting is running late. This scenario is unique to telecommuting. Maybe you regularly walk to the conference room with a coworker, or you introduce yourself politely and take the first few minutes of a meeting to fill your water bottle while everyone else arrives. </p>
<p>All of this is much more awkward over video. Small talk is less natural with mute/unmute issues, lack of non verbal cues and often bandwidth time delays. Widespread goals to keep meetings efficient encourage us to get straight to the point, which can be jarring. </p>
<p>How can UX help those first few meeting minutes? </p>
<ul>
<li>It’s important to know who is already in the meeting before you join so you can decide if you want to be one on one with a C level you’ve never met. </li>
<li>Arrive looking (and sounding!) your best with a pre-meeting ‘haircheck’ where meeting goers can check their audio/video before entering the meeting</li>
<li>Low effort social interaction built in to the welcome minutes. At team.video we’ve implemented an optional word game that early arrivers can play against each other in lieu of or in addition to any amount of small talk. </li>
</ul>

</section>
<section data-level="3" id="keep-trying-new-things-"><h3>Keep trying new things!</h3>
<p>Design is always about observing, trying and testing. With team.video we’ve been able to explore some ideas larger companies have not and we’d love to hear any thoughts or issues that you’ve encountered in our software or others! </p>

In my experience doing software consulting, I’ve seen and worked on some projects where the founders take 2 - 3 months to launch the first version of their product. That’s too much time and effort sunk into a project that may not work.</p><h2>Why you need to get your Minimum Viable Product out ASAP</h2><p>The problem is that most people are not comfortable with launching a minimum viable product. Founders are often creative people who love to explore and dive into “wouldn’t it be cool if”s. This habit can result in a continuous loop of adding features, even before the first version of your product is released.</p><p>Perfectionism can often get in the way of execution, and I’ve fallen for this trap many times. My first product (SideQuest) took me four months to build and launch. To continue developing an untested product is, to put it bluntly, arrogant. Here’s why: it assumes that what you are making is vital for your customer. It assumes that you know what’s best for your user. You don’t.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>No founder knows until they launch their startup and get feedback from people. Your first version is likely going to suck; it might even miss the mark or be utterly irrelevant to the market. You need to get any negative and positive signals from your target market as soon as possible.</p><p>That was what we tried to do with MeetButter. Everyone on our team has had experience getting burnt by wasting time, runway, effort, and emotion building products or features that were inconsequential in the larger picture.</p><p>Here’s the story of how we managed to build and ship MeetButter in three weeks.</p><h3>Step 1 - Identification</h3><figure>

    <figcaption>It started with a thread</figcaption>
  </figure><p>The first spark for MeetButter was a Slack thread discussing the pains teachers and educators were dealing with transitioning their classrooms from offline to online. We found that there was a very human problem with online video conferencing - they only allowed the focus to one speaker at a time. It was awkward interrupting the speaker, and this caused some participants to feel reluctant to engage. The discussion thread grew, with more anecdotes and feedback from our friends and family.</p><p>Identifying the problem is the first step. It’s crucial to figure out the groups of people that are facing the same issues and gathering feedback from them. </p><h3>Step 2 - Investigation</h3><p>We decided to take this asynchronous discussion and organize a synchronous brainstorm session. During this particular session, we discussed three significant problems that we had identified and were interested in solving. On the list was the aforementioned “video conferencing” - which eventually became MeetButter.</p><figure>

    <figcaption>Breaking down the current video conferencing experience</figcaption>
  </figure><p>Some significant points were brought up by everyone on the team, and we found that these were problems that each one of us had faced while doing online video conferencing:</p><ol><li>It’s difficult to indicate an interest in speaking, reply to the current conversation, or add to the discussion without feeling like you’re interrupting the current speaker.</li><li>It’s impossible to transition smoothly between one speaker to the next. Sometimes mid-sentence pauses are met with several speakers trying to enter into the conversation at once. Combined with lag, this can get quite awkward.</li><li>The avoidance of awkwardness causes some people to remain quiet.</li><li>The loudest voice in the room problem - some people naturally dominated discussions.</li><li>Social cues are almost non-existent when your entire team gets boxed into tiny windows on-screen and are only visible from their shoulder up.</li></ol><p>The purpose of this brainstorm was not to narrow down into solutions, but it was to dive deep into the problems.</p><div><p>Adam is typing something... (Click to reveal)</p><p><img src="https://adamthewan.com/static/adam-head-0b2b466e69071c2bd52efa9911165bc6.png"></p></div><h3>Step 3 - Sketching</h3><p>After the brainstorm session, we discussed some ideas on how to tackle the problem. Solutions can seem pretty vague, and usually, what happens is that several keywords get thrown around. For us, it was “queue,” “overlay,” and “polls.” It’s good to note that people often visualize keywords differently and form very different concepts in their heads. </p><p>A picture is worth a thousand words. Sketching is an essential skill to learn for any founder, as it’s the best medium to transfer your ideas with a low signal-noise ratio. People often misunderstand your words. If you’re not good at drawing, it’s good to learn how to sketch out a prototype digitally using free tools like Figma. I have even used Google Slides to build a low fidelity prototype for a client once! Sometimes I even screenshot parts of other apps and combine them into a Frankenstein of an image - anything to help bridge the gap between your vision and their imagination.</p><figure>

    <figcaption>Sketch of the app that turned into MeetButter</figcaption>
  </figure><p>Based on the feedback and ideas from the team, this was the very first sketch for MeetButter that I built using Figma. After sharing it on our team Slack, we held a meeting to discuss the steps moving forward. We decided to cut out some features and instead focus on the queuing functionality as we were able to test it internally during our daily standup calls.</p><h3>Step 4 - Prototyping</h3><p>I won’t go into too much detail about how we built the prototype. This step will be different for every team: some teams will opt to do a no-code prototype using tools like AirTable and Google Forms; some will choose to do a “simulated” prototype using Figma or Zeplin; some will opt to build a fully functioning albeit minimal prototype using code. We decided to do the latter as it was the fastest for me to code something quickly.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>Once you have your prototype, you need to get it in front of some test users. Finding test users can be tricky.  Ideally, the test users should be from within your team; this was the case for us with MeetButter. It meant that we were building a product for ourselves, that we were part of our target market. Building a product to solve your problems has some apparent benefits: </p><ol><li>It creates a shorter and more efficient feedback loop.</li><li>It’s easier to innovate on issues you face</li><li>It somewhat validates your market.</li></ol><p>If you are building a product that’s not for yourself, I’d suggest finding at least ten people within your networks who can become your loyal test users.</p><p>MeetButter was also super easy to integrate into our daily workflow. All we had to do was open up the web app during our regular standup calls. It’s essential to build some sort of feedback loop. I sent a Google Form to the participants of the meeting to gather initial feedback as soon as the meeting ended - it’s best to strike while the iron is hot. We also had several Slack threads discussing additional ideas that came up as we continued testing.</p><h3>Step 6 - Reiteration</h3><p>After testing our prototype, we collected the feedback and went back to the drawing board. At this point, you have to make a clear decision with your prototype - do you continue to reiterate, or do you kill the project? We found that our prototype worked quite well, and although we were skeptical, there was a sense that we were onto something. We started using the prototype in every meeting, so it was hard to deny that our team internally found it useful.</p><figure>

  </figure><p>We repeated the process of designing, reiterating, and receiving feedback several times. Our testing group grew from our internal team of five people out to our friends within our social circles.</p><h3>Final Step - Launch</h3><p>After a few rounds of iterations, our prototype slowly shed its pieces and morphed into something resembling a product. As soon as we exhausted our immediate networks, we knew that the next step was to launch MeetButter beyond internal test users.</p><p>I began to lay the groundwork for a codebase that could grow into a scalable project. Our tech stack ended up being the following:</p><ul><li>Frontend - NextJS with Redux and GraphQL</li><li>Backend - A mix of Firebase and an Express server that’s powered by Apollo GraphQL and Sequelize</li><li>Infrastructure - We used Netlify and AWS to deployment</li></ul><figure>

  </figure><p>Several factors allowed us to build and ship MeetButter quickly.</p><p>Firstly, we were fortunate to have had the experience and the skills to execute quickly. We didn’t run into many technical limitations, as each one of us had filled the significant roles that were needed. These roles include design/UI UX, software development, and marketing/networking.</p><p>Secondly, we tried to follow the best practices for idea generation. The brainstorm that led to MeetButter wasn’t the first one that we had together. It was probably our fifth brainstorm session after getting together as a team as Project Phoenix. With a lot of practice, we were able to build a set of best practices to have productive brainstorm sessions, get feedback, and reiterate.</p><p>Thirdly, we were close to our target market, which allowed us to test fast and slowly expand our test userbase.</p><p>Fourth, we threw perfection out the window. Our prototype didn’t work 100% of the time, had a bunch of bugs, and built with the bare minimum UI. Despite this, we still used it every single day for our video calls. It was good …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
            
<p><em>Hi, I’m Edurne (Eddie), writer &amp; support intern here at Datawrapper and aspiring data journalist. Today’s Weekly Chart is about a question I’ve frequently asked myself in the last few years: can civil resistance foster social change and revolution?</em></p>
<p>Between 2017 and 2019, I had the opportunity to work as a foreign correspondent in Kenya, Japan, and Spain. It was not always easy, but I was lucky to learn many interesting things along the way. I was also constantly on the ‘wire’, reading stories from many countries and learning about their past, culture, and daily lives.</p>
<p>Even before that, while I was studying journalism, I  found myself reading and writing a lot about protests, like the <em>Umbrella Movement in Hong Kong</em> or the <em>Yellow Vests</em> (<em>Gilets Jaunes</em>) movement in France. The images from the Arab spring in 2010 stuck with me the most. And it’s not a coincidence that I read about protests so much: <a href="https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2020/03/10/political-protests-have-become-more-widespread-and-more-frequent" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the last few decades have seen an increase in campaigns</a>.</p>
<p>But not all protests are the same: There are violent and peaceful ones. I was wondering: Which of them are successful? To find out, I used data from The Non-violent and Violent Campaigns and Outcomes (<a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/navco" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAVCO</a>) project by Harvard University, the first of its kind to collect systematic data on violent insurgencies and non-violent civil resistance around the world:</p>





<p>NAVCO gathered data on 622 campaigns between 1900 and 2019. As we can see in the chart, in this time, half of the <strong>321 non-violent campaigns succeeded, while only a quarter of their 301 violent counterparts</strong> did. 56% of violent campaigns failed, compared to 30% of non-violent ones.</p>
<p>Erica Chenoweth, a researcher on violence and co-author of the NAVCO Data Project, found even more evidence that non-violent protests are more successful: “Countries in which there were nonviolent campaigns were about 10 times likelier to transition to democracies within a five-year period compared to countries in which there were violent campaigns – whether the campaigns succeeded or failed”, she explained to <a href="https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2019/02/why-nonviolent-resistance-beats-violent-force-in-effecting-social-political-change/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Harvard Gazette</a>.</p>
<p>You can search through all the 622 campaigns that the NAVCO data set contains here:</p>





<h2 id="Data-concerns">Data concerns</h2>
<p>Because it’s a data set collected by hand instead of measured, it’s important to understand the decisions behind it better.</p>
<p>Launched by Harvard University, the NAVCO Data Project covers different aspects of civil resistance and insurgencies through time. For this article, I decided to analyze the 4th iteration of the project: the <strong><a href="https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/ON9XND" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NAVCO 1.3 data set</a></strong>, released on March 17 of this year.</p>
<p>While making statements like “non-violent campaigns are more successful”, we need to bear in mind that this data set might not include all campaigns, suffering a so-called <strong>underreporting bias</strong>. The authors of the NAVCO data set also note in their codebook that the included <strong>non-violent campaigns</strong> are <strong>biased toward success:</strong> the large, mature campaigns are most commonly reported. Some non-violent campaigns are crushed in their infancy (and therefore fail) and are not included in this data set.</p>
<p>This bias has, however, been mitigated by looking only at major campaigns with at least 1,000 people participating in the protest. The dataset also only includes protests with a maximalist objective, such as bringing down a government. Despite not being perfect, the NAVCO Data Project is still a reference <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-01/hu-imo012420.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener">for many researchers and journalists</a> to analyze the effects of both violent and non-violent protests in global politics.</p>
<h2 id="The-process">The process</h2>
<p>One thing I like about data visualization (although it can be daunting) is the amount of trial and error that it requires to come up with the right chart type. The table I finally created was not close to my first idea (at the beginning I wanted to create a scatterplot or even a map!), which shows that visualization can be really rich in variety as well!</p>
<p>Before looking at the data set, I started with a blank piece of paper and wrote down my initial questions. I believe this step comes from my journalistic background: <strong>I treat data sets as interviewees</strong>. The main question – are non-violent protests more or less successful than violent ones? – was easily answered with a pivot table in Google Sheets.</p>
<p>The main work needed to be done on the Datawrapper table. To help readers navigate this big amount of data, I opted for the use of <strong>emojis</strong> in the <strong>“Success”</strong> column. Now you just need a glance to know how the campaign ended. I also decided to bring ongoing campaigns to the front of the table, since those are the insurgencies and protests that are happening at the moment and people have likely been reading about them in the last few years. Finally, I decided to <strong>highlight the non-violent campaigns that ended up in success</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="References">References</h2>

<li>Some Datawrapper Academy articles on <a href="https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/247-examples-of-datawrapper-tables" target="_blank" rel="noopener">examples of tables</a>, how to format your text in <a href="https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/191-how-to-format-your-text-with-markdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Markdown</a> and how to insert <a href="https://academy.datawrapper.de/article/144-how-to-insert-flag-icons-in-tables" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flag icons in tables</a> also helped a lot with this article.</li>

<p><em>And that’s all for this week! I hope you enjoyed my first article here at Datawrapper. I would love to hear your thoughts on how to spark a revolution! Do you support any political movement? Is there any civil resistance group that you are particularly interested in? Leave a comment below or send me an email at <a href="mailto:edurne@datawrapper.de">edurne@datawrapper.de</a>.

I was never really sure about how to drive any deep conversations or connect with another person. As an introvert, every time I tried doing so, my self-doubt and social anxiety would creep in. I felt as if I might sound extremely weird, boring, or that the other person might judge me. These thoughts kept me from freely opening up about myself.</p><p>I often thought: “If I manage to be good at my work and communicate the same, it should be enough to reach where I want to. Why make deep conversations?”.</p><p><span>- Advertisement -</span> <ins data-ad-layout="in-article" data-ad-format="fluid" data-ad-client="ca-pub-1198872678846288" data-ad-slot="2989761355"></ins> </p><p>Thus, I often neglected my interpersonal skills.</p><h2>Plot twist – The story that led me to reconsider things</h2><p>In my final year of school, I found myself clouded with many negative thoughts. This even affected my academic performance. I started oversleeping. I could not find anyone to share my thoughts with. I constantly had the fear that no one would relate to me.</p><div><p>However, I learned to deal with those thoughts during my drop year by connecting with spirituality and analyzing things deeply. It also made me realize that things needed to change. I was not going to keep to myself.</p><p>So, when my college started, as part of my growth plan, I decided to go out of my comfort zone every time I got the chance. I had several great conversations with my colleagues, members in communities and conferences, and even those pursuing completely different career paths. As a result, I found some great mentors, lifetime buddies, and many meaningful connections who continue to inspire me.</p></div><p>All throughout, I have realized some common behavioral patterns while having these conversations. I now find myself a lot more comfortable walking into situations and striking a conversation, or even driving them with no/minimal anxiety.</p><h3><strong>But why should I be good at this art of deep conversations and have meaningful connections?</strong></h3><p>You are ultimately going to work with people and for people, directly or indirectly. You have to learn to empathize.</p><p>It enables you to do better teamwork and bring out great products.</p><p>On a personal level, meaningful connections are liberating. They can help accelerate your process of knowing yourself better and also help keep your stress levels in check.</p><p>We all help each other grow. You learn to support the people around you even if you cannot fix their problems.</p><p>The list can go on.</p><p>All this prompted me to reflect on things that worked out. I was eventually able to derive 15 lessons that I will be sharing in this blog post.</p><p>I am not claiming to be an expert, there are still many lessons to be learned. But I hope these lessons help you out if you struggle with having a great conversation with anyone. Or if you are having trouble in maintaining meaningful connections, the way I used to do.</p><p>Some of these points are great life advice too.</p><h2>1. Accept yourself the way you are</h2><p>Yes, it all starts with you!</p><div><p>Over the years, I have realized that self-acceptance helps you comfortably become a part of any conversation. When you start being true to yourself and embrace your uniqueness, it solves your self-esteem issues. And you stop seeking validation from others. </p><p>Self-exploration takes time.</p></div><p>Enjoy your own company. Reflect upon your strengths, weaknesses, values, ambitions, behavior, and things you need to fix within yourself. This would keep on evolving as you continue to learn, unlearn, and relearn things.</p><p>Know that you matter, that you can add value and your story is worth listening to. Give yourself those affirmations you seek from others.</p><p>Do not try to imitate a person. If their personality inspires you, bring their good habits/traits into your routine, and see what works out best for you!</p><h2>2. Be curious</h2><p>Being curious definitely helps you professionally. Curiosity helps in grasping new concepts and exploring how different things work. It can also do wonders on a personal level. Approaching every interaction with genuine curiosity helps you connect better with others, including strangers, and drive conversations naturally.</p><p><span><em><strong>“When curiosity is alive, we are attracted to many things; we discover many worlds.”</strong></em></span> <em>–Eric Booth</em></p><div><p>Being curious makes you more observant. You tend to actively listen and take a genuine interest. It drives you to ask better and more intriguing questions that make people think. For example –</p><p>Let us say someone mentions one of their future goals as moving out to US/Germany and work there. You can respond in two ways:</p></div><div><p>“Oh, amazing. I hope that happens soon.”</p><p>or:</p></div><p>“That sounds great. Though I would love to know what made you choose US/Germany over any other country. Have you been there before? Or anything specific you admire about them?”</p><div><p>The first phrase would rush your conversation directly to the end. The second one will drive the flow naturally. It will make the other person open up more. You can end up learning new things about these countries that you were not aware of. </p><p><strong>Curiosity makes you look beyond superficial</strong>. You do not assume. You seek clarity for things you might have misunderstood.</p></div><div><p>But, avoid being too interrogative and prefer open ended-questions over simple yes/no ones.</p><p>Socially engineer the other person, appear more open and interested. I do not think I can explain it better than Gilfoyle explaining it in this episode of Silicon Valley xD</p></div><figure><p> <iframe title="Silicon Valley - Gilfoyle vs HR [Part 2]" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItFi_08B4wc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><p>(I just love this character from Silicon Valley.)</p><h2>3. Learn to empathize with others</h2><p>“<em>Empathizing is the ability to understand emotions in others and share their feelings</em>”.</p><p>Empathizing is important. You should try actively listening to a person and imagining yourself in their situation to see how they would have felt. Recognize their emotion, understand, and acknowledge their pain points.</p><div><p>Sharing your own experiences instead of critiquing. A shared perspective makes the other person feel understood. It builds a level of trust with the other person. You can learn to empathize by starting to acknowledge and naming your own feelings when you have them.</p><p>Do not sympathize, <strong>Empathize! </strong></p></div><p><strong>Few things to keep in mind:</strong> Empathizing doesn’t require you to always have a solution to someone else’s problem. Rather, it is listening to them actively. Make them feel understood, which will prompt them to open up and seek advice.</p><p>Here is an interesting <a href="https://medium.com/@lauraclick/want-to-be-more-empathetic-avoid-these-7-responses-21bb52d5d2ad" target="_blank" aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">read</a> on empathy and how to empathize in different situations.</p><p><strong>What if the other person is way too negative about things that annoy you?!</strong><br>In such cases, be honest with them by conveying how you feel about it. You don’t always need to agree with the other person to acknowledge their perspective. If a person just repeatedly complains without taking any action, you know they are someone you will not connect with deeply and that’s totally OK.</p><h2>4. Allow yourself to be vulnerable</h2><div><p>As per a research conducted by Dr. Brene Brown, vulnerability is the root of human connection. Yet, we are taught to hide our true emotions, struggles, and portray ourselves as a “normal” confident being. We avoid being vulnerable due to the fear of getting betrayed. Or as quoted by Dr. Brown – minimizing <strong>“<em>uncertainty, risk and emotional exposure</em>”.</strong></p><p>I highly recommend watching the widely viewed Ted talks by Dr. Brown to learn the Power of vulnerability:</p></div><figure><p> <iframe title="The power of vulnerability | Brené Brown" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iCvmsMzlF7o?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><p>As she mentions, when we allow ourselves to be vulnerable, it opens us to joy, love, gratitude, empathy, and connection. Vulnerability is not about disclosing a big, dark secret but saying things that are difficult for you to share. It is not a sign of weakness but rather <em>indicates that you are strong enough to admit your true emotions</em>. It is OK to feel low, to show your humanistic side.</p><p>There is also a price that we pay for invulnerability:</p><figure><p> <iframe title="The price of invulnerability: Brené Brown at TEDxKC" width="696" height="392" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UoMXF73j0c?start=685&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure><p><em>If you want the other person to open up, you yourself need to be vulnerable first</em>. Everyone wants to be heard. They just need a safe space and trust factor to talk about their struggles.</p><p>Put your ego and pride aside. Do not try to always be in control. When you allow yourself to be vulnerable first, you create this safe space for the other person to do the same naturally. But, never mishandle this information or use it against that person, it can make them feel worse.</p><p>We choose to sympathize to avoid feeling vulnerable. Empathizing (#3) requires a sense of vulnerability and sharing your own story. But do not overshare or dwell too much on the negative. Have a sense of awareness as to when to open up.</p><h2>5. You cannot please everybody, and you should not even try to</h2><p>While on the journey of forming long-lasting meaningful connections, it is essential to get rid of toxicity. Stay careful about who you get close to. I am very thankful to a friend who gave me this bold advice last year while going through a sour experience:</p><div><p>Leave people who drain your energy and those who do not add any value. The people who bear unusual behavior that makes you feel uncomfortable and who do not respect your boundaries even if you have clearly stated them are best avoided. </p><p>The way you want to be treated is totally in your hands. Never compromise on your mental peace.</p></div><p> <strong>“<em>Do not deny the signs, vibes, and energy you feel about certain people and situations. If it’s not right, it’s not right.”</em></strong><em> – Idil Ahmed</em></p><p>There is another perspective to this point, in terms of the effect of the ease with which we connect via social media at our fingertips. You do not need to be available all the time to reply to messages. Many people time your responses, expecting you to reply within minutes. But, those who really wish to connect must respect your time. They should understand that you might be occupied. They will surely reach out again or call you up for any urgent help instead of taking things in a negative way. Never compromise on your “me” time.</p><h2>6. Do not beat yourself up</h2><p>If a conversation went awkward or did not go as expected, that does not mean that you are awkward. There might be many hidden factors around it, due to which it did not go well. Do not give it a lot of thought. If you did something embarrassing, laugh at your own mistakes. Derive the lessons from that interaction and move on.</p><p>No …</p></div></div></div>

Curiosity focused on gauging the past habitability of Gale Crater, finding an ancient, <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/news/1438/nasa-rover-finds-conditions-once-suited-for-ancient-life-on-mars/" target="_blank">potentially habitable river and intermittent lake system</a>. Like its closely-related predecessor, Perseverance will also gauge habitability of its landing region (Jezero Crater, a <a href="https://www.universetoday.com/145889/nasas-perseverance-rover-is-going-to-jezero-crater-which-is-looking-better-and-better-as-a-place-to-search-for-evidence-of-past-life-on-mars/" target="_blank">paleo-lakebed with preserved river delta and sediments</a>). But, it will go further by directly hunting for ancient microbial biosignatures (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperCam#LIBS" target="_blank">with lasers!</a>) and <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/surface-operations/" target="_blank">storing the most interesting samples in 20 sealed caches on the Martian surface</a> for a future sample return mission (tentatively launching in 2026). Perseverance is phenomenally complex, its Sample Caching System alone <a href="http://www.parabolicarc.com/2020/06/03/the-extraordinary-sample-gathering-system-of-nasas-perseverance-mars-rover/" target="_blank">contains 3,000+ parts and two robotic arms</a>. Perseverance is based on Curiosity’s design, but has <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/wheels/" target="_blank">redesigned &amp; more durable aluminum wheels</a>, better <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/landing/" target="_blank">skycrane</a> and <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/timeline/landing/entry-descent-landing/" target="_blank">landing navigation</a> systems, additional improved cameras, Mars’ <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/rover/microphones/" target="_blank">first microphones</a>, a larger drill (that can “<a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7555" target="_blank">cut intact rock cores, rather than pulverizing them</a>”), an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_Oxygen_ISRU_Experiment" target="_blank">ISRU experiment</a> that makes oxygen from CO2, more advanced autonomous navigation, and a very <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/spacecraft/instruments/" target="_blank">different set of instruments</a>. Both rovers are powered by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-mission_radioisotope_thermoelectric_generator" target="_blank">Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator</a> (MMRTG), allowing full time operation, with Perseverance carrying a unit left over from Curiosity. Oh, and Perseverance has a <a href="https://mars.nasa.gov/technology/helicopter/" target="_blank">helicopter drone</a> (cf. <a href="https://orbitalindex.com/archive/2020-05-12-Issue-64/" target="_blank">Issue 64</a>)! Perseverance is scheduled to launch at <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/jpl/the-launch-is-approaching-for-nasas-next-mars-rover-perseverance" target="_blank">9:15 a.m. EDT July 20</a>—any later than mid-August and it’ll need to wait two years for the next Mars launch window. If the flight goes as planned, it will land in Mars' Jezero Crater on Feb. 18, 2021.</p></div><!--[if mso]> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]></table><![endif]--></div><div> <!--[if mso]><table align="left" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" width="100%" style="width:100%;"><tr> <![endif]--> <!--[if mso]><td valign="top" width="600" style="width:600px;"> <![endif]--><div><p><strong id="how-would-the-mars-sample-return-mission-work">How would the Mars Sample Return mission work?</strong> NASA recently <a href="https://spaceflightnow.com/2020/04/20/nasa-narrows-design-for-rocket-to-launch-samples-off-of-mars/" target="_blank">settled on a solid-fuel design</a> for their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV), the small (max 400 kg), two-stage rocket that will hopefully carry the samples, left on the surface of Jezero Crater by Perseverance, into orbit. Once there, it will perform the first autonomous rendezvous between two spacecraft beyond the Earth-Moon system, and transfer its samples into the care of <a href="https://www.esa.int/Science_Exploration/Human_and_Robotic_Exploration/Exploration/Europe_prepares_for_Mars_courier" target="_blank">ESA’s electrically-propelled Earth Return Orbiter</a> (ERO).

There are of course a variety of factors as to why. But one commonality they share is the extreme focus on making </span><b>important</b><span> tasks take close to </span><b>zero time and effort </b><span>using their products. </span><span>Even when it’s at the expense of great pain by the product team such as the </span><a href="https://medium.com/@stewart/we-dont-sell-saddles-here-4c59524d650d">attention to every pixel at Slack</a><span>. Or at great financial cost such as improving battery life by a few minutes through </span><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/273006/apple-expenses-for-research-and-development/">multi-billion dollar R&amp;D budgets at Apple</a><span>. These companies won people over by choice in heavily saturated spaces. Markets that numerous giants operated in long before them. So how did they know what to build and when to keep investing?</span></p><p><span>While analyzing 10s of products and iterating with 100s of millions of users at companies like Microsoft, Amazon, and smaller startups I’ve developed a battle tested theory of how. A lot of ideas are cross applied to product from statistics, machine learning, and AI since that’s what my background is in. </span><span>By putting this theory to practice you can assess exactly how every change within your product affects the various markets your customers are representative of. It also lets you evaluate if your product is easy to use with quantitative certainty.</span></p><p><span>It’s important to point out the nuances of this approach and what it doesn’t do. Not all products have to be easy to use to build a company around them. Look at Salesforce and any IBM product. They just have to make important tasks easier than today for people you know how to sell to. </span><span>Also, there’s still no shortcut to figuring out what to build other than qualitative research with real people, probing markets with an MVP, and learning about a domain. </span></p><p>What this theory does help you with is evaluating the worth of your solution within different markets that use your product. It can also inspire ideas by highlighting what your existing user base already “hacks” with your product. Lastly, by observing exactly how various personas in your product react to changes you build you can understand what’s important to them so you know what areas to focus on.</p><p><span>I, along with my 2 co-founders believed in this theory so much that we all quit our $200k-300k jobs at Microsoft over 2 years ago in order to productize it at </span><a href="https://productmarketfit.ai/"><span>ProductMarketFit.AI</span></a><span>. Our goal is to make it accessible to everybody including side projects, startups, and consultants without requiring hiring a 25 person data science team like larger enterprises do.</span></p><p><span>I’m going to split this post into 2 parts. Part 1 is focused on:</span></p><ol><li>Building survival vs. pleasure technology</li><li><span>Evaluating ease of use quantitatively&nbsp;</span></li></ol><p><span>Part 2 is focused on:</span></p><ol><li><span>Evaluating the importance of tasks for your user base</span></li><li><span>Probing markets with your product</span></li></ol><p><span> I’m always growing and learning so I look forward to all types of discussion. Feel free to reach out to me on any platform. Now to it.</span></p><p><span>The reason humans do anything roughly falls into two buckets:</span></p><ol><li><span>Survival</span></li><li><span>Pleasure</span></li></ol><p><span>We brush our teeth, earn money, and sleep so we can continue pain-free existence. When there’s time to spare we long for love, revel in our accomplishments, and get dopamine hits from entertainment.</span></p><p><span>When negative experiences such as a crappy boss, loneliness, boring tasks, and an aching back invade our experience we lose pleasure in life. Small pains grow into big ones through repetition and large pains can quickly eat away at our happiness.</span></p><p><b>Happiness over time</b></p><p><img data-attachment-id="791" data-permalink="https://philippcannons.com/the-theory-behind-making-something-people-want/product-technical-happiness-over-time/" data-orig-file="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2560/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-scaled.jpg" data-orig-size="2560,1158" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Product &amp; Technical – Happiness over time" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-300x136.jpg" data-large-file="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-1024x463.jpg" src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2560/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-scaled.jpg" data-src="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2560/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1158" data-srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2560/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-300x136.jpg 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-1024x463.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-768x347.jpg 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-1536x695.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-2048x927.jpg 2048w" data-sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px" srcset="https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2560/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_300/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-300x136.jpg 300w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1024/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-1024x463.jpg 1024w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_768/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-768x347.jpg 768w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_1536/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-1536x695.jpg 1536w, https://cdn.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lossy,ret_img,w_2048/https://philippcannons.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Product-Technical-Happiness-over-time-2048x927.jpg 2048w"></p><hr><p><b>In one statement:</b></p><p><i><span>Humans strive to maximize the longevity of their positive subjective experience.</span></i></p><hr><p><span>The point of technology is to make survival easy and maximize pleasure.

Are there not people who love their work? Survival is hardly the word that comes to mind of why Warren Buffet works.

It is the long tail of wants. There are of course obvious ones which directly tie into our visceral pleasure center such as food and sex. I would argue they make up a relatively small portion of our time.

<b>Abstract.</b> ACM's 2018 A.M. Turing Award was about
<em>deep learning</em> in artificial neural networks.
ACM lauds the awardees for work based on algorithms
and conceptual foundations first published by other researchers 
whom the awardees failed to cite
(see </a><a href="#exec">Executive Summary</a>
and Sec. 
<a href="#I">I</a>,
<a href="#V">V</a>, 
<a href="#II">II</a>,
<a href="#XII">XII</a>,
<a href="#XIX">XIX</a>, 
<a href="#XXI">XXI</a>,
<a href="#XIII">XIII</a>, 
<a href="#XIV">XIV</a>,  
<a href="#XX">XX</a>, 
<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>).
ACM explicitly mentions "astonishing" deep learning breakthroughs in 4 fields:
<a href="#A"> (A) speech recognition</a>, 
<a href="#B">(B) natural language processing</a>, 
<a href="#C">(C) robotics</a>, 
<a href="#D">(D) computer vision</a>,
as well as "powerful" new deep learning tools in 3 fields: 
<a href="#VII">(VII) medicine, astronomy, materials science</a>.
Most of these breakthroughs and tools, however, were directly based on 
the results of my own labs in the past 3 decades 
 (e.g., Sec.  
<a href="#A">A</a>,
<a href="#B">B</a>,
<a href="#C">C</a>,
<a href="#D">D</a>,
<a href="#VII">VII</a>,
<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>,
<a href="#VI">VI</a>,
<a href="#XVI">XVI</a>). 
I correct ACM's distortions of deep learning history (e.g., Sec. 
<a href="#II">II</a>,  
<a href="#V">V</a>, 
<a href="#XX">XX</a>,
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>) 
and also 
mention 8 of our direct priority disputes 
with Bengio &amp; Hinton (Sec.  <a href="#XVII">XVII</a>, <a href="#I">I</a>).

<em>This document (~11,000 words)
reuses and expands some of the material in my <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/critique-honda-prize-hinton.html">Critique of the 2019 Honda Prize</a> <a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a> (~3,000 words). 
It has several layers of hierarchical abstraction: 
<b><a href="#abstract">Abstract</a></b> (150 words), <b><a href="#exec">Executive Summary with links to details</a></b> (~1,000 words), <b><a href="#I">Body with 21 comments on 21 claims by ACM</a></b> (~7,700 words) and <b><a href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></b> (~1,700 words). 
All backed up by  <a href="#References">over 200 references</a> (~6,500 words).
</em>

</p><hr>


<p>We must stop crediting the wrong people for inventions made by others.
Instead let's heed the recent call in the journal <em>Nature</em>:
<b>"Let 2020 be the year in which we value those who ensure that 
science is self-correcting"</b> <a href="#SV20">[SV20]</a>.
Like those who know me can testify, finding and citing original sources of scientific and technological innovations is important to me, whether they are mine or other people's <a href="#DL1">[DL1]</a> <a href="#DL2">[DL2]</a> <a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a> <a href="#NASC1">[NASC1-9]</a>. The present page is offered as a resource for computer scientists who share this inclination. 
By grounding research in its true intellectual foundations and crediting the original inventors, 
I am not diminishing important contributions made by popularizers of those inventions. 
My goal is to encourage the entire community to be more scholarly in its efforts, to recognize the foundational work that sometimes gets lost in the frenzy of modern AI and machine learning,
and to fight plagiarism in all of its more or less subtle forms. 
I am also inviting others to contribute additional relevant 
references (send them to <em>juergen@idsia.ch</em>). 



</p><p> I will focus on 
contributions praised by
ACM's official justification <a href="#T19">[T19]</a> of the 
2018 A.M. Turing Award for Drs. Bengio &amp; Hinton &amp; LeCun  <a href="#R1">[R1]</a> 
 published in 2019.
After the <a href="#exec">Executive Summary</a>,
ACM's full text <a href="#T19">[T19]</a> is split into 21 parts  
labeled by "<b>ACM:</b>" 
<a href="#I">I</a>, 
<a href="#II">II</a>, 
<a href="#III">III</a>, 
<a href="#IV">IV</a>,
<a href="#V">V</a>,
<a href="#VI">VI</a>,

<a href="#XVII">XVII</a>,
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>,
<a href="#XIX">XIX</a>,
<a href="#XX">XX</a>,
<a href="#XXI">XXI</a>.
Each part is followed by a critical "<b>Comment</b>." 
Most of the comments are based on references to original papers and other material from
 recent 
blog posts <a href="#MIR">[MIR]</a> <a href="#DEC">[DEC]</a>  <a href="#HIN">[HIN]</a>.
<b>I'll point out 
that  highly cited publications of the awardees ignored fundamental 
relevant prior work—this may be the reason for some of  ACM's misattributions.</b>
Since ACM's text is a bit repetitive and redundant, so are the partially overlapping
sections of  my critique.

Executive Summary (~1000 words, with links to details)
<hr>
</a></h2><a name="exec">

</a><p><a name="exec">
While Drs. LeCun &amp; Bengio &amp; Hinton (<b>LBH for short</b>)  
have made  useful improvements of algorithms for 
artificial neural networks (<b>NNs</b>) 
and deep learning (e.g., </a><a href="#I">Sec.  I</a>), ACM lauds
them for more visible 
work based on fundamental methods whose inventors they did not cite,
not even in later surveys
(this may actually explain some of  ACM's misattributions). I correct ACM's distortions of deep learning history.
Numerous <a href="#References">references</a> can be found under the relevant section links I-XXI 
which adhere to the sequential order of ACM's text <a href="#T19">[T19]</a>
(while this summary groups related sections together).


</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#II">II</a>:</b> 
In contrast to ACM's claims, 
NNs for pattern recognition etc. were introduced long before the 1980s. 
 <b>Deep learning with multilayer perceptrons started in 1965</b> through Ivakhnenko &amp; Lapa
long before LBH who have never cited them, not even in recent work.
<b>In the 1980s,</b> "modern" gradient-based learning 
worked only for rather shallow NNs,
<b>but it became really deep in 1991 in my lab,</b>
first through 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%201">unsupervised pre-training of NNs</a>, 
then through 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">supervised LSTM</a>.
<b>Sec.  <a href="#I">I</a></b> contains 4 subsections 
<b><a href="#A">A</a>, <a href="#B">B</a>, <a href="#C">C</a>, <a href="#D">D</a></b>
on <b>the  4 deep learning "breakthroughs" explicitly 
mentioned by ACM</b>. ACM does not mention that they were 
mostly based on deep learning techniques of my team:

</p><p>
<b>Sec.
<a href="#A">A: Speech Recognition</a></b> (see also <a href="#VI">VI</a> &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a> &amp; <a href="#XV">XV</a>): The first superior end-to-end neural speech recognition 
combines two methods from my lab: <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">LSTM</a> (1990s-2005) and CTC (2006), applied to speech in 2007. 
Hinton (2012) and Bengio (<a href="#XV">XV</a>)
still used an old hybrid approach of the 1980s and 90s;
Hinton et al. (2012) did not compare it to 
our revolutionary CTC-LSTM (<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">which was soon on most smartphones</a>).

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#B">B: Natural Language Processing</a></b> (see also  <a href="#VI">VI</a> &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a> &amp;  <a href="#XVI">XVI</a>): 
The first superior end-to-end neural machine translation  
(<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/impact-on-most-valuable-companies.html">soon used for several billions of
translations each day by the big platform companies</a>)
was also based on our <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%204">LSTM</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#C">C: Robotics</a></b>.
Our LSTM trained by <b>Reinforcement Learning</b> (RL) was also the core of the 
most visible breakthroughs in robotics and video games.

</p><p>
<b>Sec. <a href="#D">D: Computer Vision</a></b>
(see also   
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a> &amp; <a href="#XIV">XIV</a>  &amp; <a href="#XI">XI</a>  &amp;  <a href="#VI">VI</a>)
was revolutionized by <b>convolutional NNs</b> (CNNs).
The basic CNN architecture is due to Fukushima (1979). 
NNs with convolutions were later (1987) combined by Waibel with backpropagation and weight sharing, 
and applied to speech. <b>All before</b> LeCun's CNN work  (<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a>).
We showed twice (1991-95 and 2006-10) that 
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">deep NNs 
don't need unsupervised 
pre-training</a> (in contrast to Hinton's claims). Our team (Ciresan et al.)  
made CNNs fast &amp; deep enough for  
<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/computer-vision-contests-won-by-gpu-cnns.html">superior computer vision  in 2011</a>,
<b>winning 4 image recognition contests in a row
before Hinton's team won one</b>. ResNet (ImageNet 2015 winner)
is a special case of our earlier <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/highway-networks.html">Highway Nets</a>.

</p><p>
<b>Sec.  <a href="#XIV">XIV:</a></b>
Again ACM recognizes work that failed to cite the pioneers.
Long before Hinton (2012), Hanson (1990) had a variant of <b>dropout</b>, 
and v. d. Malsburg (1973) had <b>rectified linear neurons</b>; Hinton did not cite them.
Already in 2011,
our deep &amp; fast CNN  more than <b>"halved the error rate for object recognition"</b> (ACM's wording) 
in a computer vision contest 
(<a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/superhumanpatternrecognition.html">where LeCun participated</a>), 
long before Hinton's similar CNN (2012). 
<b>Sec. <a href="#XI">XI</a>:</b>  ACM mentions GPU-accelerated NNs  
pioneered by Jung &amp; Oh (2004). LBH
did not cite them.
Our deep GPU-NN of 2010 debunked <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/deep-learning-miraculous-year-1990-1991.html#Sec.%2019">unsupervised pre-training (introduced by myself in 1991 and later championed by Hinton)</a>, 
and our GPU-CNN of 2011 was the first  
to win contests in <b>computer 
vision</b> (explicitly mentioned by ACM).
 

</p><p>
<b>Sec.  
<a href="#XVIII">XVIII</a></b>:
ACM credits LeCun for developing CNNs. However, the foundations of CNNs were laid earlier by 
Fukushima and Waibel  (Sec. <a href="#D">D</a>).
 ACM also explicitly mentions <b>autonomous driving</b> and <b>medical image analysis</b>.
The first team to win relevant international contests in these fields 
through deep CNNs was ours (2011, 2012, 2013).
<b>Sec.  
<a href="#VII">VII</a>:</b> ACM explicitly mentions  <b>medicine</b> and
 <b>materials science</b>. Our deep NNs were the

 in 2012 and 2013, and the first to apply deep NNs to material defect detection in industry (since 2010).

Hinton has never cited him.
<b>Sec. <a href="#XX">XX</a>:</b> ACM credits LeCun for work on

<b>automatic differentiation</b> which did not cite its inventor Linnainmaa (1970). 
And also for work on
<b>deep learning for graphs</b> that failed to cite 
the earlier work  by Sperduti &amp; Goller &amp; Küchler &amp; Pollack.

 		<p>“Use managed services.”</p>
<p>If there was one piece of advice I wish I could shout from the mountains to all cloud engineers, this would be it.</p>
<p>Operations, especially operations at scale, are a hard problem. Edge cases become commonplace. Failure is rampant. Automation and standardization are crucial. People with experience running software and hardware at this scale tend to be rare and expensive. The mistakes they’ve made and situations they’ve learned from aren’t easy to pick up.</p>
<p>When you use a managed service from one of the major cloud vendors, you’re getting access to all the wisdom of their teams and the power of their automation and systems, for the low price of their software.</p>
<p>A managed service is a service like AWS relational database service, Google Cloud SQL or Azure SQL Database. With all three of these services, you’re getting best of breed configuration and management for a relational database system. There’s configuration needed on your part, but hard or tedious tasks like setting up replication or backups can be done quickly and easily (take this from someone who fed and cared for a mysql replication system for years). Depending on your cloud vendor and needs, you can get managed services for key components of modern software systems like:</p>
<ul>
<li>File storage</li>
<li>Object caches</li>
<li>Message queues</li>
<li>Stream processing software</li>
<li>ETL tools</li>
<li>And more</li>
</ul>
<p>(Note that these are all components of your application, and will still require developer time to thread together.)</p>
<p>You should use managed services for three reasons.</p>
<ul>
<li>It’s going to be operated well. The expertise that the cloud providers can provide and the automation they can afford to implement will likely surpass what you can do, especially across multiple services.</li>
<li>It’s going to be cheaper. Especially when you consider employee costs. The most expensive AWS RDS instance is approximately $100k/year (full price). It’s not an apples to apples comparison, but in many countries you can’t get a database architect for that salary.</li>
<li>It’s going to be faster for development. Developers can focus on connecting these pieces of infrastructure rather than learning how to set them up and run them.</li>
</ul>
<p>A managed service doesn’t work for everyone. If you need to be able to tweak every setting, a managed service won’t let you. You may have stringent performance or security requirements that a managed service can’t meet. You may also start out with a managed service and grow out of it. (Congrats!)</p>
<p>Another important consideration is lock-in. Some managed services are compatible with alternatives (kubernetes services are a good example). If that is the case, you can move clouds. Others are proprietary and will require substantial reworking of your application if you need to migrate.</p>
<p>If you are working in the cloud and you need a building block for your application like a relational database or a message queue, start with a managed service (and self host if it doesn’t meet your needs). Leverage the operational excellence of the cloud vendors, and you’ll be able to build more, faster.</p>

Note that the emulator is over 6x slower. On an ARM Mac, the amd64 image will instead be 6x slower.</p></div><p>Why can't you update the Docker image to also support ARM? You theoretically could switch your backend to run ARM Linux. However, this would take months - renting out ARM instances, re-building all repositories, and a tense switch over. What if your hosting provider doesn't offer ARM instances with the same system requirements as x86_64? What if you complete this migration and find it runs at half the speed?</p><p>Worse, it might be impossible if your images include files downloaded off the internet, as those are often only compiled for x86_64.</p><div><p><img src="https://bmalehorn.com/static/phantomjs-615e9c8bc9d2deb5ca62a4533c1299d6.png"></p><p>An example of a Docker command that will only work on x86_64. PhantomJS does not release an arm build.</p></div><p>While moving your backend to ARM is far from impossible, it's a serious migration that you shouldn't take lightly. Getting a new laptop isn't enough justification to switch your backend architecture.</p><p>Another option is to <strong>run Docker remotely</strong>. You set up an x86_64 Linux server, then allow Docker to connect to it remotely. From then on, all Docker commands instead run on the server. This is also supported in Docker, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-a-remote-docker-server-to-speed-up-your-workflow">here</a> is a tutorial on setting it up. This is what heavy Docker users will want to do.</p><h2>VirtualBox</h2><p><img src="https://bmalehorn.com/static/virtualbox-c37e4cc82b13d3c1c080f7ced273ae45.png" width="150"></p><p><strong>VirtualBox won't work.</strong></p><p>VirtualBox is a <strong>hypervisor</strong>. Therefore, <strong>it won't be able to run x86 Windows or x86 Linux</strong>.</p><p>You could use VirtualBox to run ARM Windows. Windows already supports ARM, and has a similar binary translation system to Apple's, so it can run x86 binaries. However, VirtualBox only supports x86 hosts and guests and is <a href="https://forums.virtualbox.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&amp;t=98742">unlikely to be ported by ARM</a>.</p><p>VMWare Fusion similarly is a hypervisor that only support x86, but <a href="https://twitter.com/VMwareFusion/status/1275483803536908288?s=20">they're thinking about supporting ARM</a>.</p><p>Instead of VirtualBox you might use QEMU, an emulator. However, QEMU is pretty low level and not often used to emulate Windows.</p><h2>Boot Camp</h2><p><img src="https://bmalehorn.com/static/boot-camp-f05493e57b0fe815dbc1d989ada98dd0.png" width="150"></p><p><strong>Boot Camp won't work.</strong></p><p><a href="https://support.apple.com/boot-camp">Boot Camp</a> is an Apple-approved way to dual-boot Mac OS and Windows. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp?utm_campaign=theverge&amp;utm_content=chorus&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter">Boot Camp will definitely not be available on ARM Macs</a>. It might be added later with the ability to run ARM Windows, though Microsoft <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/24/21302213/apple-silicon-mac-arm-windows-support-boot-camp">would have to approve</a>.</p><h2>Should I get an ARM Mac?</h2><p>The point of this post isn't to say that ARM Mac is a bad idea, but to give a realistic idea of what developing on one would look like assuming nothing changes. It's possible Apple could release more virtualization tools before the ARM Mac launches.</p><p>Should you get an ARM Mac if you're a developer? If you work largely on frontend, mobile, or native apps, you'll probably be fine. But if you use virtualization often, I wouldn't recommend it. There will be a lot of problems early on, and not all of them will have solutions. My biggest concern is getting an ARM Mac and realizing I simply can't run an essential application on it.</p><p>However if you like troubleshooting these issues and are excited about ARM Mac, go for it! My plan is for those kinds of people to fix these issues.</p><p>Know something I don't? Have questions? Email me at <a href="mailto:bmalehorn@gmail.com">bmalehorn@gmail.com</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

              <p>Gatsby is one of the most popular JavaScript static site generators available. While static sites offer excellent performance, they only store state locally in the user’s browser, so they can’t provide features like user authentication natively. If you want to add authentication to your Gatsby site, FusionAuth is an excellent solution.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>In this blog post, you’ll learn how to create a Gatsby site that uses FusionAuth to allow users to log in and access their profile securely. This application will use an <a href="https://fusionauth.io/learn/expert-advice/oauth/definitive-guide-to-oauth-2#52-code-flow--pkce">OAuth Authorization Code workflow and the PKCE extension</a> to log users in and a Node application to store your access token securely. PKCE stands for Proof Key for Code Exchange, and is often pronounced “pixie”.</p>

<p>At a high level, the authorization process looks like this:</p>

      </figure>

<p>In this tutorial, you’ll walk through the process step-by-step, but if you want to download the code, it is <a href="https://github.com/fusionauth/fusionauth-example-gatsby">available on Github</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-well-cover">What we’ll cover</h2>

  <li>Setting up FusionAuth</li>
  <li>Creating a new user</li>
  <li>Creating a Node proxy application</li>
  <li>Creating a Gatsby site</li>
  <li>Conclusion and next steps</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="what-youll-need">What you’ll need</h2>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://fusionauth.io/download">FusionAuth</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node JS</a> (10+ preferred)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">npm</a> package manager</li>
  <li>Web browser</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="setting-up-fusionauth">Setting up FusionAuth</h2>
<p>Before you start writing any code, download FusionAuth and get it running on your local machine. FusionAuth is available <a href="https://fusionauth.io/download">for all major operating systems</a> or it can be <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/installation-guide/docker">run in Docker</a>.</p>

<p>Once you have FusionAuth running, log into the admin panel and create a new Application. This process <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/5-minute-setup-guide">is outlined here</a>, but you’ll need to add your application’s URLs to the OAuth configuration:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Add <code>http://localhost:9000/oauth-callback</code> to the “Authorized redirect URLs”.</li>
  <li>Add <code>http://localhost:9000</code> to the “Authorized request origin URLs”.</li>
  <li>Enter <code>http://localhost:8000</code> in the “Logout URL” field.</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll also want to save the “Client Id” and “Client secret” values as you’ll need them later.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/oauth-gatsby/application-setup.png" alt="FusionAuth configuration options for a Gatsby static site."></p>

<p>You’ll also need to create an API key. Go to “Settings”, then to “API Keys”. You may create one with adminstrative privileges for the purposes of this tutorial. For a production application, please follow the principle of least privilege and limit the endpoints available to the key. Save the API key off as you’ll need it later.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-new-user">Creating a new user</h2>
<p>To test your Gatsby-based login, you’ll need to add a new user and register them for your application in FusionAuth. From the Users page in FusionAuth, click “+” to add a user. Enter an email address and password for your new user and click the save button.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/oauth-gatsby/create-user.png" alt="Creating a new user in FusionAuth."></p>

<p>Next, click “Add registration” to link this user to the application you created in Step 1. Click the save button when you’re finished.</p>

<p><img src="https://fusionauth.io/assets/img/blogs/oauth-gatsby/register-user.png" alt="Registering a user in FusionAuth."></p>

<p>Now that a user is registered for your application, you can start building the Node app.</p>

<h2 id="creating-a-node-proxy-application">Creating a Node proxy application</h2>
<p>This project will use two separate applications: a Node app to securely store your access token and make calls to the FusionAuth API, and a Gatsby site to present information to the user. The Node app will have four endpoints:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>/login</code> - Generates the FusionAuth login URL with a PKCE challenge</li>
  <li><code>/oauth-callback</code> - Trades the one-time authorization code and PKCE verifier for an access token which is added to session storage</li>
  <li><code>/user</code> - Uses the access token and the FusionAuth <code>introspect</code> endpoint to get information about the current user</li>
  <li><code>/logout</code> - Logs the user out and destroys the session</li>
</ul>

<p>You’ll create all the endpoints first, and then you’ll see how to call them from Gatsby.</p>

<h3 id="setting-up-the-node-app">Setting up the Node app</h3>
<p>Before you get started, you need to create a new subdirectory and initialize an Express app. Use a <a href="https://fusionauth.io/blog/2020/03/10/securely-implement-oauth-in-react">similar structure to the one outlined here</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>fusionauth-gatsby
├─gatsby
├─server
└─config.js
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Your <code>config.js</code> file should contain all your FusionAuth information. Add the following to the file with your FusionAuth application’s ID, client ID, and ports:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>module.exports = {
  // FusionAuth info (copied from the FusionAuth admin panel)
  clientID: '5eb76e67-c65e-474d-ba23-4cb61b0c8414',
  clientSecret: 'BVS1NIgID3HWE5U38HYSb4DOie3UbIySOsJKLT41WWg',
  redirectURI: 'http://localhost:9000/oauth-callback',
  applicationID: '5eb76e67-c65e-474d-ba23-4cb61b0c8414',

  // Your FusionAuth api key
  apiKey: 'skAHV4mOEhz2zYQcG_5l4BkhsCzmtYTU8VGOi8Y40zo',

  // Ports
  clientPort: 8000,
  serverPort: 9000,
  fusionAuthPort: 9011
};
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Within the <code>./server</code> directory, create a new <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> app and install the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/cors">cors</a>, <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-session">session</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/request">request</a> packages.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>npm init
<span># Complete all the questions as appropriate</span>
npm <span>install </span>express cors express-session request <span>--save</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, open up your <code>package.json</code> file and add a <code>"start"</code> script:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>//</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span>
</span><span>"scripts"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"start"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"node index.js"</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>,</span><span>
</span><span>//</span><span> </span><span>...</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, create a new file in the <code>./server</code> directory called <code>index.js</code> that will initialize your Express app:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>session</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express-session</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>cors</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>cors</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>../config</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>// configure Express app and install the JSON middleware for parsing JSON bodies</span>
<span>const</span> <span>app</span> <span>=</span> <span>express</span><span>();</span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>express</span><span>.</span><span>json</span><span>());</span>

<span>// configure sessions</span>
<span>app</span><span>.</span><span>use</span><span>(</span><span>session</span><span>(</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>secret</span><span>:</span> <span>'</span><span>1234567890</span><span>'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>resave</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>
    <span>saveUninitialized</span><span>:</span> <span>false</span><span>,</span>

      <span>maxAge</span><span>:</span> <span>3600000</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>})</span>

<p>In the following sections, you’ll create the route files listed in the code above.</p>

<h3 id="creating-the-login-route">Creating the login route</h3>
<p>To generate a login URL, your application will need to create a PKCE verifier and challenge. It will send the challenge to FusionAuth via query string parameters along with your client ID and a redirect URL.</p>

<p>Using PKCE adds an additional layer of security, as it is a one time use and guarantees that the Node application that generated the challenge is the same one that sent the verifier. Normally, PKCE is used where the client cannot keep a secret, such as a single page application.</p>

<p>To generate a <a href="https://www.oauth.com/oauth2-servers/pkce/">PKCE challenge and verifier</a>, you’ll need to use some of the <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html">Node crypto functions</a>. Create a new folder in the <code>./server</code> directory called <code>helpers</code>. Add a new file called <code>pkce.js</code> to the folder. You will generate a verifier and challenge in this file:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>crypto</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>crypto</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>function</span> <span>base64URLEncode</span><span>(</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>str</span>
    <span>.</span><span>toString</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>base64</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>

    <span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>/</span><span>\/</span><span>/g</span><span>,</span> <span>"</span><span>_</span><span>"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>.</span><span>replace</span><span>(</span><span>/=/g</span><span>,</span> <span>""</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>function</span> <span>sha256</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>crypto</span><span>.</span><span>createHash</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>sha256</span><span>"</span><span>).</span><span>update</span><span>(</span><span>buffer</span><span>).</span><span>digest</span><span>()</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>generateVerifier</span> <span>=</span> <span>()</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>base64URLEncode</span><span>(</span><span>crypto</span><span>.</span><span>randomBytes</span><span>(</span><span>32</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span><span>.</span><span>generateChallenge</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>verifier</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>base64URLEncode</span><span>(</span><span>sha256</span><span>(</span><span>verifier</span><span>))</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The two exported functions, <code>generateVerifier</code> and <code>generateChallenge</code>, will be used in your login route to create a PKCE verifier. Create a new directory called <code>routes</code> in your <code>./server</code> directory and add a new file called <code>login.js</code> to it:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>router</span> <span>=</span> <span>express</span><span>.</span><span>Router</span><span>();</span>
<span>const</span> <span>config</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>../../config</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>
<span>const</span> <span>pkce</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>../helpers/pkce</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<span>router</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>/</span><span>'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>req</span><span>,</span> <span>res</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>req</span><span>.</span><span>session</span><span>.</span><span>verifier</span> <span>=</span> <span>pkce</span><span>.</span><span>generateVerifier</span><span>();</span>

  <span>// Generate the PKCE challenge</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>challenge</span> <span>=</span> <span>pkce</span><span>.</span><span>generateChallenge</span><span>(</span><span>req</span><span>.</span><span>session</span><span>.</span><span>verifier</span><span>);</span>

  <span>// Redirect the user to log in via FusionAuth</span>
  <span>res</span><span>.</span><span>redirect</span><span>(</span><span>`http://localhost:</span><span>${</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>fusionAuthPort</span><span>}</span><span>/oauth2/authorize?`</span><span>+</span>
    <span>`client_id=</span><span>${</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>clientID</span><span>}</span><span>&amp;redirect_uri=</span><span>${</span><span>config</span><span>.</span><span>redirectURI</span><span>}</span><span>&amp;response_type=code`</span><span>+</span>
    <span>`&amp;code_challenge=</span><span>${</span><span>challenge</span><span>}</span><span>&amp;code_challenge_method=S256`</span><span>);</span>
<span>});</span>

<span>module</span><span>.</span><span>exports</span> <span>=</span> <span>router</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now when users visit <code>localhost:9000/login</code> the Node app will generate a PKCE verifier and challenge, save the verifier to session storage, and redirect the user to FusionAuth with the challenge in the URL. The FusionAuth app will store this challenge and make sure that the verifier sent in the OAuth callback is valid.</p>

<h3 id="creating-the-oauth-callback">Creating the OAuth callback</h3>
<p>Once the user has entered their username and password, the FusionAuth server will check their credentials and redirect them to your Node app’s OAuth callback endpoint with an authorization code. Your app will use that code and the PKCE verifier generated in the previous step to request a <a href="https://fusionauth.io/docs/v1/tech/oauth/tokens">long-lived access token</a>.</p>

<p>Again, adding PKCE adds another layer of security by proving that the entity which sent the challenge is now requesting an access token. Your Node app will store the access token returned by FusionAuth in session storage and redirect the user to the Gatsby profile page we’ll create in the next step.</p>

<p>Create a new route called <code>oauth-callback.js</code> and add the following:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>express</span> <span>=</span> <span>require</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>express</span><span>'</span><span>);</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>I get it. Now, as you manage multiple individuals or teams, it feels like you spend most of your time in meetings or preparing for meetings. You miss the times when you sometimes had entire days to yourself to work on a project heads down. While those days will never return, you can make changes to the way you operate to maximize the time you spend freely.</p><p>But how? Glad you asked. This article contains small tips and practices that I’ve been following for years and helped me regain some of my time. I hope you can put some of these to work too!</p><h2 id="It-all-starts-with-your-calendar"><a href="#It-all-starts-with-your-calendar" title="It all starts with your calendar"></a>It all starts with your calendar</h2><p>How does your Monday morning look like? Mine goes something like this: after my morning espresso (which I perfected on a Rancilio Silvia machine), I take a look at my calendar to understand better what the week ahead holds for me. By looking at each meeting, I try to answer the following questions. Is this a meeting that I must attend? Does it have a clear agenda? Historically, was this meeting useful to me, or can I contribute to the success of this meeting? Based on these questions’ answers, I either RSVP with a No, ask for an agenda or start figuring out how to best prepare. By doing this every Monday, you not only save time for yourself for the week by declining meetings you don’t need to attend, but it also helps you better prioritize what you need to do during the week.</p><p>A tool I found especially useful for my calendar is Clockwise- it helps you to block time (and move meetings around!) on your calendar to create focus time for you and your team.</p><h2 id="Speaking-of-meetings"><a href="#Speaking-of-meetings" title="Speaking of meetings"></a>Speaking of meetings</h2><p>In my book, there shouldn’t be any meetings scheduled without a clear agenda. If there isn’t a clear agenda, attendees won’t know what we want to get out of a session.</p><p>Like most people, I love it when a meeting wraps up early, giving everyone time back. This is one of the reasons I believe meetings should always have an agenda - if we met our goals, everyone could go back to their daily routine.</p><p>With that said, I believe it’s perfectly fine for meetings to go off-topic for some time. It helps team members to gossip and, and through that, to build better work relationships. At the same time, it’s the organizer’s responsibility to jump in if it goes on for too long to make sure that we are back on track with agenda items.</p><h2 id="Delegate-delegate-and-delegate-some-more"><a href="#Delegate-delegate-and-delegate-some-more" title="Delegate, delegate and delegate some more"></a>Delegate, delegate and delegate some more</h2><p>Delegation is the process of scaling yourself horizontally. While it requires some upfront investment on your end, like helping individuals build the skills to be successful in the project you delegate to them, it saves you time in the long term.</p><p>Delegation doesn’t only save you time, but more importantly, this is how you grow talent within your company.</p><h2 id="Notify-me-about…"><a href="#Notify-me-about…" title="Notify me about…"></a>Notify me about…</h2><p>While Slack messages may seem urgent, they are usually not. Because of this, I prefer consuming Slack by pulling messages, instead of jumping on every single notification. I disable notifications for most things on Slack, and every once in a while, I go through all the Slack rooms that need my attention. At the same time, I try to be responsive to direct messages during working hours.</p><p>Don’t take me wrong, I am not picking on Slack - I follow the same principles for all the applications I use regularly, like mail clients or Twitter.</p><p>Oh, and no notifications on mobile. Ever.</p><h2 id="Have-you-tried-automating-that"><a href="#Have-you-tried-automating-that" title="Have you tried automating that?"></a>Have you tried automating that?</h2><p>Whenever I start doing a new activity, for the first few times, I do it manually. Once I have a good grasp of what the work is, I work on automating it, so I never have to do it again. Even if you only save 15 minutes weekly, that’s almost two working days annually.</p><p>A more recent example of this was when a team I manage started collecting adoption metrics. Initially, I’ve done it manually, recording all the metrics we were interested in in a spreadsheet. After a couple of times, I wrote a simple Node.js script to collect the same metrics and the script creates CSVs that only takes a few seconds to import to the spreadsheet I created previously.</p><p>When applicable, take it a step further and delegate: ask someone from your team to take ownership of the automation to gain experience from building on it.</p><hr><h2 id="Your-turn"><a href="#Your-turn" title="Your turn"></a>Your turn</h2><p>I’d love to hear from you - what practices you follow to make sure you are your most efficient self? Please share your thoughts in the comments section below!</p></div></div>]]>

A few organizations have even experienced a permanent move towards work from home (WFH) practices. While many are satisfied with the change for different reasons, others can’t seem to wait to get back to the way that work used to be. At this time, employers have to contend to the short and long-term ramifications of new working conditions and its impacts to productivity, communication, culture, cybersecurity and several other issues that have emerged as a result.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As considerations are made, organizations will need to take a holistic approach to ensure a successful transition to a new normal. Below are some of the key areas that leadership has to work with as it builds and implements a return to the office plan.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="4a9e017" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Legal &amp; Regulatory Compliance</h2></p></div><div data-id="3019c57" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been multiple public authorities at the federal, state/ provincial and municipal levels that have enacted policies to curb the spread of the pandemic and support all pillars of society. As usual, it falls onto the laps of leadership to ensure that their organization remains in compliance with said laws.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the legal environment changes internationally and nationally, organizations have to consider the legal and financial implications of adopting and complying to new policies. Further deliberation regarding the safety of the workforce need to be taken into account. At this time, companies need to be proactive by revisiting internal policies such as Health and Safety policies, WFH policies, Code of Conduct policies, and Cybersecurity policies. As such, it is essential that senior executives work in tandem with officers on the ground to understand the current atmosphere of their organization, its impact on policies and expectations, as well as ensure that enacted policies reach their desired outcomes.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="7c67953" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="360" height="240" src="https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?w=1280&amp;ssl=1 1280w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=300%2C199&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=1024%2C680&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=768%2C510&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1 360w, https://i0.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/hands-4917949_1280-min.jpg?resize=600%2C398&amp;ssl=1 600w" data-sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"></p></div></div><div data-id="651f2b8" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Sanitary and Hygiene Practices</h2></p></div><div data-id="24e74cd" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In an office environment, organizations have to consider how and whether to shoulder the costs of PPE supplies and training for its employees and customers. If that is not an option, leaders have to contend with personally owned PPE which may be inadequate or non-existent. This may pose unintended consequences that may challenge return to the office efforts and increase customer and employee exposure, potentially leading to disruptions in operations. (<span><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/technology/amazon-coronavirus-workers.html">‘Way Too Late’: Inside Amazon’s Biggest Outbreak</a></span>, NY Times).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good personal hygiene such as hand washing and social distancing remains a major part of the fight against COVID-19. To ensure good office practices and training, well positioned pamphlets, workshops, adequate infrastructure, supporting policies, and a culture of cleanliness are just a few of the major drivers of change.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Office cleanliness will remain a priority to both the organization and employees. Even if it is believed that employees are following sanitary and hygiene practices, the organization will likely need to increase the rate of commercial cleaning services throughout its establishment.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a pandemic environment, sanitary and hygiene practices are not isolated factors that are bound to stay within the secrecy of a company. For example, a <span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/coronavirus-in-germany-meat-packing-plant-covid-19-outbreak-cases-r-reproduction-rate-up-today-2020-06-22/">single meat packing plant in Germany</a></span> is believed to be behind over 1,000 confirmed cases. Even in optimal conditions, outbreaks of this nature can have a direct impact on society, economic recovery, organizational operations and even raise risks to brand value.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="b6a4e69" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Shared Space and Common Area Policies</h2></p></div><div data-id="6fae723" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Prior to the pandemic, many organizations have moved their offices to shared work spaces and common areas within offices such as water coolers, cafeteria or entertainment rooms, were seen as standard infrastructure. Nowadays, there are concerns that these areas will often involve interactions in close proximity, which can further exacerbate pandemic related risks.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To lower said risks, organizations need to consider implementing physical distancing and hygiene measures and protocols. At this time, many governmental bodies have stipulated guidelines that can be used to support organizational procedures and help organizations navigate through the reopening of their workplace. The <span><a href="https://covid19.ca.gov/industry-guidance/">State of California</a></span>, <span><a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/covid/covid-19-businesses-and-facilities.page">New York City</a></span>, and the <span><a href="https://www.toronto.ca/home/covid-19/covid-19-protect-yourself-others/community-settings-workplaces/">City of Toronto</a></span> are just a few examples of such guidelines being extended to organizations. It is important to follow local guidelines, but whenever possible, borrow additional innovative takes from other jurisdictions.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="776149d" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Back to the Office Employee Prioritization</h2></p></div><div data-id="16083af" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Teams or roles that demand a higher amount of physical interaction and can’t perform their duties well via online means should be considered as front-runners of back to the office policies. Simultaneously, leaders should critically assess if individuals whose roles are well suited for remote working, should only make the return to the office at the later phase of the pandemic reopening. Such efforts can help reduce health risks to employees and customers.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The IT department for example, may return back to the office on a rotational basis or in batches (team by team). Employees involved in the preparation and maintenance of physical technology (e.g. servers and hardware support) are likely to be prioritized while most of the software cast may be held back to later phases since their work may be accomplished remotely.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As leadership determines how to prioritize the return to the office, there are a few questions that should always be asked:</p><ul><li>Are there feasible technological or procedural options that can be taken to limit X role’s exposure? If so, would their work be impacted and how?</li><li>How big of a priority would it be to bring certain individuals back to the office under these circumstances?</li><li>Would the solution help potential future disruptions such as a 2<sup>nd</sup> COVID-19 wave?”</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-id="94b69f1" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meeting rooms can follow similar protocols stipulated to shared spaces and common areas, given the limited square footage that such spaces traditionally have which can make it harder to enforce distancing rules and lead to an <span><a href="https://www.cebm.net/covid-19/what-is-the-evidence-to-support-the-2-metre-social-distancing-rule-to-reduce-covid-19-transmission/">increased risk of transmission</a></span>. In said cases, organizations may benefit from setting a threshold on the number of employees permitted per meeting and the distances that are expected. Office administrators may want to set delimitators such as a sign to stipulate social distancing and remove excess chairs to help set the precedent. Reminder mechanisms such as pamphlets to clean spaces before and once they have been used can also beneficial.</p></div></div><div data-id="40674cf" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Rotational Work Schedules</h2></p></div><div data-id="0e4000c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To diminish contact, some organizations may benefit from building rotational work schedules where a department or group alternates every couple of weeks. This can help set better social distancing in offices that do not have the capacity to handle prior numbers of employees and clients. Some organizations have already started a two week in office and off office rotation, in which the workforce is divided into 2 groups (or more) which rotate the office space – as seen in the case of <span><a href="https://webstercity.com/2020/03/24/city-staff-to-rotate-on-shifts-in-response-to-covid-19/">Webster City</a></span>, Iowa.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It also allows teams to regain some of the interactions and experience that the office can provide while still having work from home flexibility. Organizations may find this to be the right mix of home comfort and office experience. Once COVID-19 related issues subside, organizations may find further operational efficiency in having a mixed policy, allowing it to move into smaller offices with lower costs.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="4111b59" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="360" height="240" src="https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1" data-src="https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1 360w, https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?zoom=2&amp;resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i2.wp.com/gpetrium.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/rattan-5330786_1280-min.jpg?zoom=3&amp;resize=360%2C240&amp;ssl=1 1080w" data-sizes="(max-width: 360px) 100vw, 360px"></p></div></div><div data-id="547cd1e" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Currently, most offices are not set-up to accommodate for COVID-19 related concerns such as social distancing. As organization decide when and who may return to the office, considerations over closed workspace, socially distanced offices, signs, contactless technology can be major drivers in helping leaders implement an employee first and health-driven culture.</p></div></div><div data-id="c8cf2f0" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The pandemic has shown that family and individuals can be impacted differently. To ensure a smooth transition back to the office, organizations may benefit from having structure, policies and procedures to handle exceptions. For instance, employees with children or elderly parents at home may have a difficult time procuring the necessary resources to support their needs. At times like these, the organization may benefit from giving the employee an extended work from home period where viable.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Clients may also prefer to have the option to attend meetings and consultations online. There is a fine balance between organizational, employee, and customer needs. Considerations over the complexity of exception handling should also be taken into account. Critical assessment of said implications and needs can help improve employee and customer satisfaction in the short run while also providing much needed experience on how to handle operational challenges that are bound to occur (crisis handling).</p></div></div></div><div data-id="8c003e6" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Clear, Open and Continuous Communication</h2></p></div><div data-id="5470e56" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In periods with trials and tribulations, society looks for leaders to guide them through rough patches. For an organization, employees and customers are actively looking for cues to understand its trajectory and how it will impact them.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this time, discrepancies in individual habits in relation to work from home and back to office may be front-center in a manager’s mind. Whether it is employee tardiness, commute, productivity, organizational networks and others, readjustment will take time and requires guidance. For that to happen, leaders will need to maintain a transparent, open and continuous communication to help clarify and facilitate solutions for issues that arise.</p></div></div></div><div data-id="ab5c68a" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Transitional periods can be challenging to many and will often lead to resistances. To ensure a smooth transition back to the office, it is important to note the origins of said challenges.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>BLEU is a standard algorithm for evaluating the machine translations against the human translations. At first I thought it should be very straightforward to use. However, it turns out that there are a lot of caveats.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I am going to show the BLEU algorithm in detail and talk about the caveats.</p>

<h3 id="english-translation-example">English Translation Example</h3>

<p>We will use the following examples to illustrate how to compute the BLEU scores.</p>

<h4 id="example-1">Example 1</h4>

<p>Chinese: 猫坐在垫子上</p>

<p>Reference 1: the cat is on the mat</p>

<p>Reference 2: there is a cat on the mat</p>

<p>Candidate: the cat the cat on the mat</p>

<h4 id="example-2">Example 2</h4>

<p>Chinese: 猫坐在垫子上</p>

<p>Reference 1: the cat is on the mat</p>

<p>Reference 2: there is a cat on the mat</p>

<p>Candidate: the the the the the the the the</p>

<h3 id="precision">Precision</h3>

<p>We count each of the ngram in the candidate sentence whether it has shown in any of the reference sentences, gather the total counts for each of the unique ngram, sum up the total counts for each of the unique ngram, and divided by the number of ngrams in the candidate sentence.</p>

<h4 id="example-1-1">Example 1</h4>

<p>We first compute the unigram precision for example 1. All the unigrams in the candidate sentences have shown in the reference sentences.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Unigram</th>
    <th>Shown?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>on</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>We then merge the unigram counts.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Unique Unigram</th>
    <th>Count</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the</td>
    <td>3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>on</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>mat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>The total number of counts for the unique unigrams in the candidate sentence is 7, and the total number of unigrams in the candidate sentence is 7. The unigram precision is 7/7 = 1.0 for example 1.</p>



<p>We then try to compute the bigram precision for example 1.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Bigram</th>
    <th>Shown?</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the cat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat the</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the cat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat on</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>on the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the mat</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
</tbody></table>

<p>We then merge the bigram counts.</p>



<table>
  <tbody><tr>
    <th>Unique Bigram</th>
    <th>Count</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the cat</td>
    <td>2</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat the</td>
    <td>0</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>cat on</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>on the</td>
    <td>1</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>the mat</td>
    <td>1</td>

<h4 id="drawbacks">Drawbacks</h4>

<p>We can see from example 1 and 2 that unigram precision is very easy to be over-confident about the quality of the machine translation. To overcome this, clipped count and modified precision were proposed.</p>

<h3 id="modified-precision">Modified Precision</h3>

<p>For each unique ngram, we count its maximum frequency in each of the reference sentences. The minimum of this special count and the original count is called the clipped the count. That is to say, the clipped count is no greater than the original count. We then use this clipped count, in place of the original count, for computing the modified precision.</p>

<h4 id="advantages">Advantages</h4>

<p>Compared to precision, we found that modified precision is a better metric, at least for unigrams.</p>

<h3 id="bleu">BLEU</h3>

<h4 id="algorithm">Algorithm</h4>

<p>BLEU is computed using a couple of ngram modified precisions. Specifically,</p>



<p>where $p_n$ is the modified precision for $n$gram, the base of $\log$ is the natural base $e$, $w_n$ is weight between 0 and 1 for $\log p_n$ and $\sum_{n=1}^{N} w_n = 1$, and BP is the brevity penalty to penalize short machine translations.</p>



<p>where $c$ is the number of unigrams (length) in all the candidate sentences, and $r$ is the best match lengths for each candidate sentence in the corpus. Here the best match length is the closest reference sentence length to the candidate sentences. For example, if there are three references with lengths 12, 14, and 17 words and the candidate translation is a terse 13 words, ideally the best match length could be either 12 or 14, but we arbitrary choose the shorter one which is 12.</p>



<p>Usually, the BLEU is evaluated on corpus where there are many candidate sentences translated from different source texts and each of them has several reference sentences. Then $c$ is the total number of unigrams (length) in all the candidate sentences, and $r$ is the sum of the best match lengths for each candidate sentence in the corpus.</p>



<p>It is not hard to find that BLEU is always a value between 0 and 1. It is because BP, $w_n$, and $p_n$ are always between 0 and 1, and</p>



<p>Usually, BLEU uses $N = 4$ and $w_n = \frac{1}{N}$.</p>

<h4 id="example-1-3">Example 1</h4>

<p>We have computed the modified precision for some of the ngrams. It is not hard to compute the others. Concretely, we have</p>





<p>Because the corpus only has one translation set and thus $c = 7$ and $r = 7$</p>



<p>We plugin these values to the BLEU equation, the BLEU is</p>



<p>We further compare the BLEU to the BLEU computed using <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>.</p>

<p>The value of <code>bleu</code> is 0.467 which is exactly matching to the BLEU we computed manually.</p>

<h4 id="example-2-3">Example 2</h4>

<p>Similarly,</p>





<p>Because the corpus only has one translation set and thus $c = 8$ and $r = 7$</p>



<p>When we plugin these values to the BLEU equation, actually we would need to compute $\log 0$ which is not mathematically defined. We use a small number $10^{-100}$ instead of $0$ for $p_2$, $p_3$ and $p_4$. The BLEU is</p>



<p>We further also compare the BLEU to the BLEU computed using <a href="https://www.nltk.org/">NLTK</a>.</p>

<span>1.2882297539194154e-231</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The value of <code>bleu</code> is 0 which is exactly matching to the BLEU we computed manually.</p>

<p>Note that in the above two examples, due to the candidate sentence is long and we only have one translation in the corpus, thus $\text{BP} = 1$. In practice, there could be scenarios where $\text{BP} &lt; 1$.</p>

<h3 id="caveats">Caveats</h3>

<p>In some scenarios, BLEU does not score the translation very well, especially for those short translations with few reference sentences. For example,</p>



<p>Chinese: 你准备好了吗？</p>

<p>Reference 1: are you ready ?</p>

<p>Candidate: you are ready ?</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>nltk</span>

<span>1.133422688662942e-154</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is actually a very good machine translation to me. However, the BLEU score is 0, which means that the machine translation is totally wrong.</p>



<p>In NLTK, you are allowed to provide <a href="https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.translate.html#nltk.translate.bleu_score.SmoothingFunction">smoothing functions</a>. For example,</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>nltk</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>reference_1</span> <span>=</span> <span>"are you ready ?"</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>()</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>candidate</span> <span>=</span> <span>"you are ready ?"</span><span>.</span><span>split</span><span>()</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>bleu</span> <span>=</span> <span>nltk</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>.</span><span>bleu_score</span><span>.</span><span>sentence_bleu</span><span>(</span><span>references</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>reference_1</span><span>],</span> <span>hypothesis</span><span>=</span><span>candidate</span><span>,</span> <span>weights</span><span>=</span><span>[</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>,</span><span>0.25</span><span>],</span> <span>smoothing_function</span><span>=</span><span>nltk</span><span>.</span><span>translate</span><span>.</span><span>bleu_score</span><span>.</span><span>SmoothingFunction</span><span>().</span><span>method7</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>bleu</span><span>)</span>
<span>0.4002926439114545</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This time, the value of <code>bleu</code> is 0.4, which is magically higher than the vanilla one we computed without using smoothing functions.</p>



<p>However, one should be always cautious about the smoothing function used in BLEU computation. At least we have to make sure that the BLEU scores we are comparing against are using no smoothing function or the exact same smoothing function.</p>

By using accessibility features in your app, you’re allowing your app to reach a wider audience.</p><p id="d948">Sticking with their commitment to accessibility, Apple has introduced several new features at WWDC20 which help developers make their apps easier and more entertaining for users with disabilities. By making apps more accessible, developers eliminate the need for users to purchase clunky, expensive devices in order to use their apps — everything they need to interact with the app is built right into the device.</p><p id="df0d">In this article, you’ll learn about some of the biggest and best upgrades to accessibility, announced at this year’s WWDC.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="ecb9">The first on the list is an interesting feature — which didn’t get talked about on stage. As the name suggests, Back Tap allows users to set single, double, or triple taps on the back of their iPhones and link them to certain tasks. For example, you could double tap on the back of your iPhone to open the weather app.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg?q=20" width="1200" height="732" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg" width="1200" height="732" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*-mtu69eu445jv1BwH76CoQ.jpeg 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Setting up Back Tap on iOS 14.</figcaption></figure><p id="91c1">And since the tapping feature can be linked to Shortcuts, it opens up a whole range of possibilities with home automation and more! As seen in the example above, you could triple tap the back of your phone to quickly take notes, or you could use it to unlock your door when you’re about to enter the house. Easy, right?</p><p id="563c">For users with hearing impairments, Apple has added the ability to adjust sound frequencies on supported headphones. By doing this, users can now set their own preferences on what they want to hear more of and what they want to hear less of.</p><p id="dc81">The new feature also comes with pre-set profiles for specific outdoor situations, in case the user doesn’t want to manually configure the sound frequencies.</p><blockquote><p id="dba7">This new accessibility feature is designed to amplify soft sounds and adjust certain frequencies for an individual’s hearing, to help music, movies, phone calls, and podcasts sound more crisp and clear. Headphone Accommodations also supports Transparency mode on AirPods Pro, making quiet voices more audible and tuning the sounds of your environment to your hearing needs.</p><p id="8aab">— Apple Documentation</p></blockquote><p id="6a9f">Further, the new feature also supports Transparency Mode on AirPods Pro, which allows users to adjust how much of the surroundings they want to hear. If they want to amplify soft voices or listen to the environment in more detail, they now have that autonomy.</p><p id="d5d2">In the same vein, a new feature called <strong>Sound Recognition</strong> can pick up important sounds in the environment, such as Sirens, Fire Alarms, or Car Horns and alert the user of them. Through machine learning models built into the operating system, these sounds can be picked up and transmitted to the user in any way that they wish.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/38/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png?q=20" width="700" height="1110" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png" width="700" height="1110" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1000/1*3WhAhhK1A2LktugVV3KGHw.png 500w" sizes="500px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Real-Time Text on the iPhone.</figcaption></figure><p id="2bf5">Group FaceTime calls have become more important than ever during the global pandemic, and Apple has added a small but important accessibility feature to them. Now, if a member of a group FaceTime call is using sign language to communicate, their video will be automatically pinned.</p><p id="ab6c">Using computer vision to detect this can be a boon to those with hearing loss, since reading sign language while the screen is moving around can be frustrating.</p><p id="43b4">In addition to this, Apple has made further improvements to its Real-Time Text feature, which is used for text based communication during phone calls. Previously, it was difficult for RTT users to multitask during phone calls, but it no longer requires the full screen.</p><p id="0458">When we think of accessibility on iOS, VoiceOver is often the first to come to mind. This year, VoiceOver received several significant updates, making it even more useful than before.

June 25, 2020 | https://tomerv.github.io/posts/food-ingredients/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tomerv.github.io/posts/food-ingredients/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="food-ingredients-as-linear-programming">

<p>I like to know what I’m eating – even if it’s junk – so I often find myself looking at the ingredients list on the label.</p>
<p><a href="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/chocolates.jpg"><img alt="Life is like a box of chocolates" src="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/chocolates.jpg"></a></p><p>I got a package of choclates had this list of ingredients:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Milk chocolate (58%), nougat (40%), milk fat, coffee extract (0.1%)</p>
<p>—<em>A box of chocolates</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>How helpful of them to write the percentages for each ingredient! But wait, they put percentage only for the “good” ingredients, but not for the milk fat (what does that even mean?). No matter, I know how to subtract <a href="#f1" id="id1">1</a>:</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\mbox{chocolate} + \mbox{nougat} + \mbox{fat} + \mbox{coffee} &amp;= 100\% \\
58\% + 40\% + \mbox{fat} + 0.1\% &amp;= 100\% \\
\mbox{fat} &amp;= 100\% - 58\% - 40\% - 0.1\% \\
\mbox{fat} &amp;= 1.9\%\end{split}\]</p>
<p>Cool, we deduced some information that wasn’t given to us directly!</p>
<p><a href="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/noodles.jpg"><img alt="&quot;Professional&quot; noodles" src="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/noodles.jpg"></a></p><p>Let’s try it again, this time on a package of pre-cooked noodles:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Wheat flour, water, eggs (2%), salt, turmeric</p>
<p>—<em>A package of noodles</em></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>This one is a bit trickier. We know that</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\mbox{flour} + \mbox{water} + \mbox{eggs} + \mbox{salt} + \mbox{turmeric} &amp;= 100\% \\
\mbox{flour} + \mbox{water} + 2\% + \mbox{salt} + \mbox{turmeric} &amp;= 100\% \\
\mbox{flour} + \mbox{water} + \mbox{salt} + \mbox{turmeric} &amp;= 98\%\end{split}\]</p>
<p>Seems we’re kind of stuck here…</p>
<p>But maybe we can still do something with this. Food regulations require that the ingredients be listed in a particular order <a href="#f2" id="id2">2</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The food components shall be listed in descending order according to their relative content
in the weight of the product, from the largest content to the smallest content.</p>
<p><em>Source:</em> <a href="https://www.health.gov.il/English/Topics/FoodAndNutrition/Nutrition/Adequate_nutrition/Pages/labeling.aspx">Ministry of Health</a></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Using this information we also know that</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\mbox{flour} \geq \mbox{water} \geq \mbox{eggs} \geq \mbox{salt} \geq \mbox{turmeric} &amp;\geq 0 \\
\mbox{flour} \geq \mbox{water} \geq 2\% \geq \mbox{salt} \geq \mbox{turmeric} &amp;\geq 0\end{split}\]</p>
<p>From all of the above we can deduce that <span>\(47\% \leq \mbox{flour} \leq 96\%\)</span> and <span>\(2\% \leq \mbox{water} \leq 49\%\)</span> which is… nice to know, I guess?</p>
<p>I could go over the steps for deducing the wheat content in our noodles, but instead let’s jump to the general case.</p>
<div id="the-shortest-intro-to-linear-programming-lp">
<h2>The Shortest Intro to Linear Programming (LP)<a href="#the-shortest-intro-to-linear-programming-lp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I have to admit that the name is confusing. This sounds like some kind of programming technique, but it is more of an algorithm, or a group of algorithms that solve the same problem. To its defense, it was invented before current-day programming. I guess you could say that it started out as a programming technique.</p>
<p>The gist of LP is that if we format our problem as a <cite>linear optimization problem</cite>, we can use known algorithms to solve it. We don’t even need to implement these algorithms, there are many LP solvers freely available. Here we’ll use SciPy’s <a href="https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.linprog.html">optimize.linprog</a>, so we’ll work with its input format:</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\min_x \ &amp; c^T x \\
\mbox{such that} \ &amp; A_{ub} x \leq b_{ub},\\
&amp; A_{eq} x = b_{eq},\\
&amp; l \leq x \leq u ,\end{split}\]</p>
<p>where <span>\(x\)</span> is a vector of decision variables; <span>\(c\)</span>,
<span>\(b_{ub}\)</span>, <span>\(b_{eq}\)</span>, <span>\(l\)</span>, and <span>\(u\)</span> are vectors; and
<span>\(A_{ub}\)</span> and <span>\(A_{eq}\)</span> are matrices.</p>
<p>The term <span>\(c^T x\)</span> is the <cite>cost</cite>, and the inequalities below it are the <cite>constraints</cite>. Our LP solver finds <span>\(x\)</span> that minimizes the cost while satisfying all the constraints.</p>
<p>In a way, this is a bit like programming, but instead of source code we have matrices, and instead of a compiler we have an LP solver.</p>
<p>Let’s work towards getting our problem into the correct form.</p>
</div>
<div id="getting-to-an-lp-form">
<h2>Getting to an LP Form<a href="#getting-to-an-lp-form" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>First, let’s go over the rules of our game:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The amounts are sorted from largest to smallest</p></li>
<li><p>The sum of all the amounts is 1.0 (that’s our 100%, meaning all the ingredients are listed)</p></li>
<li><p>All the amounts are positive</p></li>
<li><p>Some amounts are known</p></li>
<li><p>For the amounts we don’t know, we would like to get an upper and lower bound</p></li>
</ol>
<p>We’ll denote the amounts by the vector <span>\(x\)</span>.</p>
<p>The first rule says that <span>\(x_1 &gt;= x_2 &gt;= \cdots &gt;= x_{n-1} &gt;= x_{n}\)</span>. Is this a linear relation? We need to bring it into the form <span>\(A_{ub} x &lt;= b_{ub}\)</span>, which means changing it into vector notation where all the unknowns to the left-hand side of the inequality. We use <span>\(e_i\)</span> to denote the vector that has 1 in the <span>\(i\)</span> th position, and 0 elsewhere.</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}x_i \geq x_{i+1} \\
- x_i + x_{i+1} \leq 0 \\
- e_i x + e_{i+1} x \leq 0 \\
(- e_i + e_{i+1}) x \leq 0\end{split}\]</p>
<p>This applies for <span>\(i=1..n-1\)</span>. For <span>\(n=5\)</span> as in our noodles example, the result looks like this <a href="#f3" id="id3">3</a>:</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\begin{pmatrix}
-1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3 \\
x_4 \\
x_5
\end{pmatrix}
\leq
\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\
0 \\
0 \\
0
\end{pmatrix}\end{split}\]</p>
<p>Moving on to the second rule, and things are only getting easier. The sum of all the amounts is an obvious linear relation:</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3 \\
x_4 \\
x_5
\end{pmatrix}
=
1\end{split}\]</p>
<p>This is the first row of our <span>\(A_{eq} x = b_{eq}\)</span> relationship. We need to add more rows to <span>\(A_{eq}\)</span>, and we’ll come back to it a bit later.</p>
<p>Next, all the amounts are positive. This sounds trivial, but it’s important. Without it we can barely deduce anything, and we would get wrong answers. We could model this in a matrix relation, but that’s not needed. The SciPy implementation has support for lower and upper bounds. We just set <span>\(l = 0, u = 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now for the known amounts. Even easier, this one. If <span>\(x_i\)</span> is known to be equal to <span>\(v_i\)</span>, then we have</p>
<p>
\[e_i x_i = v_i\]</p>
<p>We take all these, and the equation for the sum of the values, and put them all in a single matrix (each equation is a row). For our noodles example, we have a row for the some of all the amounts, and a row for the known amount for <span>\(x_3\)</span>:</p>
<p>
\[\begin{split}\begin{pmatrix}
1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
x_1 \\
x_2 \\
x_3 \\
x_4 \\
x_5
\end{pmatrix}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
1 \\
0.02
\end{pmatrix}\end{split}\]</p>
<p>Lastly, we want to find out the maximal and minimal possible amounts for one of the ingredients. If we’re interested in the minimal amount for ingredient <span>\(i\)</span>, we want to</p>
<p>
\[\mbox{minimize } e_i x\]</p>
<p>And if we want to find the maximal amount for it,</p>
<p>
\[\mbox{minimize } (-e_i) x\]</p>
<p>That’s it! Let’s put all that into code, and let SciPy do the hard work of actually solving it.</p>
</div>
<div id="coding-the-lp">
<h2>Coding the LP<a href="#coding-the-lp" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/tomerv/food-ingredients">here</a>. It’s not that interesting, so I won’t go into it.</p>
<p>The implementation uses NumPy matrices. I tried sparse matrices as well, but it was slower. This is probably due to the small size of the matrix, usually no larger than 10x10. For these sizes, the overhead of using a sparse matrix is larger than the savings.</p>
<p>I also wanted to give it a simple GUI to make it easier to use. I put it in a Jupyter Notebook with some input widgets for the names and values of the ingredients. It has a nicer interface, but it’s less flexible. You can run it <a href="https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/tomerv/food-ingredients/master?filepath=src%2Fmain.ipynb">on mybinder.org</a>.</p>
<p>We can see check that the code give correct bounds for our noodles:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ python src/main.py data/noodles.txt
wheat flour:          47.00% - 96.00%
water:                 2.00% - 49.00%
eggs:                       2.00%
salt:                  0.00% -  2.00%
turmeric:              0.00% -  2.00%
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>We can also try it out on some other real foods sold in the supermarket in Israel.</p>
<p><a href="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/nutella.jpg"><img alt="A jar of Nutella" src="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/nutella.jpg"></a></p><p>Here is Nutella:</p>
<div><div><pre><span></span>$ python src/main.py data/nutella.txt

flavorings:            0.00% -  7.40%
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The label emphasizes the hazelnut, milk, and cocoa content. But we still got non-trivial lower and upper bounds on the sugar content. I wonder how much sugar it really has…</p>
<p><a href="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/quadratini.jpg"><img alt="A package of Quadritini" src="https://tomerv.github.io/_images/quadratini.jpg"></a></p><p>Still in the candy section, we have Quadratini:</p>

</div>
<p>Lots of ingredients here, and we’re only given quantities to a few of them. But we can still deduce a minimal amount of 12.4% coconut oil!</p>
<p>I tried many items. Some give interesting results, and some don’t. You’re welcome to try on your own.</p>
</div>
<div id="summary">
<h2>Summary<a href="#summary" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Linear Programming is one of those things I encountered many times (including in 3 different university courses!) but never had a chance to apply.  New I can consider that task as “done”. I got to use scipy’s LP solver, tried out sparse matrices, and played a bit with Jupyter widgets.</p>
<p>As for the results, the most interesting cases are when a “bad” ingredient is first and the “good” ingredient has a low amount, like in the case of Nutella. This combination gives us a non-trivial lower bound for the bad ingredient.</p>
<p>Lastly, if I had to change one rule for the label on the packaging, I would force all manufacturers to give exact amounts for every ingredient that’s over 1%. It would make my code useless, but it would make consumers’ life better.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">



<p>This is a collection of random thoughts regarding the application of
permacultural ideas to the computer world.</p>

<p>Some have tried to connect these worlds before (<a href="http://wiki.c2.com/?PermaCulture">WikiWikiWeb's Permaculture
article</a>; <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck">Kent
Beck</a>'s short-lived idea of <a href="https://www.softwarequotes.com/showquotes.aspx?id=559&amp;name=Kent%20Beck">Permaprogramming</a>),
but these have mostly concentrated on enhancing software engineering
practices with some ideas from gardening. I am more interested in the aspect
of cultural and ecological permanence. That is, how to give computers a
meaningful and sustainable place in a human civilization that has a
meaningful and sustainable place in the planetary biosphere.</p>

<h2>1. Problem</h2>

<p>Over the last few hundred years of human civilization, there has been a
dramatic increase in the consumption of artificially produced energy. In the
overarching story, this is often equated with "progress".</p>

<p>In the computer world, this phenomenon gets multiplied by itself:
"progress" facilitates ever greater densities of data storage and digital
logic, thus dramatically exploding the availability of computing resources.
However, the abundance has also caused an equivalent explosion in
wastefulness, which shows in things like mindblowingly ridiculous hardware
requirements for even quite trivial tasks.</p>

<p>At the same time, computers have been failing their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Lib/Dream_Machines">utopian
expectations</a>. Instead of amplifying the users' intelligence, they rather
amplify their stupidity. Instead of making it possible to scale down the
resource requirements of the material world, they have instead become a
major part of the problem. Instead of making the world more comprehensible,
they rather add to its incomprehensibility. And they often even manage to
become slower despite becoming faster.</p>

<p>In both computing and agriculture, a major issue is that problems are too
often "solved" by increasing controllability and resource use. Permaculture
takes another way, advocating methods that "let nature do the work" and thus
minimize the dependence on artificial energy input. Localness and
decentralization are also major themes in the thought.</p>

<p>What makes permacultural philosophy particularly appealing (to me) is
that it does not advocate "going back in time" despite advocating a dramatic
decrease in use of artificial energy. Instead, it trusts in human ingenunity
in finding clever hacks for turning problems into solutions, competition
into co-operation, waste into resources. Very much the same kind of creative
thinking I appreciate in computer hacking.</p>

<p>The presence of intelligent life in an ecosystem can be justified by its
strengthening effect. Ideally, humans could make ecosystems more flexible
and more resilient because of their ability to take leaps that are difficult
or impossible for "unintelligent" natural processes. The existence of
computers in a human civilization can be justified by their ability to
augment this potential.</p>

<h2>2. Physical resources</h2>

<h3>2.1. Energy</h3>

<p>Permaculture emphasizes resource-sensitivity. Computers primarily use
electricity, so to them resource-sensitivity primarily means 1) adapting to
changes in energy conditions and 2) using the available energy wisely.
Today's computers, even mobile ones, are surprisingly bad at this. This is
partially due to their legacy as "calculation factories" that are constantly
guaranteed all the resources they "need".</p>

<p>Intense non-urgent computation (such as long machine learning batches)
would take place only when a lot of surplus energy is being produced or
there is a need for electricity-to-heat conversion. This requires that the
computer is aware of the state of the surrounding energy system.</p>

<p>At times of low energy, both hardware and software would prefer to scale
down: background processes would freeze, user interfaces would become more
rudimentary, clock frequencies would decrease, unneeded processors and
memory banks would power off. At these times, people would prefer to do
something else than interact with computers.</p>

<p>It is often wise to store energy for later use. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flywheel_energy_storage">Flywheels</a>
are a potential alternative to chemical batteries. They have similar <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density">energy densities</a>
(MJ/kg) but require no rare-earth materials and last for decades or
centuries instead of mere years.</p>

<h3>2.2. Silicon</h3>

<p>IC fabrication requires large amounts of energy, highly refined machinery
and poisonous substances. Because of this sacrifice, the resulting
microchips should be treasured like gems or rare exotic spices. Their active
lifespans would be maximized, and they would never be reduced to their raw
materials until they are thoroughly unusable.</p>

<p>Instead of planned obsolescence, there should be planned longevity.</p>

<p>Broken devices would be repaired. If the community needs a kind of device
that does not exist, it should preferrably be built from existing components
that have fallen out of use. Chips should be designed open and flexible, so
that they can be reappropriated even for purposes they were never intended
for.</p>

<p>Complex chips should have enough redundancy and bypass mechanisms to keep
them working even after some of their internals wear out. (In a multicore
CPU, for instance, many partially functioning cores could combine into one
fully functioning one.)</p>

<p>Chips that work but whose practical use cannot be justified can find
artistic and other psychologically meaningful use. They may also be stored
away until they are needed again (especially if the fabrication quality and
the storage conditions allow for decades or centuries of "shelf life").</p>

<p>Use what is available. Even chips that do "evil" things are worth
considering if there's a landfill full of them. Crack their DRM locks,
reverse-engineer their black boxes, deconstruct their philosophies. It might
even be possible to reappropriate something like Bitcoin-mining ASICs for
something artistically interesting or even useful.</p>

<p>Minimized on-chip feature size makes it possible to do more computation
with less energy but it often also means increased fragility and shorter
lifespans. Therefore, the densest chips should be primarily used for
purposes where more computation actually yields more. (In entertainment use,
for example, a large use of resources is nothing more than a decadent
esthetic preference.)</p>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconventional_computing">Alternatives
to semiconductors</a> should be actively researched. <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328395242_Towards_fungal_computer">Living
cells</a> might be able to replace microchips in some tasks sometime in the
future.</p>

<p>Once perfectly clean ways of producing microchip equivalents have been
taken to use, the need for "junk fetishism" will probably diminish.</p>

<h3>2.3. Miscellaneous</h3>

<p>Whenever bright external light is available, displays should be able to
use it instead of competing against it with their own backlight. (See: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transflective_liquid-crystal_display">Transflective
LCD</a>)</p>

<p>Personally-owned computers are primarily for those who dedicate
themselves to the technology and thus spend considerable amounts of time
with it. Most other people would be perfectly happy with shared hardware.
Even if the culture and society embraced computers more than anything else,
requiring everyone to own one would be an overkill.</p>

<h2>3. Observation and interaction</h2>

<p>The first item in many lists of permacultural principles is "Observe and
interact." I interpret this as primarily referring to a bidirectional and
co-operative relationship with natural systems: you should not expect your
garden to be easily top-down controllable like an army unit but accept its
quirkiness and adapt to it.</p><h3>3.1. Observation</h3>

<p>Observation is among the most important human skills computers can augment.
Things that are difficult or impossible for humans to observe can be brought
within human cognitive capacity by various computational processes. Gathered
information can be visualized, slight changes and pattern deviances
emphasized, slow processes sped up, forecasts calculated. In Bill Mollison's
words, "Information is <em>the</em> critical potential resource. It becomes
a resource only when obtained and acted upon."</p>

<p>Computer systems should also make their own inner workings as observable as
possible. If the computer produces visual output, it would use a fraction of
its resources to visualize its own intro- and extrospection. A computer that
communicates with radio waves, for example, would visualize its own view of
the surrounding radio landscape.</p>

<p>Current consumer-oriented computing systems often go to ridiculous
lengths to actually prevent the user from knowing what is going on. Even
error messages have become unfashionable; many websites and apps just
pretend everything is fine even if it isn't. This kind of extreme
unobservability is a major source of technological alienation among computer
users.</p>

<p>The visualizations intended for casual and passive observation would be
pleasant and tranquil while making it easy to see the big picture and notice
the small changes. Tapping into the inborn human tendency to observe the
natural environment may be a good idea when designing visualizers. When the
user wants to observe something more closely, however, there is no limit in
how flashy, technical and "non-natural" the presentation can be, as long as
the observer prefers it that way.</p>

<h3>3.2. Yin and yang hacking</h3>

<p>Traditional computer hacking is often very "yang". A total understanding and
control of the target system is valued. Changing a system's behavior is
often an end in itself. There are predefined goals the system is pushed
towards. Optimization tends to focus on a single measurable parameter.
Finding a system's absolute limits is more important than finding its
individual strengths or essence.</p>

<p>In contrast, "yin" hacking accepts the aspects that are beyond rational
control and comprehension. Rationality gets supported by intuition. The
relationship with the system is more bidirectional, emphasizing
experimentation and observation. The "personality" that stems from
system-specific peculiarities gets more attention than the measurable specs.
It is also increasingly important to understand when to hack and when just
to observe without hacking.</p>

<p>The difference between yin and yang hacking is similar to the difference
between permaculture and …</p></div>

</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">For the longest time, I've been afraid to speak up about my story with App Review, fearing I'd put my popular app at risk. I've now decided that being transparent and sharing my experience to help others is worth it, so here it goes:👇</p>— Kosta Eleftheriou (@keleftheriou) <a href="https://twitter.com/keleftheriou/status/1274356729224892416?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2020</a></blockquote> 

<p>
I admire Apple, and I believe the world is a better place because of them. As a developer, I’ve made my career on their platform and I’m grateful for it.
But I have some criticism. I’m&nbsp;<b>not</b>&nbsp;here to talk about my story, the 30% Apple developer cut, the App Review process, or to challenge any of their guidelines.
I want to talk about&nbsp;<em>transparency</em>, and <em>accountability</em>.
</p>
<p>
For far too long, developers have been discouraged from being able to share their rejection stories with the world.
"If you run to the press and trash us, it never helps", used to be the official guidance.
The risk too great for most, the fear of retribution overwhelming.
And so the stories have largely remained in the shadows, with only a few exceptions.
But there’s another, critical reason why such stories rarely see the light of day, one that hasn’t received enough attention:
</p>
<blockquote><b>Apple is systematically erasing our stories.</b></blockquote>

<p>
Unless we’re talking about your most recent submission, all communication you have <em>ever</em> sent or received through the "Resolution Center" is inaccessible to you.
Rejection notices, appeal results, anything you might want to reference to better understand previous about your product - it's all gone.
Unless you have meticulously and manually kept copies of all correspondence, what happened in the past will forever stay in the past. But why should it?
</p>
<p>
It’s not hard to see why Apple is doing this.
It <em>is</em> hard, however, to see a reason that benefits anyone but Apple.
In doing so, they gain more peace of mind, less worry about consistency and correctness in applying the public guidelines.
The appeal mechanism helps them improve, but only to the extent that Apple deems necessary.
If we ever wanted to know how well Apple is enforcing the guidelines, we have to take their word for it.
But who guards the guardians, when App Review’s accountability to the world has been intentionally reduced to the bare minimum?
</p>
<p>
Transparency is not always the solution.
We can’t expect Apple to be open about their future product plans, for example.
But when they communicate with developers, they should do so like everyone is watching - every time.
And to get there, the <em>possibility</em> that everyone might find out needs to always be on the table.
</p>
<p>
So Apple, please help us see App Review as a reliable ally.
Let us access our past communications with you - including phone call records if we choose to.
Show us that you want to be accountable for what you communicate to developers. There may be some legal challenges, but transparency is a prerequisite to accountability.
It’s only then that we can begin to have a fair and honest discussion with you about the actual process and guidelines.
Because until then, we’re in the shadows.

<p>Gray code encoding is a bijective function between natural numbers (including 0) in a way that the Gray code of subsequent integers only differ in a single binary digit.
This encoding was proved useful for rotary encoders and other kinds of counting where switching multiple bits at once would be problematic.</p>

<p><img src="https://leni536.github.io/assets/Gray_10bit_rotary_encoder.svg" alt="pdep figure"><br>
A 10bit Gray code rotary encoder.</p>

<p>I use the following common definition for Gray code encoding:</p>



<p>where  denotes the ,,bitwise exclusive or’’ and  denotes the ,,bitwise right shift’’ operators.</p>



<p>I denote the inverse of the function  with .
 can be expressed in the following way:</p>



<p>It can be shown that  is indeed the inverse of  using the commutative and associative properties of  and the following identities:</p>





<p>Implementing Gray code encoding is rather simple:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>unsigned</span> <span>gray_encode</span><span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>i</span><span>^</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>1</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One can implement Gray code decoding directly from the defining expression of :</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>gray_decode</span><span>(</span><span>unsigned</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>unsigned</span> <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
    <span>while</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>!=</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>ret</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>ret</span> <span>^</span> <span>i</span><span>);</span>
        <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>ret</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One can actually do better for a known fixed-width integral type.
The following algorithm is from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gray_code#Converting_to_and_from_Gray_code">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>gray_decode</span><span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>i</span> <span>^=</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>16</span><span>);</span>
    <span>i</span> <span>^=</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>8</span><span>);</span>
    <span>i</span> <span>^=</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>4</span><span>);</span>
    <span>i</span> <span>^=</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>2</span><span>);</span>
    <span>i</span> <span>^=</span> <span>(</span><span>i</span> <span>&gt;&gt;</span> <span>1</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>i</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One can show the correctness of this implementation using the identities I presented before and induction.</p>

<p>I also developed an alternative implementation that makes use of the <code>popcnt</code> and <code>pdep</code> x86_64 CPU instructions (part of the POPCNT and BMI2 extensions respectively).</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;stdint.h&gt;
#include &lt;x86intrin.h&gt;
</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>gray_decode</span><span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span> <span>i</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>uint32_t</span> <span>evens</span>
        <span>=</span> <span>_pdep_u32</span><span>(</span><span>0x55555555u</span><span>,</span><span>i</span><span>);</span>
    <span>uint32_t</span> <span>odds</span>
        <span>=</span> <span>_pdep_u32</span><span>(</span><span>0xAAAAAAAAu</span><span>,</span><span>i</span><span>);</span>
    <span>uint32_t</span> <span>popcount</span>
        <span>=</span> <span>__builtin_popcount</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>);</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>-</span><span>(</span><span>popcount</span> <span>&amp;</span> <span>1</span><span>))</span>
           <span>^</span> <span>((</span><span>odds</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span> <span>-</span> <span>(</span><span>evens</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>1</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In the following sections I break down how this implementation works.
I stick with 32 bit numbers, but my reasoning works for any bitwidth.</p>

<p>If  
  and  – 
  where the bold letters denote binary digits – then .
In other words one can get the th digit in  by xoring the digits from the th to the most significant digit in .
For a given  where the 1 digits are sparsely laid out one can think of  in the following way:</p>



<p>The leading digits (from the most significant digits) are 0 up until the first 1 digit in .
Then the following digits in  are all 1 up until the next 1 digit in , and so on.
The 1 digits in  mark the transitions between strips of 0s and 1s in .
For this description it’s not required that the 1s in  are sparsely laid out,
  it just makes the intuition easier (for me at least).</p>

<p>I define  by taking every second 1 binary digit in  starting from the least significant one.
I also define  by taking every second 1 binary digit in  starting from the second least significant one.
 and  correspond to the <code>evens</code> and <code>odds</code> variables in my <code>gray_decode</code> function above.</p>



<p>After adding  and , where  denotes bitwise negation, the result has similar strips of 0s and 1s as :</p>



<p>There are two main differences to :</p>

<ol>
  <li>The transitions between the strips of 0s and 1s start one place to the right compared to .</li>
  <li>The first strips from the left can be all 1s or all 0s depending if there are even or odd number of 1 digits in .</li>
</ol>

<p>The first issue can be fixed by shifting  and  to the left by one place beforehand.
The second difference can be addressed by first calculating if there are even or odd number of 1 bits in .
Then one can flip the bits in the result for the even case.</p>

<p>I denote the number of 1 bits in  as , this corresponds to the <code>popcnt</code> variable in my <code>gray_decode</code> function.
By applying these fixes we get the following expression for :</p>



<p>The branching between the even and odd cases can also be eliminated by xoring the intermediate result with <code>00…0</code> or <code>11…1</code> depending on the parity of .
 is either 0 or 1 ,  is either <code>00…0</code> or <code>11…11</code> for the even and odd cases respectively.
Since bitwise negation is required for the even case an additional bitwise negation is necessary:</p>



<p><strong>Update:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/da1juk/implementations_for_gray_code_encoding_and/f1mp1rt?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">IJzerbaard pointed out</a> that this expression can be further simplified by using the  and  identities:</p>



<p>The <code>popcnt</code> and <code>pdep</code> CPU instructions can be used to calculate ,  and  efficiently.</p>

<p>The <code>popcnt</code> instruction takes one source and one destination argument.
It writes the number of 1 binary digits in the source and returns the count in the destination.
 can be calculated by applying <code>popcnt</code> on .</p>

<p><code>pdep</code> takes two source arguments (<code>src</code> and <code>mask</code>) and one destination argument (<code>dst</code>).
It takes the low bits from <code>src</code> and deposits them in the destination to the corresponding set bit locations in <code>mask</code>.</p>

<p><img src="https://leni536.github.io/assets/pdep.svg" alt="pdep figure"></p>

<p>One can calculate  by using <code>pdep</code> and setting <code>src</code> to <code>0101…01</code> and <code>mask</code> to .
 can be calculated similarly with <code>pdep</code> but with <code>1010…10</code> as <code>src</code>.
This is how <code>evens</code> and <code>odds</code> are calculated in my <code>gray_decode</code> function, the magic numbers are the <code>src</code> arguments.</p>



<p>I think there is no correct way to objectively benchmark these Gray code decoding functions in isolation.
One can call these functions in a tight loop and compare their throughput that way, but one shouldn’t take the resulting numbers too seriously.</p>

<p>I used Google’s benchmark library and the following setup:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>static</span> <span>void</span> <span>Generic32</span><span>(</span><span>benchmark</span><span>::</span><span>State</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>uint32_t</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span> <span>_</span> <span>:</span> <span>state</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>++</span><span>i</span><span>;</span>
    <span>uint32_t</span> <span>x</span> <span>=</span> <span>gray_decode_generic</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>);</span>
    <span>benchmark</span><span>::</span><span>DoNotOptimize</span><span>(</span><span>x</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>state</span><span>.</span><span>SetBytesProcessed</span><span>(</span><span>i</span><span>*</span><span>sizeof</span><span>(</span><span>uint32_t</span><span>));</span>
<span>}</span>
<span>BENCHMARK</span><span>(</span><span>Generic32</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And similarly for all the other functions for both <code>uint32_t</code> and <code>uint64_t</code>.
I compiled the benchmark with <code>gcc -O2</code>.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>-------------------------------------------------
Benchmark          Time           CPU Iterations
-------------------------------------------------
Generic32          2 ns          2 ns   58150989   1.56283GB/s
PDEP32             2 ns          2 ns   82701968   2.18142GB/s

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The throughput of the <code>popcnt</code> and <code>pdep</code> method is somewhat faster in this specific benchmark.</p>



<ol>
  <li> can also be calculated using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carry-less_product">carry-less multiplying</a>  with <code>11…1</code> and fixing the result with <code>popcnt</code>.
The PCLMUL extension provides this operation, but it can only carry-less multiply 64bit arguments and it still requires XMM registers.
The performance of this method wasn’t great the last time I tried.
There can easily be a CPU instruction that could help beating my method at least in a streaming case, but I’m not familiar with all of the vector instructions.</li>
  <li>Fun fact:  is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thue%E2%80%93Morse_sequence">Thue–Morse sequence</a></li>
  <li>I use a variation of my algorithm in my <a href="https://github.com/leni536/fast_hilbert_curve">fast Hilbert-curve</a> library.
For my purposes I don’t need to shift  and .</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Update2:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/da1juk/implementations_for_gray_code_encoding_and/f1mul2e?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x">IJzerbaard</a> discovered an other improvement: the left shifting can be done early before the pdep instructions, this saves a single instruction in the resulting binary when compiled with gcc:</p>

In this release, Gloo has been tested and validated to work with the latest </span><a href="https://istio.io/latest/"><span>Istio 1.6</span></a><span> release. Additionally, </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2703"><span>Gloo now supports ALPN on the upstream</span></a><span> for more granular control on defining which protocol to use and helps with the integration to the latest version of Istio. Try the Gloo and Istio integration tutorial </span><a href="https://docs.solo.io/gloo/latest/guides/integrations/service_mesh/gloo_istio_mtls/"><span>here</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Security Enhancements&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>In this release we expanded security capabilities to protect the Gloo system and applications in the environment including </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2929"><span>supporting TLS in the external auth service</span></a><span>&nbsp; instead of through an envoy sidecar to handle the TLS termination, the addition of </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/1525"><span>audit logs for the Modsecurity Web Application Filter</span></a><span> (WAF) as part of the access logs to assist debugging and auditing purposes, encrypted communication is now possible with </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2134"><span>mTLS between Gloo and Envoy instances</span></a><span> for when these components are deployed to separate environments, and an </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3084"><span>update to the Gloo permissions</span></a><span> reduces the surface area for risk by enabling it to run in a fully restricted Kubernetes environment.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>User Experience Improvements for Developers and Operations</span></h2><p><span>Across the CLI and Admin UI we’ve made a number of improvements to expand the functionality of glooctl, expand observability capabilities and error handling to resolve system issues.&nbsp;</span></p><ul><li><b>glooctl</b><b> updates include</b><span> extending the timeout period for port forwarding from 3 to 30 seconds before a</span> <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2771"><span>connection refused errors is displayed</span></a><span> improves how commands like </span><span>glooctl check</span><span> or </span><span>glooctl proxy dump</span> <span>work in high latency environments with more time to finish, the </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2715"><span>glooctl add route</span></a><span> command no longer creates a route table or virtual service with the</span><span> –dry-run </span><span>flag, and </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2581"><span>glooctl check</span><span> now uses the default namespace</span></a><span> if a specific namespace flag is not provided.</span></li><li><span>The Admin UI has</span> <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2812"><span>new tags in the Granfana dashboards</span></a><span> for Envoy and Kubernetes and supports </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2804"><span>additional observailiby use case</span></a><span>s with gRPC access logging service metrics.</span></li></ul><ul><li><span>Better error handling by </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2905"><span>logging a clear message</span></a><span> when the upstream port does not match the underlying Kubernetes service, </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2660"><span>report a status</span></a><span> when an upstream points to a non-existent service, and an </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2880"><span>update to the error message display to only show the issue </span></a><span>vs. the entire message.</span></li></ul><h2><span>Expanded Configuration Options for Gloo&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>As a flexible control plane to Envoy Proxy, Gloo is built to support a wide range of deployment scenarios and use cases. In this release we’ve added a number of new options for the admins to customize the behavior of the Gloo environment and traffic handling.</span></p><ul><li><b>New Buffer Filter Improves Request Handling:</b> <span>Gloo now supports enabling the </span><a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api-v3/extensions/filters/http/buffer/v3/buffer.proto#extensions-filters-http-buffer-v3-buffer"><span>Envoy buffer filter</span></a><span> which buffers the entire request before routing it to the service to process the request. This is important because it helps the system understand how big the request is (in case the request size is too big), which avoids having to deal with partial requests and high network latency. </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2444"><span>The buffer filter can be set </span></a><span>by configuring </span><span>spec.httpGateway.options.buffer </span><span>of the desired gateway and can optionally </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2835"><span>configure the bytes limit on the upstream connection</span></a><span> (default is 1MiB).&nbsp;</span></li><li><b>Update to validation webhook: </b><span>Now </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2114"><span>validates inja compilation syntax</span></a><span> before accepting/rejecting virtual services that use transformations, allowing users to properly validate whether configurations are valid against live clusters before applying them&nbsp;</span></li><li><b>SSL Configuration Update: </b><span>Now allows for </span><span>specifying </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2871"><span>empty SSL configurations for clients</span></a><span> depending on the use case.</span></li><li><b>Helm Chart Updates Expand Available Settings: </b><span>They include two enhancements for Knative including the ability to </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2778"><span>assign a static IP to the Knative external proxy</span></a><span> and to </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/pull/2683"><span>override the Service type</span></a><span> as an alternative to Load Balancer for Ingress Proxy and Knative. Additionally, the nodeport numbers for the gateway proxy service can now&nbsp; </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2899"><span>be predefined in the values.yml</span></a><span>. We also added a </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/3016"><span>new value to disable the validation admission webhook</span></a><span> for users who cannot use webhooks but still want to use the Gloo validation API, this value makes it more straightforward to implement.&nbsp;</span></li><li><b>Improved heading formatting:</b><span> The Envoy </span><span>core.Http1ProtocolOptions.HeaderKeyFormat</span><span> is available in the Gloo API as </span><span>httpConnectionManager.http_protocol_options.proper_case_header_key_format</span><span> which</span> <a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2940"><span>formats the header by proper casing</span></a> <span>which helps with validating the headers.</span></li></ul><ul><li><b>Upstream reference by name: </b><span>This allows virtual services, route tables, and upstreams to </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo/issues/2730"><span>refer to an upstream by name only</span></a><span>, </span><span>without causing an error. Gloo will assume the upstream namespace is the namespace of the parent resource.&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span>Give the latest Gloo release a try and we’d love to get your feedback in the </span><a href="https://solo-io.slack.com/"><span>community slack</span></a><span> or </span><a href="https://github.com/solo-io/gloo"><span>file an issue/PR on Github</span></a><span>.

                    <p><strong>The Neurostimulation product aims to replace caffeine beverages with electrical impulses delivered to the sympathetic nervous system.</strong></p><p>Recently announced Zing Energy is a disposable neurostimulation patch designed to create alertness and energy in the wearer. &nbsp;Each patch can be used twice and “delivers a five-minute waveform of proprietary electrical impulses to the greater auricular nerve, creating an autonomic nervous system response.” &nbsp;	The patch is placed behind the ear and removed after the five minute stimulation session. The effects are purported to last up to four hours and to rival or surpass the effect or energy drinks in that time period.</p><p>Thync, the company behind Zing, conducted research over a period of five years which was the basis for the development of Zing. Research and development were conducted by a team of scientists and engineers from MIT, Stanford, UCSF and Harvard.</p><p>Isy Goldwasser, CEO and co-founder at Thync, said of the launch, “Our company was founded on the mission to bring neurostimulation to mainstream consumers and offer better alternatives to consumer drinks and supplements. With the launch of Zing Energy, I believe we've delivered on both.”</p><p>Zing Energy can be obtained at <a href="https://feelzing.com/">their website</a>. &nbsp;You can read the press release <a href="https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/thync-takes-neurostimulation-mainstream-with-zing-energy-the-first-electric-energy-patch-301061117.html">here</a>.</p>

June 25, 2020 | https://coding.blog/blog/jamstack | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://coding.blog/blog/jamstack">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="-codedoc-container"><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/under-the-hood-dark.svg" alt="Banner"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/under-the-hood.svg" alt="Banner"></p></div><p>Basics of providing content over the internet are fairly straight-forward: Browsers will send requests to your
server, and your server responds with some HTML potentially linked to some JS and CSS.</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>How and when you generate those HTML, CSS and JS content is however an entirely different thing. You might want
to prepare them all in advance and have your server just serve them (pre-rendering), 
you might have your server generate them on the fly (SSR), 
or you might have your server ship some code to the browser that will then generate them (client-side rendering, SPAs). 
You might even generate requested content on the server and ship it with the code that 
would generate subsequently requested content on the browser (isomorphic).</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>There is one particular approach pretty suitable for blogs: you prepare most of the content before hand, then
serve it alongside code that would wire-in interactive bits and generate fully dynamic components. This is called
the <a href="https://jamstack.org/">JAMStack</a>, and it is the approach used by <a href="https://coding.blog/"><code>coding.blog</code></a> and
<a href="https://codedoc.cc/"><strong>CODEDOC</strong></a> for content generation. In this post, we go through the reasons we chose this
approach, and how we implemented it.</p><hr><p>To better understand why we chose <em>JAMStack</em> for <code>coding.blog</code> and how we set our further design goals, its good
to first have a general overview of methods of web content generation/delivery:</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>Pre-Rendering</p><p>Pre-rendering simply means preparing your content before-hand, i.e. in the <em>build stage</em>. This is the fastest
delivery method, and allows you to simply use a CDN instead of writing a server for serving your content.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/pre-rendering-dark.svg" alt="Pre-Rendering"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/pre-rendering.svg" alt="Pre-Rendering"></p></div><p>Server Side Rendering (SSR)</p><p>Instead of preparing the content, you can generate them on-the fly on your server, in response to each request.
This is perhaps useful when your content needs to change based on incoming requests, and perhaps you need to
get some data from some API to be able to create the content. However, this approach is obviously much slower
than pre-rendering.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/ssr-dark.svg" alt="SSR"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/ssr.svg" alt="SSR"></p></div><p>Client-Side Rendering and SPAs</p><p>Highly interactive and dynamic content means you need to generate content on the client-side. To avoid having
content-generation code in multiple places (which is hard to maintain / scale), you could instead conduct all
content generation on the client browser, having your server just ship the content generation code.</p><p>To avoid shipping the content generation code for each page of your site, you can also take control of the 
navigation on the client side, which leads to a <em>Single Page Application</em> (SPA for short). This is the basis
of all modern front-end frameworks.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/csr-dark.svg" alt="CSR &amp; SPA"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/csr.svg" alt="CSR &amp; SPA"></p></div><p>Client-side rendering means the user should wait extra time for being able to see the content, since typically
servers are faster at generating content. It also messes up with SEO, since crawlers might not be able to even
get the content in its full form (since they are not browsers) and so might not be able to properly index it.</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>Isomorphic Apps</p><p>To overcome these issues without spreading the content generation code in multiple places, the concept of <em>isomorphic apps</em>
was introduced. The idea is to basically run the same code both on the server and on the client, while also shipping
the code itself to the client alongside content rendered on the server.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/isomorphic-dark.svg" alt="Isomorphic Apps"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/isomorphic.svg" alt="Isomorphic Apps"></p></div><p>The complexity of isomorphic apps inevitably brings extra constraints and overheads. For example, you need to re-hydrate
the content on client-side, which means you are limited on how you manipulate that content (e.g. for React SSR, React needs
to maintain full control of the DOM tree). These complexities also make it harder to optimize performance since many more
components and their interactions are affecting it.</p><marker><br>

</marker><p>JAMStack Apps</p><p>Another approach would be to pre-render all your static content and then ship the code for filling in dynamic/interactive
parts to the client. This would allow for the same delivery speed of pre-rendering without sacrificing interactivity
of the content. It also implies a clear separation in the code-base as opposed to isomorphic apps: there is code that
pre-renders stuff, and there is code that goes to client and makes stuff interactive.</p><div><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/jamstack-dark.svg" alt="JAMStack"></p><p><img src="https://coding.blog/img/blogs/jamstack.svg" alt="JAMStack"></p></div><p>The JAMStack architecture is specifically suitable for mostly static content, which makes it a perfect choice
for likes of <strong>CODEDOC</strong> (which is for documentation / guides about codes) and <code>coding.blog</code> (which is for blogs about
coding / programming). The simplicity of the workflow allows for easy optimization and high degrees of interoperability
and extensibility.</p><hr><p>While the JAMStack architecture was the most suitable for <a href="https://codedoc.cc/"><strong>CODEDOC</strong></a> and <a href="https://coding.blog/"><code>coding.blog</code></a>,
it mandates a split of content generation code into bits that are executed at build stage and bits that are
shipped to the client. This can quickly add a lot of complexity/overhead for any growing project, so we had to
find a solution that addressed this particular issue.</p><p>In other words, we needed to:</p><ul><li>have a shared component system</li><li>easily mark client-side components so that they are not pre-rendered</li><li>seamlessly where these components were to be rendered in the DOM tree</li><li>conveniently and efficiently collect and bundle the code of these clients</li><li>conveniently attach these bundles to pre-rendered content</li></ul><marker><br>

</marker><p>Additionally, we wanted a minimal toolchain and stack with maximum extensibility and interoperability. Generally
we wanted knowledge of HTML/JS/CSS to suffice for serious customization, which made a <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>-based 
syntax an optimal choice for our component system (specifically as Typescript supports it out of the box).</p><p>However, we couldn't use a library like React (or any VirtualDOM based solution) since its sensitivity to external changes to 
the DOM tree meant limitations on how the DOM is manipulated by extensions, either during pre-rendering or on the client.
Besides, we needed our content to be as light-weight as possible, which simply prohibited relatively heavy-weight
operations such as VirtualDOM diffing.</p><hr><p>To satisfy our design goals, we created a JSX-based rendering tool which directly sits on top of DOM APIs.

<p>Static vs dynamic linking usually has to do with our tolerance for the size of our final executable. A<em> static </em>executable contains all code necessary to run the executable, so the operating system loads the executable into memory, and it’s off to the races. However, if we keep duplicating code over and over again, such as printf, then it starts to use up more and more space. So, a <em>dynamic</em> executable means that we only store <em>stubs</em> in the executable. Whenever we want to access printf, it goes out to a <em>dynamic linker</em> and loads the code essentially <em>on demand</em>. So, we sacrifice a tiny bit of speed for a much smaller executable.</p>

<h2 id="linking">What is Linking?</h2>



<p>When I hear someone talk about <em>compiling</em> their program into an executable, they are really eliding over several stages. The definition of  compiling is to <em>produce something by combining information collected from different sources.</em> In computing, we generally think of compiling as turning a higher-level language, such as C, into a lower-level code, such as assembly.</p>



<p>The final stage before we get an executable is the <em>linking</em> stage. This is where we <em>link</em> (hence the name) all sources together to produce one coherent executable. This is also where all outstanding symbols need to be resolved. Symbol is just fancy for the name of a function or global variable.</p>



<p>We can take a look at <em>object code, </em>which is what we get after we assemble but before we link. Here’s an object dump of an example program.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="c" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdlib.h&gt;
void some_func(int a, int b);

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	if (argc &lt; 3) {
		printf("Not enough arguments.\n");
		return -1;
	}

	int a = atoi(argv[1]);
	int b = atoi(argv[2]);

	some_func(a, b);

	return 0;
}</pre>



<p>This code produces the following object code, which I disassemble using objdump for RISC-V.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23.png" alt="" width="500" height="341" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23.png 667w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-23-300x204.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px"></figure></div>



<p>Notice that the function some_func has been prototyped, but has not been defined. This will be the responsibility of the linker to find the symbol some_func and add it into our program. Notice what happens when I try to link this program without ever defining some_func.</p>



<pre>/opt/riscv_1/lib/gcc/riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/9.2.0/../../../../riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu/bin/ld: /tmp/ccmgFc75.o:
<br>
in function .L2': test.c:(.text+0x62): undefined reference to some_func'
<br>
collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status</pre>



<p>The linker is looking for the symbol some_func, but it cannot find it, so we get an <em>undefined reference</em>. We know this is at the linker stage because the error is “ld returned 1 exit status”. The “ld” means “linker”.</p>



<p>We also can see that the address of the function main is 0, this is because we haven’t linked a program. So, our object code just contains <em>bubbles</em> of code, which will then be placed into our executable at certain locations by the linker.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="finding">Finding Symbols</h2>



<p>If we use the command <em>nm</em>, which is used to list symbols in an object file, we can see all of the <em>unresolved</em> symbols. Our object code is looking for these, but it doesn’t need to know where they are until we have a full executable program.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24.png 317w, https://blog.stephenmarz.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/image-24-300x169.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 317px) 100vw, 317px"></figure></div>



<p>You can see that in this object file, the linker has a little bit of work to do. It must find atoi, puts, and some_func, which are flagged as U for undefined symbols. When we execute the linker, we will specify certain libraries, such as -lc (the C library), which most of these symbols will be found. Our some_func has never been defined, so our linker cannot really succeed until we define it somewhere.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="static">Static Libraries (archives)</h2>



<p>Archive files generally end in .a and contain code and other information that will be added to the final executable. Essentially, archive files are just a collection of object files into one file. Therefore, when we link to an archive file, we extract the actual code from the object code into our executable. The nice thing about archive files is that we don’t need to add ALL symbols into our executable–we only need those symbols that need to be used.</p>



<p>Usually, we have archive versions of all libraries to allow for <em>static</em> executables. These executables are those that don’t need any additional loading to run. In other words, these are self-contained files. The linker stage will pull in the code directly from the .a file into the executable, and all is done. The more code that the linker pulls in, the larger the executable will be.</p>



<p>Let’s go ahead and define some_func and see how linking works.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="cpp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void some_func(int a, int b)
{
	printf("Data = %d\n", a * b);
}
</pre>



<p>It’s very simple, but the point is to have some code that the linker can pull in. Recall that the linker gave us an “undefined reference” error because we didn’t define some_func. Now, we have it defined, so let’s see what happens.</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gnu-gcc -static -o test test2.o test.o</pre>



<p>Notice that I’m using gcc still. This will automatically invoke the linker and pull in the necessary <em>start files</em>. If we invoke the linker directly, we have to define _start and tell the program how to start, or we would have to directly specify the start files.</p>



<p>I specify -static so that gcc will pull in only .a files. When we are done, the file <em>test</em> will be a fully-contained, static executable. If we take a look at this file, we can see that all of the “stuff” we need for this executable makes it a fairly large file.</p>



<pre>-rwxr-xr-x 1 smarz smarz 4687920 Jun 1 09:16 test</pre>



<p>Yes, that’s 4,687,920 bytes or about 4.7 megabytes. However, if we looked at the symbol table, we will find that NO symbol is unresolved, and therefore this is a self contained executable. If we load this with our elf loader, no external resources will need to be pulled in.</p>



<p>Our linker must exhaustively follow every possible route and pull in those symbols even though they may never be called. We can see the symbol table is enormous due to all of the calls and global variable (such as errno).</p>

<h2 id="dynamic">Dynamic Libraries (shared objects)</h2>



<p>Dynamic libraries end in .so, which stands for <em>shared object</em>. These libraries contain code that will not be added directly into the executable. Instead a program called the <em>dynamic linker</em> will be responsible for taking code from the .so files and adding them into an executing program. We can also add symbols ourselves using the -ldl (dynamic linker) library.</p>



<p>We can think of the term <em>dynamic</em> as <em>run-time</em>. That is, we don’t actually load the code into our program until the program actually runs. We can see this with something as simple as printf. We can examine our executable and we don’t see printf’s code. Instead, we see printf’s <em>stub</em>. This stub will then be replaced by the dynamic loader when the program executes.</p>



<p>When we link with a dynamic, shared object, those symbols that can be added at run time will remain unresolved. We will have the symbols’ names put into a table just so we know it’s out there somewhere. However, with shared objects, we now can get that <em>unresolved reference</em> (or symbol) at run-time! If you have arch-linux and have ever compiled anything yourself, you might’ve run into this phenomenon.</p>



<hr>



<h2>Making a Shared Library</h2>



<p>Let’s go ahead and turn our test2 file into a shared object. This is fairly easy to do with gcc:</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gcc -fPIC -shared -o libtest2.so test2.o</pre>



<p>The switch -fPIC stands for <em>position independent code</em>. That means all offsets cannot be relative outside of the library itself, and this is usually the case for most shared libraries. In this case, the generated code will be placed into a table to find the offsets. This is required since the library, or specific symbols in the library, can be loaded into any location by the dynamic linker.</p>



<p>Then, we can compile our test program to link to this shared library:</p>



<pre>riscv64-unknown-linux-gcc -o test test.o -L. -ltest2</pre>



<p>In the command above, I am specify the library search path with -L, so -L. means to look in the current directory. Then, I specify the library to link with using -ltest2. GCC will automatically prepend lib and append .so to make libtest2.so.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="analyze">Analyzing A Shared Program</h2>



<p>First, we compile in the location of our library. We can see these shared libraries using the ldd command.</p>



<pre>smarz@DOMO:~ $ ./test<br>
./test: error while loading shared libraries: libtest2.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory</pre>



<p>So, when I run my program, it looks at a certain path to find your libraries. This is analogous to the PATH environment variable, except in Linux (and some UNIXes), we use LD_LIBRARY_PATH. Shown below, if I change my path so the dynamic linker can find my library, it functions properly:</p>



<pre>smarz@DOMO:~ $ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/smarz ./test 10 20<br>
Data = 200</pre>



<hr>



<h2 id="unresolved">Unresolved at Run Time</h2>



<p>When we link a program, many of the symbols will remain unresolved. This tells us what symbols the dynamic linker is responsible for loading from the shared objects (libraries). We can see these unresolved symbols using the nm command:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h3>Why Site Reliability Engineering<br></h3><p>In the world of technology, the stakes have never been higher. The move to the cloud and microservices to maximize agility has given way to digital disruptors and unprecedented competitive threats. As distributed systems become increasingly complex, the scale of ‘unknown unknowns’ increases. On top of this, customer expectations are sky-high. The cost of downtime is catastrophic, with customers willing to churn if their needs are not promptly met. According to <a href="https://blogs.gartner.com/andrew-lerner/2014/07/16/the-cost-of-downtime/">Gartner</a>, the <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/753938/worldwide-enterprise-server-hourly-downtime-cost/">average cost of downtime</a> is $300,000 per hour. For some companies, this number is considerably higher; for example , Amazon lost approximately $90 million during their <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/07/18/amazon-prime-day-outage-cost/">Prime Day outage</a> in 2018, and the outage only lasted 75 minutes.<br></p><p>Organizations need to prioritize reliability so they can innovate as quickly as possible on top of a strong foundation that won’t compromise customer experience. This will become even more critical as more businesses move toward distributed systems with high reliability requirements. That’s where site reliability engineering (SRE) comes in. The SRE function is growing quickly <a href="https://www.techrepublic.com/article/why-site-reliability-engineers-face-more-security-incidents-and-higher-stress-levels/">(30-70% YoY growth in job listings)</a>, but there is not enough skilled talent in the market to compensate. In other words, it will be important to understand how you can not just hire SREs, but grow your <em>existing</em> organization to adopt the practices and mindsets required for production excellence. With the shortage of SREs for hire, what can you do to ensure your service’s reliability? To answer this question, you’ll need a deeper understanding of what SRE actually is.<br></p><h3>What is SRE?</h3><p>SRE is a practice first coined by Google in 2003 that seeks to create systems and services that are reliable enough to satisfy customer expectations. Since then, many large organizations such as LinkedIn and Netflix, have adopted SRE best practices. In recent years, SRE has become more widely adopted by many&nbsp; organizations globally, with the goal of reliability and resilience in mind in light of exponentially growing customer expectations as well as systems complexity.<br></p><p>SRE is based on a customer-first mentality. This means that SRE efforts are all tied to customer satisfaction, even if the customers using the service are actually internal users. Each decision should result in an increase in customer satisfaction. Teams work together to determine which factors and experiences affect customer happiness, measure them, set goals, and balance reliability requirements with the innovation velocity required to stay viable in an increasingly competitive digital landscape.<br></p><p>To achieve this lofty goal, SREs and teams that have adopted SRE best practices refer to several key tenets of SRE. According to <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/introduction/">Google,</a> these include:<br></p><ul role="list"><li>Ensuring a durable focus on engineering</li><li>Pursuing maximum change velocity without violating a service level objective (SLO)</li><li>Monitoring, including alerts, ticketing, and logging</li><li>Emergency response</li><li>Change management</li><li>Demand forecasting and capacity planning</li><li>Provisioning, and</li><li>Efficiency and performance<br></li></ul><p>According to <a href="https://go.forrester.com/blogs/46-of-google-sre-applies-directly-to-your-enterprise-what-about-the-rest/">Forrester</a>, 46% of the tenets can be applied out-of-the-box for most software teams in the enterprise, but the rest require customizations or won’t make sense for the vast majority of organizations. The important question to ask yourself is how these tenets fit in with what you’re already doing, and how your teams can improve.</p><h3>Understanding How SRE Fits Into Your DevOps Practices</h3><p>Think of SRE as the practice that brings life to the DevOps philosophy. The core principles of DevOps and SRE are nearly identical. According to <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/site-reliability-engineering-slos/">Google’s Coursera course</a> on SRE, “class SRE implements DevOps,” the 5 DevOps principles are as follows:<br></p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Reduce organizational silos</strong>: SRE helps by sharing ownership across developers and production teams, and unifying tooling.</li><li><strong>Accept failure as normal</strong>: Blameless postmortems are an SRE best practice that ensures that all incidents are used as learning opportunities. SRE also creates a safe space and guardrails for failure through SLOs and error budgets.</li><li><strong>Implement gradual change</strong>: This is done by canarying rollouts to a small subset of customers before allowing all users to interact with new features. Smaller changes are easier and safer to dissect and iterate on.</li><li><strong>Leverage tooling and automation</strong>: SREs work to eliminate toil by measuring it and creating automation to do repetitive tasks without needing human intervention. This way, humans can focus on higher-value work.</li><li><strong>Measure everything: SRE specifically focuses on measuring toil and reliability to make sure that both customers and software teams are happy with the service.</strong><br></li></ol><p>With these common principles defined, it’s easy to see how SRE and DevOps fit really well together, with SRE codifying practices that make it easier to achieve the promises of DevOps. In fact, you could say that SRE is the human side of DevOps, the culture-building function that approaches systems with the people who run them in mind.</p><h3>A human approach to systems</h3><p>Resiliency engineering as a practice looks at systems holistically, considering not only infrastructure but also human, process, and cultural factors. Without adopting the culture and mindset behind SRE, you’ll simply have new processes with no uniting value at the center to keep the initiative in place. Focusing on the human approach to systems requires reevaluating your organization’s attitude towards three crucial things.</p><h4>On-call &amp; full service ownership practices</h4><p>The notion of on-call is important in SRE for several reasons. It establishes clear ownership to ensure software problems are immediately addressed, and inherently incentivizes developers to ship more performant code. But while going on-call is now a fairly common practice, establishing a healthy, balanced process is crucial to prevent burnout. Nobody can be on-call 24/7, especially when incidents during the on-call period actively disrupt engineers' personal lives. People need uninterrupted time away from work to be at their best, so on-call responsibilities need to be carefully monitored. If someone is waking up at 2 AM every night for a full month, there’s something wrong; it’s simply unsustainable. Additionally, more than one person should have to carry the burden. The whole development team should be empowered to be on-call so the responsibility becomes a shared one. This also incentivizes developers to ship better code to avoid getting woken up at 2 AM.<br></p><p>SRE best practices encourage a better proactive system, with a robust reactive system in place. Being proactive means fostering a community of constant learning and improvement. When your engineers are better prepared and learning from previous incidents, it’s less likely that the same mistakes will be made again. This lowers the amount of incidents occurring as your SRE practice matures. From a reactive perspective, better incident management practices can allow for streamlined communication during an incident, and provide a foundation to treat incidents as ‘unplanned investments’ as they become important learning opportunities. Postmortems thus give engineers a place to begin looking when the root cause of an incident is evading them. SRE gives those who hold the pager more agency.</p><h4>Keeping burnout at bay</h4><p>Constant firefighting, especially with a tough on-call schedule, can leave engineers feeling burnt out. Over time, burnout leads to high turnover rates, meaning the senior engineering will need to pick up additional slack while new hires are ramped up. This only increases burnout, leading to a vicious cycle of dissatisfied engineers who have little capacity to think about improvements, and new hires who are clueless about where to begin.<br></p><p>In this situation, the SRE approach would encourage improved visibility into engineering hours, on-call periods, and repeat incidents. Each of these issues directly contributes to burnout, yet many organizations aren’t tracking them. By knowing which engineers have spent abnormally high hours over an extended period of time, team leads can suggest vacation time to curb burnout. Knowing who has been on-call every weekend for the last month allows teams to better manage the rotation so everyone gets a break. Monitoring repeat incidents and incidents of a similar class can give insight into what’s burning through engineering hours, as well as whether previous postmortems uncovered improvements or follow-up items that were not taken action on. These are issues that should promptly be fixed in order to give teams a break from firefighting, and more time for strategic work.</p><h4>Celebrating failure</h4><p>Failure will happen, incidents will occur, and SLOs will be breached. These things may be difficult to face, but part of adopting SRE is to acknowledge that they are the norm. Systems are made by humans, and humans are imperfect. What’s important is learning from these failures and celebrating the opportunity to grow.<br></p><p>One way to foster this culture is to prioritize psychological safety in the workplace. The power of safety is very obvious, but often overlooked. Industry thought leaders like Gene Kim have been promoting the importance of feeling safe to fail. He addresses the issue of psychological insecurity in his novel, “The Unicorn Project.” Main character Maxine has been shunted from a highly-functional team to Project Phoenix, where mistakes are punishable by firing. Gene writes “She’s [Maxine] seen the corrosive effects that a culture of fear creates, where mistakes are routinely punished and scapegoats fired. Punishing failure and ‘shooting the messenger’ only cause people to hide their mistakes, and eventually, all desire to innovate is completely extinguished.”<br></p><p>Getting the most out of your teams and systems cannot be achieved if blame exists. Blamelessness is at the core of SRE. To fully adopt this practice, you need to acknowledge that people are not a source of failure. Each team member is simply doing their best with the knowledge at hand, making the decisions they believe are right and in the best interests of …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Apache Kafka has gained traction as one of the most widely adopted technologies for building streaming applications - but introducing it (and scaling it) into your business can be a struggle.</p><p>The problem isn’t with Kafka itself so much as the different components you need to learn and different tools required to operate it.</p><p>For those motivated enough, you can invest money, effort and long Friday nights into learning, fixing and streamlining Kafka - and you’ll get there.&nbsp;</p><p>But for those that prefer to spend time focusing on the data and would rather master Kafka’s value than its inner-workings, fear not.&nbsp;</p><p>When we started Lenses.io, we experienced first-hand how difficult it can be to set up a Kafka development environment; so we decided to follow an anti-pattern and create a docker image with a full-fledged Kafka installation: the<a href="https://github.com/lensesio/fast-data-dev"> fast-data-dev docker</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/dH7CDIWIgsRCvAqBzqE31/90912a877cfab5860632ea82905ed00d/kafka_docker.PNG" alt="Lenses Kafka docker"></span></p><p>
The community loved it and we are grateful for this.&nbsp;</p><p>Fast forward and we created Lenses.io, understanding that now the challenge was operating Kafka and real-time applications and data. So we wanted to create a tool to provide the best developer experience for Kafka: Lenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>It is only natural that we had to add it to fast-data-dev and make it free for developers, the people to whom we owe our success.</p><p>Hence, enter the Lenses Box; our most popular download!</p><h3>A complete Kafka-in-a-box</h3><p>To start with, the Box gives you an environment including:
</p><ul><li><p><b>1-node Kafka and Zookeeper</b>: your Kafka service, ready to receive data.</p></li><li><p><b>Kafka Connect</b>: use it to bring data in and out of Kafka, from DBs for example.</p></li><li><p><b>Schema Registry</b>: safely control the structure of your data in Kafka, powered by Avro.</p></li><li><p><b>Elasticsearch</b>: ship your streaming results here for powerful search.</p></li></ul><p>All in a single docker container.</p><p>That’s already quite a lot of time off your plate. Then we package....</p><h3>... A DataOps workspace</h3><p>
In the same container, you’ll get a Lenses.io workspace fully integrated with the Kafka environment.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re not familiar with Lenses.io, it’s an engineering portal for building &amp; operating real-time applications on Apache Kafka.</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/7DWv3Bt0Hktaxp0wffQrPV/5732afddba639697e37f3342beafbe0d/Portal_blog_copy.jpg" alt="Lenses.io Box Apache Kafka docker container for localhost development"></span></p><h3>How does Box help me develop real-time applications?</h3><p>
As a docker container that unifies all these different technologies into a single developer experience, Box is a perfect solution to learn Kafka or to develop real-time applications on a local instance before promoting to another Kafka environment.&nbsp;</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/sXmd6nQXmkgivJ9ejXxhh/5d6cc3687660dd1ac5655348bf1bf240/Portal_blog2.jpg" alt="Portal blog2"></span></p><p>So, if you’re a developer, you can <code>docker&nbsp;run</code> Lenses.io Box on your machine and try out the following use cases.</p><h3>Connect custom applications &amp; explore data in streams</h3><p>Connect your custom application, written in whatever framework you choose, to the Kafka broker just like you would with any other Kafka environment. Once you’ve done this, you’ll have full visibility into your custom application within a workspace. This includes being able to explore data in the streams using SQL, viewing and alerting on lag. If you use the <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/dev/topology/index.html">Topology client</a>, you’ll be able to even see the full topology of your pipelines.&nbsp;
</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/56OrFbezKepp4RQZEqz7Xn/27a231c4ae58faddbd8e2f0025f74832/image.png" alt="IntelliJ - Connecting consumer or producer client to Lenses.io Box localhost Apache Kafka broker"></span></p><h3>Build &amp; evolve schemas</h3><p>
Your gateway into streaming structured data. With support for multiple standard serialization formats, custom formats, and Schema Registry, you can use Box to understand your data and experiment with schemas and evolution. Lenses SQL gives you a perfect playground to iterate and verify your schema changes.
</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/2D7lSbSE37jmPozW5CGMTb/be2ead015664934f37144a30082650c6/docker-run-lenses.PNG" alt="Docker run Kafka on Lenses"></span></p><p>Do you like SQL? If so, use it to create schemas directly. For example the following statement will create a topic with an AVRO schema for the value of the topic.&nbsp;
</p><pre>CREATE&nbsp;TABLE&nbsp;customers&nbsp;(id&nbsp;string,&nbsp;name&nbsp;string,&nbsp;postcode&nbsp;string,&nbsp;city&nbsp;string)</pre><pre></pre><pre>FORMAT&nbsp;(string,&nbsp;avro)</pre><pre></pre><pre>PROPERTIES&nbsp;(partitions=3,&nbsp;compacted=false);&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><pre></pre><p>You can run these statements from the browser or from a CLI</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/nObbLUdN7CVPbGKWxf4n8/30e14ad7dbc9797d690238f2817fdcba/image.png" alt="Lenses.io CLI - create Apache Kafka topic and AVRO schema from command line with SQL"></span></p><h3>Test a microservice by injecting data into a stream using SQL</h3><p>
If you’re developing a streaming application that will be read from Kafka, you are effectively making a <b>Kafka consumer.</b> You will be connecting it to the Broker and you might want to test how it behaves when actually consuming data from a stream.
</p><p>That same SQL Engine I mentioned earlier, also extends to injecting data into a topic. For example:&nbsp;</p><pre>INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;customers&nbsp;(id,&nbsp;name,&nbsp;postcode,&nbsp;city)&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>VALUES&nbsp;('23423','Xavier',&nbsp;'75009',&nbsp;'Paris'),&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>('56456','Anne',&nbsp;'E24',&nbsp;'London'),&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>('8734','Todd',&nbsp;'10175',&nbsp;'New&nbsp;York'),&nbsp;</pre><pre></pre><pre>('6735463','Denise',&nbsp;'3207',&nbsp;'Melbourne');</pre><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/40FjAJMM5z8Apl3dv0kG7z/56918c58b7a96945dffe8e99539fcbad/image.png" alt="Insert data into an Apache Kafka topic via the Lenses.io CLI client and SQL statement"></span></p><h3>Configure Kafka Connect connectors</h3><p>The easiest way to bring data in and out of Kafka is with the Kafka Connect connectors. They are standard patterns of moving data between Kafka and other data systems.</p><p>
The environment is packaged with a number of popular connectors such as Mongo, Elastic 6, Influx but you can also import others.</p><p>
Want to bring in data from a database? Want to ship your results to Influx? No problem. Just a few clicks and Lenses will get those connectors running for you.</p><p>
This is perfect for testing out the Kafka Connect configuration and connection to those source and target systems. You benefit from the feedback loop: from error handling if you’ve mis-configured anything to seeing the performance of the flow. Not to mention being able to explore the data you are sourcing or sinking with SQL.&nbsp;</p><p><span><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3bO29ixv0ZCEzQ9ugBBjId/9b6ddfec459225940cdb8897e88a794e/image.png" alt="View and manage Kafka Connect connectors from the Lenses.io Box"></span></p><h3>Build SQL Streaming applications</h3><p>
Last but not least, Box is an environment to build stream processing applications with SQL.&nbsp;</p><p>The Streaming SQL engine allows you to define real-time data processing applications that enrich, filter, aggregate or reshape data streams. Ask things like:
</p><ul><li><p><i>What’s my total number sales up-till-now? Real-time.</i></p></li><li><p><i>How many clients are on my website checking out my new product right now?</i></p></li></ul><p>The answer is in the data. And all it takes is a bit of SQL. No frameworks, no code, no rocket-science engineering.</p><p>Here's an example<i>

</i></p><pre>SET&nbsp;autocreate=true;</pre><pre></pre><pre>SET&nbsp;`auto.offset.reset`='earliest';</pre><pre></pre><pre>SET&nbsp;`commit.interval.ms`='10000';</pre><pre></pre><pre>INSERT&nbsp;INTO&nbsp;frauds_detection</pre><pre></pre><pre>WITH&nbsp;tableCards&nbsp;AS&nbsp;(</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SELECT&nbsp;ccNumber,&nbsp;provider,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;expiry,&nbsp;accountEnabled</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FROM&nbsp;credit_cards_data</pre><pre></pre><pre>)</pre><pre></pre><pre>SELECT&nbsp;STREAM</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p.provider,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p.ccNumber,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;p.transaction.currency,</pre><pre></pre><pre>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;count(*)&nbsp;attempts</pre><pre></pre><pre>FROM&nbsp;credit_cards_payments&nbsp;AS&nbsp;p</pre><pre></pre><pre>INNER&nbsp;JOIN&nbsp;tableCards&nbsp;AS&nbsp;c&nbsp;ON&nbsp;p.ccNumber&nbsp;=&nbsp;c.ccNumber</pre><pre></pre><pre>WHERE&nbsp;c.accountEnabled&nbsp;=&nbsp;'no'</pre><pre></pre><pre>GROUP&nbsp;BY&nbsp;tumble(5,s),&nbsp;p.provider</pre><p>You don’t need extra services either.. The workload will run locally in your environment for Box. Of course with the full Lenses.io workspace, you can choose to deploy it over your existing Kubernetes infrastructure and run it at scale.</p><h3>“The Cloud”, you said?
</h3><p>As it’s next evolution, yes, Box is now available as a Cloud service!&nbsp; A full Lenses-Kafka developer environment with zero setup.&nbsp;</p><p>Sign up for free on our new <a href="http://portal.lenses.io/register">Lenses.io Portal.</a></p><p>Or if you prefer to run the Docker container yourself, get access to it from <a href="https://lenses.io/downloads/lenses/?path=wizard-form">here</a> <a href="https://lenses.io/downloads/lenses/?path=wizard-form"></a>

    <p>You’ve likely experienced it: “You’re above and beyond everything we’re asking. There’s no promotion this round but all you need to do is <strong>__</strong>_”. Insert a semi-important but not absolutely necessary thing. Even worse if it’s something you’re really not good at.</p>

<p>One of the most demotivating things that an organization or manager can do is requiring “perfection” for a promotion. It’s a problem with two main dimensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It’s incommensurate with the value being added to the business.</li>
  <li>Perfection is subjective.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="incommensurate-with-value-add">Incommensurate with Value-Add</h2>

<p>Ultimately all performance comes down to one thing: how much value are you adding to the business? Examples of where forcing perfection gets things out of whack:</p>
<ul>
  <li>I coded up a feature that brought in $10M to the business this year. I wasn’t promoted because they said I don’t speak enough in meetings.</li>
  <li>I saved the company from collapse because I was the only one who knew how to debug the system when it was melting. I wasn’t promoted because they said I show up too late every day.</li>
  <li>I identified a winning strategy for the entire business that drove us to another echelon of success. I wasn’t promoted because my design docs have typos.</li>
</ul>

<p>All that matters is the value being added to the business. There are nuances where behavior can set bad examples or cause issues for others, but that detracts from value added to the business and should be considered. The unfortunate and unbelievably common case is that some sort of benign missing strength is held against people.</p>

<h2 id="perfection-is-subjective">Perfection is Subjective</h2>

<p>When managers go down the rabbit whole of chasing perfect promotions they’re much more likely to be biased. In reality, most people’s internal picture of a perfect candidate for a promotion is something like “what did I look like when I got promoted?” That’s often the closest image a manager has of what a promotion at that level looks like.</p>

<p>In mild cases you get things like “when I got promoted I had to walk in the snow to work, uphill both ways.”</p>

<p>In more severe cases you get things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Men who don’t promote women because they’re not “aggressive enough” or they “don’t speak up enough”</li>
  <li>Extroverts who don’t promote introverts because they don’t like public speaking.</li>
  <li>Non-parents who don’t promote parents because they don’t work until midnight in the office.</li>
</ul>

<p>Promote people based on impact to the business, not their style of delivery.  Don’t hold people down because they deliver value in a way that isn’t comfortable, known, or practiced by you.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>In promotions and growth, focus more on amplifying strengths than fixing “weaknesses”.  You’ll find it’s much easier and much more fruitful to have people play to their strengths.</p>

<p>Promote imperfect people - that’s all you’ve got.</p>

        <p>Welcome to another episode of Elixir Wizards as we continue our journey into system and application architecture! Our featured guest today is Sundi Myint and she is here to share her journey with Elixir and her non-traditional path to programming. We hear about Sundi's interest in gaming, her role at Cava and a bit of the inspiration behind her amazing Instagram account! We discuss her first internship and how she found herself in the role quite suddenly before diving into the motivation behind her blog post on the history of emojis. Sundi did some serious research into this interesting subject and she shares some of the more technical aspects of the story with us on the show. We talk about architecture and both test and design-driven approaches. Sundi also explains her process and how mapping things out on a whiteboard has been her favored way to do things for some time. Andrea Leopardi then joins us for another edition of Pattern Matching with Todd! He answers Todd's questions about his home life, media favorites, future projects and more!</p>

                    <p>You may have good reasons to focus on developing your disrupting app. And you may well be a very talented developer. But like me, even after years of experience as a web engineer, comes a point where we have to admit we don't know that much about security.</p><p>Unless you only use fully managed solutions to host your web applications, your startup probably has a bunch of servers you have to monitor and maintain. And unless your company has the scale to pay for real DevOps, security engineers, audits or pentests, then quite frankly, we'll mainly focus on finishing the current sprint hoping to get some traction ;)</p><p>Today I got my first Ubuntu VPS from <a href="https://blog.openbloc.com/p/3f54a7d4-a161-4bf0-a9ee-8ea9c6daf259/www.ovh.com">OVH</a>, a fresh new image ready to host the next version of my website. And it's got me thinking: I do remember it's best practice to disable SSH login by password, what else should I do ? Do I need a firewall ? Surely I don't have time to fully audit this default Ubuntu image by myself...</p><p>In this article I'll show you how to harden a default Ubuntu Server 20.04 image using existing open-source tools:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.inspec.io/">Inspec</a> to identify security issues and misconfiguration</li><li><a href="https://www.ansible.com/">Ansible</a> to automatically harden your server</li><li><a href="https://dev-sec.io/">The DevSec Hardening Framework</a> which provides:<br>- <a href="https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline">An Inspec profile</a><br>- <a href="https://github.com/dev-sec">Ansible / Chef / Puppet recipes</a> to enforce above Inspec profile</li></ol><!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><h2 id="quicksshsetup">Quick SSH setup</h2>
<p>Make sure your server is defined in <code>~/.ssh/config</code></p>
<pre><code>Host servername
	HostName &lt;your server ip address&gt;
	User username
	Port 22
</code></pre>
<p>To ssh into the server with your ssh key without typing the password just run:</p>
<p><code>$ ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub servername</code></p>
<h2 id="usinginspecwithlinuxbaselineprofile">Using Inspec with linux-baseline profile</h2>
<p>On the server:</p>
<pre><code># download and install Inspec
$ wget https://packages.chef.io/files/stable/inspec/4.20.2/ubuntu/20.04/inspec_4.20.2-1_amd64.deb
$ sudo dpkg -i inspec_4.20.2-1_amd64.deb

# clone the linux-baseline profile
$ git clone https://github.com/dev-sec/linux-baseline

# run the Inspec profile
$ inspec exec linux-baseline
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://www.inspec.io/docs/reference/install/">Inspec installation instructions</a></p>
<p>You should see a similar output:<br>
<img src="https://cdn.openbloc.fr/2020/06/Capture-d--cran-de-2020-06-17-13-01-40.png" alt="Capture-d--cran-de-2020-06-17-13-01-40"></p>
<p>Next thing will be to automatically apply better OS settings using Ansible and the recipes provided by the DevSec framework.</p>
<h2 id="usingansibletohardentheserver">Using Ansible to harden the server</h2>
<p>On your local machine:</p>
<pre><code># install Ansible
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo apt-add-repository --yes --update ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt install ansible

# install the os and ssh hardening roles
$ ansible-galaxy install dev-sec.os-hardening
$ ansible-galaxy install dev-sec.ssh-hardening
</code></pre>
<p><a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html">Ansible installation instructions</a></p>
<p>We then need to write a playbook for each ansible role:</p>
<pre><code># ansible-os-hardening.yaml
- hosts: your-server
  become: true
  roles:
    - dev-sec.os-hardening
    
# ansible-ssh-hardening.yaml 
- hosts: your-server
  become: true
  roles:
    - dev-sec.ssh-hardening
</code></pre>
<p>Finally run these playbooks with the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>$ ansible-playbook -K ansible-os-hardening.yaml
$ ansible-playbook -K ansible-ssh-hardening.yaml
</code></pre>
<p>Then, re-running <code>inspec exec linux-baseline</code> on the server should give a similar output:<br>
<img src="https://cdn.openbloc.fr/2020/06/Capture-d--cran-de-2020-06-17-13-00-59.png" alt="Capture-d--cran-de-2020-06-17-13-00-59"></p>
<p>Which is much better!</p>
<h2 id="finalthoughts">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Though I can't say I have audited the DevSec framework per-se, I hope you now have a better understanding on how you can automate your servers security to stay up-to-date whith industry best practices.</p>
<p>Depending on what you then run on your server, you may have to allow some ports on the Ubuntu firewall, <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UFW">ufw</a>. Personally while testing <a href="https://caprover.com/">CapRover</a> I just had to run:</p>
<p><code>$ ufw allow 80,443,3000,996,7946,4789,2377/tcp; ufw allow 7946,4789,2377/udp;</code></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>You can find working code examples (including this one) in my <a href="https://github.com/pmuens/lab">lab repository</a> on <a href="https://github.com/pmuens">GitHub</a>.</p><p>Sometimes it's necessary to split existing data into several classes in order to predict new, unseen data. This problem is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification">classification</a> and one of the algorithms which can be used to learn those classes from data is called Logistic Regression.</p><p>In this article we'll take a deep dive into the Logistic Regression model to learn how it differs from other regression models such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression">Linear-</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Simple_and_multiple_linear_regression">Multiple Linear Regression</a>, how to think about it from an intuitive perspective and how we can translate our learnings into code while implementing it from scratch.</p><h2 id="linear-regression-vs-logistic-regression">Linear Regression vs. Logistic Regression</h2><p>If you've read the post about <a href="https://philippmuens.com/linear-and-multiple-regression-from-scratch/">Linear- and Multiple Linear Regression</a> you might remember that the main objective of our algorithm was to find a best fitting line or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane">hyperplane</a> respectively.</p><p>To recap real quick, a line can be represented via the slop-intercept form as follows:</p><p>\[ y = mx + b \]</p><p>Here, \(m\) represents the slope and \(b\) the y-intercept.</p><p>In Linear Regression we've used the existing data to find a line in slope-intercept form (a \(m\) and \(b\) combination) which "best-fitted through" such data.</p><p>Extending the slope-intercept form slightly to support multiple \(x\) values and multiple slopes (we'll use \(\beta_n\) instead of \(m_n\)) yields the following:</p><p>\[ y = &nbsp;\beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n + b \]</p><p>This "scaled-up" slope-intercept formula was used in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Simple_and_multiple_linear_regression">Multiple Linear Regression</a> model to find the \(\beta\) and \(b\) values for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperplane">hyperplane</a> which "best-fitted" the data. Once found we were able to use it for predictions by plugging in \(x\) values to get respective \(y\) values.</p><p>Linear Regression models always map a set of \(x\) values to a resulting \(y\) value on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function">continuous</a> scale. This means that the \(y\) value can e.g. be \(0\), \(42\) or \(5.023.212\). How would we use such a Regression model if our \(y\) value is categorical such as a binary value which is either \(0\) or \(1\)? Is there a way to define a threshold so that a value such as \(42\) is assigned to the category \(1\) while a small value such as \(0.002\) gets assigned to the category \(0\)?</p><p>That's where Logistic Regression comes into play. With Logistic Regression we can map any resulting \(y\) value, no matter its magnitude to a value between \(0\) and \(1\).</p><p>Let's take a closer look into the modifications we need to make to turn a Linear Regression model into a Logistic Regression model.</p><h2 id="sigmoid-functions">Sigmoid functions</h2><p>At the very heart of Logistic Regression is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function">Sigmoid function</a>. A Sigmoid function is a class of functions which follows an S-shape when plotted.</p><p>The most prominent Sigmoid function is the so-called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function">Logistic function</a> which was developed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre_Fran%C3%A7ois_Verhulst">Pierre Francois Verhulst</a> to model <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_growth">population grown</a>. It's mathematically described via this formula:</p><p>\[ f(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}} \]</p><p>Don't be intimidated by the math! Right now all you need to know is that this function takes any \(x\) value and maps it to a \(y\) value which ranges from \(0\) to \(1\).</p><p>Plotting the function for a range of \(x\) values proofs this claim and results in the aforementioned S-shape curve:</p><figure><img src="https://philippmuens.com/content/images/2020/06/zsigmoid_result.png"></figure><p>Note that the function gets closer and closer to the \(y\) value \(0\) or \(1\) as the \(x\) values get smaller or larger respectively. Also note that the \(x\) value \(0\) results in the \(y\) value \(0.5\).</p><p>This is exactly what we need. with this function we're able to "squish" any number, no matter its magnitude into a value ranging from \(0\) to \(1\). This makes the function outcome predictable which is useful when we later on define threshold values to associate function outputs with classes.</p><p>Let's turn the function into code:</p><pre><code>def sigmoid(x: float) -&gt; float:
    return 1 / (1 + exp(-x))

assert sigmoid(0) == 0.5</code></pre><p><strong><u>Note</u></strong>: Although there are many <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function#Examples">different Sigmoid functions</a> to choose from, a lot of people use the name "Sigmoid function" when talking about the Logistic function. We'll adhere to this convention and use the term "Sigmoid function" as a synonym for Logistic function.</p><h2 id="from-linear-regression-to-logistic-regression">From Linear Regression to Logistic Regression</h2><p>Now that we've learned about the "mapping" capabilities of the Sigmoid function we should be able to "wrap" a Linear Regression model such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression#Simple_and_multiple_linear_regression">Multiple Linear Regression</a> inside of it to turn the regressions raw output into a value ranging from \(0\) to \(1\).</p><p>Let's translate this idea into Math. Recall that our Multiple Linear Regression model looks like this:</p><p>\[ y = &nbsp;\beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n + b \]</p><p>"Wrapping" this in the Sigmoid function (we use \(\sigma\) to represent the Sigmoid function) results in the following:</p><p>\[ y = \sigma(\beta_1x_1 + ... + \beta_nx_n + b) \]</p><p>Easy enough! Let's turn that into code.</p><p>The first thing we need to do is to implement the underlying Multiple Linear Regression model. Looking at the Math it seems to be possible to use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot-product</a> to calculate the \(\beta\) and \(x\) part to which we then add the single \(b\) value.</p><p>To make everything easier to calculate and implement we'll use a small trick. Multyping a value by the identify \(1\) yields the value so we prepend \(1\) to the \(x\) values and \(b\) to the \(\beta\) values. This way we can solely use the dot-product calculation without the necessity to add \(b\) separately later on. Here's the mathematical formulation of that trick:</p><p>\[ \vec{x} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ x_1 \\ ... \\ x_n \end{pmatrix} \vec{\beta} = \begin{pmatrix} b \\ \beta_1 \\ ... \\ \beta_n \end{pmatrix} \]</p><p>\[ y = \vec{x} \cdot \vec{m} = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i \beta_i = x_1 \times \beta_1 + ... + x_n \times \beta_n \]</p><p>Once we've calculated the dot-product we need to pass it into the Sigmoid function such that its result is translated ("squished") into a value between \(0\) and \(1\).</p><p>Here's the implementation for the <code>dot</code> function which calculates the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot-product</a>:</p><pre><code>def dot(a: List[float], b: List[float]) -&gt; float:
    assert len(a) == len(b)
    return sum([a_i * b_i for a_i, b_i in zip(a, b)])

assert dot([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]) == 70</code></pre><p>And here's the <code>squish</code> function which takes as parameters the \(x\) and \(\beta\) values (remember that we've prepended a \(1\) to the \(x\) values and the \(b\) to the \(\beta\) values), uses the <code>dot</code> function to calculate the dot-product of \(x\) and \(\beta\) and then passes this result into the Sigmoid function to map it to a value between \(0\) and \(1\):</p><pre><code>def squish(beta: List[float], x: List[float]) -&gt; float:
    assert len(beta) == len(x)
    # Calculate the dot product
    dot_result: float = dot(beta, x)
    # Use sigmoid to get a result between 0 and 1
    return sigmoid(dot_result)

assert squish([1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8]) == 1.0</code></pre><h2 id="the-intuition-behind-the-0-1-range">The intuition behind the 0-1 range</h2><p>We've talked quite a lot about how the Sigmoid function is our solution to make the function outcome predictable as all values are mapped to a \(0\) - \(1\) range. But what does a value in that range represent? Let's take a look at an example.</p><p>The following is a data set which describes how long students have studied for an exam and whether they've passed the exam given the hours they've studied.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><table>

What would happen if we've somehow found some coefficients \(\beta\) for the Linear Regression model which "best" describe the data and pass the result it computes through the Sigmoid function?

Here's something I want you to try: Please apply the formula by setting \(y_i\) to \(0\) and after that to \(1\) and see what happens.

    <p>Somewhere along the way toward our current JavaScript hellscape, programmers decided that HTML was over. We’re done with it.</p>

<p>The emergence of tools like <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html">React</a> shifted programmers away from writing HTML, instead writing <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html">JSX</a>, a fancier tag-based markup language that worked nicely inside your JavaScript.</p>

<p>Backends were then relegated to being dumb JSON API endpoints. Or if you were fancy and chasing upvotes, you’d use <a href="https://graphql.org/">GraphQL</a>!</p>

<p>But HTML? Yuck!</p>

<h2 id="a-brief-history-of-html-over-the-wire">A Brief History of HTML-over-the-wire</h2>

<p>One of the key pillars of Rails is to <a href="https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine/#integrated-systems">“Value integrated systems”</a>. While the industry moves towards microservices, highly decoupled front-ends and teams, and the siren song of Programming via LEGO Bricks, Rails leans into one system that does it all – termed the <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/">Majestic Monolith</a>.</p>

<p>Instead of rebuilding much of what already works in Rails in a client-side JavaScript MVC framework, apps like Basecamp, GitHub, and Shopify are able to achieve snappy page loads using the concept of “HTML-over-the-wire”.</p>

<p>In his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SWEts0rlezA">seminal RailsConf 2016 talk</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sstephenson">Sam Stephenson</a> walks through the pieces of this stack.</p>

<p>By using <a href="https://github.com/turbolinks/turbolinks">Turbolinks</a> (or similar libraries like <a href="https://github.com/defunkt/jquery-pjax">pjax</a> or <a href="https://inertiajs.com/how-it-works">Inertia</a>) and fast HTML responses (aided by caching and avoiding excessive database queries to get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBccDerJPJE">sub-100ms response times</a>), you could build high performance pages, while still hanging on to the understated benefits of stateless HTTP responses and server-side logic.</p>

<p>As Sam points out, it was truly a “Golden Age of Web Development”.</p>

<p><img src="https://boringrails.com/images/golden-age.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So while much of the industry went down the JavaScript rabbit hole – creating new innovations for <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/reconciliation.html">reactive rendering</a>, <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-thunk">functional</a> <a href="https://redux.js.org/">state management containers</a>, and <a href="https://reach.tech/router">approximately</a> <a href="https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router">seventy</a> <a href="https://github.com/frontarm/navi">different</a> <a href="https://blog.remix.run/p/remix-preview">client-side</a> <a href="https://redwoodjs.com/docs/redwood-router">routing</a> <a href="https://github.com/4Catalyzer/found">libraries</a> – the quiet rebellion in Rails-land was honing these techniques and plugging along building apps out of boring server-rendered HTML.</p>

<p>We’re seeing a renaissance of these tools in 2020 and the excitement (at least in a small corner of the Twitter!) is reaching a fever pitch as Basecamp launches HEY: a fully-featured email client with a tiny JavaScript footprint that pushed the boundaries of the HTML-over-the-wire approach.</p>

<blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🤯 Basecamp is building a fully-featured, in-browser email client...using a ridiculously small amount of JavaScript. A tiny keyboard shortcut lib, one polyfill, and boring old Stimulus/Turbolinks/Rails...</p><p>🙏 to <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@dhh</a> for generously shipping source maps, amazing learning resource <a href="https://t.co/IEAvwjiKeO">pic.twitter.com/IEAvwjiKeO</a></p></div>— matt swanson 🤔 🦢 (@_swanson) <a href="https://twitter.com/_swanson/status/1253037966710181892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 22, 2020</a></blockquote>


<h2 id="turbolinks--stimulus-20xx-the-future">Turbolinks / Stimulus 20XX: The Future</h2>

<p>The stack in 2014-2016 was:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Turbolinks/pjax</li>
  <li>Rails UJS + <code>js.erb</code> templates (<a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3697-server-generated-javascript-responses">Server-generated JavaScript Responses</a>)</li>
  <li>Heavy HTML fragment caching</li>
  <li>Rails Asset Pipeline and <a href="https://coffeescript.org/">CoffeeScript</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You can even trace the origin of these techniques back even further. I was recently <a href="https://twitter.com/chris_vannoy/status/1274682764948844545">sent a link</a> to a nearly 15 year old REST “microformat” called <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/rest/ahah">“AHAH: Asynchronous HTML and HTTP”</a>, which is an early version of the same ideas we’re so excited about today. (You shouldn’t be surprised to see <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">David Hansson</a> listed as a contributor!)</p>

<p>Now a “state-of-the-art” 2020 version also includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://stimulusjs.org/handbook/introduction">StimulusJS</a> (see also <a href="https://github.com/alpinejs/alpine">AlpineJS</a>) for lightweight event management, data binding, and “sprinkles” of behavior</li>
  <li>Partial updates with Turbolinks via a new <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> command approach (replacing <code>js.erb</code> and supporting <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP">CSP</a>)</li>
  <li>Real-time Turbolinks updates via <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_cable_overview.html">ActionCable</a> (see also <a href="https://docs.stimulusreflex.com/">StimulusReflex</a>/<a href="https://cableready.stimulusreflex.com/">CableReady</a>)</li>
  <li>First-party support for Webpack, ES6, and new CSS approaches like <a href="https://tailwindcss.com/">Tailwind</a> and <a href="https://purgecss.com/">PurgeCSS</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This stack is extremely powerful and the development experience allows you to really fly. You can build fast and interactive applications with a small team, all while still experiencing the joy of a 2014-era vanilla Rails codebase.</p>

<p>But years of a <a href="https://macwright.org/2020/05/10/spa-fatigue.html">JavaScript SPA-heavy monoculture</a> have made it hard to learn about this stack. The community is filled with practitioners, using the tools to build software and businesses. There simply has not been the same level of content produced and so many of these tools are unknown and can be unapproachable.</p>

<p>One of the ways I can contribute is to light the way for those want to know more by showing some real-world examples (not a <a href="http://todomvc.com/">TODO list</a> or a <a href="https://wsvincent.com/react-counter/">Counter</a>). Once you see how you can use tools like Stimulus and HTML responses to build features where you might instead reach for a tool like React, things will start to click.</p>

<h2 id="lets-build-something-real-hovercards">Let’s Build Something Real: Hovercards</h2>

<p>Hovercards show extra contextual information in a popup bubble when you hover over something in your app. You can see examples of this UI pattern on GitHub, Twitter, and even Wikipedia.</p>

<p><img src="https://boringrails.com/images/hovercard-examples.png" alt="Examples of hovercard UI"></p>

<p>This feature is really easy to build with Rails using an HTML-over-the-wire approach.</p>

<p>Here’s the plan:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build a controller action to render the hovercard as HTML</li>
  <li>Write a tiny Stimulus controller to fetch the hovercard HTML when you hover</li>
</ul>

<p>…and that’s it.</p>

<p>We don’t need to make API endpoints and figure out how to structure all of the data we need. We don’t need to reach for React or Vue to make this a client-side component.</p>

<p>The beauty of this boring Rails approach is that the feature is dead-simple and it’s equally straightforward to build. It’s easy to reason about the code and super extensible.</p>

<p>For this example, let’s build the event feed for a sneaker marketplace app.</p>

<p><img src="https://boringrails.com/images/shoe-hovercard.gif" alt="Shoe feed hovercard example"></p>

<p>When you hover over a shoe, you see a picture, the name, the price, etc. Same for the user, you can see a mini-profile for each user.</p>

<h3 id="the-frontend-stimulus--fetch">The Frontend (Stimulus + fetch)</h3>

<p>The markup for the link looks like:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- app/views/shoes/feed.html.erb --&gt;</span>

<span>&lt;div</span>
  <span>class=</span><span>"inline-block"</span>
  <span>data-controller=</span><span>"hovercard"</span>
  <span>data-hovercard-url-value=</span><span>"</span><span>&lt;%=</span> <span>hovercard_shoe_path</span><span>(</span><span>shoe</span><span>)</span> <span>%&gt;</span><span>"</span>
  <span>data-action=</span><span>"mouseenter-&gt;hovercard#show mouseleave-&gt;hovercard#hide"</span>
<span>&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;%=</span> <span>link_to</span> <span>shoe</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>shoe</span><span>,</span> <span>class: </span><span>"branded-link"</span> <span>%&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/div&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Note: we are using the APIs from the <a href="https://github.com/stimulusjs/stimulus/pull/202">Stimulus 2.0</a> preview release!</p>

<p>One of the great features of Stimulus is that you can read the markup and understand what’s happening without diving into the JavaScript.</p>

<p>Without knowing anything else about the implementation, you could guess how it’s going to work: this link is wrapped in a <code>hovercard</code> controller, when you hover (via <code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code> events) the card is shown or hidden.</p>

<p>As recommended in <a href="https://boringrails.com/articles/better-stimulus-controllers/">Writing Better Stimulus Controllers</a>, you should pass in the URL for the hover card endpoint as a data property so that we can re-use the <code>hovercard_controller</code> for multiple types of cards. This also keeps us from having to duplicate the application routes in JavaScript.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// app/javascript/controllers/hovercard_controller.js</span>

<span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>Controller</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>"</span><span>stimulus</span><span>"</span><span>;</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>class</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Controller</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>static</span> <span>targets</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span><span>"</span><span>card</span><span>"</span><span>];</span>
  <span>static</span> <span>values</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span> <span>url</span><span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>};</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>hasCardTarget</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>cardTarget</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>remove</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>hidden</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>fetch</span><span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>urlValue</span><span>)</span>
        <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>r</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>r</span><span>.</span><span>text</span><span>())</span>
        <span>.</span><span>then</span><span>((</span><span>html</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
          <span>const</span> <span>fragment</span> <span>=</span> <span>document</span>
            <span>.</span><span>createRange</span><span>()</span>
            <span>.</span><span>createContextualFragment</span><span>(</span><span>html</span><span>);</span>

          <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>element</span><span>.</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(</span><span>fragment</span><span>);</span>
        <span>});</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>hide</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>hasCardTarget</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>cardTarget</span><span>.</span><span>classList</span><span>.</span><span>add</span><span>(</span><span>"</span><span>hidden</span><span>"</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>disconnect</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>hasCardTarget</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>cardTarget</span><span>.</span><span>remove</span><span>();</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is all of the JavaScript we’re going to be writing for this feature: it’s only ~30 lines and we can use this for any other hovercards in the app. There isn’t really anything app specific about this controller either, you could pull it into a separate module and re-use it across projects. It’s totally generic.</p>

<p>The controller uses the <code>fetch</code> API to call the provided Rails endpoint, gets some HTML back, and then inserts it into the DOM. As a small improvement, we use the Stimulus <code>target</code> API for data binding to save a reference to the card so that subsequent hovers over this link can simply show/hide the markup without making another network request.</p>

<p><img src="https://boringrails.com/images/hovercard-network.gif" alt="Hovercard Network tab"></p>

<p>We also choose to remove the card when leaving the page (via the <code>disconnect</code> lifecycle method), but you could also opt to hide the card instead depending on how you want caching to work.</p>

<h3 id="the-backend-rails--server-rendered-html">The Backend (Rails + Server rendered HTML)</h3>

<p>There is nothing magic on the frontend and it’s the same story on the backend.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># config/routes.rb</span>
<span>Rails</span><span>.</span><span>application</span><span>.</span><span>routes</span><span>.</span><span>draw</span> <span>do</span>
  <span>resources</span> <span>:shoes</span> <span>do</span>
    <span>member</span> <span>do</span>
      <span>get</span> <span>:hovercard</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Setup a route for <code>/shoes/:id/hovercard</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># app/controllers/shoes_controller.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>ShoesController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>
  <span>...</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>hovercard</span>
    <span>@shoe</span> <span>=</span> <span>Shoe</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>[</span><span>:id</span><span>])</span>

    <span>render</span> <span>layout: </span><span>false</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Write a basic controller action, the only difference being that we set <code>layout: false</code> so that we do not use the global application layout for this endpoint.</p>

<p>You can even visit this path directly in your browser to quickly iterate on the content and design. The workflow gets even better when using a utility-based styling approach like Tailwind since you don’t even need to wait for your asset bundles to rebuild!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- app/views/shoes/hovercard.html.erb --&gt;</span>

<article>
	<p>The Spark + AI summit for 2020 is currently happening from June 22nd to June 26th. There were talks by big names in the industry like Matei Zaharia
and even by Nate Silver from fivethirtyeight.com. There were multiple topics being talked about simultaneously and it was a difficult to just
pick one to listen to as all of them seemed interesting! I took some time to listen to Tomer Shiran, the founder of the Dremio project about the origins,
the need and use cases of Apache Arrow and how they used it in Dremio alongside the Apache Arrow Gandiva.</p>
<h2 id="the-data-querying-conundrum-in-data-lakes-paradigm">The data querying conundrum in Data Lakes paradigm</h2>
<p>Data Lakes are the talk of the town today! In today’s age where data is the chief asset that companies prize, they don’t want to lose any of it
and would rather have it stored in a Data Lake even if it does not make much sense to them right now, with the prospect of it being useful at a
later point in time. That very point makes the data unwieldy.</p>
<p>In such a scenario, when your data store has vast amounts of data, querying becomes slow because it is not just that the data is big but that
transferring data over the network when you query such stores also becomes a non-trivial factor. To get around this problem, companies again
copy part of their data from the Data Lake into Data Warehousing solutions like AWS Redshift. They then construct their OLAP cubes and
aggregations on top of this for fast querying of the underlying data. The drawback of this is that the flexibility of doing anything else with
this data reduces as you copy it into the Data Warehouse. This is the problem that the folks at Dremio / Apache Arrow are trying to solve -
how do you query your data directly from the Data Lake without having to copy it anywhere else?</p>
<h2 id="dremio">Dremio</h2>
<p>The folks at Dremio claim that they have built technology to query Data Lakes with 4 to 100 times better performance than existing solutions. The
way they were able to do it is by defining and implementing a new standard - Apache Arrow, of storing data in-memory in a columnar format for efficient
operations on today’s hardware. I will talk more about Apache Arrow later in this article.</p>
<p>Following are some features that power Dremio -</p>
<h3 id="data-reflections">Data Reflections</h3>
<p>Dremio creates a view of your data, an optimized data structure that lends itself well to boost different query patterns. This data structure can
also auto refresh itself.</p>
<h3 id="columnar-cloud-cache-c3">Columnar Cloud Cache (C3)</h3>
<p>The Columnar Cloud Cache feature takes advantage of local storage (generally NVMe - non-volatile memory express) for a distributed real time
caching solution that increases the amount of read throughput and reduces the amount of data transferred over the network. It is automatic, does
not need any user involvement and caches data based on SQL query patterns, workload management and file directory structures to optimize what to
store and evict.</p>
<h3 id="predictive-pipelining">Predictive Pipelining</h3>
<p>Dremio can predict access patterns of data which reduces its query response times. Based on usage patterns of analytical workloads and their understanding
of columnar data format, the Dremio folks provide this feature wherein they fetch data only before execution engine needs it.</p>
<h2 id="difference-between-dremio-and-facebooks-presto">Difference between Dremio and Facebook’s Presto</h2>
<p>Presto by Facebook is a distributed SQL engine over multiple data sources. Dremio offers more features on top of that. It sits between your
data over disparate sources and you who want an analysis of your data - it squashes the need for data warehousing solutions, OLAP cubes,
extracts and aggregations.</p>
<ul>
<li>Dremio claims to offer speeds of interactive nature with data of any volume</li>
<li>It has deep integrations with some data stores and is thus able to push down some compute when queries are made over those data sources</li>
<li>It is able to show how different datasets are related to each other by creating a lineage of data</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="apache-arrow">Apache Arrow</h2>
<p>Apache Arrow is a specification for storing data in a columnar format in memory, serializing the metadata and for transferring data over the network.
It uses Google Flatbuffers for metadata serialization. It was born out of Dremio’s internal memory format.</p>
<p>It provides constant time random access, data adjacency for sequential scans and lends itself easily for SIMD (single instruction, multiple data)
class of instructions in modern processors.</p>
<p>It serializes data as Arrow buffers / vectors which are basically arrays of the same size with different data types. This whole package together
constitutes its schema.</p>
<h2 id="gandiva">Gandiva</h2>
<p>Gandiva is a part of Dremio which provides a high performance execution engine over Apache Arrow data buffers. Gandiva takes a sql expression,
compiles it into LLVM bytecode and translates it to machine code. To get this high performance it is written in C++.</p>
<p>Tomer wrapped up the talk on Dremio with a demo of the platform as well.</p>
<p>Go give Dremio a try!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>What we pay attention to <a href="https://lithub.com/how-we-pay-attention-changes-the-very-shape-of-our-brains/" target="_blank">changes the shape of our brain</a>. Like water running through a landscape day after day after day, the neural pathways used in our work and routines cut familiar channels that give rise to the ecosystems of our mind. But paying attention is naturally selective. When we choose what to focus on, we are also choosing what to ignore.</p><p>I’ve been programming on and off since the 20th century. I see marked differences in myself, my behavior, perception, etc. when actively coding vs. not. It's finally time to investigate. What am I really paying attention to when programming? What are the implications?</p><p><i>And for the reader, what is your experience? Similar? Different? Or if you’re not a programmer, how does your discipline shape your perception?</i></p><p>When programming, I am writing the future. Every line of code is an instruction to be carried out predictably, if all goes well, a billion times over. Bits of simple logic—compounded across programs stacked on giant stacks of programs—create complex systems of logical inevitabilities.</p><p>To accomplish this, every command I write exercises a tiny mental loop:</p><ul><li><b><nobr>Step 1: </nobr></b><span>Research and understand the “inner logic” of relevant systems.</span></li><li><b><nobr>Step 2: </nobr></b><span>Formulate a hypothesis that models some new bit of logic.</span></li><li><b><nobr>Step 3: </nobr></b><span>Validate and iterate.</span></li></ul><p>Does it work? I test my code and expect an immediate response from the compiler. If yes, I move on to the next bit of logic in my day's lineup. If no, I retest my underlying arguments, breaking down my code into smaller and smaller bits. Every step of the way, my attention walks as efficiently as possible, a garden of forking yes/no paths. It's as if it were me, and not just an electric current, running through the logic gates of my computer’s circuit board.</p><p>When our brain focuses its attention, neuromodulators amplify its activated neural circuits. Like a spotlight on stage, the "speaking" actor is lit up. And likewise, the rest of the stage is intentionally dimmed. We actively suppress competing areas of the brain <code>"with slow waves in the alpha frequency band (between eight and twelve hertz), which inhibit a circuit by preventing it from developing coherent neural activity."</code></p><p>What part of my brain am I suppressing when I spend all day coding? The easy and obvious answer would be the opposite of logic—something to do with emotion. There’s certainly not much place for emotion in programming. This may influence why some of us gravitate more to front-end development—to be not so far from people. Or vice versa. But does programming suppress emotion? Let’s explore deeper.</p><h2>The Good</h2><p>I <a title="Click to expand">learned to code on LSD.</a><sup title="Click to expand">*</sup> Twenty-some years later, there are a few things I love about software development. But none more than the way it encourages and rewards mental plasticity through constant learning and unlearning.</p><p>We break systems apart in order to understand the imperative logic that glues them together. In the game of programming, the rules are entirely knowable… with enough digging. Somewhere, at some point in time, someone wrote them (and hopefully documented them). Debugging feels like the archeology of quirks, from programs layered atop older programs. There’s a real joy in discovery when we unlock a path forward. Over time, this clarity develops into confidence, and we approach systems knowing that yes, if needed, we could do the work to understand any part of this. Fortunately, this is far from what’s usually required; we rarely go deeper than the syntax and grammar of our immediate environment. But our environment still is always changing, and so we must always be learning.</p><p>The second joy of programming: I can build something out of nothing—or more specifically, out of logic and electricity. I’ve built with stone, wood, ink, plastic, etc. The freedom afforded by code is unique and specific—a kind of scalable mental scaffolding. Logically valid patterns can repeat ad infinitum into some functional space, limited for the most part only by their utility.</p><p>For me, programming enhances this way of seeing, which carries over into other areas of my life. My chess game improves drastically when actively coding. I see more clearly defined the risks and consequences of a position. Things seem more obvious, inevitable. I can break down an argument into its key dependencies, find flaws, and put it all back together efficiently optimized towards some solution. My mind begins to resemble the programs I work on.</p><h2>The Bad</h2><p>My mind begins to resemble the programs I work on. The ability to build applications is empowering; but I lose power when I become just another program in the stack for people to input instructions and expect outputs. I’ve seen it throughout my career. No one wants to be a code monkey. And yet, it’s a natural consequence of specialization. Developers are inevitably busy writing code all day, not talking to people. Yes, we’re a strange bunch to begin with, and to follow the stereotype, likely more comfortable with computers than people anyways. But it seems our work reinforces our role as awkward, estranged mental laborers.</p><p>I’d thought I could hack life with the same ease I could hack a program. But life is not an abstract model of logic where outcomes are inevitable and predictable. From where I stand as a microscopic organism inside an unknown number of infinite universes, math can only solve for so much. Certainly, many of society’s rules can be gamed. My heightened logic serves me well in certain domains. But, I struggle too—there’s a price I pay for spending days programming.</p><p>It’s difficult to be exact talking about this, but I feel it strongly in 3 areas of my life:</p><ul><li><b><nobr>1.</nobr></b><span>As I get older, the health impacts—physical and mental—become more apparent. I sit (or sometimes stand) staring into an artificial sun. My body becomes disoriented by space and time. My mind gets wound up, locked into the gears of software. My eyes go dim and blurry. Hiking with the dogs for an hour at the end of every day helps, but it’s not enough. I still find myself reaching for an easy jolt back to reality, often in the form of a drink.</span></li><li><b><nobr>2.</nobr></b><span>Programming requires a quite specific mental model that makes it difficult to balance in parallel with other, more creative activities (making art, creative writing, cooking, etc.). They all struggle for my attention like children with divergent needs. It’s not so simple as time boxing activities and switching modalities, as I have to travel half way around my mind to get from one headspace to another. Too often, I end up stuck wasting my time commuting between <a title="Click to expand">competing mindsets.</a><sup title="Click to expand">*</sup></span></li><li><b><nobr>3.</nobr></b><span>Finally, and perhaps the most significant consequence: I find it challenging to relate to others when in the mindset of programming. After spending my day communicating with the compiler in encoded logic, writing commands, and expecting immediate responses, talking with a human feels slow and inefficient.</span></li></ul><p>This last point is a bit of a trope, so I want to expand. When my attention is zeroed in programming, it’s not emotion that my mind suppresses, but rather, my ability to listen, to really listen. I notice it when talking with my wife (with whom I have 10+ years of observed patterns). After a day of programming, I hear her “inputs” and I can “output” the appropriate answer. But I lose touch with her human experience. What’s not explicitly defined ceases to register. Unless I’m being intentional about it, programming often degrades my capacity for empathy.</p><p>Empathy requires a different relationship to the unknown. It enables us to “hold space” for the valid, yet truly unknowable experience of another person. It saves us from projecting our ideas of ourselves, filled with expectations and judgements, into that space. That’s not to say we don’t try to understand or pattern-match. Or that we don’t share our own experience in response. It’s just that there’s no equation that can solve for two peoples life, history, genetics, etc. We try, of course, with derivatives, approximations, and metaphor. But this is where logic ends and art begins.</p><h2>The Unknown</h2><p>So what? Programming supports my way of life, my family. These side-effects are collateral damage. But I know that by seeking to understand them, I can at least begin to address negative impacts.</p><p>Perhaps, this is just one man’s experience and not something I should generalize. But my curiosity beckons, if what I’m writing about is an experience at all common to programmers, what are the implications?</p><h3>1. Can we find a healthier, more sustainable balance with programming?</h3><p>This obviously applies to computer work in general; the physical constraints and proposed solutions are well-documented—good ergonomics, exercise, etc. But on the mental side, how do we ground ourselves during a day spent riding the proverbial lightning? Stretched across the course of a career, how does this contribute to programming being a “young person’s game,” where individual contributors as they get older burn out and switch to manager roles?</p><h3>2. Looking through the wide-angle lens: is our work’s suppression of empathy at the root of the tech-lash?</h3><p>Tech has a lossy view of the human experience. We are degraded to a few million data points. Emotion is gamified for attention, dollars, and worse. Human activity online can be easily modeled by a bot. It's common to marvel at how advanced bots and algorithms have become. But on the flip side, it reveals how shallow our models of the human experience online actually are, that a few automated clicks and some NLP can fool us.</p><p>As they say, we only improve what we measure. But we don’t measure what we don’t know. We don’t talk about empathy because it’s not a variable or a metric in any of our systems. So how can we make space for empathy in our programs as they continue to eat the world?</p><h3>3. A final thought on the future of programming</h3><p>We're entering the terrain of science-fiction here, but what would it mean to program for empathy, to encode it in our systems? Here's one possible requirement: can our programs ever account for unknowable truths?</p><p>Pe…</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The short answer is yes.
It's a small change and easy to make, it won't disrupt your workflow, but has the possibility of making a group of people feel a bit more comfortable.</p>
<p>But don't delude yourself that by doing this you're fighting racism.
You're not.</p>
<p>There's a <em>real</em> work to do out there.
Unless you make this the first step in the long journey, the branch name will be the only thing that changed.</p>
<hr>
<p>The other night, I noticed that when the new Xcode 12 sets up the Git repo for a new project, it uses <code>main</code> instead of <code>master</code> as the branch name.</p>
<p>I eagerly <a href="https://twitter.com/mokagio/status/1275403354324303873">tweeted</a> my discovery.</p>
<blockquote>— Gio 💻🔧📚 (@mokagio) <a href="https://twitter.com/mokagio/status/1275403354324303873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 23, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>I woke up to more than a hundred mentions.
People got very passionate about it, the haters and the trolls were unleashed.</p>
<p>I didn't reply to the tweets.
Twitter is not the place to have constructive conversations on difficult topics, as many of the comments show. The medium is too constrained for deep thinking.</p>
<p>I'd like to say a few words here, though.</p>
<p>Moving away from the name <code>master</code> in repositories is a recent trend it tech.
<a href="https://www.theregister.com/2020/06/15/github_replaces_master_with_main/">GitHub is working on a similar change</a> and so is <a href="https://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, where I work.
WordPress.org has already <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2020/06/18/proposal-update-all-git-repositories-to-use-main-instead-of-master/">opted to use <code>trunk</code> </a> instead.</p>
<p>The topic of language in software development is older, though.
For example, 6 years ago the Django web framework <a href="https://github.com/django/django/pull/2692">replaced all occurrences of "master/slave" with "leader/follower"</a>.</p>
<p>Does changing a few names in your codebase "end racism"?
No.</p>
<p>Is it going to have a meaningful impact on society or even just tech?
No.</p>
<p>Is it just theater, doing <em>something</em> just to show that something is being done? Possibly.</p>
<p><strong>Is it something worth doing?
Yes.</strong></p>
<p>It's not a matter of being politically correct.
It's a matter of building a more inclusive environment, one step at a time.</p>
<p>The words you use make a difference in the results you get.
Marketers know it well, using the right wording can make or break the sale numbers.</p>
<p><a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/pryzant2017sigir.pdf">A Stanford study</a> shows that in Japan, products sell best if their advertising uses polite language and words that invoke cultural tradition.
<a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/cogs.12637">Another study</a> shows that if you want to encourage girls into STEM subjects, using a statement like "girls are as good as boy at math" will actually achieve the opposite result, reinforcing the stereotype that boys are better than girls.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[I]n some ways, implicit messages might shape beliefs more powerfully than explicit messages that express the same ideas.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Using a more inclusive language is the first step to build an inclusive world.
Not the only step, not the most impactful one, but a step nonetheless.</strong></p>
<p>And if this argument is not enough for you, what about just <del>not being an asshole</del> being kind?
<em>See how I changed my language to make the message positive there?</em></p>
<p>Rob Napier <a href="https://twitter.com/cocoaphony/status/1275494069024817155">puts it well</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If someone tells you that a term is offensive, you should start with the assumption that they're correct, and behave accordingly, unless you have some good reason to think it's in bad faith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not everybody has the same background as you do.
Just because something does not affect you, it doesn't mean it does not affect other people.
How would you like it if words that are offensive to you were thrown around all the time?
Do you really think you could just <em>toughen up</em> and move on?</p>
<p>Religions across history have a common thread in the so called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule">golden rule</a>: "<em>Do not treat others in ways that you would not like to be treated</em>".</p>
<p>The beauty of the golden rule is that there's nothing mystical to it.
You don't need to be religious to appreciate it's effectiveness.</p>
<p>The folks at <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog">Thoughtbot</a> went through something similar when they renamed their popular library from <code>factory_girl</code> to <code>factory_bot</code>.
The name was <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/factory_bot/pull/943/files">meant as a nod to the factory method and the object mother patterns</a>, but the female gender in such a male-dominated space as tech made some people uncomfortable.
They <a href="https://thoughtbot.com/blog/factory_bot#why">eventually changed it</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We concluded that, even though not everyone agreed, lack of concern from many shouldn't prevent the name being changed.
Being clever shouldn't be favored at the expense of others feeling marginalized.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If such a small change as <code>git -m main</code> can have a positive impact, even if little, in the work life of some people with a concrete reason to ask for it, why not just doing it and move on?</p>
<p>But don't pat yourself in the back just yet.</p>
<p><strong>Changing from <code>master</code> to <code>main</code> doesn't mean you're fighting against racism and inequality.</strong>
It is but a single step, and an easy one, too.</p>
<p>The cynical will say that this is only theater, smoke and mirrors.
If that's as far as you'll go, than that's true, it was just theater.</p>
<p><strong>But maybe, just maybe, we can make this tiny change be the first of many.</strong></p>
<p>The next one is <a href="https://anygoodthing.com/2020/06/14/what-is-racism/">educating ourselves</a>.
Another one is trying to understand <a href="https://dev.to/afrodevgirl/replacing-master-with-main-in-github-2fjf">other people's point of view</a>.
And the one after that is changing our companies from the bottom up by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyiMathkUrQ">lending our privilege</a>.</p>
<p>Just don't go on Twitter and feed the trolls.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-20">
		
	
	<div>
		
<p>Some commenters (/u/coderintherye chain notably) on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23630201">HN post</a> of the <a href="https://thinkingagriculture.io/what-silicon-valley-doesnt-understand-about-agriculture/">original article</a> brought up good points that I wanted to expand on and provide some additional context. Also for clarification: although farming is truly global, most ‘farming’ I refer to pertains to the United States (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agriculture_in_the_United_States">which is an agriculture juggernaut</a>), but in my experience should reasonably translate across agriculture zones (pending equivalent laws and climatic factors).</p>



<p><strong><em>There is ample VC money for Ag startups</em></strong></p>



<p>The original intention of the article wasn’t to bemoan the lack of capital available for <a href="https://agiowa.com/portfolio/">founders focused on agriculture</a> (there is actually plenty of capital–check out <a href="https://agfundernews.com/">AgFunderNews</a> for examples of successful raises). Instead, it is a recommendation for anyone entering the space to understand the industry and its history to harness existing synergies rather than try and swim upstream. Watching capital go to ‘solved’ problems is painful, because there are many opportunities for a unicorn ag startup if aimed in the correct space. Vertical farming for non-vegetables (or fruits) is likely dead-on-pitch. Yes, vertical farming <em>is</em> and <em>could be</em> successful, but those markets are very specific and probably 10x smaller than people think. Nice businesses no doubt, but not market shaping behemoths VCs are after. Agriculture is rightfully a commodity and the market will brutalize ideas/companies that can’t turn a profit. One bad year (droughts in 2011 and 2012 in the US Midwest) from external forces can absolutely put farmers out of business. Indoor farming has all of the risks of outdoor ag–and more! Indoor farming requires water (whose source can dry up and get shut off unexpectedly, just like a drought), has pests, and requires artificial lighting (power outage for 5 days? Uh oh). Herbicides (and sometimes pesticides) are actually an example of innovation pre-SV. Alternate technologies (i.e mechanical) didn’t work or were uneconomical for the time period; thus, chemical solutions seemed to thrive (glyphosate/glufosinate resistant corn/soy/wheat/cotton/sugar beets &amp; <a href="https://agrilife.org/lubbock/files/2020/02/BtTraitTable_FEB_2020.pdf">BT resistance for insects</a>). I predict in next 5-20 years we see that flip, where chemical and biological solutions fall out in favor of mechanized solutions (who wouldn’t want a semi-autonomous robot pulling weeds in fields in favor of a chemical solution that is <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bayer-reaches-10-5-billion-settlement-roundup-cancer-lawsuits-n1232026">open to litigation</a>)? We just have too little understanding of 2nd and 3rd order effects of disrupting nature at this scale (<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49660-6">gene drives included</a>, as promising as they appear) using these incredibly effective chemicals.</p>



<p><strong><em>Financing in the Heartland</em></strong></p>



<p>I won’t speak of financing agricultural operations in a municipality not located in the United States, as even understanding the US situation takes time and effort. Let’s be clear though: Most farmers <em>need</em> to borrow capital just to operate for a given year (hence, there is a note called an ‘operating loan’) and financing agriculture operations is more and more important as the size of farms increases. They buy seed, fertilizer, feed, chemicals, etc. to be able to produce an output to then (hopefully) sell at a profit–all to rinse and repeat. Buying big expensive new tractors ($300k+ USD), buildings to store the machines, grain storage, fencing, animal houses–all generally require a loan. Because of the huge cost to purchase these necessities, financing institutions generally need to have a <em>very</em> thorough understanding of the operation (Only farm 160 acres of corn,soy,or wheat? Good luck buying equipment). So bankers have become very good (not perfect) at evaluating and swaying farming practices to ensure maximum likelihood of repayment. Seriously, check of the used auction prices of ag machinery sometime–<a href="https://www.bigiron.com/Lots/2011JohnDeere8335RMFWDTractor-3">this tractor</a> is 10 years old and commands the price of a new Tesla. Is ag financing a place that needs disruption? Likely no because ag lending has evolved hand-in-hand in rural communities where agricultural production is the predominant industry. Because they evolved with ag, they likely have already captured the +EV that startups tend to seek because their very existence depends on it. So where <em>are</em> the value proposition? I know nothing of their founding, but the previous auction link is from <a href="https://www.bigiron.com/">Big Iron Auctions</a> and those founders likely understood ag (“hey, there is a robust secondary market for farm machinery”) and created on-line version of it–with what appears to be great success. I’d imagine these on-line secondary markets exist in Brazil and Eastern Europe given there agriculture exposure. </p>



<p><strong><em>Success Stories</em></strong></p>



<p>There are some truly incredible examples of engineering and innovation in agriculture that focus on the mechanization and scale <em>that already exists</em>. Transplanting vegetables in the Central Valley (CA) used to be labor intensive–<a href="https://www.planttape.com/">this brilliant solution solved that</a>. Auto-steer <a href="https://www.fieldbee.com/blog/fieldbee-tractor-autosteer-versus-other-systems/">systems</a> that leverage machinery that already exists. Sometimes the innovation is statistical/computation (<a href="https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-animal-021815-111422">genomic prediction has revolutionized dairy cattle</a>) Starting businesses is hard and agriculture is no different.</p>



<p>Stay away from vertical farming–unless you plan on growing saffron or figure out a way to cultivate morel mushrooms!</p>

On June 30th at 3 PM ET, thousands of people across the country will compete to win $25,000. The contest: Be the last person to take their finger off their phone.</p><p><strong>You’re kidding?</strong> No. I’m drop-digit serious. And so is the marketplace of ideas. &nbsp; According to <a href="https://www.appannie.com/en/apps/ios/app/1508022053/">App Annie</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finger-on-the-app/id1508022053">Finger on the App</a> is the #1 free app in the iOS app store, with over 3,000 reviews. You can find articles on the contest in TechCrunch, Mashable and Forbes.&nbsp;</p><p>Companies pay in the billions to be on the top of the iOS app store. MrBeast did it for $25,000 — plus the price of the app, of course.&nbsp;</p><p>This type of press would cost millions of dollars. Companies pay billions of dollars to try to be on the top of the iOS app store. MrBeast did it for $25,000.&nbsp;</p><p>MrBeast is an outlast competition, well, beast. Last December, he gave away $1,000,000. The contest? Be the last person to take your hand off $1,000,000.&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s pause to appreciate the irony here. In a time when everyone’s competing for people's attention via the utility of an app, MrBeast captured everyone's attention via an app that has no utility whatsoever. In fact, the app renders your phone unusable. During the contest, you can’t use your iPhone as a phone — or to text! (OMG! Is anything sacred?)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why do these contests work?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>People, Americans especially, love free stuff. But don't take my word for it. Take the neuroeconomics professor’s word for it. <a href="https://cm-commerce.com/academy/what-science-says-about-discounts-promotions-and-free-offers/">In a 2012 study</a> for Coupons.com, Dr. Paul Zak discovered:&nbsp;</p><p>"Coupon recipients who got a $10 voucher experienced a 38% rise in oxytocin levels and were 11% happier than those who did not receive a coupon. Furthermore, their respiration rates dropped 32%, heart rates decreased by 5% and sweat levels were reportedly 20 times lower than their peers. Consequently, they felt more relaxed and less stressed."</p><p>People who get free stuff are happier than people who don't. (And they perspire less, which makes their friends happier.)</p><p><strong>Why do we compare ourselves to others?</strong></p><p>"Individuals evaluate their own opinions and abilities by comparing themselves to others,” notes <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/basics/social-comparison-theory">Leon Festinger</a>, “in order to reduce uncertainty in these domains, and learn how to define the self."&nbsp;</p><p>People don't care about public opinion polls. They care about their peers. Or, more accurately, they care about how they compare to their peers. They want to make more money, have nicer things, and be in stronger relationships than their peers.&nbsp;</p><p>"Status is a very big part of it. They want to win. That's part of the motivation. We're all competitive in our own way,” says <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/19/your-money/inside-the-minds-of-the-ultrawealthy.html">psychologist Brad Klontz</a>, in the NY Times. “It’s part of our tribal DNA. If you think about tribal societies, the person who has the most power also has the most access to resources, and they can protect and provide for their family. The closer others are to that leader, the safer they feel. It's the pursuit that brings them happiness … The money is a side effect, but it's not what is giving them joy."</p><p>Am I alone here thinking how sweet it would be to know 15 of my friends were also in the MrBeast contest, and I won? I’d list this prize alone in the awards section of my resume.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Build Community to Capture Attention</strong></p><p>MrBeast has gamified the giveaway. <strong>The formula?</strong> Create a contest, reward your fans, go viral and repeat. Fans love the idea of being part of something bigger than themselves. On June 30th, hundreds of thousands of people will have their finger on an app all for MrBeast.&nbsp;</p><p>What’s that type of attention worth?&nbsp;</p><p>A hell of a lot more than $25,000, I assure you.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Thanks to </em><a href="https://twitter.com/randaldoane"><em>Randal Doane</em></a><em> for coaching me through this essay.</em></p></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
									<div>
										
										<p>The Go team recently released a new post in the Go blog called
<a href="https://blog.golang.org/generics-next-step">Â«The Next Step in GenericsÂ»</a> and updated the design draft on
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md">Â«Type ParametersÂ»</a> (a long one).</p>

<p>In the current post I’m going to describe how to port Java’s Stream to Go 2 Generics.</p>

<p>Let’s make it straightforward â€” define the Stream:</p>

<pre><code>type Stream(type Type) struct {
	slice    []Type
	parallel bool
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we declare a new type using type parameter <code>Type</code> with underlying slice <code>[]Type</code>.</p>

<p>And let’s have a constructor:</p>

<pre><code>func Of(type Type)(slice []Type) *Stream(Type) {
	return &amp;Stream(Type){
		slice: slice,
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>The parameter <code>(type Type)</code> after name of function and in type declaration is Type Parameter.
The type parameter is required whenever we are going to use generics.</p>

<p>Now we can implement core functions of a typical stream:</p>

<ul>
<li>Filter</li>
<li>Map</li>
<li>Reduce</li>
<li>ForEach</li>
<li>Collect</li>

<li><p>AnyMatch/AllMatch/NoneMatch</p>

<pre><code>func (stream *Stream(Type)) Filter(predicate func(Type) bool) *Stream(Type) {
	filtered := []Type{}
	for _, item := range stream.slice {
		if predicate(item) {
			filtered = append(filtered, item)
		}
	}
	stream.slice = filtered
	return stream
}

func Map(type Type, R)(stream *Stream(Type), predicate func(Type) R) *Stream(R) {
	slice := make([]R, len(stream.slice))
	for i, item := range stream.slice {
		slice[i] = predicate(item)
	}
	return Of(slice)
}

func Reduce(type Type, R)(stream *Stream(Type), predicate func(R, Type) R) R {
	var result R
	for _, item := range stream.slice {
		result = predicate(result, item)
	}
	return result
}

func (stream *Stream(Type)) ForEach(predicate func(Type)) *Stream(Type) {
	for _, item := range stream.slice {
		predicate(item)
	}
	return stream
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that Map and Reduce functions are not declared on <code>Stream(Type)</code>. It’s one of unsolved problems of current generics
design draft â€” parametrized methods are not permitted.</p>

<p>It means that we can have a function that receives type <code>A</code> and returns type <code>B</code>:</p>

<pre><code>func foo(type A, B) (a A) B
</code></pre>

<p>But we can’t declare a parametrized method on type <code>Struct(A)</code> like this:</p>

<pre><code>func (s Struct(A)) foo(type B) (a A) B
</code></pre>

<blockquote>
<p>This design draft does not permit methods to declare type parameters that are specific to the method. The receiver may
have type parameters, but the method not add any type parameters.
<a href="https://go.googlesource.com/proposal/+/refs/heads/master/design/go2draft-type-parameters.md#no-parameterized-methods">Quote from the updated design draft</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s time for the cherry on top â€” <code>Stream(Type).Collect()</code>.</p>

<p>The signature of Collect function will be pretty simple:</p>

<pre><code>func Collect(type Type, Col)(
	stream *Stream(Type),
	collector collector.Collector(Type, Col),
) Col
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that now we have two type parameters â€” one for original type that was used for creating a stream and another one
for resulting collection.</p>

<p>Here is a interface for a typical collector that consists of four functions:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Supply()</code> â€” a function that creates and returns a new result container.</li>
<li><code>Accumulate()</code> â€” a function that folds a value into a mutable result container.</li>
<li><code>Combine()</code> â€” a function that accepts two partial results and merges them. This is going to be used only in parallel mode.</li>

<li><p><code>Finish()</code> â€” while in Java this method converts from an intermediate type to the final result type, but in order to save
the simplicity of the implementation, it will return the same type.</p>

<pre><code>type Collector(type Type, Col) interface {
	Supply() Col
	Accumulate(Col, Type) Col
	Finish(Col) Col
	Combine(Col, Col) Col
}
</code></pre></li>
</ul>

<p>Now we have the interface, we need an implementation. But since we want to allow developers to add
their own implementations without declaring new types, we need a constructor that will accept functions, think of it
like <code>http.HandleFunc()</code> which is often used to wrap functions and returns <code>http.Handler</code>.</p>

<p>We will declare a new constructor for <code>Collector(Type, Col)</code> like we did for <code>Stream(Type)</code> that will return unexported
implementation of <code>Collector(Type, Col)</code> that will just call the given functions:</p>

<pre><code>func Of(type Type, Col)(
	supply func() Col,
	accumulate func(Col, Type) Col,
	finish func(Col) Col,
	combine func(Col, Col) Col,
) Collector(Type, Col) {
	return impl(Type, Col){
		supply:     supply,
		accumulate: accumulate,
		finish:     finish,
		combine:    combine,
	}
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that we also have to specify <code>(Type, Col)</code> for <code>Collector</code> even though we specified it later <code>impl(Type, Col)</code>.</p>

<p>The <code>impl(Type, Col)</code> type is going to be a holder of functions that implements the <code>Collector(Type, Col)</code> interface:</p>

<pre><code>type impl(type Type, Col) struct {
	supply     func() Col
	accumulate func(Col, Type) Col
	finish     func(Col) Col
	combine    func(Col, Col) Col
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Supply() Col {
	return collector.supply()
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Accumulate(collection Col, item Type) Col {
	return collector.accumulate(collection, item)
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Finish(collection Col) Col {
	if collector.finish == nil {
		return collection
	}
	return collector.finish(collection)
}

func (collector impl(Type, Col)) Combine(collection1, collection2 Col) Col {
	return collector.combine(collection1, collection2)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here we’re good, now let’s declare a simple collector that is going to convert a <code>Type</code> to <code>Map[Key]Value</code> â€” <code>ToMap</code>:</p>

<pre><code>func ToMap(type Type interface{}, Key comparable, Value interface{})(
	mapper func(Type) (Key, Value),
	accumulator func(Value, Value) Value,
) Collector(Type, map[Key]Value) {
	return Of(
		func() map[Key]Value {
			return map[Key]Value{}
		},
		func(table map[Key]Value, item Type) map[Key]Value {
			key, value := mapper(item)
			now, _ := table[key]
			table[key] = accumulator(now, value)
			return table
		},
		func(table map[Key]Value) map[Key]Value {
			return table
		},
		func(table1, table2 map[Key]Value) map[Key]Value {
			for k2, v2 := range table2 {
				v1, _ := table1[k2]
				table1[k2] = accumulator(v1, v2)
			}
			return table1
		},
	)
}
</code></pre>

<p>An interesting thing about this function is that while it has three separated type parameters, it returns
<code>Collector(Type, map[Key]Value)</code> that uses only two type parameters.</p>

<p>Note that we need to specify Type Constraint for Key <code>comparable</code> in order to use it as key of a map otherwise it just
wouldn’t work.</p>

<p><code>ToMap</code> expects two functions on input:</p>

<ul>
<li>Mapper <code>func(Type) (Key, Value)</code> â€” receives an original element and returns two values: first one is going to be used as key
of the map, and the second one is going to be used as the value of the map[key]</li>
<li>Accumulator <code>func(now Value, update Value) Value</code> â€” receives current value of map[key] and new value <code>update</code> that have to be
somehow accumulated into <code>now</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s see how it will work out on practice:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Declare a simple type that will describe a movie and a score that a user gave to the movie:</p>

<pre><code>type MovieVote struct {
	Name  string
	Score int
}
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Create a stream of slice of some movies and user votes:</p>

<pre><code>items := stream.Of(
	[]MovieVote{
		{Name: "A", Score: 1},
		{Name: "A", Score: 2},
		{Name: "B", Score: 9},
		{Name: "B", Score: 10},
		{Name: "B", Score: 8},
		{Name: "C", Score: 7},
		{Name: "C", Score: 8},
		{Name: "C", Score: 7},
	},
)
</code></pre></li>

<li><p>Now let’s convert them into <code>map[Name]SumOfScore</code>:</p>

<pre><code>result := stream.Collect(
	items,
	collector.ToMap(MovieVote, string, int)(
		func(movie MovieVote) (string, int) {
			return movie.Name, movie.Score
		},
		func(total, score int) int {
			return total + score
		},
	),
)
fmt.Println(result)
</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>The mapper returns name as key and score as value</li>
<li>The accumulator sums total and current score</li>
</ul>

<p>Output:</p>

<pre><code>map[A:3 B:27 C:22]
</code></pre>

<p>By the way, this collector also works in Parallel mode, check it out in the source code:</p>

I know if I start using it regularly, I will become addicted to it. So, imagine my surprise when on one Sunday afternoon I found out that I spent the entire day doing nothing but watching videos on YouTube.</p><p>The saddest thing is that I didn’t even remember what I was watching. It was just a clockwork for my brain at that point. Wake up, open YouTube, watch a video, continue watching videos.</p><p>I write this blog on another Sunday afternoon, almost three months after, to say that I watched YouTube for just 10 minutes this week to watch a work-related video that a colleague sent.</p><p>I’m a little proud of myself, to tell the truth.</p><p>This is a log of everything I did to overcome this addiction. If it helped me, it might help someone else too.</p><h2 id="how-and-why-i-became-addicted">How and Why I Became Addicted</h2><p>YouTube is a community where billions of people share their talents, interests and findings with you.</p><p><strong>That’s the hook.</strong></p><p>The <strong>real</strong> YouTube is a billion-dollar company where hundreds of researchers and designers manipulate an algorithm to deliver a low-quality video to you.</p><p>I thought about why I was addicted for a long time. It basically was three things,</p><ul><li>Types of videos I watch</li><li>YouTube’s Algorithm</li><li>YouTube’s Story</li></ul><h3 id="types-of-videos-i-watch">Types of videos I watch</h3><h4 id="gaming-30">Gaming (30%)</h4><p>This one was easy to justify for me, I like watching someone be good at something. Until I realized that this was a passive way of thinking about it.</p><p>I’m not raising my skill by watching this, so what’s the point? The only way I could get better at video games is to play it more, not by watching someone else play it.</p><h4 id="self-help-30">Self Help (30%)</h4><p><strong>Biggest trap of them all.</strong> Productivity, Self Help, Motivational channels might seem to have a good agenda on the onset but they can’t profit if you actually improve yourself.</p><p>Most of the YouTubers in this category are good people at heart. But they know that 90% of the people watching them won’t improve anything in their life. They just like the feeling of improving themselves.</p><p>Every time you watch one of the self-help videos, your brain plays a trick on you. It makes you think that you are actually improving yourself but when in reality you are just actually watching a video that you will forget in 40 minutes.</p><p>You will come for more when that rush is over. And YouTube tells them to create more videos quickly for us to consume.</p><p>For quick reference these are the only things they will say to you from now until eternity:</p><ul><li>Self Help YouTubers: Take care of yourself</li><li>Productivity YouTubers: Organize your life for deep work</li><li>Motivational YouTubers: Never stop the Hustle (This will lead to burnout by the way.)</li></ul><p>Ironically most of these YouTubers recommend you to read a book.</p><h4 id="design-and-development-20">Design and Development (20%)</h4><p>I’m a professional web designer, so it’s important for me to keep up with the latest developments in my field. Of course, that’s what I told myself.</p><p>Things always change but YouTube is not a place to capture it. YouTube videos seem to be the fast-food sector of the industry. Fast to the point but not impactful and everlasting.</p><p>I’ve found that written content like</p><ul><li>Blog Posts</li><li>Documentation</li><li>Best Practices</li><li>Newsletters</li><li>Case Studies</li></ul><p>are often more informative and educational. They let you,</p><ul><li>Read at your own pace</li><li>Accessible and Developer Friendly</li><li>Most of them are intended to be everlasting or updated frequently</li></ul><p>One might argue developer tutorials are inherently good and I agree, but I usually get a better flow in my work from written tutorials.</p><p>These are mostly for entertainment, but as I distance myself from these more and more I find them to be passive entertainment.</p><p>Netflix has a collection of marvelously produced entertainment that will take my entire lifetime to watch. Why should I settle for this glut?</p><h4 id="pointless-internet-drama-10">Pointless Internet Drama (10%)</h4><p>This was the cone of shame for me, I liked reality TV, YouTubers fighting with each other and mostly pointless drama. I was thinking about why I like this, and then a quote someone said came to me,</p><p>Don’t live on someone else’s life.</p><p>I was projecting. I have a simple life with no problems. So, I liked watching other people have problems. I thought I was superior to them in some way and that made me feel good.</p><p>Of course, I was the idiot watching videos while they simply got paid and went home.</p><h3 id="youtubes-algorithm">YouTube’s Algorithm</h3><p>Whenever I open YouTube, it shows me a carefully chosen list of videos that interests me. It’s a combination of what I recently liked, latest videos from the creators I like, trending videos from my location, and cute animals.</p><p><strong>It’s impossible not to click on any of these.</strong></p><p>YouTube’s algorithm is very powerful at this point, probably the most sophisticated recommendation engine in the world. You simply can’t win it.</p><p>You can, however, not participate in its game. Some steps you can take:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Do not <code>smash that like button</code> on any videos.</strong></p><p>If you want to see a video again, download it to your drive. The YouTube video can be removed, blocked, or altered but you can always have what you want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Do not <code>hit that bell icon</code>.</strong></p><p>Voluntarily having more notifications on your phone is the first step to becoming mindless and have other people dictate where you spend your time.</p></li><li><p><strong>Pause Watched History and Search History.</strong></p><p>Again, download important videos. 98% of what you watch is not worth it and the other 2% can easily be searched again.</p></li></ul><p>Clear watch history, remove previously liked videos, clear out your comments. Do not give any indication to YouTube on what you like.</p><p>I even ran a puppeteer (automated script) to remove all the videos from my recommendation but it just pops back up. The <code>Not Interested</code> option is not real.</p><p><strong>Ultimately, be utilitarian on what you want.</strong></p><p>If you want to learn <em>How to Tie a Tie</em>, search for it, learn it and close it. Don’t needlessly subscribe, like or engage in any way.</p><h3 id="youtubes-story">YouTube’s Story</h3><p>A brand’s story is what you want other people to tell about your brand. YouTube’s story is,</p><p>YouTube is a community of people giving free information and entertainment.</p><ul><li><p><strong>YouTube is not a community.</strong></p><p>Individual creators may create a community. But YouTube is a company that wants nothing but profits.</p></li><li><p><strong>YouTube is not free.</strong></p><p>Nothing Google does is free.</p></li><li><p><strong>YouTube gives low-quality information and entertainment.</strong></p><p>Only 5% of its millions of videos are actually helpful. Don’t take that burden of sifting through all that to find something you might like.</p></li></ul><h2 id="how-i-overcame-youtube">How I Overcame YouTube</h2><p>Here are some simple and actionable steps that I took over the months,</p><ol><li><p><strong>Cancelling YouTube Premium</strong></p><p>If you get pissed off at the ads like I do, then it’s good. You will quit the video soon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Turn off notifications</strong></p><p>Taylor Swift’s new music video is not that important to notify you. No one should have the right to disturb you anytime they want.</p></li><li><p><strong>Reducing subscriptions</strong></p><p>Go through your subscription list and remove anyone who you don’t need in your life anymore. I followed this and removed almost 300 subscriptions and I don’t even remember what they were now.</p></li><li><p><strong>Uninstalling apps</strong></p><p>YouTube is available everywhere, it doesn’t need to be on your phone or tablet. You can always watch in your mobile browser for something urgent.</p><p>Mobile apps have 30% higher engagement rate. We actively go back to an app more often than a website. That’s why everyone keeps pushing you to download their app. Don’t.</p></li><li><p><strong>Remove all subscriptions</strong></p><p>After some time, I naturally removed all my subscriptions, I found alternate sources to topics I was interested in. Books, Newsletters, Spotify, and Netflix was enough for me.</p><p>Tip: Subscribe to a channel called <code>Sub with no videos</code> to reduce the recommendations in your subscriptions tab.</p></li><li><p><strong>Add alternate habits</strong></p><p>My viewing hours reduced exponentially at this point. Now I opened YouTube, searched for some good creators, watched their latest video, and closed the site.</p><p>But to quit fully I knew I needed to replace YouTube time with something else. This can be a different thing for you and me. I started writing more often. The silence is great for creative thoughts and reflection.</p></li></ol><p>Today, after all this, I realized that I’m not addicted to YouTube anymore. I should be careful to make sure I don’t go back to it slowly. But I have high hopes for the future.</p><p>And always remember,</p><blockquote><p>“Too much of anything can make you sick” ~ Cheryl Cole</p></blockquote></article></div></div>]]>

<p>📘 Check our <strong>step-by-step tutorial and screencast</strong> on how to easily deploy on <strong>AWS</strong> a single-node <strong>Firecracker cloud</strong> integrated with the <strong>Docker Hub</strong> marketplace:</p>



<figure><a href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360045029871-How-to-Use-miniONE-to-Deploy-a-Firecracker-Cloud-Integrated-with-Docker-Hub-on-AWS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://opennebula.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/FC_AWS.jpg" alt=""></a></figure>
</div></div>



<div><div>
<p>Application container technologies, like <a href="https://www.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Docker (opens in a new tab)">Docker</a> and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Kubernetes (opens in a new tab)">Kubernetes</a>, are becoming the de facto leading standards for packaging, deploying and managing applications with increased levels of agility and efficiency. Kubernetes is widely used for the orchestration of containers on clusters, offering features for automating application deployment, scaling, and management.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>However, <strong>Kubernetes doesn’t necessarily work for every single use case</strong> nor solves all container management-related challenges an organization might face. Just to put an example, its support for multi-tenancy is actually quite limited, and it cannot guarantee perfectly secure isolation between tenants. The only way to run Kubernetes is by providing different teams with their own clusters. Upgrading clusters and patching vulnerabilities is not a quick and easy task, which in the end requires to build an <strong>expensive full-time admin team</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>Moreover, Kubernetes does not offer cloud-like self-service provision features for users, nor accounting and advanced authorization features for administrators. Cloud providers and cloud management tools, like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Amazon EKS (opens in a new tab)" href="https://aws.amazon.com/eks/" target="_blank">Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Google Kubernetes Engine (opens in a new tab)" href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine" target="_blank">Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)</a>, try to bridge these gaps by offering <strong>managed Kubernetes-as-a-Service platforms</strong>. What these solutions do is to add an extra control layer that ends up <strong>increasing management complexity, resource consumption, and associated costs</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
</div></div>
</div></div></div>



<h2>OpenNebula 5.12 “Firework”</h2>



<p>The new <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OpenNebula 5.12 “Firework” (opens in a new tab)" href="https://opennebula.io/firework/" target="_blank">OpenNebula 5.12 “Firework”</a> brings new exciting features to the container orchestration ecosystem by providing an <strong>innovative open source solution</strong> for organizations that need to build and manage a secure, self-service, multi-tenant cloud for serverless computing. Users of an OpenNebula cloud can now easily run isolated containers without the need to provision and manage servers or additional control layers, thus allowing them to focus on designing and building their applications instead of managing the underlying infrastructure. OpenNebula’s <strong>pioneering approach towards container orchestration</strong> integrates two main technologies: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="AWS Firecracker (opens in a new tab)" href="https://firecracker-microvm.github.io/" target="_blank">AWS Firecracker</a> as the VMM that provisions, manages and orchestrates micro-VMs, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Docker Hub (opens in a new tab)" href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank">Docker Hub</a> as the marketplace for application containers from which users can obtain and seamlessly <strong>deploy Docker images as micro-VMs</strong>.&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>AWS Firecracker is an open source technology that makes use of KVM to launch lightweight Virtual Machines—called micro-VMs—for <strong>enhanced security, workload isolation, and resource efficiency</strong>. It is widely used by AWS as part of their <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Fargate (opens in a new tab)">Fargate</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Lambda (opens in a new tab)">Lambda</a> services. Firecracker opens up a whole new world of possibilities as the foundation for serverless solutions that need to quickly deploy critical applications as containers while keeping them in secure isolation. With the recent integration of Firecracker as a <strong>new supported virtualization technology</strong>, OpenNebula provides now an innovative solution to the classic dilemma between using containers—lighter but with weaker security—or Virtual Machines—with strong security but high overhead.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p>



<p>OpenNebula’s integration of Docker Hub as a new native marketplace provides users with immediate access to <strong>Docker Hub official images</strong>. Through this integration Docker images can be easily imported into an OpenNebula cloud, following a process similar to the way in which the OpenNebula Public Marketplace operates. The OpenNebula context packages are installed during the import process so, once an image is imported, it becomes fully functional (including auto IP configuration, SSH key management and custom scripts). The Docker Hub marketplace also creates a new VM template associated with the imported image. This template can be customized by the user (e.g. adding the desired kernel, tuning specific parameters, etc.).</p>

<h2>An Enterprise Cloud for Containerized Applications</h2>



<p>OpenNebula brings to the container world a series of unique features to <strong>build your own enterprise cloud for serverless computing</strong>. Its unique approach speeds up the deployment of <strong>containerized applications and multi-tier services</strong> within your development workflow. In particular, OpenNebula provides:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Fast startup times</strong>: With OpenNebula you can start containers in seconds by deploying them as Firecracker micro-VMs, without the need to provision and maintain Dockerized hosts or complex Kubernetes infrastructures.</li><li><strong>Direct access to applications</strong>:&nbsp; Deploying a container as a micro-VM allows your container to directly access your networks through the Firecracker micro-VM’s IP address. Furthermore, the micro-VM can be accessed via SSH and VNC by providing interactive modes that help with application development and troubleshooting.</li><li><strong>Hypervisor-level security: </strong>OpenNebula guarantees that your containerized application to run within a Firecracker micro-VM which, in turn, provides VM-grade security and isolation in a multi-tenant environment while preserving the efficiency of lightweight containers.</li><li><strong>Persistent storage: </strong>OpenNebula’s datastores can be used as persistent data volumes for containers by attaching them to your Firecracker micro-VMs. Read-only configuration or data files can be provided by using the OpenNebula file datastore, which can be used by the application within the micro-VM.</li><li><strong>Network access: </strong>Virtual Networks defined within an OpenNebula cloud (i.e. IPv4, IPv6, Dual Stack, Ethernet) can be easily configured so that containerized applications get direct access to the internet without requiring additional components (e.g. ingress controllers, load balancers, etc.). With OpenNebula Virtual Routers it is also possible to connect different virtual networks, allowing applications and Virtual Machines attached to different virtual networks to communicate with each other. It is possible to use security groups for ensuring network security for containers applications.</li><li><strong>Application horizontal scaling</strong>: Application deployed as complex, multi-tier services can be scaled up and down “manually” but also (via the OneFlow component) in an automatic manner, based on user-defined metrics and pre-defined criteria. An <em>init</em> script can be defined to send application metrics to OneGate, OpenNebula’s metadata server.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Complete multi-tenant environments</strong> with ACLs, users, groups, resource UNIX-like permissions and VDCs, in which cloud admins can easily adapt OpenNebula to their organization’s infrastructure and DevOps requirements and set up independent sets of resources for specific purposes or groups of users (i.e. development, testing, integration and production).</li><li><strong>Geo-distributed applications</strong>: Thanks to its elastic cloud infrastructure feature (OneProvision), OpenNebula allows to build on-demand geo-distributed infrastructures for execution of containerized applications at the Edge.</li></ul>







<h2>Summary</h2>



<p>Although many IT departments providing container execution services have decided to implement their <strong>DevOps requirements on top of Kubernetes</strong>, that doesn’t mean that betting only on one horse is the wisest thing to do. Organizations requiring container orchestration capabilities should first of all state what their main objective is, and be careful not to make apples to oranges comparisons or to fall into <strong>unexpected costs or vendor lock-ins</strong>. Kubernetes is a <strong>very complex and demanding technology</strong>, and—temporary fashions aside—other technologies may actually be the best solution for some use cases.<br></p>



<p>Some of the features provided by Kubernetes (such as its declarative model, self healing, automated rollout and rollbacks, secret and configuration management, service discovery and load balancing) make it ideal for companies that need complete container orchestration services for the deployment and management of containerized workflows in a production environment. Yet, these organizations have to be able to cope with <strong>high operational costs</strong> if what they want is to build and manage a <strong>corporate Kubernetes deployment</strong>.<br></p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OpenNebula (opens in a new tab)" href="https://opennebula.io/firework/" target="_blank">OpenNebula</a>, on the other hand, becomes an ideal solution for companies that need to build <strong>multi-tenant Container-as-a-Service environments</strong>, but with <strong>lower operational costs</strong>. In this way, users and business units can develop and deploy applications easily and very fast, without their organizations having to manage dockerized hosts or complex orchestration infrastructures such as Kubernetes or OpenShift. With the release of its version 5.12 “Firework”, OpenNebula has become a real alternative for implementing an <strong>agile and serverless cloud paradigm for containerized workloads</strong> in production environments 🚀</p>

      <!--kg-card-begin: markdown--><p>After 8 years of using Apple computers (mac mini and multiple MacBooks), I decided to say "Farewell" to Apple.</p>
<p>The quality of both software and hardware when it comes to their mobile computers went downhill in recent years.<br>
Butterfly keyboard issues, old CPUs (compared to what other manufacturers put in their machines), quite limited of memory (until latest iteration of 13" MacBooks Pro it was impossible to get more than 16GB of RAM), software issues with Catalina (audio glitches, random freezes, random reboots) - all of that led me to the point where I decided to sell my 2015-version of MacBook Pro (I still have one MBPro from 2019 that I'm using for work at current company, and I still need to live with this failing system)</p>
<p>When I had switched from 2012 mac mini to PC desktop three years ago (there was no reasonable alternative from Apple on the horizon) I've told myself I'm going to stick with Apple for mobile computing (and I partly do, I still don't see any alternatives to iPhone and iPad) based on my previous experiences with Linux on a laptop. But I decided to give it a try.<br>
When I previously used Linux on a laptop, it was between 2008 and 2011, and it was a mess - battery life was a joke compared to what I could achieve with Windows, constant issues with suspending and hibernation, failing wireless network card.<br>
That was when I joined Apple cult. It was quite the opposite - long battery life, beautiful UI, seamless integration between different products, quite good performance, lot of great apps. Too bad it's only partially true now.  I want to share my journey about looking for a suitable replacement for MacBook Pro in 2020, and I need to make clear that my needs for computing might not be usual. But hey, we're talking about MacBook <em>Pro</em>, and I mean this should be aimed at professionals. I'm 100% sure many people will be happy with their Macs.</p>
<p>Requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>5-6 hours of battery life</li>
<li>As much memory as possible. I use a lot of Docker containers with memory-hungry applications. And I use Chrome, so there's no such thing as too much memory</li>
<li>Fast disks</li>
<li>Ideally - matte display</li>
<li>Screen no bigger than 14"</li>
<li>Reliably working Wi-Fi card</li>
</ul>
<p>You may think many products will meet these criteria, but you couldn't be more wrong.</p>

<center><span lang="EN-US">By Gerard ’t Hooft</span><p><img src="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/animate.gif"></p>
</center><p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="6">Once upon a 
time ...</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">there was a civilization, not unlike 
ours today, that had enjoyed tremendous recent advances in technology. One of 
their remarkable achievements was the invention of a new device. It was called 
the <b><i>automobile</i></b>.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;The first automobiles had engines that 
worked on steam and coal. It took about three minutes to start the engine, and 
the automobile did not yet move very fast, having a maximum speed of 30 km per 
hour. Still, this was faster than people could walk, and so it was considered a 
real improvement. People, on average, now took only some 30 minutes to travel 
from their homes to work, and everyone was happy with this great new enrichment 
of their lives.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;Then further technological advances 
came. The new automobiles had a roof, and were equipped with windows; they now 
had lights, claxons and light signals. The fuel for the engines was replaced by 
gasoline, and the maximum speed greatly improved, to 60 km/hour. The engines 
would start much quicker. However, the machines had also become more complex, 
and, for safety reasons, it was decided that before you start riding this 
vehicle, the proper working of the lights, the claxon, the light signals, the 
steering wheel, the breaks and the transparency of the windows had to be 
checked. 
<img src="http://www.staff.science.uu.nl/~hooft101/cars.jpg" width="378" height="151">All this checking would take about four minutes. Adding one minute to 
start the engine, this meant that after you'd step inside your automobile, you 
would not start moving before another five minutes went by. The breaks would be 
tested regularly also during the ride, and so the average time to get to your 
work had actually increased to 40 minutes.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;Then many more mighty improvements 
came. The maximum speed was increased to 200 km/hour. The engine could start up 
instantly. The automobile manufacturers made use of all these marvelous advances 
to build in many more interesting features. Your automobile would now have 
electrically adjustable windows, rear view mirrors, spare wheels, powered 
brakes, automatic gear shift, safety belts, door locks, radio and TV, a 
telephone set, an alarm clock and other gadgets, such as many automatic checking 
devices to ensure the proper working of the engines. Before starting the car 
however, all these devices had to be configured and tested. A standard feature 
was that the automobile would also check whether everybody was wearing safety 
belts, and whether there were elderly people or babies in the automobile. In 
case there were such passengers, they would receive special instructions. In 
case there were no elderly or babies in the car, this phase of checking took 
even more time: the automobile had to make <i>sure</i> that there were no 
elderly people or babies in the car. And if not, the babies could now be 
crossing the road in front of the automobile and all detectors had to be 
properly adjusted. All these procedures took time, and so after you would press 
the start button, another ten minutes would go by before you could actually 
drive your car. Very often, something went wrong. Then you had to stop the car 
and begin the starting procedure all over again.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;When you stepped <i>out</i> of your 
car, you also had to wait for a few minutes. This was because all devices that 
you were using during the ride, had to be switched off one-by-one, and the way 
you had adjusted their functioning had to be registered.&nbsp; Because of traffic 
lights, police control and other limiting factors, driving to your work would 
now take an average of 50 minutes.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;But that was not all. When you bought a
<i>new</i> automobile, all its devices were not yet properly installed.&nbsp; When, 
in your new automobile, you would try to open your window for the first time, a 
sign appeared, saying that you first had to go to the garage to have your 
window-opening device properly registered. You'd better not leave the garage 
before you also checked and registered the powered brakes, the steering wheel, 
the signal lights, the windshield wipers, the claxon, the safety belts, the baby detectors, and so on. 
Otherwise you would not be able to ride for more than a few inches. When you 
turned on the radio or TV for the first time, they both said that you first had 
to go to the electricity shop to obtain a registration number and a password for 
those. If you opened the hood to put luggage inside, you discovered that the 
hood also had to be registered first. The hood's lock had a password that you 
might have forgotten. You had to re-register the hood every six months.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;And then, you had the problem of 
gasoline poison. Some malafide gas stations purposefully put poison in the 
gasoline that you purchased, which would ruin your engine. This problem had to 
be addressed by buying antidotes for this poison at other, bonafide, gasoline stations. 
Since new brands of poison were being invented every month, automobile owners 
were forced to purchase new antidotes at gasoline stations routinely every month 
or so. All in all, it often took more than a week before the owner of a new 
automobile could drive his vehicle more or less comfortably. But, because of the 
frequent engine failures and broken cars on the highway, his journey from home 
to work would often last much longer than an hour. </span> </span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">Only few people complained about this 
situation. After all, automobiles are complicated machines.</span></span></p>
<p><span lang="EN-US"><span size="4">&nbsp;By the way, the people in this 
civilization also had invented computers. When you bought one and switched it 
on, it would work instantly. </span> </span><span size="4">And they became better every year.</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Back with a post after 6 years of silence. If you had to parse a microsecond-resolution epoch timestamp as quickly as possible, how would you do it?  We’ll take a look at using compiler intrinsics to do it in log(n) time.</p>


        <h3 id="the-problem">The problem</h3>

<p>Let’s say, theoretically, you have some text-based protocol, or file that
contains microsecond timestamps. You need to parse these timestamps as quickly
as possible. Maybe it’s json, maybe it’s a csv file, maybe something else
bespoke. It’s 16 characters long, and this could also apply to credit card
numbers.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="csv">timestamp,event_id
1585201087123567,a
1585201087123585,b
1585201087123621,c</code></pre></figure>

<p>In the end you have to implement a function similar to this:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>parse_timestamp</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>// ???</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-native-solution">The native solution</h3>

<p>Let’s start with what’s available, and compare. We have
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/string/byte/atoi"><code>std::atoll</code></a> , a function
inherited from C,
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/io/basic_stringstream"><code>std::stringstream</code></a>
, the newer C++17
<a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header/charconv"><code>&lt;charconv&gt;</code></a> header, and
by request
<a href="https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_73_0/libs/spirit/doc/html/spirit/qi/reference/basics.html"><code>boost::spirit::qi</code></a>.
I’ll be using <a href="https://github.com/google/benchmark">Google Benchmark</a> to
measure the performance, and to have a baseline let’s compare against loading
the final result into a register - i.e. no actual parsing involved.</p>

<p>Let’s run the benchmarks! The code is not important here, it just shows what is being benchmarked.</p>

<p>Wow, <code>stringstream</code> is pretty bad. Not that it’s a fair comparison but parsing
a single integer using <code>stringstream</code> is 391 times slower than just loading our
integer into a register.  <code>&lt;charconv&gt;</code> and <code>boost::spirit</code> do a lot better by
comparison.</p>

<p>Since we know our string contains the number we’re trying to parse, and we
don’t need to do any whitespace skipping, can we be faster?  Just how much time
is spent in validation?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-naive-solution">The naive solution</h3>

<p>Let’s write a good old for loop. Read the string character by character, and
build up the result.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="cpp"><span>inline</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>uint64_t</span> <span>parse_naive</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string_view</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>noexcept</span>

  <span>for</span><span>(</span><span>char</span> <span>digit</span> <span>:</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>*=</span> <span>10</span><span>;</span>
    <span>result</span> <span>+=</span> <span>digit</span> <span>-</span> <span>'0'</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>result</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

</figure>

<p>That’s actually not bad for a simple for loop. If such a simple solution is
able to beat a standard-library implementation, it means there’s quite a lot of
effort that goes into input validation. As a sidenote - if you know your input,
or can do simpler validation you can get some significant speedups.</p>

<p>For further solutions and benchmarks, let’s ignore the standard library
functions. We should be able to go much faster than this.</p>

<p>Ok, that’s slightly better again, but we’re still processing a character at a time.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-byteswap-insight">The byteswap insight</h3>

<p>Let’s draw out the operations in the unrolled solution as a tree, on a
simplified example of parsing ‘1234’ into a 32-bit integer:</p>

<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://kholdstare.github.io/diagrams/parse-unrolled.png">

<figcaption><p>Unrolled solution graph of operations for ‘1234’</p>
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>We can see that the amount of multiplications and additions is linear with the
amount of characters. It’s hard to see how to improve this, because every
multiplication is by a different factor (so we can’t multiply “in one go”), and at
the end of the day we need to add up all the intermediate results.</p>

<p>However, it’s still very regular. For one thing, the first character in the
string is multiplied by the largest factor, because it is the most significant
digit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On a little-endian machine (like x86), an integer’s first byte contains the
least significant digits, while the first byte in a string contains the most
significant digit.</p>
</blockquote>

<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://kholdstare.github.io/diagrams/parse-byteswap-insight.png">

<figcaption><p>Looking at the string as an integer we can get closer to
the final parsed state in fewer operations - see how the hex representation is
<strong>almost</strong> what we want</p>
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Now to reinterpret the bytes of a string as an integer we have to use
<code>std::memcpy</code> (<a href="https://blog.regehr.org/archives/1307">to avoid strict-aliasing
violations</a>), and we have compiler
instrinsic <code>__builtin_bswap64</code> to swap the bytes in one instruction. The
<code>std::memcpy</code> will get optimized out, so this is a win so far.</p>

<p>But now that we have an integer that kind of, sort of looks like what we want,
how do we get it across the finish line without too much work?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-divide-and-conquer-insight">The divide and conquer insight</h3>

<p>From the previous step, we end up with an integer whose bit representation 
has each digit placed in a separate byte. I.e. even though one byte can
represent up to 256 values, we have values 0-9 in each byte of the integer.
They are also in the right little endian order. Now we just need to “smash”
them together somehow.</p>

<p>We know that doing it linearly would be too slow, what’s the next possibility?
<strong>O(log(n))</strong>! We need to combine every adjacent digit into a pair in one step,
and then each pair of digits into a group of four, and so on, until we have the
entire integer.</p>

<p>After I posted the first version of this article, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cpp/comments/gr18ig/faster_integer_parsing/frx9agb">Sopel97 on
reddit</a>
pointed out that the byteswap is not necessary. Combining adjacent digits works
either way - their order doesn’t matter.  I realized that it helped me with the
next insight, but could be omitted for the final code.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The key is working on adjacent digits simultaneously. This allows a tree of
operations, running in O(log(n)) time.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This involves multiplying the even-index digits by a power of 10 and leaving the
odd-index digits alone. This can be done with bitmasks to selectively apply
operations</p>

<figure>
    <img width="100%" height="100%" src="https://kholdstare.github.io/diagrams/parse-mask-insight.png">

<figcaption><p>By using bitmasking, we can apply operations to more than one digit at a time, to combine them into a larger group</p>
</figcaption>

</figure>

<p>Let’s finish the <code>parse_8_chars</code> function we started earlier by employing this
masking trick. As a neat side-effect of the masking, we don’t need to subtract
<code>'0'</code>, since it will be masked away.</p>

<h3 id="the-trick">The trick</h3>

<p>Putting it all together, to parse our 16-digit integer, we break it up into two
chunks of 8 bytes, run <code>parse_8_chars</code> that we have just written, and benchmark it!</p>

</figure>

<p>Not too shabby, we shaved almost 56% off of the unrolled loop benchmark! Still,
it feels like we are manually doing a bunch of masking and elementwise
operations. Maybe we can just let the CPU do all the hard work?</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="the-simd-trick">The SIMD trick</h3>

<p>We have the main insight:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Combine groups of digits simultaneously to achieve O(log(n)) time</li>
</ul>

<p>We also have a 16-character, or 128-bit string to parse - can we use SIMD? Of
course we can! <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMD">SIMD stands for Single Instruction Multiple
Data</a>, and is exactly what we are looking
for. SSE and AVX instructions are supported on both Intel and AMD CPUs, and
 they typically work with wider registers.</p>

<p>I used the <a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/landingpage/IntrinsicsGuide/">Intel Intrinsics
Guide</a> to find
the right compiler intrinsics for the right SIMD CPU instructions.</p>

<p>Let’s set up the digits in each of the 16 bytes first:</p>

   <!-- Title -->
   
   <p><img src="https://cheapskatesguide.org/pics/gopher-240.jpg" alt="Gopher">
      I first had access to the early Internet--what there was of 
      it--through the university I attended.  I remember how different 
      the Internet was back in the mid-to-late 1980's.  We had 
      electronic mail, but almost no one used it.  We logged onto 
      remote computers with telnet and transferred files with FTP.  
      All this was done at the command line.  If I remember correctly, 
      very few graphical user interfaces existed then.  Those that 
      did were composed of ASCII characters.  The first web browser was 
      not released until 1991.  Remembering causes me some sadness, 
      though in some ways the Internet is better now.  It certainly 
      has many more users, and that is a good thing.  I just wish it had 
      more Internet-savvy users.</p>

   <p>I remember that many of the early computer networks and websites on 
      the Internet were run by imaginative people with great senses of 
      humor.  For example, the computer network that I used at the second 
      engineering company for which I worked in the late 1980's had seven 
      sun workstations named after the seven dwarves.  As you may imagine, 
      that provided us with no end of entertainment.  "Dopey is down, 
      AGAIN!"  "Grumpy is acting up."  "Sneezy died yesterday.  When is 
      the funeral?"</p>

   <p>Back then, computers were something special.  They were wondrous.  
      Individuals who owned them were mavericks in a sense.  Buying a 
      personal computer then was the same as painting the word "nerd" in big 
      red letters across your forehead, and being known as a nerd back then was 
      not something you wanted.  One of my highschool friends built a 
      Heathkit computer.  The only display it had was in the form of 
      one-inch, red LED digits on the front.</p>

   <p>Now, that computers permeate our society, no one bothers giving them 
      interesting names.  They've nearly become fungible commodities that we 
      use up and then throw away when they have outlived their usefulness.  
      Nearly everyone uses the Internet at least occassionally.  And, 
      strangely enough, being called a nerd is seen as a good thing.</p>
   <h2>Gopherspace</h2>
   <p>The Gopher protocol was released by the University of Minnesota in 
      1991.  Gopher servers provided users with access to various types 
      of files, including text, binary, image, sound, and GIF.  But the 
      milieu of gopherspace was text.   Text was mostly what Gopher users 
      saw.  Users could also access FTP, telnet, and 
      Usenet servers.  Back in the 1990's, Veronica search engines
      tied together the network of Gopher servers in a similar way as 
      modern search engines do today with the webservers of the
      modern Internet.  In the 1990's, Jughead search engines were designed 
      to search individual Gopher servers.  And, Archie was an FTP search 
      engine.  Archie, Veronica, and Jughead search engines were named 
      after characters in the Archie comics that first appeared in print in
      1941.  Back in the 1980's and early 1990's, when people who loved 
      computers still ran much of the Internet, it reflected their 
      personalities.  Now, the Internet is more a beige and gray  
      reflection of the corporate world.</p> 
  
   <p>Today the Gopher protocol has been supplanted almost completely 
      by the HTTP protocol upon which the World Wide Web is based.
      Though the Internet has changed considerably, Gopher servers are 
      still around.  Text is still mostly what users see 
      in gopherspace, and it can still be navigated with 
      gopher-capable Internet browsers.  Sadly, only one Veronica search 
      engine appears to operate today.  Now, When a user navigates through
      gopherspace with the Veronica search engine, by following links, or
      by entering URL's into his browser, he has an experience in many 
      ways similar to surfing the modern Internet.</p>
   
   <p>Though about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gopher_(protocol)"> 
      two dozen Internet browsers</a> can still access gopherspace, either 
      natively or with plugins, I will only talk about one.  I'll focus on the 
      Lynx browser, because it is readily available, easy to use, and 
      powerful.  The Lynx browser also runs on all the major 
      operating systems.  I'll show readers how to use the Lynx browser 
      to get into gopherspace and have a look around.</p>
   <h2>Installing and Using the Lynx Browser</h2>
   <p>The Lynx browser is a text-only Internet browser that has native 
      support for gopherspace.  Lynx allows a user to seamlessly navigate 
      around the Internet and gopherspace using only the keys on his computer's 
      keyboard.  Lynx does not use a mouse or touchpad.  Windows computer 
      users can download the Lynx browser from the 
      <a href="https://lynx.browser.org/">Lynx website</a>.</p>
 
   <div><p>Most Linux users can install Lynx simply by opening a Linux 
      terminal window and typing:
   </p></div><div>
<pre>sudo apt-get install lynx
</pre>
   </div>
   <p>

   Then, type "lynx" (without the quotes) at the command line to start 
   the Lynx browser.</p>

   <p>To go to a Gopher address using the Lynx browser, hit the "g" 
      key on your keyboard.  Near the bottom of the Lynx window, the 
      prompt "URL to open:" will appear.  Now, begin typing the Gopher 
      address.  Gopher URL's can also be copied and pasted from other 
      applications.  First, copy the URL from the other application, 
      then select the Lynx window, hit the right mouse button, and 
      select "paste".  Try going to this Gopher address for practice: 
      gopher://infinitelyremote.com/0/books/Internet_Gopher_Users_Guide.txt.  
      After you hit the "Enter" key, the text file entitled "Internet 
      Gopher Users Guide" should be visible in your Lynx window.</p>

   <p>Lynx has three user modes.  At this point, you are in the novice 
      user mode, so at the bottom of the page, the following instructions 
      should be visible: "-- press space for next page --  Arrow keys: 
      Up and Down to move.  Right to follow a link; Left to go back.  
      H)elp O)ptions P)rint G)o M)ain screen Q)uit /=search 
      [delete]=history list".</p>

   <p>At a basic level, Lynx is very easy to use, so a user does not 
      have to know much to navigate around gopherspace and read text 
      files.  I will go over the basic commands, and leave it to you 
      to learn more later.  To navigate around inside a text file that 
      contains no hyperlinks, press the space bar or the down arrow on 
      your keyboard to move down one page and the up arrow to move back 
      up one page.  The left arrow is like the back button in a modern 
      Internet browser; it takes you to the previous text file that you 
      visited.  In a text file with hyperlinks, pressing the up or down 
      arrow moves the cursor to the hyperlink above or below the 
      cursor's present position.  When the cursor is on a hyperlink, 
      pressing the "Enter" key or the right arrow takes you to the 
      document pointed to by the hyperlink.</p>

   <p>Some Gopher pages contain forms similar to HTML forms.  For 
      example, links to search engines may appear as a search line.  Use 
      the left or right arrow to move the cursor to the search line.  
      Then, type the key words you want to search for and hit the 
      "Enter" key.  This will take you to a search results page.</p>

   <p>To display the Gopher URL of the file you are currently reading, 
      hit the "=" key.  Then, hit the left arrow key to get back to the 
      file you were just reading.</p>

   <p>Exit from Lynx by hitting the "q" key.  By the way, most 
      command-line Linux programs that take control of a terminal 
      window can be exited by hitting either the "q" key or by typing 
      ":q".</p>

   <p>This is all the information you need to know to navigate around 
      in gopherspace (or on the rest of the Internet) using the Lynx 
      browser.  For additional instructions on the use of Lynx, bring 
      up Lynx and hit the "h" key.</p>
   <h2>Exploring Gopherspace</h2>
   <p>Now the fun begins.  Perhaps the best place to enter gopherspace 
      is gopher://gopher.floodgap.com/1/world.  There you will find 
      links to dozens of Gopher servers.  Floodgap claims that it 
      hosts the last Veronica search engine in existence.  So, from 
      Floodgap you can use the Veronica search engine to search 
      gopherspace by key words, or you can go to individual Gopher 
      user sites by following links to the Gopher servers that host them.</p>

   <p>One of the largest collections of Gopher user sites can be found 
      by following the Link on Floodgap labeled "'Greatest hits': most 
      recently verified Gopher servers".  From there, follow the link 
      labeled "sdf.org:70" to the Super-Dimensional Fortress (URL: 
      gopher://sdf.org/1).  There you will find many interesting phlogs 
      and files.  Gopher blogs are called phlogs.  One interesting 
      phlogger is Tomasino (gopher://sdf.org/1/users/tomasino/).  
      Another is solderpunk (gopher://sdf.org/1/users/solderpunk/).  
      There are also may others.  So, have fun and explore!</p>

With no need to remember a password or prove email ownership, <a href="https://medium.com/@kelvinvanamstel/should-we-embrace-magic-links-and-leave-passwords-alone-c73db7007fc4">many</a> <a href="https://techbeacon.com/security/your-passwordless-future-make-it-sooner-rather-later">people</a> have hailed "Magic Link" as the perfect authentication solution.</p><p>How it works on SnapHabit? After a user enters their enter email address, we direct them to their inbox to tap a link to sign in. Before diving into what went wrong, here's a snapshot of our authentication funnel:</p><ul><li><strong>11% of users</strong> required at least 4 magic-link emails before completing signing up.</li><li><strong>18% of users never finished signup (clicked the magic link)</strong>. On average, these users attempted signup twice, with several users submitting &gt; 10 times.</li></ul><!--kg-card-begin: html--><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="-why-would-you-use-magic-link-anyways">... why would you use magic link, anyways?</h2><p>Friends are core to SnapHabit, so the functionality to send a friend request is critical. Phone number or email felt like the cheapest way to support a unique identifier — as it could be used for both authentication and finding a friend.</p><p>Like most services, we first looked at using "Sign in with Google/Facebook". However, Apple recently adjusted App Store Guidelines... starting June 30, <strong>"apps that use a social login service ... must also offer Sign in with Apple"</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-17-at-3.47.00-PM-2.png"><figcaption>App Store Guidelines, June 17, 2020</figcaption></figure><p>Apple Sign In supports <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT210425">"Hide My Email"</a>, so many users who sign in with Apple would not have a meaningful email attached to their account. Asking for a user's email after they chose to "hide it" would be a poor user experience.</p><p>So in summary, we had 4 options for account creation:</p><ol><li><strong>Email + Password</strong> ... requires forgot password and users to prove email ownership</li><li><strong>Support all third-party (Apple, Google, Facebook)</strong> ... and add a new unique identifier to allow friends to find each other, given email will not be sufficient</li><li><strong>Phone number magic link</strong> ... we were relying on Expo (previously did not support phone-number auth), and we also felt emails would be a good/cheap tool for communication</li><li><strong>Email magic link</strong> </li></ol><p>Email magic link felt... perfect! &nbsp;We built the login flow, complete with a custom email, instructional webpage, and deep linking. <strong>Hurrah, we had cracked the authentication funnel!</strong></p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QoS2-mIuOZw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><!--kg-card-end: html--><h2 id="what-went-wrong-and-how-we-tried-to-solve">What went wrong and how we tried to solve</h2><p><em>If you're interested in the technical details of how we implemented some of these fixes, let me know and we'll consider publishing.</em></p><h3 id="1-users-clicking-the-link-on-another-device-">1. Users clicking the link on another device.</h3><p>Of 10 users we chatted with who had issues, 4 tried to click the link on another device. There are two routes to solving this:</p><ul><li>technical solution to support this behavior (clicking the link on desktop will authenticate the user on mobile)</li><li>better instructional text</li></ul><p><strong>The latter was simpler, so we started with that:</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/firstattempt.png"></figure><p><strong>And again.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/email.png"></figure><p><strong>And more.</strong></p><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/landingpage.png"></figure><h3 id="2-user-confusion-about-clicking-a-link-to-login">2. User confusion about clicking a link to login</h3><p>At least 2 people mentioned they simply did not understand that they needed to authenticate with email. &nbsp;To solve this, we added</p><ul><li>call-to-action to open Apple Mail or Gmail</li><li>disabled the "resend" button for 10 seconds, to encourage users to tap the mail CTA before attempting login again</li></ul><figure><img src="https://snaphabit.app/blog/content/images/2020/06/buttons.png"></figure><h3 id="3-users-entering-the-wrong-email">3.

<p>You’ve probably seen the little surveys that pop up on this site from time to time. These are a way of discovering what visitors to the site care about, so I can write on topics that are directly helpful.</p>



<p>One of the biggest things that people want help with is “changing the wider organisation”. How might we approach this?</p>



<p>Our role might allow us to make sweeping changes, but it’s more likely that we have no control over the bigger picture. However, we can control what we say to our boss so they use their influence to make a difference.</p>



<p>The question then becomes: <em>“I want to change my boss’s mind – how do I do it?”</em></p>



<p>Conversations with our boss can be the hardest conversations of all. Let’s step through why it’s hard, and what we can do through a good conversation that can make a difference in our organisation.</p>



<h2>Step #0: If you have a nightmare boss, fire them if you can</h2>



<p>Firstly, let me lay it out straight for an unlucky few. There are some bosses who are narcissistic, self obsessed, and tend to claim credit for the hard work of others. They never listen, don’t acknowledge reality or others’ points of view, and treat everything as a power game. These bosses will eventually grind every employee they have into the ground.</p>



<p>If you’re in this position, you already know it. None of what I’m about to outline will work for you.</p>



<p>If you can, I suggest you fire your boss by changing your job as soon as possible. Reach out to me on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/chrismdp" target="_blank">Twitter</a> and I’ll share your resume for you.</p>



<p>If you’re not able to change your job that easily, then there are things you can do to manage difficult situations. I plan to write more about this in the future. In the meantime, here are <a href="https://hbr.org/2015/01/what-everyone-should-know-about-managing-up">some great articles</a> for dealing with difficult bosses. I’m lucky never to have had a boss like this, but I have come across them whilst consulting.</p>



<p>However, most bosses are not in this category. Nobody’s perfect, but your boss may well be trying to do the right thing, and shows some signs of listening to reason and humility. If that’s the case then you have enough to move on to the next step.</p>



<h2>Step #1: Confront your fear</h2>



<p>Even if we don’t have a nightmare boss, the fear factor is a powerful hidden problem for many of us. Plenty of people harbour irrational fears about their boss. This is sometimes because they don’t know them well, or they assume they’re going to be awful because of a bad previous experience. This fear saps our confidence, and makes it very difficult to get anything of consequence done at all.</p>



<p>It’s time to be honest with ourselves for a moment. Let’s confront any fear we have about being candid and building genuine relationship with our boss.</p>



<p>This is something I have had to come to terms with personally. I’ve struggled with placing too much value on people’s approval my entire life. Because of this, I have a tendency to change my behaviour to match what I think are others’ expectations or desires of me. I have to be careful not to sugar-coat difficult topics. I have to push into taking the right decision even if it means people aren’t going to be happy. </p>



<p>If this is an area of struggle for us, we are only going to have good conversations with our boss with a similar amount of self-reflection. I’d <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://deliverydoubled.com/agile-conversations-why-this-is-a-must-read-for-agile-leaders/" target="_blank">recommend you start with the Agile Conversations book</a> to help unpick your own communication triggers and patterns.</p>



<p>As an aside: if you’re managing people, you need to spend time intentionally dispelling a fear culture. I spent a <em>lot</em> of my time carefully crafting intentional messages to my team to get their honest feedback, so that I’m not that boss that allows fear to propagate in their team. Make sure you explicitly ask for feedback from people about how things can be better, and explicitly invite disagreement. If you don’t, you won’t get it.</p>



<h2>Step #2: Start to talk</h2>



<p>Now you’ve dealt with the fear, it’s time to talk. If you’re not having <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://deliverydoubled.com/how-to-use-one-to-ones-to-level-up-your-agile-team-communication/" target="_blank">regular one-to-ones</a> with your boss, then ask for them. It’s important to spend at least some time with your boss at least once a week.</p>



<p>By regularly catching up with your boss, you can slowly build relationship and goodwill with them. That way, when a tricky conversation comes around, or you need something to happen in the wider organisation, you’ll have the ability to push back. You may even be able to reserve a bad decision if you need to.</p>



<p>Try and understand their motivations. Don’t complain. Empathise with their position if you can, and restate their arguments to check your understanding.</p>



<p>For more help in checking you understand their train of thought, I’d recommend Douglas Squirrel’s “TDD for people” technique. It’s detailed&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://preview.convertkit-mail2.com/click/o2im0xkvfwu3/aHR0cHM6Ly9wbGF5LmFjYXN0LmNvbS9zL3Ryb3VibGVzaG9vdGluZy1hZ2lsZS90ZXN0LWRyaXZlbi1kZXZlbG9wbWVudC1mb3ItcGVvcGxl" target="_blank">in this podcast</a>.</p>



<h2>Step #3: Ask for feedback</h2>



<p>Perhaps you have a boss who is always offering constructive feedback. However, if you have a boss who is more laissez-faire in their approach to you, it’s important to ask for feedback on your performance. Ask them to be honest with you. Let them know you’re happy to receive any kind of constructive comments on how to improve.</p>



<p>I’m always pleased when a team member asks me for feedback, as it shows that they respect my opinion, and it gives me an opportunity to help them. Your boss will likely feel the same.</p>



<h2>Step #4: See their side</h2>



<p>When talking to your boss, ask searching questions to help you to understand your boss’s point of view. Ask what your boss wants to see happen. If it’s it’s all surface level changes they’d like to see, make sure you take the time to understand <em>why</em> they want those changes.</p>



<p>Mary Abbajay, in her book <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://amzn.to/2YO06PS" target="_blank">Managing Up</a>, talks about how <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/rodgerdeanduncan/2018/05/26/why-managing-up-is-a-skillset-you-need/#7548a65937fd" target="_blank">people will often resist the idea</a> of managing up (taking charge of one’s workplace experience) through their own ego – our own need to be right. We become obsessed with “my boss should” or “my boss needs to” without considering their needs or perspective. We get trapped in our own views, needs and wants.</p>



<p>Ideally you want their honest answers to questions like these:</p>



<ul><li>Is there anything you would like me (or my team) to be doing more of?</li><li>What makes you stressed?</li><li>How much freedom do I have to change our processes or practices?</li><li>What needs to stay the same? Why?</li></ul>



<p>Listen carefully to how they see things, and strive to understand their context and their point of view. Use all the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://deliverydoubled.com/how-to-use-one-to-ones-to-level-up-your-agile-team-communication/" target="_blank">one-to-one listening techniques on this post</a>.</p>



<h2>Step #5: Be patient</h2>



<p>As Abbajay points out, your boss might change their mind, but your boss won’t fundamentally change who they are. You can only manage your reaction and interaction.</p>



<p>The only way that you’ll be able to change your boss’s mind when it matters is through good prep work. This takes time. Don’t rush it. When the moment comes where you need to change your boss’s mind, if you don’t have that relationship, you might as well not bother trying.</p>



<p>Even then, you may not succeed. They’re an individual with their own concerns, and may have context you don’t know anything about. However, by doing the prep work you’ve given yourself the best chance of having influence and a chance to spend that influence when it matters.</p>



<hr>



<p>If you want to change your boss’s mind, don’t try and do it without building relationship first. That can have the opposite effect to what you intend. Take time now to earn goodwill, so that you can use it when you need to. Then you’ll be able to change your boss’s mind when it matters, unblock your organisation’s delivery bottlenecks and allow your team to flourish.</p>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a personal knowledge management and sharing system inspired by <a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam Research</a>, built on <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>You can use <strong>Foam</strong> for organising your research, keeping re-discoverable notes, writing long-form content and, optionally, publishing it to the web.</p>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is free, open source, and extremely extensible to suit your personal workflow. You own the information you create with Foam, and you’re free to share it, and collaborate on it with anyone you want.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>In a rush?</strong> You <em>could</em> jump to <a href="#getting-started">Getting started</a>, but I highly recommend reading the introductory sections first. <strong>Foam</strong> isn’t obvious.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-use-foam">How do I use Foam?</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> is a tool that supports creating relationships between thoughts and information to help you think better.</p>

<p><img src="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/assets/images/foam-navigation-demo.gif" alt="Short video of Foam in use"></p>

<p>Whether you want to build a <a href="https://www.buildingasecondbrain.com/">Second Brain</a> or a <a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/">Zettelkasten</a>, write a book, or just get better at long-term learning, <strong>Foam</strong> can help you organise your thoughts if you follow these simple rules:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a single <strong>Foam</strong> workspace</a> for all your knowledge and research.</li>
  <li>Write your thoughts in markdown documents (I like to call them <strong>Bubbles</strong>, but that might be more than a little twee). These documents should be atomic: Put things that belong together into a single document, and limit its content to that single topic. (<a href="https://zettelkasten.de/posts/overview/#principles">source</a>)</li>
  <li>Use Foam’s shortcuts and autocompletions to link your thoughts together with <code>[[wiki-links]]</code>, and navigate between them to explore your knowledge graph.</li>
  <li>Get an overview of your <strong>Foam</strong> workspace using a [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/graph-visualisation" title="Graph visualisation">graph-visualisation</a>] (⚠️ WIP), and discover relationships between your thoughts with the use of [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/backlinking" title="Backlinking">backlinking</a>].</li>
</ol>

<p>Foam is a like a bathtub: <em>What you get out of it depends on what you put into it.</em></p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-foam">What’s in a Foam?</h2>

<p>Like the soapy suds it’s named after, <strong>Foam</strong> is mostly air.</p>

<ol>
  <li>The editing experience of <strong>Foam</strong> is powered by VS Code, enhanced by workspace settings that glue together [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] and preferences optimised for writing and navigating information.</li>
  <li>To back up, collaborate on and share your content between devices, Foam pairs well with <a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a>.</li>
  <li>To publish your content, you can set it up to publish to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> with zero code and zero config, or to any website hosting platform like <a href="http://netlify.com/">Netlify</a> or <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/vercel">Vercel</a>.</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: This documentation was researched, written and published using <strong>Foam</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="getting-started">Getting started</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>⚠️ Foam is still in preview. Expect the experience to be a little rough.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>These instructions assume you have a GitHub account, and you have Visual Studio Code installed.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam-template/generate">Create a GitHub repository from foam-template</a>. If you want to keep your thoughts to yourself, remember to set the repository private.</li>
  <li>Clone the repository and open it in VS Code.</li>
  <li>When prompted to install recommended extensions, click <strong>Install all</strong> (or <strong>Show Recommendations</strong> if you want to review and install them one by one)</li>
</ol>

<p>After setting up the repository, open <a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/.vscode/settings.json">.vscode/settings.json</a> and edit, add or remove any settings you’d like for your Foam workspace.</p>

<p>To learn more about how to use <strong>Foam</strong>, read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>].</p>

<p>There are [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/known-issues" title="Known Issues">known-issues</a>], and I’m sure, many unknown issues! Please <a href="http://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues">report them on GitHub</a>!</p>

<h2 id="features">Features</h2>

<p><strong>Foam</strong> doesn’t have features in the traditional sense. Out of the box, you have access to all features of VS Code and all the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recommended-extensions" title="Recommended Extensions">recommended-extensions</a>] you choose to install, but it’s up to you to discover what you can do with it!</p>

<p>Head over to [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/recipes" title="Recipes">recipes</a>] for some useful patterns and ideas, and</p>

<h2 id="call-to-adventure">Call To Adventure</h2>

<p>The goal of <strong>Foam</strong> is to be your personal companion on your quest for knowledge.</p>

<p>It’s is currently about “10% ready” relative to all the features I’ve thought of, but I’ve only thought of ~1% of the features it could have, and I’m excited to learn from others.</p>

<p>I am using it as my personal thinking tool. By making it public, I hope to learn from others not only how to improve Foam, but also to improve how I learn and manage information.</p>

<p>If that sounds like something you’re interested in, I’d love to have you along on the journey.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Check out [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/roadmap" title="Roadmap">roadmap</a>] to see what’s in the plans</li>
  <li>Read about our [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/principles" title="Principles">principles</a>] to understand Foam’s philosophy and direction</li>
  <li>Read the [<a href="https://foambubble.github.io/foam/contribution-guide" title="Contribution Guide">contribution-guide</a>] guide to learn how to participate.</li>
  <li>Feel free to open <a href="https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues">GitHub issues</a> to give me feedback and ideas for new features.</li>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody mainEntityOfPage">
        <div><p><img src="https://dev.p.ota.to/images/5670392840585216/" alt="Image"></p>
<h2>Intro</h2>
<p>Two of my favourites things are React and dinosaurs.
In this article I will show how I’ve put them together to develop a server side rendering <a href="https://reactjs.org/">React</a> application with <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a>.</p>
<h2>Project Setup</h2>
<p>I will assume that we are all familiar with React and Deno. Knowing that Deno is pretty new, if you don’t know how to install it and how it works, I would highly suggest you to have a read at this great <a href="https://dev.p.ota.to/post/an-introduction-to-deno-4u3suut77w6/">introduction</a> before diving into this article.</p>
<p>Now let’s start creating the project structure and the files needed for this tutorial, I’m using <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> but any editor will do.
Open your terminal and type:</p>
<pre><code>mkdir deno-react-ssr &amp;&amp; cd $_
code .
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new folder called <code>deno-react-ssr</code> and will open it with vscode.
In this folder we will need to create three files, <code>app.tsx</code> that will contain the code of the React component, <code>server.tsx</code> for the server code and <code>deps.ts</code> will contain all our dependencies. Think of it as our version of a <code>package.json</code>.
You will end up with a structure like this:</p>
<pre><code>.
├── app.tsx
├── deps.ts
└── server.tsx
</code></pre>
<h2>Setting up the dependencies</h2>
<p>In <code>deps.ts</code> we will have to export all the dependencies needed for this application to run.
Copy the following code and add it to your file.</p>
<pre><code>// @deno-types="https://deno.land/x/types/react/v16.13.1/react.d.ts"
import React from 'https://jspm.dev/react@16.13.1';
// @deno-types="https://deno.land/x/types/react-dom/v16.13.1/server.d.ts"
import ReactDOMServer from 'https://jspm.dev/react-dom@16.13.1/server';
export { React, ReactDOMServer }
export { Application, Context, Router } from 'https://deno.land/x/oak@v4.0.0/mod.ts';
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, in Deno you import the modules directly from a url. 
I’ve decided to import React and ReactDOMServer from <a href="https://jspm.org/">jspm</a> as suggested in the <a href="https://deno.land/#third-party-modules">documentation for third party modules</a> but you can use any other CDN that provides the same modules.</p>
<p>One unusual thing that may stand out to you could be this:<br>
<code>// @deno-types="https://deno.land/x/types/react/v16.13.1/react.d.ts"</code><br>
Since we are using typescript, this line of code will inform Deno of the location of the types it needs to import and will affect the <code>import</code> statement that follows. A more exhaustive explanation can be found in the <a href="https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/typescript#compiler-hint">Deno Type Hint</a> manual.</p>
<p>I’ve also decided to use <a href="https://github.com/oakserver/oak">Oak</a>, a middleware framework for <a href="https://doc.deno.land/https/deno.land/std/http/mod.ts">Deno's http server</a> that also provides a router, so I’m importing all the modules we will use in the server in addition to the <code>Context</code> type that typescript requires.</p>
<h2>Create your React component</h2>
<p>This is how our <code>app.tsx</code> component will look:</p>
<pre><code>import { React } from "./deps.ts";

const App = () =&gt; {
  const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0);

  const garden = {
    backgroundColor: 'green',
    height: 'auto',
    fontSize: '30px',
    maxWidth: '400px',
    padding: '20px 5px',
    width: '100%'
  };

  return (
    &lt;div className="pure-g pure-u"&gt;
      &lt;h2&gt;My DenoReact App&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;button className="pure-button" onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;Add a 🦕 in your garden!&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;p style={garden}&gt;
      { Array(count).fill(&lt;span&gt;🦕&lt;/span&gt;) }
      &lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
};

export default App;
</code></pre>
<p>As with any standard React component, we start by importing React from our <code>deps.ts</code> file.</p>
<p>Then we are going to declare our App component that uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html">hooks</a> to implement a simple button counter that allows you to add as many dinosaurs as you want in your personal garden!</p>
<h2>Setting up the Server</h2>
<p>For the server I’m using <a href="https://github.com/oakserver/oak">Oak</a> and the code in <code>server.tsx</code> will look like this:</p>
<pre><code>import {
  Application,
  Context,
  React,
  ReactDOMServer,
  Router,
} from './deps.ts';

import App from "./app.tsx";

const PORT = 8008;

const app = new Application();
const jsBundle = "/main.js";

const js =
`import React from "https://jspm.dev/react@16.13.1";
 import ReactDOM from "https://jspm.dev/react-dom@16.13.1";
 const App = ${App};
 ReactDOM.hydrate(React.createElement(App), document.getElementById('app'));`;  


const html =
  `&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/purecss@2.0.3/build/pure-min.css"&gt;
      &lt;script type="module" src="${jsBundle}"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
      &lt;main id="app"&gt;${ReactDOMServer.renderToString(&lt;App /&gt;)}&lt;/main&gt;  
    &lt;/body&gt;
  &lt;/html&gt;`;

const router = new Router();
router
  .get('/', (context: Context) =&gt; {
    context.response.type = 'text/html';
    context.response.body = html;
  })
  .get(jsBundle, (context: Context) =&gt; {
    context.response.type = 'application/javascript';
    context.response.body = js;
  });

app.use(router.routes());
app.use(router.allowedMethods());

console.log(`Listening on port ${PORT}...`);

await app.listen({ port: PORT });
</code></pre>
<p>As always we need to import all the dependencies we will use in our server. 
We will also import our App we created earlier, as you can see the extension <code>.tsx</code> is required in Deno so don’t forget it!<br>
Next step is to create our Oak server application and we’ll also need to define some routes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>'/'</code> will serve our HTML page that contains the rendered app.  </li>
<li><code>'/main.js'</code>  will serve our application code that is needed to <a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/react-dom.html#hydrate">hydrate</a> the client side React application.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally we tell our application to use the route we just created and start listening on port <code>8008</code>. You can notice I’m also using <code>router.allowedMethods()</code>, it’s a middleware that lets the client know when a route is not allowed.</p>
<h2>Run the application</h2>
<p>Running the SSR React application we just created is extremely simple, you just need to use the following command:</p>
<pre><code>deno run --allow-net ./server.tsx
</code></pre>
<p>Deno is built secure by default, that means that a Deno application will not be able to access your network, to overcome this we'll just need to use Deno's <code>--allow-net</code> flag.<br>
Now the only thing missing is to open <code>http://localhost:8008/</code> and enjoy your new App!</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope you enjoyed the brief tutorial illustrated in this article and I’m looking forward to seeing what will happen next and how more complex applications can be built with this stack.</p>
<p>If you are still unclear about anything we’ve done or want a full reference of the code, here’s the <a href="https://github.com/fleonard/deno-react-ssr">GitHub repository</a>.</p>

</p>

<p>Below, we use the <a href="https://github.com/adalca/tipiX">tipiX</a> interactive visualization tool for some time lapses. The first row shows real time lapses created by artists, the second row shows videos synthesized by the <i>visual deprojection</i> baseline, and the third row shows videos synthesized by our method. To use the tipiX tool, click on the image to pause/start the autoplay feature, and move your mouse from left to right to move through each time lapse.</p>

	<section>
		<p>A LOT has been said (written) about how COVID-19 has enforced "remote revolution" in software development companies (&amp; not only). About the benefits, challenges and risks. Tools, techniques &amp; processes. Almost everything remote-related one could think about.</p><p>Except for leadership. <strong>Remote leadership.</strong></p><hr><p><em>Disclaimer #1: pretty please - do NOT confuse 'leadership' with 'management' - these are two completely different topics. </em><em>I intend to focus on 'leadership' only.</em></p><p><em>Disclaimer #2: this is not a blog post about the top 5% of the market - companies that excel in a distributed model, have practiced it for years, etc. It's a consideration about everyone else - companies where unicorns do not poop rainbows.</em> </p><hr><p>On one hand: the true leader is always a leader, regardless of circumstances. Remote-first (hub-less) distributed teams are (by definition) fully symmetrical: everyone shares the same constraints - a candidate for a genuine leader suffers the same difficulties her/his associates do.</p><p>But on the other hand, let's consider the nature of leadership. No, I'm not going to (re-)define what leadership is (again) - I assume you do know it at this point. Instead, let's focus on "the medium" of leadership.</p><p>What's "the protocol" that true leaders do influence (positively) others through? How do "the leadership particles transmit"? Do you need continuous physical proximity and maybe it's OK to have a video call once a week?</p><p>Apart from purely individual traits (like charisma, professional credibility, authority, having an inspiring vision, being able to communicate it, etc.), there's a need for <strong>CONNECTION</strong> (between a leader and her/his followers).</p><p>I'd define <strong>CONNECTION</strong> as a function of <strong>PRESENCE</strong>, <strong>BANDWIDTH</strong> &amp; established, mutual <strong>TRUST</strong>.</p><ol><li>What's the <strong>PRESENCE</strong>? It's being around. Making an example (impersonating some principle). Exchanging a glance and nodding respectfully. It's comforting for your team-mates to know that you're always close and with every small interaction you express that you (personally) care. It's also inspiring for them to see you in action, personally involved, when they notice details of your behavior (derivatives of your experience) you find absolutely mundane.</li><li>While the presence is one thing, the <strong>BANDWIDTH</strong> (of communication) is the other one. To make an impact, one has to have clarity, which comes out of awareness and indirectly: data (information). It's not just the range of information, but also its accuracy and timeliness. It's thanks to sufficient bandwidth that you're capable of properly assessing the situation (e.g., commitment, burden, stress &amp; risk level) - which is crucial to make decisions about where to aim for leverage.</li><li>What about <strong>TRUST</strong>? The trust is very interesting, because a leader's efforts to increase presence and bandwidth may imply the actual luck of trust (a team is afraid that leader doesn't trust the team, so (s)he tightens the apparatus of control). In distributed scenarios, such efforts are, by default, much more obtrusive.</li></ol><p>What's my point?</p><p>Team distribution works like a charm in mature, mesh-like org structures. With very small, autonomous, highly engaged and truly entrepreneurial teams. Where people do understand the meaning of all three pillars of agility: autonomy, transparency &amp; discipline. Those teams will perform superbly regardless of the scenario. In such organizations, everyone is (some sort of) a leader.</p><p><strong>But scaling such teams is very difficult.</strong> And it requires top-notch, carefully selected people on board. Even the positive effects are frequently highly unstable (depend on a particular composition which will not last forever, then they lose their <em>"magick"</em>).</p><p>In the majority of scenarios I've ever encountered, the org structure doesn't really resemble an autonomous, self-catalyzing mesh:</p><ul><li>there's an "old guard" and the "new guard"</li><li>there are people who are very engaged and ones who ... care less</li><li>some have company-aligned priorities, while many do not</li><li>while some feel accountable for the outcomes of their work, many others just follow the instructions (do what they are told to)</li><li>knowledge silos are solidified by the never-ending urge to go fast, which causes various asymmetries within teams</li></ul><p>I'm not implying anyone's bad will. Not at all - it's just the reality. And still - all those "non-exceptional", unbalanced, flawed teams can also do decently (at least). But they need dedicated, strong <strong>LEADERS</strong> to set (&amp; keep) the direction, be the catalysts and simple drive things. And the ability of those (especially new) leaders to develop and maintain a strong <strong>CONNECTION</strong> will be from now on significantly more challenged. I'm not saying it's not possible to make a decent impact as a leader remotely, but I believe that it will nearly always take more time &amp; effort (with a bigger part of energy consumed by "friction" and inertia).</p><hr><p>My thesis is that many of hitherto leaders are not prepared for the pivot (of everyone around going remote). Most of them are currently <em>"traveling with momentum"</em> (based on what was developed in the days before the pandemic). But they are from now on playing a completely different kind of sport - and the difficulty bar has been significantly raised.</p><p>I can't help being curious about what kind of long-term effects (of the situation described above) we'll observe in the next year or two. At this point it's nothing but a wild guess:</p><ul><li>a new generation of "distributed era leaders" will arise, with skill-sets more suited to how the situation has evolved?</li><li>fragmentation will increase - companies, services and products will gravitate towards smaller, more independent teams &amp; offerings?</li><li>getting a taste of the remote model will prove to be a temporary fashion - a new wave of highly efficient co-located challengers will out-compete their rivals struggling with effective distribution?</li><li>we'll all just get used to lower efficiency and higher inertia, because the benefits of distributed work models are still a fair compensation for the price?</li></ul>

<p>One of my favorite games of all time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption" target="_blank">Red Dead Redemption</a>
returned with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2" target="_blank">prequel</a> for consoles in 2018. Then it came for PCs in 2019.
I finally managed to play the game and amazed by its graphics immediately.
But I got upset because I can barely play the game on medium settings at 25 FPS with a 1050Ti laptop GPU.
I know that I don't have a good rig but 25 FPS on medium settings?</p>

<p>Today, we are going to look at some frame captures from the game and try to analyze graphics techniques used in the game.</p>

<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>

<p>This isn't an official breakdown of the game. It just me analyzing <a href="https://renderdoc.org/" target="_blank">RenderDoc</a> frame captures.
If you want to learn from the actual developers,
you can check the slides from a SIGGRAPH talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/globbbe" target="_blank">Fabian Bauer</a>.
<a href="https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2019/index.htm" target="_blank">Slides</a> (At the bottom of the page), <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3305366.3335036" target="_blank">Video</a> (starts at 1:58:00)</p>

<p>You can also read a graphics analysis of GTA5 by Adrian Courrèges <a href="https://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/" target="_blank">here</a>.
Since both RDR2 and GTA5 are from the same company and uses the same engine, some of the techniques from GTA5 present here as well.</p>

<p>Another important thing is that, I am not a senior graphics programmer or anything like that.
I am still a junior in this field.
So, there will be plenty of things that I don't understand. If you find any mistakes or things that can be improved, please reach out to me. Here we go!</p>

<em>Captured on PC, medium settings.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to a game like RDR2, it's almost impossible to see all the techniques in one frame.
It amortizes its work across multiple frames.
Because of that, I captured more than a single frame but this is the main one we are going to be focusing on.
It contains a lot of properties like; spot and point lights, directional light (it's very subtle but it's there), buildings, NPCs, a horse, trees, vegetation, clouds, etc. It should demonstrate most of the rendering techniques used in the game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RDR2 is an open-world game that streams data constantly. Because of that, the frame starts with a bunch of tasks like creating and deleting textures, shader resource views, unordered access views, updating descriptors, buffers, etc.</p>

<h3 id="mud-map">Mud map</h3>

<p>Mud plays a big role in the game. Beside being a game mechanic, it makes envrionments more realistic. The game renders footprint textures of humans and horses into a displacement map along with trail textures of horse wagon wheels. This accumulated texture is used for <a href="https://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2012/10/Tatarchuk-POM.pdf" target="_blank">Parallax Occlusion Mapping</a> when rendering terrain.</p>

<em>Mud map: 2048x2048 <code>R16_UNORM</code></em></p>

<h3 id="sky-and-clouds">Sky and clouds</h3>

<p>After the mud pass, the game does a lot of work on GPU compute. Most of them related to sky and clouds.
Clouds, fog, and volumetrics are RDR2's prominent effects.
You can find more information about this stage on Fabian's slides. He explains in far more detail than I could ever explain.</p>

<h3 id="environment-map">Environment map</h3>

<p>Environment maps are the main source of reflections in RDR2 as well as GTA5.
<a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/#environment-cubemap" target="_blank">Like the GTA5</a>, RDR2 generates an environment cubemap from the camera position.
It generates a thin GBuffer for the envrionment map, similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD6KcxcCl_8" target="_blank">Far Cry 4</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/envdepth.jpg" alt="EnvironmentMapDepth">
<em>Environment Cubemap Faces (Depth): <code>D32S8</code></em></p>

<p>Environment cubemap generation in every frame can be a heavy task. RDR2 does some optimizations to reduce the cost.
For example, the game only draws static and opaque objects, does <a href="https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/frustum-culling-r4613/" target="_blank">frustum culling</a> before rendering each face, and draws lower LOD versions of models.
Although, I've found that poly count of the terrain is still very high for environment maps.</p>

<p>After the G-Buffer pass, a sky environment cubemap is generated using a sky paraboloid map and cloud-related textures.
The next step is convolution. RDR2 uses <a href="https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/karis/s2013_pbs_epic_notes_v2.pdf" target="_blank">split sum approximation</a> for Image Based Lighting.
That method uses a pre-filtered environment cubemap along with an environment BRDF LUT.
For filtering, the game convolutes an environment cubemap and stores convoluted versions in the cubemap's mipmap levels.</p>

<p>Before executing a lighting pass for the environment cubemap, RDR2 renders baked large-scale ambient occlusion into another cubemap texture.
The game uses screen space ambient occlusion but SSAO can help you on a small scale.
Baked ambient occlusion helps to darken on a large scale such as darkening in patios and interiors.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/envao.jpg" alt="EnvironmentMapBakedAO">
<em>Environment Cubemap Faces (Baked AO): <code>R8_UNORM</code></em></p>

<p>The game uses <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023510/Advanced-Graphics-Techniques-Tutorial-Day" target="_blank">tile-based deferred rendering</a> path for calculating the lighting of environment maps.
The light culling and the lighting are calculated together in one compute pass for each environment map face. (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/benoitvimont" target="_blank">@benoitvimont</a> for pointing that out)
The game also uses the "top-down world lightmap" technique, <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1017710/Rendering-Assassin-s-Creed" target="_blank">similar to Assassin's Creed III</a>, for baked lighting.</p>

<p>For each cubemap face, RDR2 renders the final color on top of the sky environment texture.
Then it filters the environment cubemap same as the sky environment cubemap.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/envfinal.jpg" alt="EnvironmentMapFinal">
<em>Environment Cubemap Faces (Final): <code>R11G11B10_FLOAT</code></em></p>

<p>RDR2 also loads envrionment maps that located in building interiors when the player is near a building.
These are also cubemap G-Buffers streamed from the disk.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/bakedenvalbedo.jpg" alt="BakedEnvironmentMapAlbedo">
<em>Baked Environment Cubemap Faces (Albedo): <code>BC3_SRGB</code> (Baked AO stored in alpha channel)</em></p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/bakedenvdepth.jpg" alt="BakedEnvironmentMapDepth">
<em>Baked Environment Cubemap Faces (Depth): <code>R16_UNORM</code></em></p>

<p>The game calculates the lighting of these maps and filters them like the previous ones.
It only calculates one baked environment map at a time and only recalculates them when the time of day changes.
All of the environment maps are stored in a texture cubemap array. There isn't any <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/#cubemap-to-dual-paraboloid-map" target="_blank">cubemap to dual-paraboloid map conversion</a>.</p>

<h3 id="g-buffer-pass">G-Buffer Pass</h3>

<p>This stage starts with terrain depth prepass and then the game renders scene into G-Buffers.</p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>This buffer contains baked ambient occlusion in the red channel, the same as in the environment map stage.
But there are other channels in this texture. The green channel contains some data that looks like the data in GBuffer 3's blue channel.
Again, I don't know what is this data used for. And I can't find any data in blue and alpha channels on my captures. I will investigate this further.</p>

<h3 id="shadow-map-generation">Shadow Map Generation</h3>

<p>After the G-Buffer stage, the game starts to render shadow maps.
It uses 2D texture arrays for point light shadow maps and texture cube arrays for point light shadow maps.</p>

<p>Some games use big shadow atlas texture for shadow maps (<a href="http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2016/Siggraph2016_idTech6.pdf" target="_blank">e.g DOOM</a>).
One of the advantages of that method is shadow map size can vary based on distance.
When you use texture arrays, you lose that flexibility because all of the textures in texture arrays must be the same size.
RDR2 has 3 different texture arrays for different quality.
For example, spotlights have:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>512x768 D16</strong> for distant lights</li>
<li><strong>1024x1536 D16</strong> for medium distance(and closer distance on medium setting) lights</li>
<li><strong>2048x3072 D16</strong> for closer lights (on high/ultra settings)</li>
</ul>

<p>Point lights cast shadows in all directions. To deal with that problem, games use a technique called <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Shadows/Point-Shadows" target="_blank">Omnidirectional Shadow Mapping</a>
where you render the scene into a depth cubemap from the camera position. Campfire shadows and shadows from Arthur's lantern are rendered using this technique.
Point light shadows have 3 different arrays for different quality settings same as spotlights.</p>

<p>Most of the static point lights in the game have baked shadow cubemaps.
So, the game uses baked shadows whenever it can and only generates shadow maps when the player is near a light-volume.
But things get more interesting than that.</p>

<p>Most of the lights on walls are spotlights but the game doesn't generate an omnidirectional shadow map for them.
Instead, it generates a spotlight shadow map and copies that shadow map's memory into pointlight shadow map cube array.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th></th>
</tr>
</thead>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img width="512" height="768" src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/spotshadow.jpg"></td>
<td><img width="128" height="768" src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/pointshadow.jpg"></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><em>Left image is a 1024x1536 spotlight shadow map, right image is the same image data in 512x512 texture cube format</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that local light shadow maps stores linear z.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That explains why they are not using a square sized shadow map for spotlights.
Pixel count for spotlight shadow and point light texture cubemap should be the same.
I am sure you noticed some slice pattern in the right image.
That happens because the width of spot and point light shadow map is different.</p>

<p>Also note that this texture doesn't cover 360 degrees.
But luckily, lights on buildings generally have a wall on their backside and baked shadow maps cover it.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing is that this process is vice-versa.
For example, in Saint Denis -one of the biggest cities in the game- the game generates omnidirectional shadow maps for spotlights
and copies that data into spotlight shadow map array.
I don't know why RDR2 doing shadow mapping like this. I couldn't find any similar technique on the internet.</p>

<p>Directional light shadow mapping in RDR2 is pretty much the <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/#shadows" target="_blank">same as in GTA5</a>. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dxtecharts/cascaded-shadow-maps" target="_blank">Cascaded Shadow Mapping</a> with 4 cascades.

<p>If there are already a few apps on ProductHunt that are similar to what you're building, consider using  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.indiehackers.com/post/how-i-growth-hacked-my-way-to-500-waiting-list-subscribers-9612933fd3">this growth hack</a>. I've used it extensively myself. </p>
<h3 id="buy-targeted-email-lists">Buy targeted email lists</h3>
<p>I've built a tool myself that lets me scrape email addresses from founders on Indie Hacker. What's powerful is that you can filter by every filter available on Indie Hacker (revenue, location, business model, ...). You can use it to buy an email list here and use a tool like <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gmass.com/">Gmass</a> or Streak to reach out.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://scrapeindiehacker.app/">Buy a list here</a>.</p>
<p>I don't recommend just sending the same email to everyone as this will impact your reputation. Instead, send personalized mass emails. It does take a bit longer, but it's worth every second considering the impact it will have on response rate and trust.</p>

<p>There are many chrome extensions out there that have tons of users but that are not maintained anymore. You can buy one for very cheap that is related to what you do and advertise your business on there. I bought  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/google-contacts-opener/pjpambjkhcilibnmeihhfgdkhfelbdkj">Google Contacts Opener</a>  and it's been generating significant traffic to our website ever since. </p>

<p>It will cost you too much. Just don't think about it. In the early days, ads are not the way to go.</p>
<h3 id="launch-on-product-hunt">Launch on Product Hunt</h3>
<p>You've got only one shot at this, it better be big. You don't want to launch on Product Hunt before having built a mature product. Product Hunt is not for the launching phase, it's for the growth phase.  <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://betalist.com/">BetaList</a> is a better place to start.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ew PHP, right? High-fives all around. Except that for my generation, the first cool web app you’d create would be written in PHP, often coupled with MySQL. Not only it is a language you can use object-oriented principles if used well but also it is free to use. There is a reason that massive platforms such as Shopify, Facebook or even WordPress still use PHP to this day. Today,  I will show you how to set up your WordPress development environment in about 10 minutes with the power of Docker.</p><h2>Before we start you will need</h2><ul><li><a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker Desktop</a>, available on Windows 10 (<a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.codingnagger.com/2020/06/20/install-docker-desktop-on-windows-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even Home</a>), OS X. Not sure about the option for Linux but you can definitely set up docker and docker-compose. It will come with the tools we will use here:<ul><li>Docker, because we will be using containers</li><li>Docker-compose will make it easier to orchestrate our WordPress and DB container without too much overhead.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I am using VSCode but feel free to use any IDE or text editor you feel comfortable with.</p><h2>Create your root development folder</h2><p>In my case, I created a wordpress-dev folder which is will be my workspace where all the plugins and themes will go. Assume that from now on, I will refer to files and actions to execute will be relative to the wordpress-dev path.</p><p>The first file we will create is a docker-compose file. This file will contain the base information to spin up our docker and MySQL containers for use. I copied it from the <a href="https://hub.docker.com/_/wordpress">WordPress docker page</a> and made a minor change for now. I fixed the WordPress version to make sure that this tutorial will still work regardless of when you go through it.</p>  <p>Save the file as<strong> <em>docker-compose.yml</em></strong> and execute the following command:</p><pre>docker-compose up</pre><p>After a few seconds, maybe minutes depending on your setup, you should see this:</p><div><figure><img src="https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?fit=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?fit=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="640" height="210" data-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?w=1383&amp;ssl=1 1383w, https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?resize=300%2C98&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?resize=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?resize=768%2C252&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-old-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?fit=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?w=1383&amp;ssl=1 1383w, https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?resize=300%2C98&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?resize=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?resize=768%2C252&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i1.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-14.png?fit=1024%2C336&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div><h2>Checking your default setup is good</h2><p>Your WordPress instance would be working and accessible at <a aria-label="undefined (opens in a new tab)" href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8080</a>.

Personally, I store the dev credentials in a text file in the folder so I don’t need to ever bother about these. Plus if someone actually gets hold of my machine all they have is a local setup password unused anywhere else. After filling the fields and pressing “Install WordPress” you land on the installation confirmation page.</p><div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?w=844&amp;ssl=1 844w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-sizes="(max-width: 844px) 100vw, 844px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-old-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?ssl=1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?w=844&amp;ssl=1 844w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?resize=300%2C169&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?resize=768%2C432&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-16.png?ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div><h2>Completing your WordPress development workspace</h2><p>Now you’re all set with a local installation of WordPress that is ripe for local experimentation, you need an easy way to plug the useful stuff. You know, the plugin and themes folders you’re here for.</p><p>First, go to your workspace folder and create the <em><strong>themes </strong></em>and <em><strong>plugins </strong></em>sub-folders. Now we will add volumes for the WordPress container to map the workspace plugins and themes to the WordPress installation. This is how the <em><strong>docker-compose</strong></em> file will look like:</p>  <p>Once you updated the docker-compose file, use the kill shortcut, Ctrl-C or Cmd-C depending on your platform.</p><p>Now there is a gotcha. Since your theme folder is empty, if you try to bring the containers back up you will have an error message about the <strong><em>twentytwenty </em></strong>folder gone missing. In order to avoid that, you will need to install the TwentTwenty theme manually. To do so, download it here and extract it. You should have a twentytwenty folder with the theme files inside. Copy that folder to your workspace themes folder.</p><p>Finally, bring back up your containers with the compose up command.</p><pre>docker-compose up</pre><p>Now if you go back to <a href="http://localhost:8080/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">http://localhost:8080</a> you should see your install is still there.</p><div><figure><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?fit=1024%2C565&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" data-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?fit=1024%2C565&amp;ssl=1" alt="" data-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?w=1752&amp;ssl=1 1752w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=1024%2C565&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=768%2C424&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=1536%2C848&amp;ssl=1 1536w" data-sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-old-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?fit=1024%2C565&amp;ssl=1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?w=1752&amp;ssl=1 1752w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=300%2C166&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=1024%2C565&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=768%2C424&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?resize=1536%2C848&amp;ssl=1 1536w" data-lazy-src="https://i0.wp.com/www.codingnagger.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/image-17.png?fit=1024%2C565&amp;ssl=1&amp;is-pending-load=1" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div><h2>Validating your WordPress development setup with a dummy plugin</h2><p>Now that environment is set, time to create a plugin through it.

You now have a working development setup to create and contribute to open-source WordPress plugins. For the open-source plugins, you may clone them directly in your workspace plugin repository as long as the root folder matches the released plugin in shape. As you can see on the screenshot above, the Podlove plugin I cloned in my workspace plugins folder is there too. One thing to be careful about though, if you delete the plugin in WordPress, it will delete the folder so make sure it is actually what you want.</p><p>I hope you enjoyed that tutorial, and feel free to share it with your friends, colleagues, family and pets.

  <h2>My Personal Digital transformation</h2>
<p><img src="https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0290/7756/9635/files/Smartphone_addiction_Burnout_Balance_relationship_1024x1024.png?v=1591043209" alt="Smartphone Addiction, Burnout and Balance Relationship Technology dependency"></p>
<p><strong>When do we start focusing on the digital transformation that is going on in the lives of each of us, individually? When did any of us make a conscious choice about how we want digital tech to add to our lives? A story about&nbsp;<a href="https://lifebeyond.one/?ref=hackernoon.com">smartphone addiction</a>, maximizing human potential and releasing a new book from a state of near-burnout.</strong></p>
<div><p>My name is Erwin, and I am addicted to my smartphone.</p></div>

<div><p>And I’m climbing out of a state of near-burnout. Let’s figure out what the two have to do with each other exactly, and what that could mean for you. If you're someone who is active in the world of tech, this will be of special relevance to you. At least I think it will.</p></div>


<p>I have been going through a very personal digital transformation. And I think in a sense we all are. Meanwhile the world is talking about “digital transformation” as something that happens<span>&nbsp;</span><em>to</em><span>&nbsp;</span>us, that is driven by tech companies and IT departments.</p>





<div><p>But what about the digital transformation that is going on in the life of every individual human on the planet right now?</p></div>

<h2>Has Tech Been Creeping Up On&nbsp;Us?</h2>
<p>Tech seeped into our lives almost like a silent virus over the course of the last four or five decades. And it is changing us. For better or for worse.</p>
<p>I feel as though tech is something that dripped into our lives little by little, as human beings born before around 1990.</p>





<p>The tech companies created these awesome functionalities. The nerds, the cool kids, the smart business men — they started using them. Our friends started using them. So we decided we’d give them a try as well.</p>





<p>For those of us born after 1990, using digital tech was the norm pretty much since the day they arrived on the planet. The process of cool kids and nerds using new stuff first is still a thing, mind you. Can you say TikTok?</p>





<p>Governments and major companies started expecting us to be digital. We started to expect each other to be digital.&nbsp;<a href="https://medium.com/life-beyond/life-beyond-the-touch-screen-a715b119b8db?ref=hackernoon.com">It became the social norm to be online and connected at all times</a>. It became the social norm to check work email at all times and to share whatever you’re doing or thinking on social networks.</p>




<p>It even became a social norm to be almost compulsively catching up with people digitally, ignoring the people you were present with.</p>




<p>But when did any of us make a conscious choice?</p>





<h2>A Conscious Choice for Our Use of Our Digital Technology</h2>
<p>When did any of us say: “Wow, these new tools and capabilities are really cool. I’m going to try my utmost to use these tools in such a way that I can…”?</p>
<p>I feel very strongly that we never did. I feel that we subconsciously chose to start using email, Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, Instagram, Spotify, SnapChat, AirBnB, Booking, Uber, Netflix etc. etc. until it got to a point where it’s no exception for a human being to unlock and<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/millennials/ebooks/Millennials_And_Tech_At_Home_eBook_All_AK.pdf?ref=hackernoon.com">check their smartphone 150 times a day.</a>
</p>


<p>To spend two to three hours of your waking day stroking a glass rectangle.</p>
<p>Do you reach for your lover 150 times a day? Do you reach for your children, your family, your loved ones 150 times a day? Do you reach for your dreams? For the best possible version of you that you could ever hope to be?</p>


<p>Do you reach for your maximum potential for happiness 150 times a day?</p>

<p>I know I don’t. I’m addicted. But I’m changing that as we speak.</p>

<p>I’d like to share my story with you.</p>


<h2>My Personal Digital Transformation and Near-Burnout</h2>
<p>I’m in the middle of a near-burnout. And I think it started when I was in the middle of my five-year run with Motion10, the IT company that I used to work for as a digital marketing strategist.</p>


<p>You see at that time, I was — obviously — working as many knowledge workers nowadays, behind a screen for large parts of the day. The main skill I use in my line of work is gathering information, analyzing and structuring that information using a thought process that is known to most of us as writing.</p>


<p>I would say that I was probably looking at a screen for at least four to five hours per workday, just to get my basic writing work done.</p>


<p>But then, I’d also write for me. You see I am obsessed with writing, marketing and digital tech — the latter especially in relation to maximizing human potential. I find these all incredibly interesting and loved putting work into them.</p>


<p>So I wrote blogs, or sometimes poems, at times a mean of two or three per week.</p>
<p>And I wrote books. I published a book around two years ago, it was my debut novel,<span>&nbsp;</span><a href="https://publish.sweek.com/shop/index.php/face-value-135450-publish-sweek-com.html?ref=hackernoon.com">Face Value</a>, and after that I’ve written two more books and have started on another.</p>


<p>Two years ago, while I was writing for my work for about five hours a day, I guess I was probably writing somewhere between two to three hours per day for my own little side projects. And I don’t know how many hours I was reading online.</p>
<div><p>And then I had social media.</p></div>

<h2>The Tsunami of Social&nbsp;Media</h2>
<p>I had my own personal accounts. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and LinkedIn, that I was reasonably active on at that time.</p>


<p>But then I was also the so-called social media manager for Motion10, as a natural part of my job. This meant managing a company account for LinkedIn, a LinkedIn group; a few Yammer (by Microsoft) accounts, two Facebook accounts, two Instagram accounts and two Twitter accounts, all for my day job.</p>


<p>And then I published my book, so I was promoting that — you guessed it — on social media.</p>


<p>I was managing all of these social media accounts and campaigns, and at the time I was very active about it so that we wouldn’t miss any interaction on any of these platforms. I was checking my mail pretty much 24/7 in case someone was trying to contact me .</p>


<p>I don’t think I’m very special for checking my mail around the clock, but just to be sure — does anybody else here have the tendency to do that?</p>


<p>Someone from work or a client of Motion10 might be trying to get in touch with me. Anyone could be trying to contact me regarding my book and/or its promotion. I didn’t want to miss anything.</p>


<p>And lastly, I was checking stats. I don’t know if you know any digital marketers but checking web analytics can become like a plague to us, a mental disease that gets you hopped-up on dopamine and adrenaline, and that leaves you distracted and exhausted.</p>


<p>I was not a fun person to be around.</p>


<p>I honestly think that our smartphones or our digital tech arelike a glass mirror, much like “<a href="https://medium.com/@limawrites/black-mirror-new-season-black-mirror-book-coming-soon-5363c04ef079?ref=hackernoon.com">Black Mirror</a>”, that is reflecting or making visible the things that work underneath the surface; the things that drive us. I think digital tech and the way we use it can be a perfect mirror for our personal transformation. It can help us elevate our consciousness.</p>


<h2>What I started noticing about&nbsp;myself</h2>
<p>It was around this time that I began noticing some things. In random order;</p>
<ul>
<li>I was starting to get really, really tired. Where I’d been used to not needing much more than 7,5 hours of sleep and feeling quite energetic, around this time I started having ‘exhaustion’ as a baseline energy level.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Was I taking good enough care of myself?</em>
</li>
<li>I was distracted all of the time. I was not present at all, when I was supposedly present with my fiancé, my children, my family or friends. My son who was about 8 or 9 at the time would routinely ask me or sometimes tell me to put the phone down when I was talking to him.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>Was I getting my priorities in life straight?</em>
</li>
<li>I was unhappy, maybe due to lack of clear focus but definitely also because of lack of rest. I think there might be a limit to how much information a human being can naturally process over the course of a set amount of time.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>I think I may well have been exceeding my limit.</em>
</li>
<li>I was lonely. Or I felt lonely. I had halfway chosen, consciously, to kind of scale down my social life as I realized working a full-time job, promoting a self-published book and being a husband and father was already probably a pretty heavy load. But my social life took a much more serious hit than I was expecting.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>What is the link between social connection and addiction?</em>
</li>
<li>I started feeling less and less motivated, focused and concentrated. First at work, then in doing my own projects, and then in pretty much everything I did in life.<span>&nbsp;</span><em>What do I really need to be happy?</em>Is there Life Beyond the Touch&nbsp;Screen?</li>
</ul>



<p>Because apart from noticing these things in myself, I started really noticing them in people around me as well. Digital distraction, in my fiancé or my own children; friends — the screen distracts from the conversation we are having right now, doesn’t it? Research indicates it even distracts when it’s just near you, even lying on a table, face down.</p>


<p>I started seeing the <a href="https://lifebeyond.one/blogs/tech-impact/smartphone-addiction-technology-dependency-science-and-statistics" target="_blank" title="Smartphone Addiction Statistics" rel="noopener noreferrer">true effects of digital tech addiction everywhere.</a> On the train, on the sidewalk, in cars, restaurants, bars, family get-togethers, meetings at work. I remember having conversations with people about it and they wouldn’t understand what I was saying — then check their smartwatch for messages.</p>


<p>My whole working life revolved around the relationship people had with tech at that time, and my own natural curiosity coupled with what I had started to notice in myself, had got me thinking. This is when I started writing the aphorisms, in social post-format;</p>
<blockquote>“Is there Life Beyond The Touch&nbsp;Screen?”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Work mail can&nbsp;wait.”</blockquote>
<blockquote>“Touch Humans, not Screens.”</blockquote>
<p>This, coupled with some fragments of blog articles and a few poems together were the start of my newest book.</p>


<h3>Publishing and promoting a new book from a half-a-burnout</h3>

<p>Fast forward to just a couple of months ago.</p>


<p>I was sitting at the kitchen table with my fiancé, having coffee the morning after I had taken sick leave due to a splitting headache. We got to talking, and she cornered me. In a good way.</p>


<p>Hadn’t I been incredibly tired over the last two years? So much so that I had been saying for about two years now that I should go to the doctor’s for a check-up, to see if there wasn’t anything weird going on physically?</p>


<p>And wasn’t I kind of gloomy, slightly depressed, for a long time already? And wasn’t I also a bit edgy, easily irritated — with her, with the kids? …</p></div></div></div></div></article></div>

<p>If you have used <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://bountysource.com/">Bountysource</a> in the past, you may have received an email announcing new terms of service that included a clause that would forfeit unclaimed bounties. On June 16, Bountysource sent this message:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You are receiving this email because we are updating the Bountysource Terms of Service, effective 1st July 2020.</p>

  <h4 id="whats-changing">What’s changing?</h4>
  <p>We have added a Time-Out clause to the Bounties section of the agreement:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p><em>2.13 Bounty Time-Out.</em></p>

    <p><em>If no Solution is accepted within two years after a Bounty is posted, then the Bounty will be withdrawn and the amount posted for the Bounty will be retained by Bountysource. For Bounties posted before June 30, 2018, the Backer may redeploy their Bounty to a new Issue by contacting <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">support@<wbr>bountysource.com</a> before July 1, 2020. If the Backer does not redeploy their Bounty by the deadline, the Bounty will be withdrawn and the amount posted for the Bounty will be retained by Bountysource.</em></p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>…</p>
  <h4 id="what-do-i-need-to-do">What do I need to do?</h4>
  <p>If you agree to the new terms, you don’t have to do anything… Or, if you do not agree with the new terms, please discontinue using Bountysource.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This gave open source projects and their bounty hunters just two weeks to act; oftentimes it would take <em>longer than that</em> to even get a response from the support team. The controversial terms have since been withdrawn—at least for now. On June 17, Bountysource sent the following message (emphasis theirs):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’re receiving this because we updated our Terms of Service.</p>

<p>In December, 2017, <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191008103840/https://blog.canya.com/2017/12/20/canya-acquires-majority-stake-in-bountysource-adds-over-46000-users/">Bountysource was acquired</a> by a cryptocurrency company called CanYa who redesigned the Bountysource site and service with a new cryptocoin focus. In addition to the general friction we’ve experienced with using the service since to get developers paid, we feel like this policy change–even withdrawn–is concerning. It calls into question the future of Bountysource as a platform and the stability of their business model. While we understand that operating a platform incurs costs, we want to make sure that funds are primarily going to developers, not being automatically scooped up by corporate stakeholders.</p>

<p>These events have led us to re-think our recommendation and use of Bountysource. As such, we’ve removed Bountysource from our website, removed any Bountysource integration with elementary repos on GitHub, withdrawn our funds, and closed our account. For backers and bounty hunters on Bountysource, your bounties on elementary projects will automatically be returned to you. You may also wish to withdraw any funds and close your account by emailing <a href="mailto:support@bountysource.com">support@<wbr>bountysource.com</a>.</p>



<p>As an alternative, we recommend checking out <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">GitHub Sponsors</a>. We recently launched a few tiers on Sponsors, and have been very pleased with it.</p>

<p>You can directly sponsor <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/sponsors/elementary">organizations like elementary</a>, as well as individual contributors. For elementary specifically, we have a new $50/month tier that offers the closest equivalent to a bug bounty program: each month, backers at this tier can comment on any elementary issue to get at least an hour of our investigation time. This is a great way to help steer development in the direction you see fit while also directly supporting us.</p>



<p>GitHub also covers payment processing and doesn’t charge any fees for GitHub Sponsors; this means <strong>100% of your sponsorship goes to elementary</strong> to help fund our work.</p>

<p>If GitHub Sponsors isn’t your cup of tea, you can also check out the funding section on our <a rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" target="_blank" href="https://elementary.io/get-involved#funding">Get Involved</a> page to see other ways you can help support elementary OS.</p>

<div itemprop="mainEntityOfPage">
	
<p>It seems that coding skills are becoming less and less of a barrier to building and launching a successful application.</p>
<p>No-code tools have offered everyone from small businesses to enterprises the opportunity to achieve digital transformation both simply and sustainably. In the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/johneverhard/2019/01/15/what-really-is-low-codeno-code-development/#61935a6f2a8e" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">words of Forbes contributor John Everhard</a>, no-code, as well as often-associated low-code, solutions help “build powerful applications that can scale for any organization—without writing any code.”</p>
<p>Everhard further discussed in his article the powerful impact that no-code tools, also known as codeless tools, can have. With these types of software, IT teams no longer need to spend 60% of their time keeping their current systems working. Instead, no-code solutions help companies maintain a competitive edge over their peers with up to a 75% improvement on time to market.</p>
<p>Industry analysts have taken note of the “no-code movement” as well, with <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2019/08/gartner-lcap.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gartner predicting</a> that low-code application platforms (LCAP) will account for 65% of application development activity by 2024. Enterprises seem to be taking note as well, whether by <a href="https://www.testcraft.io/testcraft-joins-perforce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">acquiring codeless tools</a> or by releasing no-code capabilities of their own.</p>
<p>With that in mind, here is a list of different tools to keep on your radar in the no-code space. These tools cover every stage of application development, although there are other solutions that are not covered here, such as industry-specific solutions and payment applications.</p>

		<div>

			
<p>If you’re reading this wondering if you should stop using AES-GCM in some standard protocol (TLS 1.3), the short answer is “No, you’re fine”. </p>



<p>I specialize in secure implementations of cryptography, and my years of experience in this field have led me to dislike AES-GCM.</p>



<p>This post is about why I dislike AES-GCM’s design, not “why AES-GCM is insecure and should be avoided”. AES-GCM is still miles above what most developers reach for when they want to encrypt (e.g. <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/the-ecb-penguin">ECB mode</a> or <a href="https://robertheaton.com/2013/07/29/padding-oracle-attack/">CBC mode</a>).</p>



<p>To be clear: This is solely my opinion and not representative of any company or academic institution.</p>



<h2 id="what-is-aes-gcm">What is AES-GCM?</h2>



<p>AES-GCM is an authenticated encryption mode that uses the AES block cipher in counter mode with a polynomial MAC based on Galois field multiplication.</p>



<p>In order to explain why AES-GCM sucks, I have to first explain what I dislike about the AES block cipher. Then, I can describe why I’m filled with sadness every time I see the AES-GCM construction used.</p>



<h3 id="what-is-aes">What is AES?</h3>



<p>The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a specific subset of a block cipher called Rijndael.</p>



<p>Rijndael’s design is based on a substitution-permutation network, which broke tradition from many block ciphers of its era (including its predecessor, DES) in not using a Feistel network.</p>



<p>AES only includes three flavors of Rijndael: AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256. The difference between these flavors is the size of the key and the number of rounds used, but–and this is often overlooked–not the block size.</p>



<p>As a block cipher, AES always operates on 128-bit (16 byte) blocks of plaintext, regardless of the key size.</p>



<p>This is generally considered acceptable because AES is a secure pseudorandom permutation (PRP), which means that every possible plaintext block maps directly to one ciphertext block, and thus <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_problem#Cast_as_a_collision_problem">birthday collisions</a> are not possible. (A pseudorandom function (PRF), conversely, does have birthday bound problems.)</p>



<h3 id="why-aes-sucks">Why AES Sucks</h3>







<h4 id="side-channels">Side-Channels</h4>



<p>The biggest reason why AES sucks is that its design uses a lookup table (called an S-Box) <a href="https://github.com/veorq/cryptocoding#avoid-table-look-ups-indexed-by-secret-data">indexed by secret data</a>, which is inherently vulnerable to cache-timing attacks (<a href="https://cr.yp.to/antiforgery/cachetiming-20050414.pdf">PDF</a>).</p>



<p>There are workarounds for this AES vulnerability, but they either require hardware acceleration (AES-NI) or a technique called <a href="https://github.com/jedisct1/libsodium/tree/1.0.14/src/libsodium/crypto_stream/aes128ctr/nacl">bitslicing</a>.</p>



<p>The short of it is: With AES, you’re either using hardware acceleration,<em> or </em>you have to choose between performance and security. You cannot get fast, constant-time AES without hardware support.</p>



<h4 id="block-size">Block Size</h4>



<p>AES-128 is considered by experts to have a security level of 128 bits.</p>



<p>Similarly, AES-192 gets certified at 192-bit security, and AES-256 gets 256-bit security.</p>



<p><strong>However, the AES block size is only 128 bits!</strong></p>



<p>That might not sound like a big deal, but it severely limits the constructions you can create out of AES.</p>



<p>Consider the case of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_cipher_mode_of_operation#Cipher_block_chaining_(CBC)">AES-CBC</a>, where the output of each block of encryption is combined with the next block of plaintext (using XOR). This is typically used with a random 128-bit block (called the initialization vector, or IV) for the first block.</p>



<p>This means you expect a collision after encrypting <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B64%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{64}" title="2^{64}"> (at 50% probability) blocks.</p>



<p>When you start getting collisions, you can break CBC mode, as this video demonstrates:</p>



<figure><p><span><iframe width="580" height="327" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0IsYNDMV7A?version=3&amp;rel=1&amp;fs=1&amp;autohide=2&amp;showsearch=0&amp;showinfo=1&amp;iv_load_policy=1&amp;wmode=transparent" allowfullscreen="true"></iframe></span>
</p><figcaption>Their attack on CBC mode completely hand-waves away the block size detail that the demo depends on, but so long as you keep that in mind, their attack is valid.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is significantly smaller than the <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B128%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{128}" title="2^{128}"> you expect from AES.</p>



<h4 id="aes-post-quantum">Post-Quantum Security?</h4>



<p>Cryptographers estimate that AES-128 will have a post-quantum security level of  64 bits, AES-192 will have a post-quantum security level of 96 bits, and AES-256 will have a post-quantum security level of 128 bits.</p>



<p>This is because Grover’s quantum search algorithm can search <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="n" title="n"> unsorted items in <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="\sqrt{n}" title="\sqrt{n}"> time, which can be used to reduce the total number of possible secrets from <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7Bn%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{n}" title="2^{n}"> to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Csqrt%7B2%5E%7Bn%7D%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="\sqrt{2^{n}}" title="\sqrt{2^{n}}">. This cuts the security level, expressed in bits, in half.</p>



<p><strong>But remember, even AES-256 operates on 128-bit blocks.</strong></p>



<p>Consequently, for AES-256, there should be approximately <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B128%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{128}" title="2^{128}"> (plaintext, key) pairs that produce any given ciphertext block.</p>



<p>Furthermore, there will be many keys that, for a constant plaintext block, will produce the same ciphertext block despite being a different key entirely. (n.b. This doesn’t mean for <em>all</em> plaintext/ciphertext block pairings, just some arbitrary pairing.)</p>



<p><strong>Concrete example:</strong> Encrypting a plaintext block consisting of sixteen NUL bytes will yield a specific 128-bit ciphertext exactly once for each given AES-128 key. However, there are <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B128%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{128}" title="2^{128}"> times as many AES-256 keys as there are possible plaintext/ciphertexts. Keep this in mind for AES-GCM.</p>



<p>This means it’s conceivable to accidentally construct a protocol that, despite using AES-256 safely, has a post-quantum security level on par with AES-128, which is only 64 bits.</p>



<p>This would <em>not</em> be nearly as much of a problem if AES’s block size was 256 bits.</p>



<h4 id="aes-signal-protocol">Real-World Example: Signal</h4>



<p>The Signal messaging app is the state-of-the-art for private communications. If you were previously <a href="https://latacora.micro.blog/2019/07/16/the-pgp-problem.html">using PGP</a> and email, you should use Signal instead.</p>



<p>Signal aims to provide private communications (text messaging, voice calls) between two mobile devices, piggybacking on your pre-existing contacts list.</p>



<p>Part of their operational requirements is that they must be user-friendly and secure on a wide range of Android devices, stretching all the way back to Android 4.4.</p>



<p>The Signal Protocol uses <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java/blob/4f5e1ff299cea22cc75bb97249020a7da67b816d/java/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/libsignal/SessionCipher.java#L395-L413">AES-CBC</a> + <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-protocol-java/blob/4f5e1ff299cea22cc75bb97249020a7da67b816d/java/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/libsignal/protocol/SignalMessage.java#L111-L139">HMAC-SHA256</a> for message encryption. Each message is encrypted with a different AES key (due to the <a href="https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/">Double Ratchet</a>), which limits the practical blast radius of a cache-timing attack and makes practical exploitation difficult (since you can’t effectively replay decryption in order to leak bits about the key).</p>



<p>Thus, Signal’s message encryption is still secure even in the presence of vulnerable AES implementations.</p>

<p>However, the storage service in the Signal App uses <a href="https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-Android/blob/c24d285cd3e93f32fbcd94c7296aa6ac3a6967d0/libsignal/service/src/main/java/org/whispersystems/signalservice/api/storage/SignalStorageCipher.java">AES-GCM</a>, and this key has to be reused in order for the encrypted storage to operate.</p>



<p>This means, for older phones without dedicated hardware support for AES (i.e. low-priced phones from 2013, which Signal aims to support), <strong>the risk of cache-timing attacks is still present</strong>.</p>

<p>What this means is, a malicious app that can flush the CPU cache and measure timing with sufficient precision can siphon the AES-GCM key used by Signal to encrypt your storage without ever violating the security boundaries enforced by the Android operating system.</p>



<p>As a result of the security boundaries never being crossed, these kind of side-channel attacks would likely evade forensic analysis, and would therefore be of interest to the malware developers working for nation states.</p>



<p>Of course, if you’re on newer hardware (i.e. Qualcomm Snapdragon 835), you have hardware-accelerated AES available, so it’s probably a moot point.</p>



<h3 id="aes-gcm-worse">Why AES-GCM Sucks Even More</h3>



<p>AES-GCM is an authenticated encryption mode that also supports additional authenticated data. Cryptographers call these modes <a href="https://tonyarcieri.com/all-the-crypto-code-youve-ever-written-is-probably-broken">AEAD</a>.</p>



<p>AEAD modes are more flexible than simple block ciphers. Generally, your encryption API accepts the following:</p>



<ol><li>The plaintext message.</li><li>The encryption key.</li><li>A nonce (<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=n_%7Bonce%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="n_{once}" title="n_{once}">: A number that must only be used once).</li><li>Optional additional data which will be authenticated but not encrypted.</li></ol>



<p>The output of an AEAD function is both the ciphertext and an authentication tag, which is necessary (along with the key and nonce, and optional additional data) to decrypt the plaintext.</p>



<p>Cryptographers almost universally recommend using AEAD modes for symmetric-key data encryption.</p>



<p>That being said, AES-GCM is possibly my least favorite AEAD, and I’ve got good reasons to dislike it beyond simply, “It uses AES”.</p>

<h4 id="ghash">GHASH Brittleness</h4>



<p>The way AES-GCM is initialized is stupid: You encrypt an all-zero block with your AES key (in ECB mode) and store it in a variable called <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="H" title="H">. This value is used for authenticating all messages authenticated under that AES key, rather than for a given (key, nonce) pair.</p>

<p>This is often sold as an advantage: Reusing <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=H&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="H" title="H"> allows for better performance. However, it makes GCM brittle: Reusing a nonce allows an attacker to recover H and then forge messages forever. This is called the “forbidden attack”, and led to <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/475">real world practical breaks</a>.</p>



<p>Let’s contrast AES-GCM with the other AEAD mode supported by TLS: ChaCha20-Poly1305, or ChaPoly for short.</p>



<p>ChaPoly uses one-time message authentication keys (derived from each key/nonce pair). If you manage to leak a Poly1305 key, the impact is limited to the messages encrypted under that (ChaCha20 key, nonce) pair.</p>



<p>While that’s still <em>bad</em>, it isn’t “decrypt all messages under that key forever” bad like with AES-GCM.</p>



<h4 id="short-nonces">Short Nonces</h4>



<p>Although the AES block size is 16 bytes, AES-GCM nonces are only 12 bytes. The latter 4 bytes are dedicated to an internal counter, which is used with AES in Counter Mode to actually encrypt/decrypt messages. </p>



<p>(Yes, you can use arbitrary length nonces with AES-GCM, but if you use nonces longer than 12 bytes, they get hashed into 12 bytes anyway, so it’s not a detail most people should concern themselves with.)</p>



<p>If you ask a cryptographer, “How much can I encrypt safely with AES-GCM?” you’ll get two different answers.</p>



<ol><li><strong>Message Length Limit: </strong>AES-GCM can be used to encrypt messages up to <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B36%7D+-+32&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{36} - 32" title="2^{36} - 32"> bytes long, under a given (key, nonce) pair.</li><li><strong>Number of Messages Limit: </strong>If you generate your nonces randomly, you have a 50% chance of a nonce collision after <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B48%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{48}" title="2^{48}"> messages.<p>However, 50% isn’t conservative enough for most systems, so the safety margin is usually much lower. Cryptographers generally set the key wear-out of AES-GCM at <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=2%5E%7B32%7D&amp;bg=0a0a0a&amp;fg=f0f0f0&amp;s=3" alt="2^{32}" title="2^{32}"> …</p></li></ol></div></div></div>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Deutsch’s Algorithm is the simplest quantum computing algorithm invented to solve a slightly contrived problem. Suppose we have a black-box function $f(x)$ which maps from the set $\{0,1\}$ to the set $\{0,1\}$. It is easy to speculate that there are four possible mappings for $f(x)$. We call the function $f(x)$ constant if $f(0) = f(1)$, otherwise we call the function $f(x)$ balanced.</p>



<p>With a classical computer, we would have to run the black-box $f(x)$ twice to evaluate $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ and compare the values of $f(0)$ and $f(1)$ to see if they are equivalent or not. With a quantum computer, because we could take advantage of superposition, probably we could do better with fewer runs and operations.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to discuss the Deutsch’s Algorithm.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="separable-and-entangled-states">Separable and Entangled States</h4>

<p>States that can be broken into the Kronecker product of states from the constituent subsystems are called separable states, whereas states that are unbreakable are referred to as entangled states.</p>



<p>For example, we have the following two states $| \psi \rangle$ and $| \psi^{\prime} \rangle$.</p>



<p>$| \psi \rangle$ is separable and $| \psi^{\prime} \rangle$ is entangled.</p>

<h4 id="unitary-quantum-operator">Unitary Quantum Operator</h4>

<p>Every quantum operator $U$ is unitary and thus reversible. Because $UU^{\dagger} = U^{\dagger}U = I$, we have</p>



<h4 id="hadamard-operator">Hadamard Operator</h4>

<p>Hardmard operator is a special quantum operator.</p>



<p>Notice that $H^{\dagger} = H$, therefore</p>











<h4 id="an-equation">An Equation</h4>

<p>If $f(x)$ maps from the set $\{0,1\}$ to the set $\{0,1\}$, we have</p>



<p>Where $\oplus$ is $\text{XOR}$ (binary addition modulo 2).</p>

<h3 id="deutschs-algorithm">Deutsch’s Algorithm</h3>

<p>The black-box $f(x)$ is represented using a quantum gate $U_f$. Just like the classical gate for $f(x)$, it has four possible candidates. Our job is to determine whether the $f(x)$ corresponding to the $U_f$ is constant or balanced.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-23-Deutsch-Algorithm/Uf.png">
    <figcaption>$U_f$</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<p>The quantum gate $U_f$ is a unitary matrix which maps from $| x \rangle \otimes | y \rangle$ to $| x \rangle \otimes | y \oplus f(x) \rangle$, namely $U_f (| x \rangle \otimes | y \rangle) = | x \rangle \otimes | y \oplus f(x) \rangle$, for $x, y \in \{0, 1\}$. When $y = 0$, $| y \oplus f(x) \rangle = | 0 \oplus f(x) \rangle = | f(x) \rangle $, $| y \oplus f(x) \rangle$ is just $| f(x) \rangle$.</p>



<p>Note that the above mapping is only valid when $| x \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are basic qubit states $| 0 \rangle$ or $| 1 \rangle$. When $| x \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are superpositions, the mapping does not necessarily hold.</p>



<p>Let’s further check when $| x \rangle$ and $| y \rangle$ are superpositions, what the outputs from $U_f$ will be. Perhaps we could achieve fewer runs with superpositions.</p>

<h4 id="first-attempt">First Attempt</h4>

<p>In the first attempt, we made the first qubit input to $U_f$ a superposition, which is achieved by applying a Hadamard operator to the input basic state $|0\rangle$. The superposition is</p>



<p>The second qubit input to $U_f$ is just a normal  basic state $|0\rangle$.</p>

<div>

    <figcaption>First Attempt</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>







<p>If $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 1$, one of the balanced cases,</p>



<p>Note that this $|\varphi_2\rangle$ is entangled and could be be expressed as the Kronecker product of two qubits. The first qubit output from $U_f$ is not $H|0\rangle$ either. In fact it could not be described using single qubit! The two qubits must be described as a whole due to quantum entanglement. When we observe either the first qubit output or the second qubit output, we immediately know the observation of the other qubit. For example, if we observed the second qubit is 0, we know the observation of the first qubit must be 0. There are 50-50 percent chance observing 0 or 1 for both the first qubit and the second qubit.</p>



<p>If $f(0) = 1$, $f(1) = 0$, one of the balanced cases,</p>



<p>This $|\varphi_2\rangle$ is entangled and there are 50-50 percent chance observing 0 or 1 for both the first qubit and the second qubit.</p>



<p>If $f(0) = 0$, $f(1) = 0$, one of the constant cases,</p>



<p>This $|\varphi_2\rangle$ is separable. Although we are not sure the exact state the two qubit outputs would be in, due to the phase is not defined, we are sure that the observation of the bottom qubit must be 0.</p>



<p>If $f(0) = 1$, $f(1) = 1$, one of the constant cases,</p>



<p>This $|\varphi_2\rangle$ is separable. Although we are not sure the exact state the two qubit outputs would be in, due to the phase is not defined, we are sure that the observation of the bottom qubit must be 1.</p>



<p>However, all of these are not helpful if we are only allowed to run once. After running once, no matter what we observed from the first qubit and the second qubit, we are not sure whether $f(x)$ is constant or balanced.</p>

<h4 id="second-attempt">Second Attempt</h4>

<p>In the second attempt, we made the second qubit input to $U_f$ a superposition, which is achieved by applying a Hadamard operator to the input basic state $|1\rangle$. The superposition is</p>



<p>The second qubit input to $U_f$ is a variable and it could be either $|0\rangle$ or $|1\rangle$.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-23-Deutsch-Algorithm/attempt-2.png">
    <figcaption>Second Attempt</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>







<p>Because $\frac{|f(x)\rangle - |\overline{f(x)}\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ is either $\frac{|0\rangle - |1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$ or $\frac{|1\rangle - |0\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}$, $|\varphi_2\rangle $ could be further simplified as</p>



<p>The observation from the first qubit output is always the same to the first qubit input, whereas there are 50-50 percent chance observing 0 or 1 for the second qubit.</p>



<p>This provides no information of determining whether $f(x)$ is constant or balanced either.</p>

<h4 id="third-attempt">Third Attempt</h4>

<p>In the third attempt, we made the both qubit inputs to $U_f$ superpositions. The superpositions for the first qubit and the second qubit are $H|0\rangle$ and $H|1\rangle$, respectively.</p>

<div>
<figure>
    <img src="https://leimao.github.io/images/blog/2020-06-23-Deutsch-Algorithm/deutsch-algorithm.png">
    <figcaption>Deutsch's Algorithm</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>







<p>Note that if $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 0$, $f(x)$ is constant; if $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 1$, $f(x)$ is balanced. This information is encoded in the phase of the first qubit. How could we extract this key information?</p>



<p>We noticed that in the first qubit output $|0\rangle + (-1)^{f(0) \oplus f(1)} |1\rangle$ is either $|0\rangle + |1\rangle$ when $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 0$ or $|0\rangle - |1\rangle$ when $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 1$. Applying a Hadamard operator to it results in $|0\rangle$ when $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 0$ or $|1\rangle$ when $f(0) \oplus f(1) = 1$.</p>



<p>This means if $f(x)$ is constant, we must observe 0 for the first qubit whereas if $f(x)$ is balanced, we must observe 1 for the first qubit. Therefore, we are able to determine if $f(x)$ is constant or balanced using such quantum circuits.</p>



<p>Conventionally, we compare algorithms on the same platform, either it is a classical computer or a quantum computer. However, in our case, it is a little bit weird that the classical algorithm is using classical gate whereas the quantum algorithm uses quantum gate, yet we still have to compare the two algorithms. Therefore, in my opinion, such comparison is not fair.</p>

<pre>#======= THIS IS THE JARGON FILE, VERSION 4.2.0, 31 JAN 2000 =======#
</pre>

<p>This is the Jargon File, a comprehensive compendium of hacker slang
illuminating many aspects of hackish tradition, folklore, and humor.

</p><p>This document (the Jargon File) is in the public domain, to be freely
used, shared, and modified.  There are (by intention) no legal
restraints on what you can do with it, but there are traditions about
its proper use to which many hackers are quite strongly attached. 
Please extend the courtesy of proper citation when you quote the File,
ideally with a version number, as it will change and grow over time. 
(Examples of appropriate citation form: "Jargon File 4.2.0" or
"The on-line hacker Jargon File, version 4.2.0, 31 JAN 2000".)

</p><p>The Jargon File is a common heritage of the hacker culture. 
Over the years a number of individuals have volunteered considerable
time to maintaining the File and been recognized by the net at large
as editors of it.  Editorial responsibilities include: to collate
contributions and suggestions from others; to seek out corroborating
information; to cross-reference related entries; to keep the file in a
consistent format; and to announce and distribute updated versions
periodically.  Current volunteer editors include:

</p><p>	Eric Raymond 	<a href="mailto:esr@snark.thyrsus.com">esr@snark.thyrsus.com</a>

</p><p>Although there is no requirement that you do so, it is considered good
form to check with an editor before quoting the File in a published work
or commercial product.  We may have additional information that would be
helpful to you and can assist you in framing your quote to reflect
not only the letter of the File but its spirit as well.

</p><p>All contributions and suggestions about this file sent to a volunteer
editor are gratefully received and will be regarded, unless otherwise
labelled, as freely given donations for possible use as part of this
public-domain file.

</p><p>From time to time a snapshot of this file has been polished, edited,
and formatted for commercial publication with the cooperation of the
volunteer editors and the hacker community at large.  If you wish to
have a bound paper copy of this file, you may find it convenient to
purchase one of these.  They often contain additional material not
found in on-line versions.  The two `authorized' editions so far are
described in the Revision History section; there may be more in the
future.

<p>This document is a collection of slang terms used by various
subcultures of computer hackers.  Though some technical material is
included for background and flavor, it is not a technical dictionary;
what we describe here is the language hackers use among themselves for
fun, social communication, and technical debate.

</p><p>The `hacker culture' is actually a loosely networked collection of
subcultures that is nevertheless conscious of some important shared
experiences, shared roots, and shared values.  It has its own myths,
heroes, villains, folk epics, in-jokes, taboos, and dreams.  Because
hackers as a group are particularly creative people who define
themselves partly by rejection of `normal' values and working habits,
it has unusually rich and conscious traditions for an intentional
culture less than 40 years old.

</p><p>As usual with slang, the special vocabulary of hackers helps hold
their culture together -- it helps hackers recognize each other's
places in the community and expresses shared values and experiences. 
Also as usual, <em>not</em> knowing the slang (or using it
inappropriately) defines one as an outsider, a mundane, or (worst of
all in hackish vocabulary) possibly even a <b><a href="#suit">suit</a></b>.  All human
cultures use slang in this threefold way -- as a tool of
communication, and of inclusion, and of exclusion.

</p><p>Among hackers, though, slang has a subtler aspect, paralleled perhaps
in the slang of jazz musicians and some kinds of fine artists but hard
to detect in most technical or scientific cultures; parts of it are
code for shared states of <em>consciousness</em>.  There is a whole
range of altered states and problem-solving mental stances basic to
high-level hacking which don't fit into conventional linguistic
reality any better than a Coltrane solo or one of Maurits Escher's
`trompe l'oeil' compositions (Escher is a favorite of hackers), and
hacker slang encodes these subtleties in many unobvious ways.  As a
simple example, take the distinction between a <b><a href="#kluge">kluge</a></b> and an
<b><a href="#elegant">elegant</a></b> solution, and the differing connotations attached to each. 
The distinction is not only of engineering significance; it reaches
right back into the nature of the generative processes in program
design and asserts something important about two different kinds of
relationship between the hacker and the hack.  Hacker slang is
unusually rich in implications of this kind, of overtones and
undertones that illuminate the hackish psyche.

</p><p>But there is more.  Hackers, as a rule, love wordplay and are very
conscious and inventive in their use of language.  These traits seem
to be common in young children, but the conformity-enforcing machine
we are pleased to call an educational system bludgeons them out of
most of us before adolescence.  Thus, linguistic invention in most
subcultures of the modern West is a halting and largely unconscious
process.  Hackers, by contrast, regard slang formation and use as a
game to be played for conscious pleasure.  Their inventions thus
display an almost unique combination of the neotenous enjoyment of
language-play with the discrimination of educated and powerful
intelligence.  Further, the electronic media which knit them together
are fluid, `hot' connections, well adapted to both the dissemination
of new slang and the ruthless culling of weak and superannuated
specimens.  The results of this process give us perhaps a uniquely
intense and accelerated view of linguistic evolution in action.

</p><p>Hacker slang also challenges some common linguistic and
anthropological assumptions.  For example, it has recently become
fashionable to speak of `low-context' versus `high-context'
communication, and to classify cultures by the preferred context level
of their languages and art forms.  It is usually claimed that
low-context communication (characterized by precision, clarity, and
completeness of self-contained utterances) is typical in cultures
which value logic, objectivity, individualism, and competition; by
contrast, high-context communication (elliptical, emotive,
nuance-filled, multi-modal, heavily coded) is associated with cultures
which value subjectivity, consensus, cooperation, and tradition.  What
then are we to make of hackerdom, which is themed around extremely
low-context interaction with computers and exhibits primarily
"low-context" values, but cultivates an almost absurdly high-context
slang style?

</p><p>The intensity and consciousness of hackish invention make a
compilation of hacker slang a particularly effective window into the
surrounding culture -- and, in fact, this one is the latest version
of an evolving compilation called the `Jargon File', maintained by
hackers themselves for over 15 years.  This one (like its ancestors)
is primarily a lexicon, but also includes topic entries which collect
background or sidelight information on hacker culture that would be
awkward to try to subsume under individual slang definitions.

</p><p>Though the format is that of a reference volume, it is intended that
the material be enjoyable to browse.  Even a complete outsider should
find at least a chuckle on nearly every page, and much that is
amusingly thought-provoking.  But it is also true that hackers use
humorous wordplay to make strong, sometimes combative statements
about what they feel.  Some of these entries reflect the views of
opposing sides in disputes that have been genuinely passionate; this
is deliberate.  We have not tried to moderate or pretty up these
disputes; rather we have attempted to ensure that <em>everyone's</em>
sacred cows get gored, impartially.  Compromise is not particularly a
hackish virtue, but the honest presentation of divergent viewpoints
is.

</p><p>The reader with minimal computer background who finds some references
incomprehensibly technical can safely ignore them.  We have not felt
it either necessary or desirable to eliminate all such; they, too,
contribute flavor, and one of this document's major intended audiences
-- fledgling hackers already partway inside the culture -- will benefit
from them.

</p><p>A selection of longer items of hacker folklore and humor is included
in <b><a href="#Appendix%20A">Appendix A</a></b>. The `outside' reader's attention is particularly
directed to the Portrait of J. Random Hacker in <b><a href="#Appendix%20B">Appendix B</a></b>. 
Appendix C, the <b><a href="#Bibliography">Bibliography</a></b>, lists some non-technical works
which have either influenced or described the hacker culture.

</p><p>Because hackerdom is an intentional culture (one each individual must
choose by action to join), one should not be surprised that the line
between …</p></div>

		<p>Between roughly 1975 and 1995, access to computers accelerated much more quickly than access to computer networks. First in the United States, and then in other wealthy countries, computers became commonplace in the homes of the affluent, and nearly ubiquitous in institutions of higher education. But if users of those computers wanted to connect their machines together – to exchange email, download software, or find a community where they could discuss their favorite hobby, they had few options. Home users could connect to services like CompuServe. But, until the introduction of flat monthly fees in the late 1980s, they charged by the hour at rates relatively few could afford. Some university students and faculty could connect to a packet-switched computer network, but many more could not. By 1981, only about 280 computers had access to ARPANET. CSNET and BITNET would eventually connect hundreds more, but they only got started in the early 1980s. At that time the U.S. counted more than 3,000 institutions of higher education, virtually all of which would have had multiple computers, ranging from large mainframes to small workstations.</p>
<p>Both communities, home hobbyists and those academics who were excluded from the big networks, turned to the same technological solution to connect to one another. They hacked the plain-old telephone system, the Bell network, into a kind of telegraph, carrying digital messages instead of voices, and relaying messages from computer to computer across the country and the world.</p>
<p>These were among the earliest peer-to-peer computer networks. Unlike CompuServe and other such centralized systems, onto which home computers latched to drink down information like so many nursing calves, information spread through these networks like ripples on a pond, starting from anywhere and ending up everywhere. Yet they still became rife with disputes over politics and power. In the late 1990s, as the Internet erupted into popular view, many claimed that it would flatten social and economic relations. By enabling anyone to connect with anyone, the middle men and bureaucrats who had dominated our lives would find themselves cut out of the action. A new era of direct democracy and open markets would dawn, where everyone had an equal voice and equal access. Such prophets might have hesitated had they reflected on what happened on Usenet and Fidonet in the 1980s. Be its technical substructure ever so flat, every computer network is embedded within a community of human users. And human societies, no matter how one kneads and stretches, always seem to keep their lumps.</p>
<h2>Usenet</h2>
<p>In the summer of 1979, Tom Truscott was living the dream life for a young computer nerd. A grad student in computer science at Duke University with an interest in computer chess, he landed an internship at Bell Labs’ New Jersey headquarters, where he got to rub elbows with the creators of Unix, the latest craze to sweep the world of academic computing.</p>
<p>The origins of Unix, like those of the Internet itself, lay in the shadow of American telecommunications policy. Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie of Bell Labs decided in the late 1960s to build a leaner, much pared-down version of the massive MIT Multics system to which they had contributed as software developers. The new operating system quickly proved a hit within the labs, popular for its combination of low overhead (allowing it to run on even inexpensive machines) and high flexibility. However, AT&amp;T could do little to profit from their success. A 1956 agreement with the Justice Department required AT&amp;T to license non-telephone technologies to all comers at a reasonable rate, and to stay out of all business sectors other than supplying common carrier communications.</p>
<p>So AT&amp;T began to license Unix to universities for use in academic settings on very generous terms. These early licensees, who were granted access to the source code, began building and selling their own Unix variants, most notably the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) Unix created at the the University of California’s flagship campus. The new operating system quickly swept academia. Unlike other popular operating systems, such as the DEC TENEX / TOPS-20, it could run on hardware from a variety of vendors, many of them offering very low-cost machines. And Berkeley distributed the software for only a nominal fee, in addition to the modest licensing fee from AT&amp;T.<sup id="fnref-13802-fee"><a href="#fn-13802-fee">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Truscott felt that he sat at the root of all things, therefore, when he got to spend the summer as Ken Thompson’s intern, playing a few morning rounds of volleyball before starting work at midday, sharing a pizza dinner with his idols, and working late into the night slinging code on Unix and the C programming language. He did not want to give up the connection to that world when his internship ended, and so as soon as he returned to Duke in the fall, he figured out how to connect the computer science department’s Unix-equipped PDP 11/70 back to the mothership in Murray Hill, using a program written by one of his erstwhile colleagues, Mike Lesk. It was called <em><span>uucp</span></em> – Unix to Unix copy – and it was one of a suite of “uu” programs new to the just-released Unix Version 7, which allowed one Unix system to connect to another over a modem. Specifically, <em>uucp</em> allowed one to copy files back and forth between the two connected computers, which allowed Truscott to exchange email with Thompson and Ritchie.</p>

<p>It was Truscott’s fellow grad student, Jim Ellis, who had installed the new Version 7 on the Duke computer, but even as the new upgrade gave with one hand, it took away with the other. The news program that was distributed by the Unix users’ group, USENIX, which would broadcast news items to all users of a given Unix computer system, no longer worked on the new operating ssytem. Truscott and Ellis decided they would replace it with their own 7-compatible news program, with more advanced features, and return their improved software back to the community for a little bit of prestige.</p>
<p><span>At this same time, Truscott was also using <em>uucp</em> to connect with a Unix machine at the University of North Carolina ten miles to the southwest in Chapel Hill, and talking to a grad student there named Steve Bellovin.<sup id="fnref-13802-bellovin"><a href="#fn-13802-bellovin">2</a></sup> Bellovin had also started building his own news program, which notably included the concept of topic-based <em>newsgroups</em>, to which one could subscribe, rather than only having a single broadcast channel for all news. Bellovin, Truscot and Ellis decided to combine their efforts and build a networked news system with newsgroups, that would use <em>uucp</em> to share news between sites. They intended to distributed provide Unix-related news for USENIX members, so they called their system Usenet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Duke would serve as the central clearinghouse at first, using its auto-dialer and <em>uucp</em> to connect to each other site on the network at regular intervals, in order to pick up it local news updates and deposit updates from its peers. Bellovin wrote the initial code, but it used shell scripts that operated very slowly, so Stephen Daniel, another Duke grad student, rewrote the program in C. Daniel’s version became know as A News. Ellis promoted the program at the January 1980 Usenix conference in Boulder, Colorado, and gave away all eighty copies of the software that he had brought with him. By the next Usenix conference that summer, the organizers had added A News to the general software package that they distributed to all attendees.</p>
<p>The creators described the system, cheekily, as a “poor man’s ARPANET.” Though one may not be accustomed to thinking of Duke as underprivileged, it did not have the clout in the world of computer science necessary at the time to get a connection to that premiere American computer network. But access to Usenet required no one’s permission, only a Unix system, a modem, and the ability to pay the phone bills for regular news transfers, requirements that virtually any institution of higher education could meet by the early 1980s.</p>
<p>Private companies also joined up with Usenet, and helped to facilitate the spread of the network. Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) agreed to act as an intermediary between Duke and UC Berkeley, footing the long-distance telephone bills for inter-coastal data transfer. This allowed Berkeley to become a second, west-coast hub for Usenet, connecting up UC San Francisco, UC San Diego, and others, including Sytek, an early LAN business. The connection to Berkeley, an ARPANET site, also enabled cross-talk between ARPANET and Usenet (after a second re-write by Mark Horton and Matt Glickman to create B News). ARPANET sites began picking up Usenet content and vice versa, though ARPA rules technically forbid interconnection with other networks. The network grew rapidly, from fifteen sites carrying ten posts a day in in 1980, to 600 sites and 120 posts in 1983, and 5000 sites and 1000 posts in 1987.<sup id="fnref-13802-sitesandposts"><a href="#fn-13802-sitesandposts">3</a></sup></p>

However they left the system entirely open for expansion. Anyone was free to create a new group under “net”, and users very quickly added non-technical topics such as <em>net.jokes</em>. Just as one was free to send whatever one chose, recipients could also ignore whatever groups they chose, e.g. a system could join Usenet and request data only for <em>net.v7bugs,</em> ignoring the rest of the content. Quite unlike the carefully planned ARPANET, Usenet self-organized, and grew in an anarchic way overseen by no central authority.</p>
<p>Yet out of this superficially democratic medium a hierarchical order quickly emerged, with a certain subset of highly-connected, high-traffic sites recognized as the “backbone” of the system. This process developed fairly naturally. Because each transfer of data from one …</p></div></div>

	<p><small>June 24, 2020</small></p>
</div><div><p>Sometimes, you will hear the view that Unix's design is without
significant issues, especially the 'pure' design of Research Unix
(before people who didn't really understand Unix like Berkeley and
corporate AT&amp;T got their hands on it). Unfortunately that is not
the case, and there are some areas where Research Unix made decisions
that still haunt us to this day. For reasons beyond the scope of
this entry, today's example is that part of the file attributes
that you get from <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/stat.2"><code>stat()</code></a> system
call and its friends is the 'device number' of the filesystem the
file is on.</p>

<p>(To be specific, this is the <code>st_dev</code> field of the <code>struct stat</code>
that <code>stat()</code> returns, which has been since <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V7/usr/include/sys/stat.h">V7's stat.h</a>.
The <a href="https://minnie.tuhs.org/cgi-bin/utree.pl?file=V6/usr/man/man2/stat.2">V6 stat()</a> was
even more explicit about what it was returning.)</p>

<p>In Unix, the user level file attributes you get back need some kind
of locally unique identifier for the filesystem that the file is
on, so the presence of some identifier is not a mistake. The
identifier being different between two files is how you detect
things like that you're at a filesystem mount point, that you can't
use <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/link.2"><code>link()</code></a>, or that two otherwise
identical looking files are not actually hardlinked together because
they're on different filesystems. It's also useful to have an
identifier that can be matched up with things like a list of mounted
filesystems.</p>

<p>However, early Unixes didn't make this merely some identifier, they
made this specifically the device number of the underlying disk
device that the filesystem was mounted from (hence its name as
'<code>st_dev</code>'). This had the unfortunate consequence of permanently
joining two logically separate identifier namespaces, the namespace
of (mounted) filesystems and the namespace of block devices.</p>

<p>Now, 40 odd years later, we have plenty of Unix filesystems that
don't have underlying block devices (especially singular ones).
Anything mounted using one of these filesystems needs to somehow
make up a 'device number' for itself, and this device number can't
be the same as any real block device. This generally requires Unixes
to carve out a section of their overall block device numbers that's
reserved for filesystems to do this with, in other words things
that aren't actually block devices. Fortunately modern Unixes have
generally made the namespace of device numbers be much larger than
it used to be.</p>

<p>(Then because device numbers for block devices are generally stable,
a certain amount of software expects the 'device number' returned as
part of file attributes to also be stable, for any arbitrary filesystem.
When the kernel and a filesystem has to make this number up on the fly,
this is not always the case.)</p>

<p>At the same time, this is a good design for V7 itself, in the time and
the context. V7 and its kernel were intended to be a small system, and
in a small system you don't want to go doing extra work unless you
absolutely have to, especially in the kernel. V7 could reuse the device
number to be the filesystem identifier essentially for free, so that's
what it did.</p>

<p>(V7's kernel took any number of shortcuts in the interests of having
a simple implementation. For instance, a lot of things were stored
in small fixed-sized arrays, because you would never have more than
a modest number of processes, open files, or so on.)</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>Many laptop users choose to undervolt their machines. This decreases thermal output, which, in turn, can increase program performance, since modern CPUs will automatically adjust their operating frequency depending on the available thermal headroom. Undervolting tools exist for all major operating systems; they typically require administrator rights, but otherwise are easy to use. In Linux, however, things aren't quite so simple: recent versions of the kernel prohibit the mechanism used for undervolting Intel CPUs when SecureBoot is enabled. The most common way around this, unsurprisingly, is just to disable SecureBoot. With a bit of work, though, it is possible to keep SecureBoot enabled, but allow controlled access to the undervolting mechanism.</p>
<p>The next sections will go into some background information on undervolting, SecureBoot, and why newer versions of Linux prevent the former while the latter is enabled. You can skip any of these if you're already familiar with the topic.</p>

<p>Some laptops today are well-known for having thermal issues. A common culprit is that these laptops ship with voltage settings that are higher than actually required. This is a good default behavior, since chips' performance can vary significantly, even within a SKU. High-end chips that are put into more expensive models of these laptops, however, tend to be better binned, and often work without errors at substantially lower voltage. Since all modern chips implement some sort of "auto-overclock" when there is enough thermal headroom, this can translate into increased clock speeds, and thus, better performance.</p>
<p>My current laptop is a Dell XPS 15 7590, with an 8-core Intel® i9-9980HK. This particular model performs better compared to its predecessors, but there is still room for improvement. Unfortunately, Dell's UEFI provides no way to control the voltage settings, so any adjustments must be done after booting up.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://wiki.debian.org/SecureBoot#What_is_UEFI_Secure_Boot.3F">Debian Wiki</a> has a great explanation of SecureBoot and Machine Owner Keys:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>UEFI Secure Boot (SB) is a verification mechanism for ensuring that code launched by a computer's UEFI firmware is trusted. It is designed to protect a system against malicious code being loaded and executed early in the boot process, before the operating system has been loaded. SB works using cryptographic checksums and signatures. Each program that is loaded by the firmware includes a signature and a checksum, and before allowing execution the firmware will verify that the program is trusted by validating the checksum and the signature. When SB is enabled on a system, any attempt to execute an untrusted program will not be allowed. This stops unexpected / unauthorized code from running in the UEFI environment.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>A key part of the shim design is to allow users to control their own systems. The distro CA key is built in to the shim binary itself, but there is also an extra database of keys that can be managed by the user, the so-called Machine Owner Key (MOK for short).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Large distros, like Ubuntu, ship with kernels signed by the same CA key used by Microsoft for Windows. This lets them be installed onto systems with SecureBoot without making the user go through the hassle of registering their own MOK and signing the kernel manually. If you want to run any custom kernel modules, however, you must create and register a MOK with the UEFI, and sign the driver(s) with it, or the kernel will refuse the load them.</p>

<p>Intel CPUs have had MSRs—<em>model-specific registers</em>—for quite some time. All sorts of tracing and debugging functionality is available through them, but, importantly for this topic, this is also how they provide a way to dynamically adjust voltages applied to the core and caches of the CPU. More troubling, though, is that these registers can also be used to violate protection rings, allowing user applications to read <em>and write</em> over kernel memory, including kernel code. This is why applications that use the MSRs have always required some sort of elevated privileges.</p>
<p>Previously, programs that wrote to the MSRs only required the <code>SYS_RAWIO</code> capability in Linux. Recent version of the kernel, however, don't allow any writes to the MSRs whatsoever when SecureBoot is enabled. (In kernel parlance, this is called "lockdown mode.") The motivation here is sound: the entire purpose of SecureBoot is to have a trusted environment that runs only the exact code that's been authorized, so any mechanism that potentially allows modification of kernel code at runtime flies in the face of that goal.</p>
<p>There has been at least <a href="https://lore.kernel.org/linux-security-module/38d18a24-c580-d56b-f0cd-91e8184e1f0d@gmail.com/T/">one recent proposal</a> to open up the subset of MSRs used for undervolting, even when the kernel is locked down. A consensus hasn't yet been reached, though, so for the time being, we must come up with our own solutions.</p>

<p>tl;dr: the easiest way to allow undervolting in Linux while using SecureBoot:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate your own MOK and register it with the UEFI.</li>
<li>Patch the <code>msr</code> module to remove the checks for lockdown mode.</li>
<li>Build, sign, and install the patched module.</li>
<li>Install an undervolting tool, like <code>intel-undervolt</code>, and give it the
<code>RAW_IO</code> capability.</li>
<li>Rejoice!</li>
</ul>
<p>In my case, Ubuntu 20.04 uses kernel v5.4.0, and the patch looks like this:</p>

                        err = -EFAULT;
                break;
</span></pre>
<p>Pretty straightforward: look for all instances of <code>LOCKDOWN_MSR</code> in this file,
and comment-out the lockdown check &amp; error-handling code.</p>

<p>For all tests, these are the undervolt settings:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>ΔmV</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>CPU Core</td><td>-99.6mV</td></tr>
<tr><td>CPU Cache</td><td>-99.6mV</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>The first test is running Prime95 with default settings. Starting with the undervolt applied, I let the CPU frequency and temperature settle. Then, I set the voltage to stock settings, and let the system settle again. Measurements were done using the <code>intel-undervolt</code> tool. Here's the averaged &amp; rounded results:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Voltages</th><th>CPU Core (W)</th><th>CPU Core (°C)</th><th>CPU Core (Hz)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Stock</td><td>38 W</td><td>92 °C</td><td>2350 Hz</td></tr>
<tr><td>Undervolted</td><td>34 W</td><td>92 °C</td><td>2950 Hz</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>To see how this change would affect a realistic workload for myself, I compiled the latest trunk branches of Firefox and alacritty. Both of these runs were done with the same settings, and with a clean build tree.</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Voltages</th><th>Firefox Time (s)</th><th>alacritty time (s)</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>Stock</td><td>1401 s</td><td>139 s</td></tr>
<tr><td>Undervolted</td><td>1273 s</td><td>129 s</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>These are only brief, non-rigorous tests, but the results suggest that undervolting can provide tangible benefits.</p>

<p>The obvious objection to this solution, of course, is that it makes SecureBoot useless. Or does it? If your system has multiple tenants, some of whom require the ability to grant programs the <code>SYS_RAWIO</code> capability, then this objection holds water. For the vast majority of laptop users, though, this isn't a threat. The owner decides which programs are allowed to perform raw I/O, and is responsible for their own security.</p>
<p>As for the common solution to this problem—disabling SecureBoot entirely—the drawbacks are pretty clear: you're throwing the baby out with the bathwater, abandoning any sense of security and peace-of-mind that comes from cryptographic verification of your operating system. Users shouldn't have to sacrifice critical security features for acceptable performance.</p>
<p>The best solution would satisfy the needs of both server and desktop use cases. If the kernel had an interface to control undervolting, without providing access to the raw MSRs, then we could have the best of both worlds: no way to violate the SecureBoot contract from userspace, and laptop users can get better performance. Designing a good, reusable interface for this would undoubtedly take some time; we don't want it to be married specifically to one vendor, architecture, or platform. Until such an interface gets made and merged, we'll have to stick to workarounds.</p>

<p>Undervolting can provide noticeable benefits for many laptop configurations. Unfortunately, some OEMs prevent adjusting these settings in their UEFI, requiring the use of runtime mechanisms. Even <em>more</em> unfortunately, the mechanism for Intel CPUs also comes with potential security holes, which make it a challenge to provide this functionality in a way that completely complies with protocols like SecureBoot. Linux, in particular, takes the most conservative approach, absolutely forbidding access to undervolting mechanisms when running under a secure context. That is a sane starting point, but it would certainly be worthwhile to figure out an acceptable solution.</p>

<p>I have twice migrated large JavaScript apps to PureScript. At CitizenNet we replaced Angular with Halogen, and at Awake Security we’ve replaced most of a React application with PureScript React. Both companies have seen a dramatic drop in bugs in production.</p>

<p>It’s relatively easy to replace React due to PureScript’s <code>react</code> and <code>react-basic</code> libraries. The React mental model fits well with a strongly-typed, pure functional language like PureScript (or Reason), and using the same underlying library means that components can be shared between languages with little modification.</p>

<p>At Awake Security we share internationalization, a Redux store and middleware, and much more in an code base where PureScript regularly imports JavaScript and JavaScript regularly imports PureScript.</p>

<p>The best way to rewrite a significant app from one language to another is incrementally, while it runs. At first the new language can take over logically isolated parts of the app: the management dashboard, or the chat window, or a form. But eventually you must mix components from both languages together – for example, to support shared global state.</p>

<p>At this point you can’t just let the new language take over a DOM node. You need to support simple, clear features for intermixing the languages. Fortunately, you can transform the interface of idiomatic PureScript code into idiomatic JavaScript (and vice versa). With <code>react</code> and <code>react-basic</code> you can write business logic in PureScript but easily interoperating with the larger React ecosystem and your existing code.</p>

<p>In this article I will demonstrate how to replace part of a React application with simple components written in PureScript. Along the way, I’ll share best practices for making this interop convenient and dependable. The examples will be simple, but the same techniques also apply to complex components.</p>

</ol>

<p>I encourage you to code along with this article; no code is omitted and dependencies are pinned to help ensure the examples are reproducible. This code uses Node <code>v11.1.0</code>, Yarn <code>v1.12.0</code>, and NPX <code>v6.5.0</code> installed globally, and PureScript tooling installed locally.</p>

<p>Peter Murphy has <a href="https://github.com/ptrfrncsmrph/purescript-react-tutorial">implemented the ideas in this article using React Hooks</a> if you’d like to see this in action.</p>




<h2 id="let-s-write-a-react-app-in-javascript">Let’s write a React app in JavaScript</h2>

<p>We are going to write a tiny React application which shows a few counters, and then we’re going to replace its components with PureScript. The resulting JavaScript code will be indistinguishable, aside from imports, from the original, and yet it will all be PureScript under the hood.</p>

<p>Let’s follow the official React docs in using <code>create-react-app</code> to initialize the project and then trim our source code to the bare minimum.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Create the app</span>
npx create-react-app my-app <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd</span> my-app</code></pre></div>
<p>At the time of writing, <code>create-react-app</code> produces these React dependencies:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>"dependencies"</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>"react"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^16.8.6"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"react-dom"</span><span>:</span> <span>"^16.8.6"</span><span>,</span>
    <span>"react-scripts"</span><span>:</span> <span>"3.0.1"</span>
  <span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have a handful of source files under <code>src</code>, but our application will need just two of them: <code>index.js</code>, the entrypoint for Webpack, and <code>App.js</code>, the root component of our application. We can delete the rest:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Delete all the source files except for the entrypoint and</span>
<span># root app component</span>
find src -type f -not <span>\(</span> -name <span>'index.js'</span> -or -name <span>'App.js'</span> <span>\)</span> -delete</code></pre></div>
<p>Finally, let’s replace the contents of those two files with the bare minimum we’ll need for this article. From here on out I’ll supply diffs that you can supply to <code>git apply</code> to apply the same changes I did.</p>

<p>First, our entrypoint:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>// src/index.js
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>React</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>ReactDOM</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react-dom"</span><span>;</span>
<span>import</span> <span>App</span> <span>from</span> <span>"./App"</span><span>;</span>

<span>ReactDOM</span><span>.</span><span>render</span><span>(&lt;</span><span>App</span> <span>/&gt;,</span> <span>document</span><span>.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(</span><span>"root"</span><span>));</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then our main app component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>// src/App.js
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>React</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>App</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>&lt;</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span><span>My</span> <span>App</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>h1</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;</span>
  <span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>App</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="writing-a-react-component">Writing a React component</h3>

<p>Let’s write our first React component: a counter. This is likely the first example of a React component you ever encountered; it’s the first example in the PureScript React libraries as well. It’s also small and simple enough to be replaced twice over the course of this article.</p>

<p>The counter will be a button which maintains the number of times it has been clicked. It will accept, as its only prop, a label to display on the button.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="jsx"><span>// src/Counter.js
</span><span></span><span>import</span> <span>React</span> <span>from</span> <span>"react"</span><span>;</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Counter</span> <span>extends</span> <span>React</span><span>.</span><span>Component</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>super</span><span>(</span><span>props</span><span>);</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
      <span>count</span><span>:</span> <span>0</span>
    <span>};</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>render</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
      <span>&lt;</span><span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span>=</span><span>{()</span> <span>=</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>setState</span><span>({</span> <span>count</span><span>:</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>count</span> <span>+</span> <span>1</span> <span>})}</span><span>&gt;</span>
        <span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>props</span><span>.</span><span>label</span><span>}</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>state</span><span>.</span><span>count</span><span>}</span>
      <span>&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>Counter</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, we’ll import our new counters into our main application:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/App.js
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/App.js
</span><span></span><span>@@ -1,9 +1,13 @@
</span><span></span> import React from "react";
<span>+import Counter from "./Counter";
</span><span></span>
 function App() {
   return (
     &lt;div&gt;
       &lt;h1&gt;My App&lt;/h1&gt;
<span>+      &lt;Counter label="Count" /&gt;
</span><span>+      &lt;Counter label="Clicks" /&gt;
</span><span>+      &lt;Counter label="Interactions" /&gt;
</span><span></span>     &lt;/div&gt;
   );
 }
</code></pre></div>
<p>With <code>yarn start</code> we can run the dev server and see our app in action.</p>

<p><img src="https://thomashoneyman.com/images/2019/running-app.gif" alt="running app"></p>



<p>We’ve written entirely too much JavaScript. Let’s support PureScript in this project as well. Our goal is to write code in either language and freely import in either direction without friction. To accomplish that, we will install PureScript tooling, create a separate PureScript source directory, and rely on the compiler to generate JavaScript code.</p>

<h3 id="1-install-the-compiler-and-package-manager">1. Install the compiler and package manager</h3>

<p>First we must install PureScript tooling. I recommend installing versions of the compiler and Spago (a package manager and build tool) which match those used in this article. I’ll use NPX to ensure all commands are run using local copies.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># Install the compiler and the Spago package manager however you prefer;</span>
<span># since we're already in a React project I'll use Yarn</span>
yarn add -D purescript@0.13.2 spago@0.8.4</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="2-initialize-the-project-and-package-set">2. Initialize the project and package set</h3>

<p>We can create a new PureScript project with <code>spago init</code>. As of version 0.8.4, Spago always initializes with the same package set, which means you should have identical package versions to those used to write this article. I’m using the <code>psc-0.13.0-20190607</code> package set.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># npx ensures we're using our local copy of Spago installed in node_modules.</span>
npx spago init</code></pre></div>
<p>Spago has created a <code>packages.dhall</code> file which points at the set of packages which can be installed and a <code>spago.dhall</code> file which lists the packages we’ve actually installed. We can now install any dependencies we need and we’ll know for sure the versions are all compatible.</p>

<p>Before installing anything, let’s update the existing <code>.gitignore</code> file to cover PureScript. For a Spago-based project this will work:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>echo</span> -e <span>"\noutput\n.psc*\n.purs*\.spago"</span> &gt;&gt; .gitignore</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="3-adjust-the-directory-structure">3. Adjust the directory structure</h3>

<p>Finally, let’s organize our source code. It’s typical to separate JavaScript source from PureScript source except when writing an FFI file for PureScript. Since we aren’t doing that in this project, our source files will be entirely separated. Let’s move all JavaScript code into a <code>javascript</code> subdirectory and create a new <code>purescript</code> folder next to it.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">mkdir src/javascript src/purescript
mv src/App.js src/Counter.js src/javascript</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we’ll adjust <code>index.js</code> to the new location of our root component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="diff"><span>--- a/src/index.js
</span><span></span><span>+++ b/src/index.js
</span><span></span><span>@@ -1,5 +1,5 @@
</span><span></span> import React from "react";
 import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
<span>-import App from "./App";
</span><span></span><span>+import App from "./javascript/App";
</span><span></span>
 ReactDOM.render(&lt;App /&gt;, document.getElementById("root"));
</code></pre></div>
<p>We’ve just one task left. The PureScript compiler generates JavaScript into a directory named <code>output</code> in the root of the project. But <code>create-react-app</code> disables importing anything outside the <code>src</code> directory. While there are fancier solutions, for this project we’ll get around the restriction by symlinking the <code>output</code> directory into the <code>src</code> directory.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># we can now import compiled PureScript from src/output/...</span>
ln -s <span>$PWD</span>/output <span>$PWD</span>/src</code></pre></div>
<p>Your <code>src</code> directory should now look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh">src
├── index.js
├── javascript
│ ├── App.js
│ └── Counter.js
├── output -&gt; ../output
└── purescript</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="replacing-a-react-component-with-purescript-react">Replacing a React component with PureScript React</h2>

<p>I like to follow four simple steps when replacing a JavaScript React component with a PureScript one:</p>

<ol>
<li>Write the component in idiomatic PureScript.</li>
<li>Write a separate interop module for the component. This module provides the JavaScript interface and conversion functions between PureScript and JavaScript types and idioms.</li>
<li>Use the PureScript compiler to generate JavaScript</li>
<li>Import the resulting code as if it were a regular JavaScript React component.</li>
</ol>

<p>We’ll start with the <code>react</code> library, which we use at Awake Security. It’s similar to <code>react-basic</code> but maps more directly to the underlying React code and is less opinionated. Later, we’ll switch to <code>react-basic</code>, which will demonstrate some differences between them.</p>

<p>As we take each step in this process I’ll explain more about why it’s necessary and some best practices to keep in mind. Let’s start: install the <code>react</code> library and prepare to write our component:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span># install the purescript-react library</span>
npx spago install react

<span># build the project so editors can pick up the `output` directory</span>
npx spago build

<span># create the component source file</span>
touch src/purescript/Counter.purs</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="1-write-the-react-component-in-idiomatic-purescript">1. Write the React component in idiomatic PureScript</h3>

<p>Even though we are writing a component to be used from JavaScript, we should still write ordinary PureScript. As we’ll soon see, it’s possible to adjust only the interface of the component for JavaScript but leave the internals untouched. This is especially important if this component is meant to be used by both PureScript and …</p></div></div>

<p>I have been toying with a theoretical idea for the past 18 months off-and-on in my head and I have not fully articulated it aloud yet. It is regarding the concept of <em>Ownership Semantics</em> (OS) or <em>Move Semantics</em> in programming languages. Fundamentally this article is a criticism of the concept and states that the concept is a duality of traditional OOP but applied to a different area.</p>
<h2 id="general-definitions-of-terminology">General Definitions of Terminology</h2>
<p>A general list of definitions of terminology used within this article in order to minimize confusion.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <em>Value</em> is a datum with an associated type</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>(Data) Type</em> is an attribute of a value which encodes information about how the data value can be operated upon</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>Object</em> is a value with associated behaviour, and thus implies it has <em>agency</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>Class</em> is the data type of an <em>Object</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A hierarchy of value ownership is a hierarchy of responsibility of values</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>Owned-Value</em> is a value which belongs to a hierarchy of value ownership, which implies it is governed by an <em>agent</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An <em>Agent</em> is an actor with the capacity to act within a given environment</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>Model of Interpretation</em> is a way to view and analyse a subject</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <em>Paradigm</em> is a way of classifying models of structure of programming languages; a <em>Paradigm</em> is a <em>model of interpretation</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Object Orient(at)ed Programming (OOP)</em> - A paradigm of structuring a program around the sole concept of <em>Objects</em>, commonly through coupling data and code into a single unit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Ownership/Move Semantics (OS)</em> - Orientation around responsibility of values in a hierarchical fashion</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="foundations-of-the-object-orientation-paradigm">Foundations of the Object Orientation Paradigm</h2>
<p>Though the original conception of the term coined by Alan Kay<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> was never used as he intended it to be, the term <em>Object Orient(at)ed Programming (OOP)</em> has been commonly understood to be a paradigm of structuring a program around the concept of <em>Objects</em>, commonly through coupling data and code into a single unit. Many languages support multiple paradigms, including aspects for the OOP paradigm, but I would class those as multiparadigm rather than being <em>solely</em> an OOP language.</p>
<p>Most languages implement <em>Objects</em> and <em>Classes</em> in the Simula tradition; most of the notable OOP languages have a similar form by defining methods (member functions) within the class definition. Traditionally languages such as Java can be classed as <em>solely</em> an OOP language.</p>
<p>Most traditional OOP languages are based around the concept of <em>inheritance</em>, a mechanism of deriving a class data type from another class data type and retaining similar information. Most people generally view inheritance as a combination of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtyping">subtyping</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_dispatch">dynamic dispatch</a> through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_method_table">virtual method tables (vtables)</a>. This has lead to many discussions asking whether a language can be called as OOP if it does not support inheritance<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>
<p>In recent times, <em>inheritance</em> has been falling out of fashion in favour of <em>composition</em><sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. This is mostly due to the issue of conforming a <em>class</em> to a strict (singular) hierarchy of agency when in reality, things can belong to many (if not infinite) categories and hierarchies, as well as another aspect which I will be discussing throughout this article.</p>
<p>There are many criticisms of OOP<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup><sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup><sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup><sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup><sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup> but my general criticism is that by placing emphasis on trying to solve problem in the type system, it shifts focus from the data structures and algorithms, <a href="https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2020/05/31/progamming-pragmatist-proverbs/#the-concept-of-programming">the core of what a program fundamentally is</a>.</p>
<p>Since objects themselves are being treated <em>as if</em> they have behaviour (not just type properties), they are effectively being treated as if they were <em>agents</em> in the program. This mental model has many conclusions, many of which cause issues.</p>
<p>In my article <a href="https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2020/05/31/progamming-pragmatist-proverbs/"><em>Pragmatism in Programming Proverbs</em></a>, I state:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Object orientated programming is a form of misinterpreted and misapplied Aristotelian Metaphysics applied to a domain it was never meant to model</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What I mean by this statement is that <em>artificially</em> conforming any/all relationships between data and types to an artificial hierarchy of <em>agency</em> is a form of naïve-Aristotelian metaphysics. Since there is no actual <em>agency</em> in the programming objects, it is a partial fallacy. When trying to conform a program to have a particular structure when it does not naturally, the absence of a structure in a program is more useful than a bad structure.</p>
<h3 id="methods">Methods</h3>
<p>The concept of adding methods to classes/objects has proven useful to many. The real questions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why?</li>
<li>And how do people actually conceptualize methods on a day-to-day basis?</li>
</ul>
<p>For most people, I am going to bet that methods, in languages with an emphasis on inheritance rather than composition (such as C++ or Java), are treated as a way of categorizing and associating functions/procedures with a data record. There are a few reasons for this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Easy to organize and search for procedures by a data type</li>
<li>Allowing methods as a form of syntactic sugar for writing calls in a <em>subject verb object</em> manner e.g. <code>foo_do_thing(x, y)</code> vs <code>x.do_thing(y)</code></li>
<li>Mental model of behaviour for objects</li>
</ul>
<p>From experience, I have found that long time users of “OOP” languages eventually start treating methods primarily in the first two approaches.</p>
<p>I will not go into depth about the other main aspects of OOP such as encapsulation, local retention, forms of polymorphism, etc, as the hierarchical nature is the fundamental aspect of focus for this article. The (linear) hierarchy of agency is the main problem. The reason why people argue for <em>composition over inheritance</em> is that it flattens this linear hierarchy, reducing its effect. It is the transition from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nominal_type_system">nominal typing</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structural_type_system">structural typing</a>, which is more flexible because many data structures and problems have a <em>non-linear</em> nature to them, which <em>linear</em> approaches <strong>cannot</strong> handle. When trying to adhere to the the strict hierarchical type system approaches, it leads to numerous issues because data is more commonly graph-like (non-linear) than tree-like (linear) for most problems. This strict hierarchy does occur with encapsulation at the object level too, a strict hierarchy of messages/references; this hierarchical nature arises from the concept agency itself, inheritance is not the root cause.</p>
<p><strong>n.b.</strong> Inheritance is not all bad and does have many real life practical uses, but these costs must be known before using them, like with any tool.</p>
<p><strong>n.b.</strong> The linearity is with regards to the data structures themselves and not the algorithms.</p>
<h2 id="foundations-of-the-ownership-semantics-paradigm">Foundations of the Ownership Semantics Paradigm</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%2B%2B">C++11</a> introduced the concept of <em>move semantics</em> or <em>ownership semantics</em> (OS), a way to minimize the copying of data through copy constructors. It utilizes the added concept of r-value references (<code>T &amp;&amp;</code>) as a means to do this. However, the concept began to be used for a lot more than its basic purpose. The concept adds the high level abstraction of “moving” objects rather than “copying” objects. Physically, a computer only ever copies and this high level abstraction, to treat objects <em>as if</em> they were “real objects”, is not what actually happens. It is also a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_mistake">category error</a> to treat them as “real objects” since “real objects” and “programming objects” have little connection with each other ontologically. When a value or object is “moved”, this means is that the <em>responsibilities</em> of the resources of that object have been transferred to another object or environment—<em>agents</em>. In this case, ownership/move semantics is fundamentally based around the <em>responsibilities of values</em> by tracking value usage.</p>
<p>In this model of agency, the arena of agency can take on many forms, such as blocks, procedure bodies, or aggregate values. Therefore some <em>owned-values</em> also <em>own</em> other values, and thus a value could have agency.</p>
<p>If we were to call Ownership Semantics a paradigm, it would be the orientation around the <em>responsibility of values</em> in a hierarchical fashion, placing emphasis on this system of responsibility, shifting focus from data structures and algorithms.</p>
<p>The concept of <em>responsibility</em> and <em>ownership</em> is similar to the real world counter parts in that to own something means to have exclusive use and full responsibility over it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> is a multi-paradigm programming language but at its core is an Ownership-Orientated language. Everything in Rust has a concept of <em>“ownership”</em> and <em>lifetime</em> associated with it. Rust is designed around trying to be first and foremost “safe”, especially with regards to concurrency. Rust derives from the C++ family in terms of philosophy and style, but uses a more <a href="https://www.gingerbill.org/article/2018/03/12/on-the-aesthetics-of-the-syntax-of-declarations/">qualifier-focused</a> declaration syntax and many concepts from functional languages from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_%28programming_language%29">ML family</a>.</p>
<p><em>Lifetimes</em> are theoretically orthogonal to <em>ownership</em> but in practical, they usually are intrinsically coupled. I will not discuss the problems with object-based lifetimes in this article.</p>
<p>The following Rust code can be used to demonstrate this responsibility transfer between different capturing things such as <code>let</code> statements:</p>
<pre><code>pub struct Foo {
	value: i32,
}

fn main() {
	let foo = Foo{value: 123};
	let bar = foo; // the responsibility of `foo` is transferred to `bar`

	println!("{}", foo.value); // error: use of moved value: `foo.value`
	println!("{}", bar.value);
}

</code></pre>
<p>Rust is an immutable-by-default language, with the option to opt into mutability with <code>mut</code>. Immutability helps a lot with mathematical proofs for logic since things things can be “flattened” quite easily, however virtually all computers are fundamentally mutable things, even if the abstraction of immutability is a useful tool. As a result, the ownership semantics system requires a few more rules to take into account mutability, by adding the concept of “borrowing” through references. The general rules for the borrow checker are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Each value may have as many immutable borrows as you want</li>
<li>Each value may only have one mutable borrow at a time</li>
<li>Each value may not borrow immutably and mutably at the same time</li>
<li>Values will be “dropped” when the owning connecting goes out of scope</li>
<li>Taking a value by <code>self</code> <code>Drop</code>s the original value</li>
</ul>
<p>When using Rust (or move semantics to their full extent in C++11), most people will fight the borrow …</p></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Life before a software engineering career is commonly a series of time-bound efforts to gain competency in a new area. This semester you learn geometry. That semester you learn history. Next semester you learn calculus. And so on.</p>

<p>As a result, most people entering the software engineering workforce equate learning with learning a brand new topic. I didn’t know ruby, I learned ruby. I didn’t know SQL, now I know SQL.</p>

<p>This kind of thinking leads people to 2 year cycles. On most modern software teams, it takes roughly one year to really feel like you have your feet under you. By that time the kind of learning novelty people are used to isn’t there. By 16 months they’re restless. By 24 months they’re gone.</p>

<p>This is a problem. It’s a problem because the majority of durable and transferable knowledge comes after achieving basic competency. Mastery of a skillset, understanding and learning from the outcomes of decisions made years ago, architecture and design, leading projects - these all come well after basic competency.</p>

<p>Not only does a life of cyclic learning work against reaching these next levels, but your ego and willpower also work against you. Those next-level skills are harder to learn. And once you’ve gained competency you lose the excuse of “I’m onboarding” or “still ramping up” when something goes wrong.</p>

<p>I always challenge engineers that want to make big changes in what they’re working on to consider whether they’re simply at the end of a novelty cycle. I always encourage them to go after those next level skills.</p>

<p>On the hiring front, I see a lot of people who have a career’s worth of 2-year stints. You can do that successfully for an entire career, and there are even some people that’ll tell you it’s a way to optimize earnings over time. If it does, I believe it only optimizes earnings for people who can’t get to those next level skills. The biggest earnings come from building and growing with a winning company.</p>

<p>24-monthers never deeply learn how things work. They’ll typically add value to a new company by carrying a collection of things they’ve seen before and shallowly applying them to similar problems. But when faced with a new problem that doesn’t map easily to the solutions they’ve seen, things start to break down.</p>

<p>The end-games for both careers are very different.</p>

<p>24-monthers eventually can get into C-level positions where it’s not uncommon to bring in someone who can just apply the common solutions to the similar task at hand. Their stints usually end right around the time where they’ve upleveled the company in some way and don’t know how to grow their team or evolve their strategy or deal with the short-comings of some of their decisions.</p>

<p>People who learn next level skills and how to deeply understand and react to the tasks at hand lead companies to uniquely successful outcomes. The best CEOs, the best CTOs, the best C-level anything - their careers are often a small handful of long-duration roles where they didn’t apply rote practices but innovated and reacted to change and created novel solutions based on deep understanding.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I’m not saying you should stay with any given job. There are bad roles and bad bosses and everything in between. And skill diversification is important. But every job has problems. If you’re leaving because you’re chasing novelty or avoiding tackling your company’s challenges, you’ll start over in the cycle. Leave enough places for these reasons and you’ll find you’ve seriously limited your opportunities and earnings over time.</p>

Cloud native applications are increasingly distributed, evolving faster and failing in new ways, making it harder to monitor, troubleshoot and resolve incidents. Traditional approaches such as dashboards, carefully tuned alert rules and searches through logs are reactive and time intensive, hurting productivity, the user experience and MTTR. We believe machine learning can do much better – <a href="https://www.zebrium.com/blog/using-machine-learning-to-detect-anomalies-in-logs" rel=" noopener">detecting anomalous patterns</a> automatically, creating highly diagnostic incident alerts and shortening time to resolution.</p>

<h3>What do you imagine when you see "Anomaly Detection"?</h3>
<p>When you think about anomaly detection, you probably visualize it for metrics: detection of outlier values like peaks, dropouts, or other deviations from normal. <img src="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=303&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png" alt="anomaly detection" width="303" srcset="https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=152&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 152w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=303&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 303w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=455&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 455w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=606&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 606w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=758&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 758w, https://www.zebrium.com/hs-fs/hubfs/anomaly%20detection.png?width=909&amp;name=anomaly%20detection.png 909w" sizes="(max-width: 303px) 100vw, 303px">In the realm of application monitoring metrics are a scheduled measurements of a large set (thousands) of system health attributes – such as CPU, memory, latency and throughput. So metrics anomaly detection can be a useful tool to detect application health incidents, with the metrics anomalies serving as symptoms of the incident. A challenge with traditional time series anomaly detection is that it is noisy – applications can generate thousands of metrics, and in any given day it’s common to see many of them deviating from their historical ranges. Alerting on all of these would be a noisy mess,so users need to do more work to avoid alert fatigue. They must handpick which ones really matter, carefully tune thresholds, make adjustments for seasonality and trend lines, plus be thoughtful about algorithm selection.</p>
<p><br>This approach is untenable to detect new failure modes (unknown failure modes with as yet unknown symptoms). And it does not take advantage of the fact that when software incidents occur, they almost never impact just one metric. For example, memory contention on a node impacts multiple containers. Similarly, network bottlenecks impact latency for many operations which show up in metrics.</p>

<p>To be useful for incident detection, anomaly detection has to work autonomously across all time series, but also separate the signal from&nbsp;the noise by picking out the hotspots of correlated anomalies that are indicators of real problems. And to be even more useful, it should automatically correlate these metric anomaly hotspots with something that is even harder to build rules for – anomalies in log events. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3><span><strong>Anomaly detection applied to logs is very different</strong></span></h3>

<p>Log events are generated synchronous with execution of specific software paths. This makes them incredibly granular (micro-second or even finer resolution). They are also rich: since log events are only generated when specific conditions are encountered, they can selectively output data with almost unbounded cardinality (such as labels and IDs). Most significantly, events provide the best indication of causality. Where metrics measure aggregate symptoms about the application, log events are closely linked to specific code paths or error conditions in the software. For all of the above reasons, logs are an invaluable trove of information, so troubleshooting invariably involves digging through logs to find out root cause of an incident.&nbsp;</p>

<p>What if you didn’t have to do this reactively? Why couldn’t anomaly detection also be applied to events, with the goal of detecting highly unusual patterns of code execution, or rare errors or conditions. In other words, patterns that are diagnostic of a software problem, an infrastructure issue that impacts the application, or even security incidents. This is a bit harder to conceptualize than anomaly detection for metrics, but here is how it works.</p>
<h3>Learn what to track</h3>
<p>Metrics are explicitly tagged with labels and IDs – so it is clear what is being measured. Unfortunately, the link between a specific log event and the corresponding line of code is not explicit – most log events don’t contain references to source code, and they are typically unstructured, free form outputs coded by developers to help them troubleshoot. As a result, many of them look similar to the human eye because they contain similar keywords or strings.</p>

<p>Luckily machine learning can do far better than a human in this regard – it only needs to see a few variants of each message type to fully extract the fixed and variable parts of each message type – rapidly learning all the unique message types. This essentially constitutes the “dictionary” <strong><em>of all unique event types generated by the application stack</em></strong> – all that’s</p>

<p>Note that this event type dictionary is not as big as you might think – an entire Atlassian suite has fewer than 1,000 unique event types.</p>

This includes things such as its frequency, periodicity, severity, and even the values of metrics embedded within each event type. Now when a log event breaks pattern significantly, it is anomalous.</p>

<p>Particularly important variants include the first occurrence of a very rare event, and the sudden stoppage of a normal event (e.g. a system heartbeat).</p>

<p>s, with hundreds if not thousands of instances (many of them ephemeral), scaling operations and frequent updates. Good anomaly detection can be very selective - picking out the one in a million event that is truly anomalous. However, one in a million would still be too many things to focus on in an environment that generates billions of messages a day. Once again, machine learning to the rescue – it takes advantage of the fact that a single anomaly in one event type is rarely alert worthy – but when tightly clustered group of anomalies pops up across multiple event streams – that IS almost always alert worthy. What constitutes “unusually tight cluster” depends on the specific deployment of an application, so it needs to be learned on the fly.</p>
<h3>See a complete narrative</h3>
<p>This type of anomaly clustering doesn’t just improve signal to noise by several orders of magnitude. It also constructs an automatic summary of the incident – picking out the sequence of anomalous events and the related anomalous metrics, as well as highlighting the hosts and log types that fully describe the incident.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Done right, anomaly detection can <a href="https://www.zebrium.com/blog/is-autonomous-monitoring-the-anomaly-detection-you-actually-wanted" rel=" noopener">enable autonomous incident creation</a>, making it an incredibly powerful pillar of a monitoring strategy. It detects previously unknown problems the first time they occur, and reduces MTTR by automatically surfacing the unusual events and anomalies in metrics that describes an incident. But doing it right means understanding unique event types, learning the patterns and correlations of log events and metrics, and detecting anomaly clusters with good signal to noise. And for this to be practical, all of this has to work without extensive configuration, manual tuning, or impractical training windows.</p>

From a simple, finicky API a few years ago, ARKit has grown into a seamless integration between cutting edge hardware and advanced software. With the introduction of ARKit 4 during WWDC20, augmented reality connects virtual objects to the real world better than ever. In this article, you’ll learn about the latest from Apple in augmented reality.</p></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="6f0c">Last year, Apple announced the ability to share augmented reality experiences across devices — so two users could simultaneously interact with the same experience. This year, ARKit will allow augmented reality scenes to be linked to physical locations.</p><p id="83e3">Using a technique that Apple calls “visual localization,” ARKit will use machine learning techniques to map a physical scene to 3D data from Apple Maps. This way, a virtual object can remain anchored to the physical map and appear in the exact same position every time. Apple’s map data already contains feature points, which means that that you don’t need to handle any of the location matching — it’s all handled by the API!</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*NZSvCTpMKy4gnsF5JGpMDQ.png?q=20" width="1816" height="1082" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3632/1*NZSvCTpMKy4gnsF5JGpMDQ.png" width="1816" height="1082" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*NZSvCTpMKy4gnsF5JGpMDQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*NZSvCTpMKy4gnsF5JGpMDQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*NZSvCTpMKy4gnsF5JGpMDQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*NZSvCTpMKy4gnsF5JGpMDQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Using map-based virtual localization to determine a user’s exact location.</figcaption></figure><p id="7aa6">Location anchors are available for development in most major US cities and are compatible with iOS devices that have a GPS chip and an A12 Bionic chip or newer. The API requires you to check for these capabilities before starting the augmented reality experience. By far, location anchoring is one of the biggest updates to ARKit 4 this year.</p><p id="93bc">Using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/the-new-ipad-pros-lidar-sensor-changes-the-augmented-reality-game-5ee067058a7a">the new iPad’s LiDAR scanner</a>, ARKit 3.5 could create an accurate topological map of the surroundings. The iPad Pro’s LiDAR sensor, in short, shoots laser beams at the environment and then uses a scanner to check how fast the light gets reflected back to the sensor.</p><p id="e4a3">The idea is that the longer the light takes to come back, the farther the object is. If you want, you can learn more about this in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/the-new-ipad-pros-lidar-sensor-changes-the-augmented-reality-game-5ee067058a7a">one of my previous articles</a>:</p><p id="1f5b">With the release of ARKit 4, semantic segmentation of scenes is now possible, which allows us to recognize objects in a given scene for more dynamic augmented reality experiences. So — instead of only creating a map, ARKit can detect what types of objects are present in the map.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*hUwQVvKUUgTK3mviUdPWcA.png?q=20" width="1816" height="1082" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3632/1*hUwQVvKUUgTK3mviUdPWcA.png" width="1816" height="1082" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*hUwQVvKUUgTK3mviUdPWcA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*hUwQVvKUUgTK3mviUdPWcA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*hUwQVvKUUgTK3mviUdPWcA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*hUwQVvKUUgTK3mviUdPWcA.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Semantic segmentation with ARKit.</figcaption></figure><p id="708b">Live object recognition can allow augmented reality experiences to occlude — or cover — virtual objects with physical objects and differentiate between different objects. For example, you could have a virtual pet be occluded by living room couches but not by the table. This fine-tuned control over the experience has tremendous potential for developers.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="d4f1">The new Depth API provides detailed information about the topography of the environment. A depth map is available for each frame of a live video feed at up to 60 frames per second — that’s a lot of frames to do depth analysis on! This API combines data from the LiDAR sensor and maps it onto images to generate a dense depth map.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*1suVlGPLsrngHcsIUg1ZxQ.png?q=20" width="1600" height="953" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/1*1suVlGPLsrngHcsIUg1ZxQ.png" width="1600" height="953" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*1suVlGPLsrngHcsIUg1ZxQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*1suVlGPLsrngHcsIUg1ZxQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*1suVlGPLsrngHcsIUg1ZxQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*1suVlGPLsrngHcsIUg1ZxQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>A dense depth map generated from image and LiDAR data.</figcaption></figure><p id="6281">In addition to a depth map, the Depth API also provides a confidence map, which indicates how accurate the depth reading is. This can help developers evaluate when to rely on the depth map reading or to use an alternate method for determining depth. The depth and confidence maps are lower in resolution than the actual image because they use individual pixel values to convey the depth information.</p><p id="397f"><em>Ray casting</em> is a technique used to place virtual objects in augmented reality environments and has been optimized for precision in ARKit 4 — especially on devices with LiDAR sensors. In the past, hit testing was the recommended technique for ARKit experiences, and Apple now recommends ray casting.</p><blockquote><p id="210d">Ray casting provides a 3D location in physical space that corresponds to a given 2D location on the screen. When you call this function, it succeeds in returning a result when a mathematical ray that ARKit casts outward from the user intersects with any real-world surfaces that ARKit detects in the physical environment.</p><p id="6aa2">— Apple Documentation</p></blockquote><p id="8367">If you aren’t familiar with ray casting, it’s a technique that uses a mathematical ray to determine the position of a point on a 3D plane. In essence, ray casting is a better method than hit-testing and allows for faster and more precise object placement.</p><p id="3168">Face Tracking was previously only available on devices with a TrueDepth camera — in other words, Face ID-supported devices. With ARKit 4 comes support across all devices with the A12 processor or newer. The API no longer requires TrueDepth cameras to operate, making face tracking capabilities more widely accessible.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*tm5vrdVDr2DAulgPvDMRow.png?q=20" width="1816" height="1082" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3632/1*tm5vrdVDr2DAulgPvDMRow.png" width="1816" height="1082" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*tm5vrdVDr2DAulgPvDMRow.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*tm5vrdVDr2DAulgPvDMRow.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*tm5vrdVDr2DAulgPvDMRow.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*tm5vrdVDr2DAulgPvDMRow.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Face tracking is now supported on more devices.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="7d44">Now, augmented reality is more connected to the actual environment than ever before with the release of ARKit 4.

</figure><p>After more than a decade of habitual, voyeuristic internet-enabled "participant observation," I have learned that Mann is easily assumed to be a Jewish surname, and also that I'm <em>definitely</em> a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kulak">kulak</a>. I do, in fact, 100% believe that such extremists would kill me and my family if they could. Nobody is kidding about "liberals get the bullet too," although they may not realize it; you can tell because they style themselves after people who did just that. Emulation may be lossy, but that makes it <em>more</em> terrifying not less.</p><p>Did Weimar-era Nazis differ much from contemporary <a href="https://samzdat.com/2017/06/28/without-belief-in-a-god-but-never-without-belief-in-a-devil/">true believers</a>? (Pick your flavor.) I think not. Will to power existed long before Nietzsche named it, and thus here we are.

A brilliant theorist, but history has proven him to be a chump like the rest of us. God turns our lives to His purposes and we struggle to catch up with His plan; so it goes.</p><p>Will to power is often couched in more polite terms, of course:</p><blockquote>Ultimately, we dream of a world in which the massive wealth hoarding that underlies the [Poetry] Foundation's work would be replaced by the redistribution of every cent to those whose labor amassed those funds.<p>— <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf4u5Ns8Blz0gutuanOHF6I026Xi0dE9lT36HQtg5pDKeT5uQ/viewform">Letter to the Poetry Foundation from Fellows + Programmatic Partners</a> [<a href="http://archive.is/LjFb2">archive link</a>]</p></blockquote><p>I dream of that world too, occasionally, but I ain't dumb enough to think it can be instantiated, regardless of whether it should.

</figure><p>The endpoint of communism being dissolution of the family is true — <em>family</em> in practice means amassing resources and access to other advantages in order to share them with your kin specifically, because that is what gives your genome an edge.

Correspondingly, we respond to scarcity signals far, far more instinctively than intellectually.

<p>The question becomes how does the game-theory module determine this interest by evaluating observations and environmental and social cues? What it is really trying to probe for, as usual, are any deviations  between the 'true' status and social ranking ("who would beat whom, or  support whom, in a fight") and the currently formally accepted hierarchy.</p>
<p>"I'm a beta male now, everyone thinks that and treats me like that. But I've been getting stronger, and the old chief (or silverback) is getting older and weaker. Am I strong enough now, such that if I bait him and pick a fight, I’d come out on top and be the new alpha?"</p>
<p>The game-theory module is looking for situations just 
like this, and when it's time to pick a fight, it doesn't make you think "It's time to pick a fight to test the waters", it makes you feel "God  dammit the way that silverback treats me – with a lack of respect – is infuriating!" and then you just impulsively lash out in sincere rage.</p>

Medicine, as a practice, only makes sense in the moment we consider disease as an evil to be avoided or rectified. For modern Biology, though, there is no such thing as a "disease": everything is just a deterministic process which follows a precise set of rules. When deadly plague bacteria destroy a patient's lungs, the only thing the biologist sees are microscopic organisms feeding on another being's cells. The patient is prey, an ephemeral entity whose physical body will eventually dissolve in the environment.

<h2>Table of Contents</h2>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I had written this a while ago to be a humorous post on
<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cfb" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">/r/CFB</a>, but due to COVID-19, I totally
forgot to post it. This is not meant to be serious. Enjoy.</p>

<p>To begin with, we need to gather actual data from real footballs.
This is to help with our calculations for corncobs, and to provide as a reference
to ensure our process is correct.</p>
<h3 id="size-and-mass">Size and Mass</h3>
<p>First, we need the mass and frontal area of a football.
I don’t know if college footballs are different from NFL footballs, but I was able to
find that a NFL football should be between 14 to 15 ounces in weight and have
a circumference of 22 inches.
<a href="https://www.sportsrec.com/6560043/what-is-the-official-size-of-the-nfl-football" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Source.</a>
We’ll meet the weight half-way and
call it 14.5 ounces or 0.41 kg. With a circumference of 22 inches,
that means (assuming the football front is perfectly circular)
the frontal area is 38.52 in<sup>2</sup> or 0.0248 m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<h3 id="throwing-velocity">Throwing Velocity</h3>
<p>So, how fast can a quarterback <em>actually</em> throw a football? More importantly, how much
<em>force</em> can a quarterback impart on a football? (you’ll see why later)
Based on some research, a fast throw is around 60 mph (26.82 m/s)
with a rotation of about 600 rpm (62.83 rad/s).
<a href="https://www.sportsrec.com/6938474/maximum-speed-of-a-football" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Source.</a>
However, that still doesn’t provide us
the force of the throw, as force equals mass times acceleration. In order to figure out
acceleration, we need to know how long the throw takes.
Using <a href="https://youtu.be/tVoqA-LKGb4?t=206" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this clip</a>,
I counted the throw taking 11 frames, from winding back,
to the ball leaving Drew’s hand. In that 30fps video, that’s 0.36 seconds,
which means the ball experienced about 74.5 m/s<sup>2</sup> of acceleration.
This means that about 30.545 Newtons of force was imparted onto the ball.</p>
<h3 id="throwing-height">Throwing Height</h3>
<p>Another important factor is at what height the football is thrown from. Someone taller
will be able to throw the ball farther. I don’t know much about football,
but it seems that when throwing the football, it’s released around head-height,
so we’ll estimate it as that. Therefore, we need an idea of idea of how tall
our average quarterback is. Thankfully, a quick search reveals that to be around
6’1” or about 1.55 meters.
<a href="https://www.ncsasports.org/football/recruiting-guidelines" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Source.</a></p>
<h3 id="air-properties">Air Properties</h3>
<p>Next, we need to figure out the properties of air (density, temperature, pressure)
that footballs are being thrown in,
as this affects the drag and trajectory. While we could just assume sea-level, let’s
find the average altitude of every college football stadium, and use a
standard atmosphere lookup table to find the air properties.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I was unable to find a list of altitudes of college football stadiums.
Instead, I had to get creative. I <em>did</em> manage to find a list of
every college football stadium.
<a href="http://www.collegegridirons.com/comparisons.htm" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Source.</a>
From there, I wrote a script that ran each
stadium through the Google Maps API to get an elevation.
<a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/elevation/start" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Source.</a>
Just average all the values together, and ta-da, the average elevation
of every US college football stadium is around 285 meters.</p>
<p>With the average elevation, we can now determine the standard air density. This comes
out to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Density: 1.19183 kg/m<sup>3</sup></li>
<li>Temperature: 286.297 K</li>
<li>Pressure: 97947.8 Pa</li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.digitaldutch.com/atmoscalc/" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Source.</a></p>
<h3 id="coefficient-of-drag">Coefficient of Drag</h3>
<p>A crucial number in determining the trajectory of a flying object is it’s
“coefficient of drag”. This is a unitless coefficient that represents how much
drag an object experiences. This is a very difficult number to calculate,
and is usually found experimentally.</p>
<p>Research shows that the coefficient of drag of a football is around 0.05-0.06.
<a href="http://users.df.uba.ar/sgil/physics_paper_doc/papers_phys/fluids/drag_football.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Source.</a>
However, to ensure our process is correct, I’d like to replicate this result with CFD
(computational fluid dynamics) software.</p>
<h4 id="3d-model">3D Model</h4>
<p>In order to compute our own coefficient of drag, we need a 3D model. Thankfully
a quick search on GrabCAD found the
<a href="https://grabcad.com/library/american-football-5" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">perfect candidate</a>.
This model was hollow, so to avoid any weird effects in CFD, I filled in the model.</p>
<h4 id="cfd">CFD</h4>
<p>I setup a fluid simulation in SOLIDWORKS (my CAD program of choice), with the following
parameters, and an equation goal to compute the drag coefficient from the
drag force imparted on the football.
<a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/dragco.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Source.</a></p>
<p>Parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li>External Analysis
<ul>
<li>Exclude cavities without flow conditions</li>
<li>Exclude internal space</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Gravity on</li>
<li>Global rotation @ 62.83 rad/s</li>
<li>Air preset</li>
<li>Laminar and turbulent flow</li>
<li>Humidity effects on (default settings)</li>
<li>Turbulence effects on (default settings)</li>
<li>Adiabatic wall with 100 micrometer roughness</li>
<li>97947.8 Pa pressure</li>
<li>286.297 K temperature</li>
<li>-26.82 m/s flow velocity relative to rotating frame</li>
<li>Level 6 density global mesh</li>
<li>Computational Domain +/- 0.2 m on sides, +/- 0.3 m front-to-back.</li>
</ul>
<p>After it was done, I was pleasantly surprised to find my coefficient of drag to
come out to 0.0953. This means we’re in the right ballpark. (I didn’t expect to
hit the value exactly as CFD inherently has some error, and SOLIDWORKS flow
simulation isn’t a top-tier product)</p>

<p>Thrown at an optimal 45 degrees, our theoretical football calculations say the
ball will fly about 64 meters. Based on record throw data from
<a href="https://www.topendsports.com/sport/gridiron/longest-throw.htm" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">this site</a>
it looks like our data is pretty feasible, though maybe a bit on the short side.</p>
<h2 id="corncob">Corncob</h2>
<p>Time to perform the same analysis with a corncob.</p>
<h3 id="size-and-mass-1">Size and Mass</h3>
<p>Once again, we first need the
size and mass of a corncob. Research shows that the average ear of corn
was between 156.80 mm and 178.13 mm in length, depending on when it was picked.
<a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303010127_Azospirillum_brasilense_promotes_increment_in_corn_production" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Source.</a>
(I know this research is from Africa. It’s best I could come up with
without going to the grocery store with a ruler looking like an idiot.)</p>
<p>Finding the mass of an average corncob was a bit trickier. I was able to find
that a pound of corn is about 1300 kernels, and that an ear of corn averages
800 kernels. This means that we can estimate that an ear of corn is about 0.615 pounds
or 0.279kg.
<a href="https://www.nefbfoundation.org/Images/FOUndation/Educators/Enriching-Activities/Corn-Calculations.pdf" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">Source.</a></p>
<h3 id="throwing-velocity-1">Throwing Velocity</h3>
<p>So, how fast can you throw a corncob?
Given that the corncob has a mass of only 0.279 kg, this means with 30.545 Newtons
of force, the corncob can be accelerated at a rate of 109.48 m/s<sup>2</sup>. Over the same
0.36 second period, that’s 39.413 m/s or a little over 88 mph (where we’re going,
we don’t need roads).</p>
<h3 id="coefficient-of-drag-1">Coefficient of Drag</h3>
<h4 id="3d-model-1">3D Model</h4>
<p>I didn’t have any desire to 3D model an ear of corn, so I went looking for a model
I could download for free. Surprisingly, there weren’t many options. Thankfully,
I did manage to find one
<a href="https://free3d.com/3d-model/cornoncob-v01--775846.html" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">free model</a>.
A quick measurement shows the length of the model falls within our acceptable range,
so no scaling required.</p>

</a>
<figcaption>Corncob Length</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In order to get the frontal area of our selected corncob, I simply measured
the diameter of the model, which happened to be a near-perfect circle with
a diameter of 35.49 mm.</p>

</a>
<figcaption>Corncob Diameter</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This gives the corncob a frontal area of 989.24 mm<sup>2</sup> or 0.00098924 m<sup>2</sup>.</p>
<h4 id="cfd-1">CFD</h4>
<p>I setup a very similar simulation as described above, just with a higher velocity
and smoother walls. I then fired off the simulation and let my processor chug
for about 20 minutes. This simulation took significantly longer as the model
was not a native SOLIDWORKS file, but a very complex imported geometry. Meshing
the model alone took about 5 minutes.</p>

</figure>
<p>After the simulation was finished, I was very surprised to have the coefficient of drag
come out to 0.184 (almost twice that of the football).
My best guess for this is despite the corncob’s small size,
the higher velocity and rougher surface contributed to more relative drag.
Another theory I have is that the kernels protruding create a lot of low-pressure areas,
increasing drag, as you can see in the image below with the sort of “ripples” of
pressure values.</p>

<p>Now, we bring it all together. How far can you actually throw a corncob? I plotted

				<p>I am tired of boring Elasticsearch tutorials. Learning should be interactive; it shouldn't feel like reading lengthy technical documentation. Today we are going to learn the basics of Elasticsearch using a movie database. I have a small database of titles ready for you to import.</p><p>Don't we need some theory? You didn't click to view the typical technical blog post. If you are stubborn, jump to the workshop section and learn on the fly. Some people learn this way better, &nbsp;nothing wrong with that. If you want to get to know some essentials, go through Slideshare I created.</p><figure> 

</figure><p>Before we begin clone this repo: <code>git clone <a>git@github.com</a>:ptsdengineer/learn-elasticsearch-with-hollywood-movies.git</code> or<strong> <a href="https://github.com/ptsdengineer/learn-elasticsearch-with-hollywood-movies/archive/master.zip">download zip</a></strong></p><h3 id="installing-elasticsearch-and-seeding-data">Installing Elasticsearch and seeding data</h3><p><strong>For Mac users</strong>: the most comfortable way would be to install it from homebrew: <code>brew install Elasticsearch</code></p><p><strong>For Linux users</strong>: Please try this tutorial here: <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-elasticsearch-on-ubuntu-14-04" rel="nofollow">https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-elasticsearch-on-ubuntu-14-04</a></p><p><strong>Run Elasticsearch</strong></p><p><code>elasticsearch</code> on Mac</p><p> <code>sudo service elasticsearch start</code> on Ubuntu</p><p> Check if it's running on <a href="http://localhost:9200/" rel="nofollow">http://localhost:9200</a></p><h3 id="run-using-docker">Run using docker</h3><p>If you prefer docker way, you can also use it in tutorial. I have docker-compose file ready.</p><p><code>docker-compose up</code></p><p><strong>Credentials</strong>: user is <strong><code>elastic</code></strong> and password <strong><code>changeme</code></strong></p><p><strong>Use Postman, curl or Insomnia for making calls to Elasticsearch API</strong>. I can't recommend <a href="https://insomnia.rest/">Insomnia</a> enough, this piece of software makes life so much easier.</p><h2 id="creating-data">Creating data</h2><p>Create index for movies, it will hold all the movies documents that we will import in a minute. Open insomnia and make your first call.</p><figure><img src="http://realptsdengineer.com/content/images/2020/06/put-movies-1.png" alt="" srcset="http://realptsdengineer.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/put-movies-1.png 600w, http://realptsdengineer.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/put-movies-1.png 1000w, http://realptsdengineer.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/06/put-movies-1.png 1600w, http://realptsdengineer.com/content/images/size/w2178/2020/06/put-movies-1.png 2178w"></figure><p>Now let's import data into our index. I prepared JSON with all the documents that could be easily run.</p><figure><pre><code>curl -s --header "Content-Type:application/json"  -XPOST localhost:9200/_bulk --data-binary @movies.json
</code></pre><figcaption>Bulk import of movies from json</figcaption></figure><p>*Use option <code>-u</code> for typing user and password when running with docker.</p><p>If you want to learn more about this feature: <a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docs-bulk.html" rel="nofollow">Bulk import</a></p><h2 id="match-all">Match all</h2><p>Let's make the most straightforward possible query to our movies index. The query that returns all results, it's called match all query.</p><pre><code>GET &lt;name_of_index&gt;/_search
{
    "query": {
        "match_all": {}
    }
}
</code></pre><p>You should get this type of result in response:</p><pre><code>"hits": {
    "total": 306,
    "max_score": 1,
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-match-all-query.html" rel="nofollow">Match all docs</a></p><h4 id="exercise">Exercise</h4><p>Type this query into Insomnia. You will get results for the movies index.</p><h2 id="string-query">String query</h2><p>Still straightforward query, we will only search for a particular string.</p><pre><code>GET /_search
{
    "query": {
        "query_string" : {
            "default_field" : "content",
            "query" : "this AND that OR thus"
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p><a href="https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/query-dsl-query-string-query.html" rel="nofollow">String query documentation</a></p><h5 id="exercise-">Exercise.</h5><p>Using this knowledge find movie Scarface in the Elasticsearch. There should be only one result.</p><h3 id="operators">Operators</h3><p>Let's build on this. We want to extend our search capabilities. Elasticsearch uses operators like in programming, by default it uses <code>OR</code> but we can use <code>AND</code> to get an exact match.</p><pre><code>GET /_search
{
    "query": {
        "query_string" : {
            "default_field" : "content",
            "query" : "Strawberry pie with jello",
            "default_operator": "AND"
        }
    }
}
</code></pre><p>Now we will be sure that we will only get recipes we are interested.</p><h5 id="exercise--1">Exercise.</h5><p>Make a query to Elasticsearch that will return only <strong>one</strong> result on query <code>Captain America first avenger</code></p><pre><code>"hits": {
     "total": 1,
     "max_score": 11.263437,
     "hits": [
        {

              "title": "Captain America: The First Avenger",
              "plot": "Predominantly set during World War II, Steve Rogers is a sickly man from Brooklyn who's transformed into super-soldier Captain America to aid in the war effort. Rogers must stop the Red Skull – Adolf Hitler's ruthless head of weaponry, and the leader of an organization that intends to use a mysterious device of untold powers for world domination.",
              "genres": null,
</code></pre><h3 id="fuzziness">Fuzziness</h3><p>What about cases when users don't type query correctly? We should also handle those cases. Fortunately Elasticsearch has an answer, match query with a fuzzy query, it's a simpler cousin of string query.</p><pre><code>"query": {
  "match": {
    "text": {
      "query": "jomped over me!",
      "fuzziness": "AUTO",
      "operator":  "and"
    }
  }
}
</code></pre><p><code>"fuzziness": "AUTO"</code> generates an edit distance based on the length of the term. <code>0..2</code> must match exactly <code>3..5</code> one edit allowed <code>&gt;5</code> two edits allowed</p><p>You could also use number values, like <code>0, 1, 2</code>. Fuzziness is interpreted as Levenshtein Edit Distance.

The Lucene query type depends on the field type, for string fields, the TermRangeQuery, while for number/date fields, the query is a NumericRangeQuery. The following example returns all documents where age is between 10 and 20:</p><pre><code>GET _search

      <h4>Movements against unregulated police use of facial recognition, which compound its many ethical issues, are gaining speed</h4>
      
      </div><div>
      <h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Recent protests in racial discrimination and police brutality led IBM to cease developing facial recognition technology and Microsoft and Amazon to pause selling face recognition technology to law enforcement.</li>
  <li>While this is a good starting point, as companies are not only acknowledging but addressing known flaws and biases in face recognition systems, much work remains to be done.</li>
  <li>In particular, continued pressure from the public is needed to ensure ethical developments and regulations of face recognition technology in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="what-happened">What Happened</h2>

<p>In a June 8 <a href="https://www.ibm.com/blogs/policy/facial-recognition-susset-racial-justice-reforms/">letter</a> to members of Congress, IBM declared its opposition to technologies that would enable surveillance, including facial recognition. 
Microsoft and Amazon followed suit on facial recognition, respectively <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/11/microsoft-facial-recognition/">banning police use</a> and placing a <a href="https://blog.aboutamazon.com/policy/we-are-implementing-a-one-year-moratorium-on-police-use-of-rekognition">one-year moratorium</a> on use. 
Other companies, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jun/19/victoria-police-distances-itself-from-controversial-facial-recognition-firm-clearview-ai">such as Clearview AI</a>, still offer the technology to police departments. 
As <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/06/11/ibm-facial-recognition/">The Washington Post</a> reports, IBM’s decision to drop facial recognition technology has been preceded by years of debate, particularly in response to a 2018 study called <a href="http://gendershades.org/overview.html">Gender Shades</a> which found that industry facial recognition systems have much higher error rates on darker-skinned faces.</p>

<p>Civil rights and justice groups, including the <a href="https://medium.com/@Joy.Buolamwini/ibm-leads-more-should-follow-racial-justice-requires-algorithmic-justice-and-funding-da47e07e5b58">Algorithmic Justice League</a> and <a href="https://www.aclu.org/press-releases/aclu-statement-amazon-face-recognition-moratorium">ACLU</a>, have commended these actions from IBM and Amazon:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Algorithmic Justice League commends this decision as a first move forward towards company-side responsibility to promote equitable and accountable AI.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>It took two years for Amazon to get to this point, but we’re glad the company is finally recognizing the dangers face recognition poses to Black and Brown communities and civil rights more broadly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Facial recognition technology, capable of identifying a person from a digital image or video frame, has been under development for decades. 
With the major advances in deep learning over the past decade, facial recognition has also seen substantial progress. 
Modern AI-powered face recognition systems rely on large datasets of faces for two purposes: 1) training a neural network that can extract key features of human faces and 2) finding similar-looking faces using these features. 
There are multiple privacy and ethical concerns with collecting such large datasets, ranging from biased data that results in biased predictions to how these data <a href="https://onezero.medium.com/i-got-my-file-from-clearview-ai-and-it-freaked-me-out-33ca28b5d6d4">can be collected without consent</a>.</p>

<p>The recent controversies regarding face recognition are specifically centered around use by law enforcement. 
There are currently no federal laws, and few local ones, regulating how and when police and other government agencies can use such technologies. 
This is despite commercial offerings already being available for years, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/12/technology/facial-recognition-police.html">being used</a> by some police departments. 
When these flawed systems are applied by law enforcement, they can place people of color at higher risk due to the higher error rate. 
Even if these systems worked perfectly, they can still be <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/06/12/1003482/amazon-stopped-selling-police-face-recognition-fight/">“easily weaponized against communities to harass them.”</a></p>

<h2 id="the-reactions">The Reactions</h2>

<p><strong>From the Press:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/6/10/21287194/amazon-microsoft-ibm-facial-recognition-moratorium-police">Vox</a> notes that public statements on facial recognition from such major companies is a step forward, but there are also concerns that smaller companies like Clearview AI may step in to take their place. Some are also skeptical of the recent moves by tech companies, calling them PR stunts:</li>

<p><strong>From the Source:</strong></p>

<p>After the announcements from IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon, Microsoft’s president <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/06/18/tech/brad-smith-microsoft-facial-recognition/index.html">repeated the call</a> for federal regulation of facial recognition technology:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“We need to start teasing this issue apart, to understand it better and move just beyond a binary conversation of: permit it or ban it,” Smith said. “And think about: what is the right way to regulate it?”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The enthusiasm for IBM’s, Microsoft’s, and Amazon’s moves on facial recognition have been mixed.</li>
  <li>Adding to the worries are the existence of other companies peddling facial recognition technology, such as Clearview AI.</li>
  <li>While many see these announcements as a small step down a long road, they do see it as a step in the right direction.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="our-perspective"><strong>Our Perspective</strong></h2>

<p>Amazon and Microsoft have engaged in the same marketing of facial recognition that is being lambasted today. 
While Amazon’s contracts are already public knowledge, Microsoft was recently found to have <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2020/06/17/microsoft-dea-facial-recognition/">pitched its facial recognition technology to the Drug Enforcement Administration</a> (DEA) as far back as 2017. 
The recent announcements from IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon are a promising step forward in the fight against unfettered use of facial recognition technology, particularly in policing. 
There are strong arguments that due to the inherent difficulties in fairly implementing automation technology in law enforcement, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/09/technology/facial-recognition-software.html">police should be banned from using facial recognition altogether</a>. 
In addition, as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZjmlJPJgug">John Oliver</a> pointed out, development of facial recognition in and of itself has opened a Pandora’s Box that even some in Silicon Valley were too afraid to touch.</p>

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jZjmlJPJgug" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

<p>In particular, the following immediate issues remain:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Amazon is still engaged with the police in surveillance applications - Ring allegedly <a href="https://www.cnet.com/features/rings-work-with-police-lacks-solid-evidence-of-reducing-crime/">has partnered with over 1000 police departments in the US</a>.</li>
  <li>Even if Microsoft and Amazon decide to go as far as IBM has in the moral sense, the fact remains that companies like Clearview AI and Banjo continue to offer facial recognition services. As long as there are people who want to continue to use facial recognition for any purpose, its development will go on.</li>
  <li>Without substantive federal regulations on such technology, no one company (or three companies) will have much of an impact on the development and use of facial recognition technology and the associated risks.</li>
</ul>

<p>The current spotlight on the existing and potential abuses of face recognition technology is pressuring both industry leaders and governments to re-evaluate and re-imagine the future of face recognition. 
Congress is currently considering a police reform bill that limits face recognition in law enforcement. 
Many see this bill and the recent responses from tech companies as promising starting points. 
However, more pressure is needed to ensure fair and ethical uses of face recognition and other AI technologies with significant social impacts.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The moves by IBM, Microsoft, and Amazon to stop (or pause) development of face recognition technology, especially for law enforcement, at least until adequate federal regulations are in place, are promising starting points to ensure ethical uses of this technology. 
Although studies have revealed flaws in commercial face recognition systems for years, companies are only now taking action as a result of recent protests and the national conversation on racial discrimination and police brutality. 
This also suggests that continuous pressure from consumers, civil liberty groups, and the public at large is needed to ensure progress in the ethical development and regulation of face recognition technology.</p>

<p>And it’s crazy to think that we haven’t even scratched the surface of America…</p>



<p>Over the past week I’ve recapped the 17 days of my road trip that that took me and my girlfriend from the Pocono Mountains in northeastern Pennsylvania through the arid northern Arizona desert, to the Pacific Ocean and back. If you want to check out some pictures or need a little motivation to get out and take the trip of your lifetime, I recommend checking out <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/15/road-trip/">Part I</a> and <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/06/23/road-trip-2/">Part II</a>.</p>



<p>My goal with this post is not just to show and tell my experiences, but primarily to set proper expectations and to show you exactly how to get up off the couch, out of your cubicle, out of bed, away from the TV, and into a car (fuel efficient if possible) that will take you on a trip that you will never forget.</p>



<p>The following is based solely on my own experiences, so I cannot promise that it will optimize for your specific needs. What it will do is give you a framework from which to build your own plan.</p>



<h4><strong>Layers of the Onion</strong></h4>



<p>Planning an extended road trip is a lot like peeling the layers of an onion. The conventional road trip, during normal times, has layers and layers of decisions that could effect each subsequent layer of decisions:</p>



<ul><li>Choosing between an RV, your own car, and a rental.</li><li>Selecting your destination and which cities and towns to stop in.</li><li>Navigation—which routes will get you to where you want to go within the parameters of your goals.</li><li>Deciding how much time you have and how much you want to cram into the trip.</li><li>Accounting for the difference between how much money you are willing/able to spend, and how much it will actually cost.</li><li>Identifying all expenses and hidden costs that will make up your total expenditure: gas, food, rentals, parks passes, insurance, lodging, etc.</li><li>How to stay sane in the car for hours on end.</li><li>Technology—how to communicate, or even navigate in areas with absolutely no cell phone service.</li></ul>



<p>These are just some of the complexities you would expect in normal times. But these are no normal times. COVID-19 has added new layers of complexity to the road trip, while simultaneously removing others. Different states have different restrictions and different attitudes. National parks are either closed or limited. Many businesses are closed or operating within tight constraints. But places to stay are widely available at cheaper prices than normal. Gas prices are at 10-20 year lows. The roads are emptier than ever. And the air is cleaner than ever. What better time to take the trip of a lifetime?</p>



<p>If you have never done an extended road trip, all of this might seem intimidating and overwhelming to the point where it might not even feel worth doing such a trip. But I have good news: you don’t have to reinvent the wheel. Just use my experience as a guide and shape it to fit your own aspirations for the perfect road trip.</p>



<h4><strong>Part 1: Decide and Commit</strong></h4>



<p>Like building a business or any large undertaking, dreams of a cross-country road trip can vanish before they ever materialize. And almost always, our indecision and inaction is the culprit. There are a million and one reasons to delay or put it off. Don’t. Decide what you want and make an irreversible decision, <a href="https://joebalcom.blog/2020/05/02/forcing-function/">a forcing function, to keep you from talking yourself out of it</a>.</p>



<p>Like many of my adventures, I didn’t plan this road trip with a lot of lead time (started planning 5/25, left on 6/5). Sure, anticipation is half the fun, but it is also the source of all second-guessing. To eliminate that possibility, my girlfriend and I set a goal to drive from the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania to Page, AZ. I made a simple spreadsheet with the dates that we felt comfortable with (for quarantine purposes and other obligations that would follow) and made the most sense. More on this in the next step.</p>



<p>Page, AZ is a town that we have previously visited and enjoyed it enough that we decided to make it a primary destination. It served as a strategic base, as it is accessible to many of the Southwest’s best national parks and destinations. So I booked a place in Page for nine days. You will soon see how quickly plans change.</p>



<h4><strong>Part 2: Prioritize Structure So You’re Free to Play</strong></h4>



<p>Do not over plan. It will take the fun, the serendipity, and the wonder out of the whole experience. What you want to do is build constraints or safety nets that will allow you the freedom to do what you want while ensuring that you don’t overextend yourself. As you can see in the tables below, due to unforeseen circumstances, our original plan and our actual outcome differ drastically.</p>



<p>While in Page, we decided that we might as well go all the way to the coast. What is a cross country road trip without seeing the Pacific Ocean?? That forced us to sacrifice the last two nights in Page (lodging costs in Part 5), and book places in new cities. Personal experience had taught me not to book everything from the original plan, as I knew things were bound to change.</p>



<p>Imagine if we planned everything down to the smallest detail and booked every hotel! It would be a logistical mess, or at the very least, a duller road trip.</p>

<p>Create a structure that will give you an idea of what you have to work with. Timeframe, distance, destinations. Knowing these will give you a sufficient framework and the freedom to adjust on the fly.</p>



<h4><strong>Part 3: Preparations</strong></h4>



<p><strong>(Note: All costs are listed in Part 5)</strong></p>



<ul type="1"><li>Rent a car. If you don’t have an RV or don’t want to drive your own car, rent a fuel-efficient car from Enterprise (I have no financial stake in that recommendation!). The reason I recommend Enterprise is that they do not charge petty fees for out of state driving or for mileage like most of the other “cheaper” rental companies. You can drive 10 miles, or 10,000 miles and you will still be charged the same. Go to a small town rental location, as they will probably have cheaper options, and more availability.</li><li>Be mindful of your thirst for adventure. You don’t want to drive off-road on rocks and sand, or up steep mountains in a Smart Car. But you also don’t want to break the bank with the rental or at the gas pump. Find the right balance for your needs.</li><li>Insurance: this decision comes down to your toleration of risk. You typically don’t have to take the rental company’s insurance if you are covered under your own plan. But some form of insurance is required.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Pack only what you <strong>need</strong>. It is tempting to take everything you own for a three-week trip, but you will feel much freer by travelling lighter. Odds are you will only use half of what you bring anyway. Like how a messy desk creates feelings of anxiety and disorganization at work, a messy car will create the same for you on the road.</li><li>Unfortunately for us, we were already coming from a rental property in the Poconos, so in addition to our clothes and food, I had my kettlebell and pullup bar and other random bags taking up space. Not ideal for being stopped by border patrol, but we made it work.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Searching for towns/lodging. This is totally subjective, as people range from minimalist campers to those who need every comfort and accommodation. We mainly kept it to Airbnb and simple hotel searches. Prices were cheaper than normal, and hotels were cheaper than Airbnb on average. Other than for Page, we didn’t book anything further out than three days. In busier times, that might have to change. But we valued flexibility over all else.</li><li>Location depended largely on our interests, and our stomach for longer drives. A rule of thumb for a cross country trip would be to take your total distance and divide it by how many days you plan on driving. From that you will have an average daily distance, which will give you an idea of where to stay each night. For us, we did a 24-hour drive on the first night (2pm in PA to 12 noon the next day in Boulder), which allowed for more time in the western part of the country. On the way back, I simply divided 2800 miles by 4 days, which gave me 700 miles each day. We then chose our return stops based on that. We had a consistent average of 65-70mph on the …</li></ul></div></article></div>

<p>In 1995, Javascript was created <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://thenewstack.io/brendan-eich-on-creating-javascript-in-10-days-and-what-hed-do-differently-today/" target="_blank">within 10 days</a> by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/BrendanEich" target="_blank">Brendan Eich</a>. And at that time, Javascript was not designed to be fast. <strong>It’s basically for form validation and it’s slow like crazy.</strong> As time went by it got better.</p>



<p>In 2008, Google came out of nowhere and put on the table its new browser: Google Chrome. Inside Chrome was a Javascript engine called V8. <strong>And the revolution of V8 was the Just in Time (JIT) compilation of Javascript.</strong> This change from interpreted code to  JIT compilation monstrously accelerated the performance of Javascript, and thus of browsers in general. This speed was going to allow the birth of technology like NodeJS or Electron and the explosion of popularity of Javascript.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YHJMavH.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/YHJMavH.jpg" alt="webassembly"></figure>



<p>In 2015, WebAssembly is announced for the first time with a <a href="https://www.eteknix.com/gaming-in-your-browser-is-about-to-get-interesting-with-webassembly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">small demo of a game</a> running under Unity. The game runs directly in the browser!</p>



<p>In 2019, the W3C made WebAssembly a new web standard. Just as the V8 engine was in its day, <strong>WebAssembly is shaping up to be the new performance revolution</strong>. So WebAssembly is already here, and it’s off to a flying start.</p>



<h3>What is WebAssembly?</h3>



<p>WebAssembly, abbreviated to wasm, is a way to use non-Javascript code and run it in your browser. This code can be C, C++, Rust and many others. <strong>It will be compile and run in your browser at near native speed on your CPU.</strong> This code is in the form of a binary file that you can use directly from Javascript as a module.</p>



<p><strong>WebAssembly is not there to replace Javascript</strong>. On the contrary, these two technologies are made to work together. By using the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly/Using_the_JavaScript_API" target="_blank">Javascript API</a> you can load WebAssembly modules into your page. This means that you can take advantage of the performance of compiled code via WebAssembly with the flexibility of Javascript.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/gbBMTTf.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/gbBMTTf.jpg" alt="internet"></figure></div>



<p>The name WebAssembly is a bit misleading. <strong>WebAssembly does indeed work for the Web, but it is not limited to it!</strong> The team that made WebAssembly has gone to a lot of trouble to make it generic so that it can be used everywhere. We’re starting to see <a href="https://github.com/wasmerio/wasmer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">examples of this</a>.</p>



<p>Also, there’s a misconception that comes up all the time. <strong>WebAssembly is not a programming language.</strong> WebAssembly is an intermediate format, a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bytecode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bytecode</a>, which acts as a compilation target for other languages. Okay, it’s not clear, let’s make some drawings.</p>



<h3>How does it work?</h3>



<div><figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/EHwFHv0.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/EHwFHv0.jpg" alt="webassembly"></figure></div>



<p>Did you see that? Another work of art. Do you believe me if I tell you I use Photoshop? Anyway !</p>



<ul><li><strong>Step 1</strong> : It’s you and your developer skills. <strong>You produce source code in C, C++</strong> (you can use others languages). This code is supposed to fix a problem or make a process too intensive for Javascript in the browser.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Step 2 </strong>: you will use <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://emscripten.org/index.html" target="_blank">Emscripten</a> to do the translation. <strong>Emscripten is a tool chain, built with <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM" target="_blank">LLVM</a>, that will compile your source code into WebAssembly</strong>. You can install it and compile whatever you want <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://webassembly.org/getting-started/developers-guide/" target="_blank">in a few quick steps</a>, we’ll look at it later. At the end of this step, you will have a WASM file.</li></ul>



<ul><li><strong>Step 3</strong> : You will use the WASM file on your web page. <strong>If you come from the future, you can load this file like any ES6 module.</strong> Right now, the usage is slightly more complex, but nothing fancy.</li></ul>



<p>OK, let’s get our hands dirty.</p>



<h3>Show me the code</h3>



<p>First of all, we need a small piece of C++ code to compile. Where some people will offer you the whole <a href="https://d07riv.github.io/diabloweb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Diablo 1  game in the browser</a> as an example, <strong>I’ll keep it simple with a function that adds two digits</strong>. We’re not going to prove the speed of C++ with that, it’s for the example.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="cpp" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">int add(int firstNumber, int secondNumber) {
  return firstNumber + secondNumber;
}</pre>



<p>Then go to the Linux distribution of your choice. We will start by downloading and installing emscripten.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group=""># installing dependencies (yes, you can use newer version of python)
sudo apt-get install python2.7 git

# gettin emscripten via a git clone.
git clone https://github.com/emscripten-core/emsdk.git

# downloading, installing and activating the sdk
cd emsdk
./emsdk install latest
./emsdk activate latestl
source ./emsdk_env.sh

# make sure the installation worked
emcc --version

# compiling the c++ file to a webassembly template
emcc helloWebassembly.cpp -s WASM=1 -o helloWebassembly.html

# we serve the HTML and look at the result
emrun helloWebassembly.html</pre>



<p>That was the hackerman way of doing the wasm. There’s a simpler way. </p>



<p>You can go to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://mbebenita.github.io/WasmExplorer/" target="_blank">this site</a> and put your C++ code on the left. Then you get the name of the exported function in the WAT part. <strong>Using the add function code showed before i got : “_Z3addii” as function name, we’ll use that just after</strong>. You just have to click on download and you will get your WASM file back. Easy !</p>



<p><strong>Now we can make WebAssembly work directly in the browser without all the annoying noise around.</strong> </p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="generic" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;head&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;WASM test&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="/stylesheets/style.css" /&gt;
  &lt;/head&gt;

  &lt;body&gt;
    &lt;script&gt;
      const getRandomNumber = () =&gt; Math.floor(Math.random() * 10000);

      WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(
        fetch("https://012q1.sse.codesandbox.io/wasm/add.wasm")
      )
        .then(obj =&gt; obj.instance.exports._Z3addii)
        .then(add =&gt; {
          document.getElementById("addTarget").textContent = add(
            getRandomNumber(),
            getRandomNumber()
          );
        });
    &lt;/script&gt;

    &lt;h1&gt;Résultat du C++&lt;/h1&gt;
    &lt;p id="addTarget"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</pre>



<p>This is it. This html web page allows you to use C++ compiled into WebAssembly ! I skip all the HTML and obvious stuff to go directly to line 11 with the <strong>InstantiateStreaming </strong>function. As the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Objets_globaux/WebAssembly/instantiateStreaming" target="_blank">Mozilla documentation</a> says, this function allows you to compile and instantiate our WebAssembly module via a simple fetch.</p>



<p>Then, I use the add function via the function name we retrieved earlier and use it to replace a piece of DOM. And voila ! <strong>C++ via Javascript inside your browser.</strong> How crazy is that? Look, I even made you a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://codesandbox.io/s/webassembly-en-5-minutes-012q1?fontsize=14&amp;hidenavigation=1&amp;module=%2Fpublic%2Findex.html&amp;theme=dark" target="_blank">codesandbox</a> with a working demo. I’m embedding it right here, play with it !</p>







<p>You’re gonna tell me it’s complicated just to do this, and you’re right. <strong>They’re working to replace the instantiation javascript bit with a simple import into the future.</strong> So be patient, it’s coming. </p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4FjTgL7.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/4FjTgL7.jpg" alt="fast"></figure>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>We’ve already been talking for five minutes, so I’ll stop here. If you want to know more about WebAssembly and you have time in front of you : i<strong> recommend this <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.javascriptjanuary.com/blog/webassembly-neither-web-nor-assembly-but-revolutionary" target="_blank">excellent article</a> to go deeper in the subject.</strong> For the rest of the story, I’m looking forward to what this opening of the Web to other languages will bring. There’s a lot of potential and i can’t wait for the web to get even faster !</p>

		<p>My 10 Year Game Development Journey</p>
		<h4>June 24, 2020</h4>
        <hr>
	
		<p>Hello! My name is Nico Tuason and I'm an indie game developer from the Philippines. This year marks the 10th year of my game development journey. I'd like to share my entire story with you - my failures, triumphs, and major life events. I hope it will be worth your time.</p>
		<h2>2010 - A Leap of Faith</h2>
		<p>At the start of the decade, I was 23 years old and had just left my job at a local web development company. I had been working there for a year and was making about <strong>22,000 PHP</strong> or <strong>440 USD</strong> a month. The pay was not bad for a fresh grad, but I was unproductive and unhappy. Additionally, my girlfriend of 4 years was dropping plenty of hints of her desire to get married, and 20k pesos just wasn't going to cut it.</p>
		<p>Being Asian (Filipinos are Asian too!) it was not acceptable for my parents that I was not either working or studying, so I applied for a post-grad Multimedia course in Singapore. Little did my parents know, shortly after applying I had received a rejection letter. I would keep telling them that "my application was pending", because I was secretly working on a passion project - my first game.</p>
		<p>To me, video games were more than a fun past-time. They were my refuge during hard and lonely times growing up. I spent almost all my free time playing games on the family PC. One of the first video games I ever received was Star Wars Rebel Assault II, a short but cinematic game. I played through it on every difficulty multiple times. After that, my parents bought me Command and Conquer and my fate was sealed. Growing up, I spent all my money on upgrading the family PC and buying boxed copies of games.</p>
		<p>Being in web development, I learned to use Flash to create banner ads and menu navigation for our clients. Out of necessity, I also had to learn how to create attractive UI and graphic design. While researching, I stumbled across a website called FGL.com (Flash Game License) that allowed anyone in the world to upload a Flash game and have sponsor websites bid on the right to put their logo on the game. They showed what some of the games were bidding for - <strong>3000 USD</strong>,  <strong>5000 USD</strong>! To me this looked like an incredible amount of money. There were even some mythical games going for <strong>10,000 - 20,000 USD</strong>! I devoured all the tutorials I could find. Before I had an idea for a game, I wanted to see if I could do a basic animation.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/male1_walk_side.gif"></p><p>My first animation</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>It looked good! But I knew I wanted to make a game in the isometric perspective. I had fallen in love with classic isometric RPGs like Baldur's Gate, and I was sure that any game I made had to be in isometric view. So, I repeated the animation but from different angles.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/male1_sheet.gif"></p><p>My first spritesheet</p>
		</div>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/iso_walk.gif"></p><p>Resulting animation</p>
		</div>

		<p>The next step was to see if it actually looked good moving around a surface.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/walk_test1.gif"></p><p>Yes!</p>
		</div>

		
		<p>I didn't know any game math, but I knew from tutorials that in an isometric perspective, a square is twice as wide as it is tall. So, any movement along the y-axis had to be halved. This made for a very simple isometric transform:</p>
		<div>
		<p>screen_x = x;</p>
		<p>screen_y = y*0.5;</p>
		</div>
		<p>Ok, after I got the basics down, It was time for a stress test.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/walk_test2.gif"></p><p>Stress me out</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>By now I was waking up at 6am and jumping right into the computer to make more sprite sheets. It was intoxicating. Every day I felt a step closer to realizing my dream of making a game.</p>
		<p>I did a bunch more tests and I found the fastest way to draw stuff on screen using Flash was to use a method called "copyPixels". The tutorials called it "bitmap blitting" but I only cared that it was super fast. Most flash games those days used Vector graphics - very sharp and smooth shapes. This was a huge burden on CPUs around the world (and eventually led to Flash's demise), but by using copyPixels my game could have way more stuff onscreen than other Flash games.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/walk_test3.gif"></p><p>Walk all over me</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Ok, the tech looked good, so it was time to start thinking about what kind of game this was going to be. At the time, tower defense was a very popular genre, and I loved RTS games. I decided that the simplest route was to make a bunch of enemies walk in one direction while you try to stop them, with lasers. Taking heavy influence from Starship Troopers and Starcraft, I created a suitable enemy that you could have fun slaughtering by the hundreds.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/walk_test4.gif"></p><p>Blizzard dont sue pls</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>I kept developing the game like this, working on one thing at a time and making sure it was acceptable before moving on to the next thing. If I don't stop myself, I could probably talk about every little detail that went into making the game, but we still have a long way to go.</p>
		<p><strong>7 months later...</strong></p>
		<p>I had a small but complete game on my hands. I called it "Desert Moon".</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/desert_moon.gif"></p><p>C'mon you apes, you wanna live forever!?</p>
		</div>

		
		<p>It was time to put the game up for bidding. I uploaded the game to FGL.com and proceeded to not sleep for the next few days. I wish I took more screenshots of this process. I think at the time the bidding period lasted 1 month. After many tens-of-thousands of "reload page" clicks later, there was finally a winning bid. It was <strong>8500 USD</strong>! I don't know how to describe how I felt, but my head must have grown very large. I showed my girlfriend and my parents, the latter finally accepting that I wasn't going to grad school.</p>
		<p>My girlfriend, Terry, also loved Tower Defense games and she was the main play-tester during development. This was a very happy time for us.</p>
		<p>All I had to do was slap the Sponsor's logo onto the game and we could release it to the world.</p>


		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/maxgames_intro.gif"></p><p>Thank you business daddy!</p>
		</div>

		<p>The game launched on the major Flash game portals (Kongregate, Newgrounds, Armorgames, etc.) on December 11, 2010, and thus began my gamedev career.</p>
		


		<h2>2011 - Indie to Employee</h2>
		<p>Flash games are free, so once a game is out there's not much you can do to make more money besides make another game. It takes a while before securing a sponsor and the game finally being released so I immediately started on another game called "Solarmax".</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/solarmax_test.gif"></p><p>First prototype</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>One of my favorite games of all time is Homeworld. There's just nothing like the epic feeling of the fate of your entire race, your entire <em>history</em>, resting on your shoulders. I couldn't do anything near a 3D RTS like Homeworld, but there was a popular genre of Flash game called "Swarm" defense / strategy. I think Phage Wars was the most popular of these. I thought it would work well translated into epic space battles.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/solarmax.gif"></p><p>Scientifically accurate depiction of orbital mechanics</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>I spent some time learning 3D modeling software for this game. I was quite tired of pixel art after doing all the spritesheets for Desert Moon and exporting 3D models as a png sequence seemed like a good way to get all the angles needed for an isometric perspective without having to manually draw every frame.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/solarmaxb.gif"></p><p>pew pew!</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>The game was completed in 3 months, much faster than my first project! I was able to get it sponsored for <strong>6000 USD</strong>. A bit less than before, but it was a "non-exclusive" sponsorship meaning I could still sell "sitelocked" versions of the game. This was a common practice back then of having 1 version that would spread to all the portals, and many "sitelocked" versions that had a different site's branding but could only be played on their site.</p>
		<p>I planned to keep building small games like this as my skills grew, but then something unexpected happened. I got a job!</p>
		<p>I got an email from the CEO of a tech company in the U.S. who had seen my games and was looking for a flash programmer for a game they were making. Who knew CEOs were randomly playing flash games and emailing the developer?</p>
		<p>My first response was actually to decline the offer, because number 1 - I'm a dunce, and number 2 - I thought I could just make small flash games forever. Luckily this guy was persistent and I would still get to work on Flash games, but with more team members! And and... they were going to fly me out to the States to attend <strong>GDC</strong>!!!</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/gdc1.jpg"></p><p>I'm in GDC!</p>
		</div>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/gdc2.jpg"></p><p>I'm in San Francisco!</p>
		</div>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/gdc4.jpg"></p><p>Another time, baby</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>I'm so grateful to the people who made this happen! As a young game dev, going to GDC is like going to see the Vatican if you're ultra-Catholic. I was over the moon.</p>
		<p>Plus, the salary... it was <strong>3000 USD</strong> a month! A U.S.-based salary for someone living in the Philippines! I have to tell you, I really thought I was hot shit at the time.</p>
		<p>After I got my first paycheck, I proposed to my girlfriend Terry, who I was sure would say yes because the year before her lawyer-auntie cornered me and demanded a deposition on why I had not married her niece yet.</p>
		<p>Things were going great!</p>



		<h2>2012 - Life... finds a way</h2>
		<p>In January, Terry and I got married! I was imagining that the next few years would be just the two of us, traveling together to different countries... making up for all the times we weren't allowed to travel together because the Philippines is a conservative country and it would be scandalous.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/wedding.jpg"></p><p>Our wedding Jeepney</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Instead, 9 months later we had our first child! Which is great too I guess haha... ha.</p>

		<div><p><img src="http://nicotuason.com/img/10years/andres.jpg"></p><p>Yup, that's a baby alright</p>
		</div>
		
		<p>Becoming a dad mostly just means that a full-night's sleep is a thing of the past, at least in the beginning. I was working from home anyway so the arrangement was very doable.</p>
		<p>Meanwhile, work as an employee started out great and we produced lots of small games in a short time frame. Over the months though things started to drag. I felt myself becoming less and less productive. I missed the feeling of always learning something new and putting what I learned into a game. Maybe I'm just a bad employee?</p>

<p><strong>Protocol Buffers</strong>  or <strong>“Protobufs”</strong> is a term often thrown around the rooms of big tech companies when designing <a href="https://systems-analysis.net/application/definition.html">application systems</a>. Application systems can contain hundreds of thousands of machines all communicating with each other. At that scale, many companies try to optimize in any way possible—Protocol Buffers is tool you can use to send data between your applications at high speeds. </p>
<p>In this article, I’ll be shedding some light on protocol buffers and showing you how to use it!</p>
<p>Protobufs are often paired with gRPCs (<a href="https://grpc.io/">Remote Procedure Calls</a>), which are a topic of its own. I’ll try to cover it in a few weeks.</p>

        <p>What would you take your data on?</p>
</div>
<h2 id="the-gist">The Gist</h2>
<p>Protobufs is an <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/670630/what-is-idl">interface definition language</a> and <a href="https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communication_protocol">communication protocol</a> used to build applications and transport data between them. Protobufs accomplishes this by enforcing a common data structure in the sections of code where data will be transmitted between applications. These data structures are defined in <code>.proto</code> files. A commandline tool, <code>protoc</code>, uses those <code>.proto</code> files to generate class files that are used to write your applications. </p>
<p>These classes come with a few helper functions that can convert data defined in a class to binaries--which then is used to transmit data between two servers. </p>
<p>Protobufs can be compared to JSON, the two differences are:</p>
<ol>
<li>You need to pre-define how your structure looks like in <code>.proto</code> files</li>
<li>The data stored in protobufs are modified by helper functions provided by the autogenerated classes from those <code>.proto</code> files</li>
</ol>
<p>Any time you transmit JSON between two servers; you could replace that with a protobuf binary instead. Sending data via protobuf binaries can offer performance improvements in faster download times between 4 to 78% depending on the situation (I discuss more in Tradeoffs and Benefits).</p>
<p>In my mind, there are two processes when developing with protobufs: the development process and the implementation process. The development process deals with creating and managing protobufs. The implementation process is the use of protobuf classes to build our applications/servers/services.</p>

    <p>The development process, visualized</p>
</div>
<p>Let's look at these processes by example. Let's say we're developing an application that returns us a list of customers our company has. </p>
<p>Our development process looks like the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>A developer writes some data structures called <code>CustomerList</code> and <code>Customer</code> in a <code>customerlist.proto</code> file</li>
<li>A command line tool that comes with the protobuf library, called <code>protoc</code>, reads <code>.proto</code> files and generates classes in the programming langauge of the developer's choice.</li>
<li>The developer commits the <code>.proto</code> and generated code into their codebase</li>
<li>If any changes are needed to that datastructure, we start again at step one.</li>
</ol>
<p>The generated code in our case is the classes <code>CustomerList</code> and <code>Customer</code>. We can now use these classes to build out application. </p>
<p>When the time comes to send data between two systems, we can invoke a helper function that's attached to these classes to convert our Class data into a string. An invoked REST/gRPC/etc call passes this data to another service. Our listener on our other service can then use the same classes to deserialize the string back into language readable data.</p>

    </picture>
    <p>Let's build something like this!</p>
</div>
<p>Let’s build a system that transports a list of customers from our python application server to a Node.js webserver and shows us that list on a table.</p>
<p>This application is a bit complicated, so I have provided a Github link below for you to follow along:<br>
<a href="https://github.com/4shub/protobufs-example">https://github.com/4shub/protobufs-example</a></p>
<p>The file structure of our application should look like the following:</p>
<pre><code>// @language-override:Our folder
application_root
|_src
   |_ generated
   |_ protos</code></pre>
<p>First let’s build a <code>customerlist.proto</code> in <code>src/protos</code>:</p>
<pre><code>// @language-override:proto3
syntax = "proto3";

message Customer {
  required string name = 1;
  required int32 id = 2;
  required string email = 3; 
  required bool isNewCustomer = 4;
}

message CustomerList {
  repeated Customer customer = 1;
}</code></pre>
<p>Above I created our data structure following the <a href="https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/docs/proto3">proto3 language</a>. </p>
<p>Then we need to run following command in our application root:</p>
<pre><code>// @language-override:Terminal
protoc --python_out=src/generated --js_out=import_style=commonjs,binary:src/generated src/protos/customerlist.proto -I src/protos</code></pre>
<p>This command will generate our classes in files named <code>customerlist_pb.py</code> and <code>customerlist_pb.js</code> in a folder called <code>generated</code>.</p>
<p>Now let’s build our python server</p>
<pre><code># @language-override:Python + Flask
import flask
from generated import customerlist_pb2

app = flask.Flask(__name__)

# creating our "database"
customer1 = customerlist_pb2.Customer(name='Shubham', id=0, email='<a href="https://docs.shub.club/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="f98a918c9bb98a918c9bd79a958c9b">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>')
customer2 = customerlist_pb2.Customer(name='Rui', id=1, email='<a href="https://docs.shub.club/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" data-cfemail="d8aaadb198acb7b7f6bbb7b5">[email&nbsp;protected]</a>', isNewCustomer=True)

customer_list = customerlist_pb2.CustomerList()
customer_list.customer.append(customer1)
customer_list.customer.append(customer2)


@app.route('/customer-list')
def get_customer_list():
    # `SerializeToString` is a helper function that serializes customer_list to a binary format
    return customer_list.SerializeToString()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=3001)</code></pre>
<p>In the code above, I instantiate the class <code>CustomerList</code> and populate it with some customer data. Then I convert that data into a protobuf binary and pass it anyone who requests <code>/customer-list</code>.</p>
<p>Our node server will act as our receiving server, it will host a html page that would contain a button that requests us the customer list stored on the python server. The node.js server will make the request on behalf of the client to get that data.</p>
<pre><code>// @language-override:Node.js + Express
const path = require('path');
const axios = require('axios');
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

const { CustomerList } = require('./generated/customerlist_pb');
const PYTHON_SERVER_URL = 'http://localhost:3001';

app.get('/customers', async (req, res) =&gt; {
    try {
        const binaryData = await axios.get(`${PYTHON_SERVER_URL}/customer-list`);

        // convert string to base64 to be read by `deserializeBinary`
        const base64data = Buffer.from(binaryData.data).toString('base64')

        const customerList = CustomerList.deserializeBinary(base64data)

        // convert to json
        res.send(customerList.toObject());
    } catch (e) {
        console.log(e)
        res.send(404);
    }
});

app.get('/', (req, res) =&gt; res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, './index.html')));

app.listen(port, () =&gt; console.log(`Example app listening at http://localhost:${port}`))</code></pre>
<p>We see <code>CustomerList</code>'s helper function <code>deserializeBinary</code> converting our binary string into a workable <code>CustomerList</code> class object. We use <code>toObject</code> to convert our class data into a JSON. We finally pass the JSON to the client.</p>
<h2 id="tradeoffs-and-benefits">Tradeoffs and Benefits</h2>
<p><strong>Not everything you build requires protobufs!</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes it’s easier and more efficient to not deal with sophisticated methods over sending data. In a study by Auth0 [0], where they compared JSON vs protobuf binary performance, Protobufs significantly improved data transmission rates from java server to java server communication (78% download time reduction), while java server to client communication had only a 4% download time reduction. </p>
<p>Auth0 also did a second test from a java server to the client in an “uncompressed” environment. Download time was improved by 21%. Using this information, if your goal is just to enhance performance, it's much better just to compress your JSON data and forget implementing protobufs.</p>
<p>Outside optimizations, protobufs provides a method of documenting and enforcing a data structure. This is super useful with keeping data consistent across multiple programming languages and multiple teams. </p>
<p>What do tradeoffs and benefits mean for you, the developer? It means that sometimes a tool you could use in one part of your application system might not be useful elsewhere. Or it could mean that maybe the additional development time to enforce protobufs on your whole application is worth it. In the end, it's up to you as a developer to see if a solution is viable for your product or use-case. </p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Building an application ecosystem can be daunting, but with protobufs in your toolkit you can optimize your networking capacity to its full potential. Companies like Square, Google and Netflix use it every day in their systems. Maybe you can try and build something cool with it too. As always, let me know what you’ve built with protobufs.</p>

You're not alone.</h2><p>After advising hundreds of CTOs - I noticed a set of questions that consistently came up. They seem simple at face value but in reality they are some of the hardest questions to answer as an engineering leader.</p><p>‍</p><h2>Common Questions:</h2><ol role="list"><li>Are we getting better?</li><li>Where can we improve?</li><li>Are we even good at all?</li></ol><p>‍</p><p>As a manager it can be incredibly frustrating to not have the answers to these questions - &nbsp;even more so when you have to answer to outside stakeholders.</p><p>We often rely on trust and culture - but even in the best cases these questions largely go unanswered.

Half baked metrics can ruin teams, destroy culture and make developers live miserable.

What about a super high velocity count? Probably not. You're probably imagining a team that's responsive to one another, collaborating effectively, and has a really efficient process - and the metrics you use should reflect that.</p><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><h2>Measure what matters - Process Metrics</h2><p>Use software development metrics that enable productivity. </p><p>‍</p><p>Measuring <strong>responsiveness, collaboration, and process</strong> allows the team to improve how they work together. What's great about process metrics is - as developers - we really care about this stuff. They directly impact our day to day and allow us to improve while having concrete numbers to show our organization.</p><p>‍</p><p>When we measure process we drive productivity - ultimately giving leaders quantitative ways to express improvement while enabling developers to drive meaningful change in their day-to-day experience.</p><p>‍</p><h3><em>"Process metrics enhance culture.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>An interesting essay caught my eye today at HN about how <a href="https://secondbreakfast.co/google-blew-a-ten-year-lead">google blew a 10 years lead </a> , mostly in services. The essay described how most services that were the peak of innovation 10 years ago have subsequently stood stagnant and lost their technology edge to small companies. </p> <p>Gmail is less innovative than HEY (and superhuman and many others). Google docs is not as good as Notion for knowledge sharing and collaboration. And the list goes on. </p> <p>Initially, I thought it was because Google targets only big business customers, competing with Microsoft 365. Other product innovations do not scare them, they still offer a package with mail, video conferencing, docs, sheets, drive, etc. This is great for big business collaboration tools. Competitors like Notion and HEY are too small for Google business to care. </p> <p>Docs, sheets, drive, mail are all products targeted at corporate collaboration. These are directly competing with Microsoft alone. What about Google Cloud? What about Android? What happened there? </p> <p>Google consistently follows the market preventing its competitors from achieving market control. And in Google's case, "the market" is Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and Facebook. </p> <img alt="google logo" src="https://snir.dev/blog/google-10-years-lead/google.png"> <p>We'll start with Microsoft since they were the first. And beating them down took place ~10 years ago, that's why it seems like the tech from back then never progressed much. Because the hit had already struck. </p> <p>Microsoft dominated the corporate world with its mail software Outlook, and with its Office suite, Word, Excel, etc. Google is native to the web and they leveraged their position to slowly hit Microsoft in this spot. Gmail first, then Google Drive, and then Chrome to kill IE as a final strike. And it was successful. </p> <p>Amazon got big into the tech business through AWS. Google brought Google Cloud to the fight. The offering is no only cheaper, it also provides technologies that can't be explained any other way than as a way to hit AWS. Kubernetes as an open platform is against any business textbook rukes to lock in customers. But it will allow for an easy way out of AWS in the long run, preferably to GCP, but it can be any other cloud provider that provides Kubernetes service as well. It is strategically more of a hit to the front runner, Amazon, than a benefit to GCP. </p> <p>Google's first priority is to hit the front runner, then everything else. This can also be seen with the Apple case. Android came after the iPhone. It has a much larger market share, and yet, generates far less revenue to Google than the iPhone is to Apple. That's because the main goal is to prevent Apple from winning the market. And in that, it is successful. </p> <p>Google Buzz. Ouch. Google Plus. Double ouch. Google spent so much effort into hitting Facebook as hard as they can. They were not succeful here, but from the history of things it is obvious how Google try to hit Facebook. They did not try to create a new social platform, no. Otherwise they would come up with something that is not.. well, exactly like facebook. </p> <p>Google home initially released at 2016. Amazon Alexa in 2014.</p> <p>I have so many more examples that comes to mind as I write, but the point is already clear. </p> <p>On a final note, I'll say, Google is not only trying to bend down competitors. Google Glass is one new product market they tried to create. The self-driving cars initiative is another example the comes to mind. They do innovate. </p> <p>They just have so much money, blocking out other big tech companies is a strategy they are not willing to give up. And when this is the strategy, well, Google sheets already took a huge chunk from Microsoft, what more does it need? </p> <form action="https://snir.substack.com/api/v1/free?nojs=true" method="post" min-width="400 500 600 700 800"> <div data-style="minimal">  <ul data-element="errors" data-group="alert"></ul>  <p>I wont send you spam.

<p>You can also find me on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/CaptainProton42">@CaptainProton</a> and on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/captainproton42">u/CaptainProton42</a>.</p>

<p>Below you will find a step-by-step explanation of the implementation.</p>

<h2 id="how-i-did-this">How I did this</h2>

<p>My implementation uses a finite-differencing method in order to solve the wave equation on a grid. I used the paper <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221314832_Real-Time_Open_Water_Environments_with_Interacting_Objects">Real-Time Open Water Environments with Interacting Objects</a> by H. Cords and O. Staadt as a reference. If you want to know more about the technical aspects of this implementation or more advanced techniques like infinite water, it’s a really good read.</p>

<h3 id="the-wave-equation">The wave equation</h3>

<p>A very important equation in phyiscs is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation">wave equation</a>. It describes the propagation of many types of waves like water waves, sound waves, and even light. It therefore plays a large role in many fields of physics like fluid dynamics, acoustics, and optics. We can use it to describe the behaviour of our waves as well.</p>

<p>The equation itself is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperbolic_partial_differential_equation">hyperbolic partial differential equation of second order</a>. If this sounds very complex, don’t worry, the equation itself is actually quite short:</p>



<p>Here,  is the current time,  is the position on the water surface and  is the wave speed.  then denotes the displacement, that is the height, of the water surface at position  and time .</p>

<p>The opertator  is the so-called Laplace operator and denotes the sum of the second spatial derivatives in every direction:</p>



<p>Thus we can see that the wave equation connects the second spatial derivates of the wave height with its second derivative in time. This property results in the motion of waves as we would observe it in nature.</p>

<h3 id="the-finite-difference-method">The finite difference method</h3>

<p>So now that we know what equation we want to solve we still have to figure out how to obtain a solution. Generally, this cannot be done analytically so we resort to a very popular numerical method: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference_method">the finite difference method</a>. In this method, we discretise the area in which we want to solve our equation into a grid. We then determina an approximate solution at each point of that grid.</p>

<p>Since we are discretising the water surface, we need to discretise the wave equation as well. For this, we use <em>stencils</em>. More specifically, a <em>five point stencil</em> for the Laplace operator and a <em>three point stencil</em> for the second derivative in time.</p>

<p>Let’s start with the Laplace operator: As previously stated, we dicretise the water surface as a grid. Let’s denote  as the value of the function  at the grid coordinates . Using a <em>five point stencil</em>, we can then <em>approximate</em> the derivative at that point as</p>



<p>where  is the distance between two grid points which is assumed to be equal in  and  direction. So, in order get the second spatial derivative at point  we need to sample all direct (non-diagonal) neighbours of that point (see the figure below).</p>

<p><img width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaptainProton42/DynamicWaterDemo/media/stencil.png"></p>

<p>However, the wave equation also contains a second time derivative which we need to discretise as well. For the time discretisation, we simply use the physics process delta time  (which is constant in Godot). We use the upper index  to denote the point in time. The complete notation is  for the displacement at grid coordinates  and time . In order to now approximate the second time derivate, we can just use the following three-point-stencil:</p>



<p>Now that we have dicretized both derivatives, let’s just plug them back into the initial wave equation and solve for :</p>



<p>where we introduce . In order to obtain a stable simulation,  needs to hold true. We thus have some limits on our choice of $\Delta t$ and $h$, depending on how fast our waves should propagate. Grids with less points (and thus large ) are generally more stable but also less accurate. It is desirable to keep  as small as reasonably possible which means high framerates will benefit our simulation.</p>

<p><strong>Let’s break down the final equation:</strong> In order to update and retreive , we need to know the grid neighbouring grid values at time  as well as the previous displacement values at time  and . We can start our grid from any arbitrary initial conditions and let it evolve over time.</p>

<p>Now that we know the theory, let’s get to the actual implementation.</p>

<h3 id="implementation-of-the-finite-difference-method">Implementation of the finite difference method</h3>

<p>In order to bring the finite difference method to life, we use fragment shaders. Textures are basically just two-dimensional grids that can hold values (colors) at each grid point (pixel). We make use of this convenient property and simply use a texture as the grid for our finite difference method.</p>

<p>In the editor, we create a new viewport called <code>SimulationViewport</code>. This viewport in return contains a <code>ColorRect</code> as shown below.</p>

<p><img width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaptainProton42/DynamicWaterDemo/media/implementation.PNG"></p>

<p>We then apply a shader to the <code>ColorRect</code> which contains the simulation code. The size (in pixels) of the <code>ColorRect</code> thus defines the size of the simulation grid. Two textures are passed as uniforms to this shader: <code>z_tex</code> which holds the grid values  and <code>z_old_tex</code> which holds the grid values . The resulting values  are then rendered to the <code>ColorRect</code> by the fragment shader. In order to retreive the current grid values, we can then simply retreive the contents of <code>SimulationViewport</code> with a <code>ViewportTexture</code>.</p>

<p>The snippet below contains the part of the simulation shader assigned to <code>ColorRect</code> which does the heavy lifting:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>void fragment() {
    float pix_size = 1.0f/grid_points;

    vec4 z = a * (texture(z_tex, UV + vec2(pix_size, 0.0f))
                  + texture(z_tex, UV - vec2(pix_size, 0.0f))
		  + texture(z_tex, UV + vec2(0.0f, pix_size)) 
		  + texture(z_tex, UV - vec2(0.0f, pix_size)))
	     + (2.0f - 4.0f * a) * (texture(z_tex, UV))
	     - (texture(old_z_tex, UV));

    float z_new_pos = z.r; // positive waves are stored in the red channel
    float z_new_neg = z.g; // negative waves are stored in the green channel

    ...

    COLOR.r = z_new_pos;
    COLOR.g = z_new_neg;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><em>Note that we store “positive” waves in the red and “negative” waves in the green channel. This is not particularly important now and we will explain it later on.</em></p>

<p>You can see that we first read the neighbouring grid values as well as the current and last values at the grid position and then combine them according to our formula. The resulting value is then assigned to <code>COLOR</code>.</p>

<p><code>a</code> can be se at initialisation of the scene as a <code>uniform</code> since the physics frame rate is constant.</p>

<p>We also need a script that updates the simulation as well as grid textures each step. This is done in a script assigned to the <code>Water</code> Node. <code>_update</code> is called each physics frame:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>func _update():
    ...
    update_height_map()

    # Render one frame of the simulation viewport to update the simulation
    simulation_viewport.render_target_update_mode = Viewport.UPDATE_ONCE

    # Wait until the frame is rendered
    yield(get_tree(), "idle_frame")
    ...

func update_height_map():
    # Update the height maps
    var img = simulation_texture.get_data() # Get currently rendered map
    # Set current map as old map
    var old_height_map = simulation_material.get_shader_param("z_tex")
    simulation_material.get_shader_param("old_z_tex") \
        .set_data(old_height_map.get_data())
    # Set the current height map from current render
    simulation_material.get_shader_param("z_tex").set_data(img)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And that’s it for our basic simulation. We now know how to propagate waves along the surface but have yet to create them.</p>

<h3 id="creating-waves">Creating waves</h3>

<p>When considering a boat moving through water, we need to be aware of two “types” of waves, <em>bow</em> waves and <em>stern</em> waves. Bow waves are created were the the boat’s hull pushes away the water. Stern waves, on the other hand, are created behind the boat, where water is rushing back to fill the space the boat previously occupied. We thus create <em>positive</em> bow waves in front of the boat and <em>negative</em> stern waves behind the boat. Creating positive or negative waves just means manually setting grid points to positive or negative values.</p>

<p>The intensity of both creatd wave types will also depend on the speed of the boat: The faster the boat, the higher the waves.</p>

<p>In order to create waves we first need to know <em>where</em> to create them. We thus need to know the intersection of the boat’s hull with the water surface.</p>

<p>We use a little trick to accomplish this:</p>

<p>Let’s create a second viewport called <code>CollisionViewport</code>. This viewport will hold the texture which contains the intersection areas of all objects with the surface.</p>

<p>We then add a new camera called <code>CollisionCamera</code> to <code>CollisionViewport</code>. This camera uses on orthogonal projection and has its size set to that of the water surface. The near plane is set to match the water surface and the far plane should be moved sufficiently far away, as shown below.</p>

<p><img width="75%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaptainProton42/DynamicWaterDemo/media/viewing_frustum.png"></p>

<p>Next, we add an additional mesh to every node that should be able to create waves and call it <code>CollisionMesh</code>. This mesh defines the hull of our boat.</p>

<p><img width="30%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CaptainProton42/DynamicWaterDemo/media/collision_mesh.png"></p>

<p>This mesh has a special material which consists of two passes: The first one is a <code>ShaderMaterial</code> with a shader <code>collision.shader</code> that looks like this (this can also be done with a <code>SpatialMaterial</code> but I find this variant to be more verbose):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>shader_type spatial;

uniform float speed;

render_mode cull_front;

void fragment() {
    ALBEDO.r = speed;
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The second pass is just a <code>SpatialMaterial</code> with albedo set to black and a <em>higher</em> render priority (so that front faces are drawn in front of back faces).</p>

<p>The resulting material will draw the <em>inside</em> of the mesh whatever color we set from <code>speed</code> and the <em>outside</em> plain black. Since the camera culls every fragment above the water surface (its near plane), it will draw the colored inside of objects that intersect the surface. The viewport texture will then be black where there is no intersection and colored for all areas where a hull intersects.</p>

<p>We can also give …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Since time immemorial PostgreSQL supports JSON fields and can even index
them. By immemorial I mean this functionality was added in versions 9.2 and 9.4
that are unsupported now. </p>
<p>I perfectly remember the world where PostgreSQL had no JSON support because 9.2
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/release-9-2.html">was released</a> in 2012,
and before that, I worked in a company that used MongoDB (we suffered
greatly<a href="https://vsevolod.net/postgresql-jsonb-index/#note1"><sup id="back1">[1]</sup></a>). It was an ample bit of marketing
for Mongo back then: "you can store any document without tediously defining an
ungodly schema! You gain so much flexibility!"</p>
<p>Little did we know back then that the world does not work that way, and
relational SQL databases are actually way more flexible than document-oriented
DBs, columnar DBs, or whatever.<a href="https://vsevolod.net/postgresql-jsonb-index/#note2"><sup id="back2">[2]</sup></a> Because
often we don't know what exactly are we going to do with the data, and with
relational DBs we can lay out the data however seems reasonable, and then add
indexes to support our use cases. </p>
<p>In document-oriented DBs you need to lay out your data exactly the way you're
going to query it later. Or else you'll need to migrate data inside your
schema-less database to another layout, which is way more cumbersome and
error-prone than adding some indexes and JOINs. </p>
<p>Don't trust me - there is an exceptional talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaEPXoXVf2k">Advanced Design Patterns for
DynamoDB</a> by Rick Houlihan, a
Principal Technologist at AWS. He explains that and so much more - it's a very
information-dense presentation with interesting ideas. I found it useful even
though I don't plan to use DynamoDB nor MongoDB in the near future.</p>
<p>Anyway, JSON support was added into PostgreSQL a long time ago, because
sometimes it is useful to store some documents in the database. And it can be
indexed in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html#JSON-INDEXING">two different
ways</a> -
full <abbr title="Generalized Inverted Index">GIN</abbr> and a special
<code>jsonb_path_ops</code> that supports indexing the <code>@&gt;</code> operator only. It means
"contains" and can be used like this:</p>
<pre><span>SELECT * FROM table WHERE jsonb_field @&gt; '{"employer": {"country": "ZA"}}';
</span></pre>
<p>Let me tell you a story about how I cleverly used this feature and it bit me in
the ass.</p>
<h2 id="story-time">Story time<a href="#story-time" aria-label="Anchor link for: story-time">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I am a co-founder at <a href="https://www.prophy.science/">www.prophy.science</a> which is
a product that can understand, search and recommend scientific papers and
experts. To do that well, we need a collection of all scientific papers, and
papers are often provided by many different providers with different ids. There
are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">PubMed</a> (30M+ articles), <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed
Central</a> (6M+ articles),
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a> (80-100M+),
<a href="https://inspirehep.net/">INSPIRE</a>, there are preprint servers like
<a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">biorXiv</a>,
<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/">medRxiv</a> and many others.</p>
<p>There is a widespread system of <abbr title="Digital object
identifier">DOIs</abbr> that are used to persistently identify journal articles,
research reports and data sets. It was introduced in the year 2000, and, as many
of these bibliographic databases predate DOI standard, they have their own
identifiers. Sometimes they even cross-link their IDs between different
services, and sometimes they cross-link wrong articles.</p>
<p>Some monitoring services download data from Crossref, Pubmed, PMC and some other
sources, add them and report that they have 180 million articles, 220 million,
or some other bullshit. We strive to merge the same article from different
sources into one entity with many external identifiers. We called these
identifiers "origin ids" and stored them in a special <code>jsonb</code> column, so one row
could have a record like this:</p>
<pre><span>{"pubmed": "3782696", "pmc": "24093010", "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2013.00489"}
</span></pre>
<p>It was a simple key-value document with a <code>jsonb_path_ops</code> index on it. And
whenever we needed to fetch an article by an origin id, we queried it using a
<code>@&gt;</code> operator like that:</p>
<pre><span>SELECT id FROM articles WHERE origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}';
</span></pre>
<p>It is a bit easier to store ids this way, no need to maintain a separate table
with hundreds of millions of rows.</p>
<p>One problem arose when we tried to query the index with many different origin
ids. There is no <code>IN</code> nor <code>ANY()</code>, so we stitched lots of <code>OR</code>s together:</p>
<pre><span>SELECT id FROM articles WHERE 
    origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}' OR 
    origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "654321"}' OR 
    origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123321"}' OR 
    origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "456654"}';
</span></pre><h2 id="explain-everything">Explain everything<a href="#explain-everything" aria-label="Anchor link for: explain-everything">🔗</a></h2>
<p>And with enough <code>OR</code>s the query gets really slow. Why? <code>EXPLAIN</code> helpfully says
that it becomes a sequential scan (I shortened output for clarity):</p>
<pre><span>EXPLAIN
 SELECT id, origin_ids
   FROM articles
  WHERE origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}' OR
        origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "654321"}' OR
        ....;   - x200
                        QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on articles  (rows=7805036)
   Filter: ((origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}') OR
            (origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "654321"}') OR   ...x200)
</span></pre>
<p>Why? For some reason it thinks that this query will return millions of rows. But
one origin id can match at most one article if my data is correct, so 200
filters should only match 0..200 rows. Let's look at <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> to check:</p>
<pre><span>EXPLAIN ANALYZE
 SELECT id, origin_ids
   FROM articles
  WHERE origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}' OR
        origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "654321"}' OR
        ....;   - x200
                        QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on articles  (rows=7805036) (actual rows=200)
   Filter: ((origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}') OR
            (origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "654321"}') OR   ...x200)
</span></pre>
<p>It does indeed return only 200 rows. Hmmm... Let's check one row:</p>
<pre><span>EXPLAIN ANALYZE
 SELECT id, origin_ids
   FROM articles
  WHERE origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}';
                        QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on articles  (rows=43038) (actual rows=1)
   Recheck Cond: (origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}')
    -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on  ... (rows=43038) (actual rows=1)
         Index Cond: (origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}')
</span></pre>
<p>Supposedly 43 thousand rows for only one filter! And 7.8 million rows are 39
thousand times more than 200, which is pretty close. At the time I fired these
queries we had only 43 million of articles. PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/planner-stats.html">gathers some
statistics</a> about
values in different columns to be able to produce reasonable query plans, and
looks like it's shooting blanks for this column.</p>
<p>What's the simplest fix? Oftentimes
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-analyze.html"><code>ANALYZE</code></a> on a table
is enough to fix broken statistics, but this time it didn't help at
all. Sometimes it's useful to adjust how many rows are analyzed to gather
statistics, and it can be adjusted down to a per-column basis with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html"><code>ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS</code></a>, but
here it had no effect as well.</p>
<p>Since version 10 PostgreSQL supports <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createstatistics.html"><code>CREATE STATISTICS</code></a>
to gather complex statistics for inter-column dependencies and whatnot, but our
filter is single-column, no luck here as well.</p>
<h2 id="contsel">Contsel<a href="#contsel" aria-label="Anchor link for: contsel">🔗</a></h2>
<p>So I dug some more, and more... And found that operator <code>@&gt;</code> uses something
called <code>contsel</code>. It was mentioned in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/23452.1288288224@sss.pgh.pa.us">PostgreSQL mailing
list</a>
in 2010. I tried to decrypt what <code>contsel</code> means and I think it stands for
"contains selectivity". Then I tried searching PostgreSQL sources for <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/search?q=contsel&amp;unscoped_q=contsel"><code>contsel</code>
mentions</a>
and found exactly <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/utils/adt/geo_selfuncs.c#L80">one
place</a>
in C code which mentions it:</p>
<pre><span>Datum
contsel(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
	PG_RETURN_FLOAT8(0.001);
}
</span></pre>
<p>0.001? That looks exactly like the ratio between 43 million rows in the table
and an estimated 43 thousand rows in the result. However, if we just multiply 43
thousand by 200 filters we should get 8.6 million, and PostgreSQL estimated only
7.8M. This discrepancy bothered me for a minute because I like to understand
things completely, so they won't set me up for an unpleasant surprise later<a href="https://vsevolod.net/postgresql-jsonb-index/#note3"><sup id="back3">[3]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>After a minute of contemplating the difference I realized that it's probability
in play - PostgreSQL thinks that every filter can match 0.1% of the total number
of rows and they can overlap. The actual math is:</p>
<pre><span>1 - 0.999 ** 200 = 1 - 0.819 = 0.181
</span></pre>
<p>18.1% of 43 million is 7.8 million (I'm rounding numbers here). Itch scratched
successfully.</p>
<p>And, depending on the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-QUERY-CONSTANTS">different
costs</a>
of various factors in the config, Postgres will select either sequential scan or
will use an index. Our first solution was to slice these filters into batches
with no more than 150 of them per query. It worked quite well for a couple of
years.</p>
<h2 id="domain-modeling-failure">Domain modeling failure<a href="#domain-modeling-failure" aria-label="Anchor link for: domain-modeling-failure">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Until we learned that one article could have more than one such external
identifier per type. For example, some pre-print services grant new DOI for each
version. <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.11938173.v8">10.26434/chemrxiv.11938173.v8</a>
has eight of them at the time of writing. And then it has the main DOI without
version
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.11938173">10.26434/chemrxiv.11938173</a>, and
will have another one if it will be published after peer review. There are other
cases for some other identifier types (we call these types "origin name").</p>
<p>We had two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Store origin ids in a separate table with columns <code>article_id</code>, <code>origin_name</code>
and <code>origin_id</code> with two indexes - one on <code>article_id</code> and the other on
<code>(origin_name, origin_id)</code>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accommodate many values per key in <code>jsonb</code>. Two more possible options here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many values per key: <code>{"doi": ["10.26434/3", "10.26434/3.v1"]}</code></li>
<li>List of pairs: <code>[["doi", "10.26434/3"], ["doi", "10.26434/3.v1"]]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Both can be queried with <code>@&gt;</code>, but it's getting even more uglier than it was.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We ended up doing kind of both - we created a separate table that's much easier
to query with many origin ids at once, and we store a list of pairs in a
separate non-indexed column so it's convenient to query.</p>
<h2 id="separate-table-speed-up">Separate table speed-up<a href="#separate-table-speed-up" aria-label="Anchor link for: separate-table-speed-up">🔗</a></h2>
<p>As a bonus, it's much-much faster to query a btree index with lots of filters
than a GIN one. With a GIN every <code>@&gt;</code> turns into a separate Bitmap Index Scan
that costs approximately millisecond for each (0.7-1.2 ms each if in
cache). With a btree index on two columns we construct a query that looks like
this:</p>
<pre><span>SELECT article_id FROM articles_origin_ids WHERE
    (origin_name = $1 AND origin_id = ANY($2)) OR
    (origin_name = $3 AND origin_id = ANY($4)) OR
    (origin_name = $5 AND origin_id = ANY($6));
</span></pre>
<p>Accessing a btree index is faster even by itself, I get 0.07 ms for Bitmap Index
Scan node in <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> for one <code>origin_name</code>, <code>origin_id</code> pair. …</p></section></div>

<p>About two years ago I decided to add HTTPS support to this site, using automatic certification via Let’s Encrypt. All the articles on the subject relied on a tool called <a href="https://certbot.eff.org/">certbot</a>. A couple of variations were mentioned, some requiring the tool to run while the site is down, others using nginx + certbot combination. It seemed that installing and running some additional external tool(s) in production was mandatory.</p>
<p>At that point The Erlangelist was a standalone Elixir-powered system which required no external program. It seemed that now I have to start worrying about setting up additional services and interact with them using their custom DSLs. This would complicate operations, and create a disconnect between production and development. Any changes to the certification configuration would need to be tested directly in production, or alternatively I’d have to setup a staging server. Either way, testing of certification would be done manually.</p>
<p>Unhappy with this state I started the work on <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/site_encrypt/readme.html">site_encrypt</a>, a library which takes a different approach to automatic certification:</p>
<ol>
<li>site_encrypt is a library dependency, not an external tool. You’re not required to install any OS-level package to use it.
</li>
<li>The certification process and periodical renewal are running in the same OS process as the rest of the system. No other OS processes need to be started.
</li>
<li>Everything is configured in the same project where the system is implemented.
</li>
<li>Interaction with site_encrypt is done via Elixir functions and data. No yaml, ini, json, or other kind of DSL is required.
</li>
<li>It’s trivial to run the certification locally, which reduces the differences between prod and local dev.
</li>
<li>The support for automatic testing of the certification is provided. There’s no need to setup staging machines, or make changes directly on the production system.
</li>
</ol>
<p>This is an example of what I call “integrated operations”. Instead of being spread across a bunch of yamls, inis, jsons, and bash scripts, somehow all glued together at the OS-level, most of the operations is done in development, i.e. the same place where the rest of the system is implemented, using the same language. Such approach significantly reduces the technical complexity of the system. The Erlangelist is mostly implemented in Elixir, with only a few administrative tasks, such as installation of OS packages, users creation, port forwarding rules, and similar provisioning tasks being done outside of Elixir.</p>
<p>This also simplifies local development. The <a href="https://github.com/sasa1977/erlangelist/#running-the-site-locally">instructions to start the system locally</a> are very simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Install build tools (Elixir, Erlang, nodejs)
</li>
<li>Fetch dependencies
</li>
<li>Invoke a single command to start the system
</li>
</ol>
<p>The locally started system will be extremely close to the production version. There is almost nothing of significance running on production which is not running locally. The only two differences of note I can think of are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ports 80/443 are forwarded in prod
</li>
<li>The prod version uses Lets Encrypt for certification, while the local version uses a local CA server (more on this later).
</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, this may not sound like much for a simple blog host, but behind the scene The Erlangelist is a bit more than a simple request responder:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Erlangelist system runs two separate web servers. The public facing server is the one you use to read this article. Another internal server uses the <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_dashboard/Phoenix.LiveDashboard.html">Phoenix Live Dashboard</a> to expose some metrics.
</li>
<li>A small hand-made database is running which collects, aggregates, and persists the reading stats, periodically removing older stats from the disk.
</li>
<li>The system periodically renews the certificate.
</li>
<li>Locally and on CI, another web server which acts as a local certificate authority (CA) is running.
</li>
</ol>
<p>In other words, The Erlangelist is more than just a blog, a site, a server, or an app. It’s a system consisting of multiple activities which collectively work together to support the full end-user service, as well as the operational aspects of the system. All of these activities are running concurrently. They don’t block each other, or crash each other. The system utilizes all CPU cores of its host machine. For more details on how this works take a look at my talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvBT4XBdoUE">The soul of Erlang and Elixir</a>.</p>
<p>Let’s take a closer look at site_encrypt.</p>
<h2>Certification</h2>
<p>Let’s Encrypt supports automatic certification via the <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8555">ACME (Automatic Certificate Management Environment) protocol</a>. This protocol describes the conversation between the client, which is a system wanting to obtain the certificate for some domain, and the server, which is the certificate authority (CA) that can create such certificate. In ACME conversation, our system asks the CA to provide the certificate for some domain, and the CA asks us to prove that we’re the owners of that domain. The CA gives us some random bytes, and then makes a request at our domain, expecting to get those same bytes in return. This is also called a challenge. If we successfully respond to the challenge, the CA will create the certificate for us. The real story is of course more involved, but this simplified version hopefully gives you the basic idea.</p>
<p>This conversation is an activity of the system. It’s a job which needs to be occasionally done to allow the system to provide the full service. If we don’t do the certification, we don’t have a valid certificate, and most people won’t use the site. Likewise, if I decide to shut the site down, the certification serves no purpose anymore.</p>
<p>In such situations my preferred approach is to run this activity together with the rest of the system. The less fragmented the system is, the easier it is to manage. Running some part of the system externally is fine if there are stronger reasons, but I don’t see such reasons in this simple scenario.</p>
<p><a href="https://hexdocs.pm/site_encrypt/readme.html#quick-start">site_encrypt makes this task straightforward</a>. Add a library dep, fill in some blanks, and you’re good to go. The certification configuration is provided by defining the <code>certification</code> function:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>certification</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0390845481-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>SiteEncrypt</span><span>.</span><span>configure</span><span data-group-id="0390845481-2">(</span><span>
    </span><span>client</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>:native</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>domains</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0390845481-3">[</span><span>"mysite.com"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"www.mysite.com"</span><span data-group-id="0390845481-3">]</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>emails</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0390845481-4">[</span><span>"contact@mysite.com"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"another_contact@mysite.com"</span><span data-group-id="0390845481-4">]</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>db_folder</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"/folder/where/site_encrypt/stores/files"</span><span>,</span><span>
    </span><span>directory_url</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>directory_url</span><span data-group-id="0390845481-5">(</span><span data-group-id="0390845481-5">)</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="0390845481-2">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="0390845481-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>This code looks pretty declarative, but it is executable code, not just a collection of facts. And that means that we have a lot of flexibility to shape the configuration data however we want. For example, if we want to make the certification parameters configurable by the system operator, say via a yaml file, nothing stops us from invoking <code>load_configuration_from_yaml()</code> instead of hardcoding the data. Say we want to make only some parameters configurable (e.g. domains and email), while leaving the rest hardcoded. We can simply do <code>Keyword.merge(load_some_params_from_yaml(), hardcoded_data)</code>. Supporting other kinds of config sources, like etcd or a database, is equally straightforward. You can always build declarative on top of imperative, while the opposite will require some imagination and trickery, such as running external configuration generators, and good luck managing that in production :-)</p>
<p>It’s also worth mentioning that site_encrypt internally ships with two lower-level modules, a sort of plumbing to this porcelain. There is a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/site_encrypt/SiteEncrypt.Acme.Client.html#content">mid-level module</a> which provides workflow-related operations, such as “create an account”, or “perform the certification”, and a <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/site_encrypt/SiteEncrypt.Acme.Client.API.html#content">lower-level module</a> which provides basic ACME client operations. These modules can be used when you want a finer grained control over the certification process.</p>
<h2>Reducing the dev-production mismatch</h2>
<p>There’s one interesting thing happening in the configuration presented earlier:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>certification</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="3249251622-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>SiteEncrypt</span><span>.</span><span>configure</span><span data-group-id="3249251622-2">(</span><span>
    </span><span># ...</span><span>
    </span><span>directory_url</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>directory_url</span><span data-group-id="3249251622-3">(</span><span data-group-id="3249251622-3">)</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="3249251622-2">)</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="3249251622-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>The <code>directory_url</code> property defines the CA where site_encrypt will obtain the certificate. Instead of hardcoding this url, we’re invoking a function to compute it. This happens because we need to use different urls for production vs staging vs local development. Let’s take a look:</p>
<pre><code><span>defp</span><span> </span><span>directory_url</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5360223777-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>case</span><span> </span><span>System</span><span>.</span><span>get_env</span><span data-group-id="5360223777-2">(</span><span>"MODE"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"local"</span><span data-group-id="5360223777-2">)</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5360223777-3">do</span><span>
    </span><span>"production"</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>"https://acme-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"</span><span>
    </span><span>"staging"</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span>"https://acme-staging-v02.api.letsencrypt.org/directory"</span><span>
    </span><span>"local"</span><span> </span><span>-&gt;</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="5360223777-4">{</span><span>:internal</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>port</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>4002</span><span data-group-id="5360223777-4">}</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="5360223777-3">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="5360223777-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>Here, we’re distinguishing production from staging from development based on the <code>MODE</code> OS env (easily replaceable with other source, owing to programmable API). If the env is not provided, we’ll assume that the system running locally.</p>
<p>On a production machine, we go to the real CA, while for staging we’ll use Let’s Encrypt staging site. But what about the <code>{:internal, port: 4002}</code> thing which we use in local development? If we pass this particular shape of data to site_encrypt, an internal ACME server will be started on the given port, a sort of a local mock of Let’s Encrypt. This server is running inside the same same OS process as the rest of the system.</p>
<p>So locally, site_encrypt will start a mock of Let’s Encrypt, and it will use that mock to obtain the certificate. In other words, locally the system will certify itself. Here’s an example of this in action on a local version of The Erlangelist:</p>
<pre><code>$ iex -S mix phx.server

[info]  Running ErlangelistWeb.Blog.Endpoint at 0.0.0.0:20080 (http)
[info]  Running ErlangelistWeb.Blog.Endpoint at 0.0.0.0:20443 (https)
[info]  Running local ACME server at port 20081
[info]  Creating new ACME account for domain theerlangelist.com
[info]  Ordering a new certificate for domain theerlangelist.com
[info]  New certificate for domain theerlangelist.com obtained
[info]  Certificate successfully obtained!</code></pre>
<h2>Testability</h2>
<p>Since local Erlangelist behaves exactly as the real one, we can test more of the system behaviour. For example, even on the local version HTTP requests are redirected to HTTPS. Here’s a test verifying this:</p>
<pre><code><span>test</span><span> </span><span>"http requests are redirected to https"</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="4049071146-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span>assert</span><span> </span><span>redirected_to</span><span data-group-id="4049071146-2">(</span><span>Client</span><span>.</span><span>get</span><span data-group-id="4049071146-3">(</span><span>"http://localhost/"</span><span data-group-id="4049071146-3">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>301</span><span data-group-id="4049071146-2">)</span><span> </span><span>==</span><span>
    </span><span>"https://localhost/"</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="4049071146-1">end</span></code></pre>

<h2>How can the Covid-19 pandemic possibly make a better world in the future?</h2>
<p><span>Last week we talked about how the Covid-19 pandemic has already caused changes in the American workplace and the future of working from home. This week, we want to talk about how Covid-19 can lead the way for a better world </span><i><span>in the future</span></i><span>. Here is our list of the top 10 things we have learned from Covid-19 for a better post Covid-19 world:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span><strong>Stop all the excessive waste –</strong> let’s face it, during Covid-19 our top priority became our health, emotional and financial well-being. Due to this, our concerns about reducing waste and recycling more were likely thrown to the side. But Covid-19 has caused more home waste than ever before!&nbsp; Let’s bring this back into focus. Recycle more. Take reusable bags to the supermarket. Buy less. Use less toilet paper, worried about shortages? Work on reducing your usage. Eliminate food waste as much as possible!</span></li>
<li><strong>Netflix and Chill isn’t so bad:</strong> Learn to be still with a loved one, and be with family, kids (our future). While you participate in Netflix and chill take this opportunity to be mindful of the media you consume. Expand your idea of what you would watch. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/watching/lists/diverse-tv-shows">Watch TV shows with a diverse or non-white cast</a><span>. Add some shows about race and being black in the U.S to your </span><a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/culture/a32800785/netflix-shows-about-race-black-america/">queue.&nbsp;</a></li>
<li><span><strong>Be at home:</strong> Work from home, Cook from home, party at home, all saves the environment from excessive travel, food production (</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth"><span>especially meat</span></a><span>), and unneeded lifestyle practices. This is a great opportunity to incorporate vegetarian and vegan recipes and food practices into your life. </span><a href="https://www.feastingathome.com/vegan-dinner-recipes/"><span>Here are some quick and easy recipes to get started with</span></a><span>! Cooking at home also allows you to reduce consumption in takeout, which reduces waste!</span></li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2018/may/31/avoiding-meat-and-dairy-is-single-biggest-way-to-reduce-your-impact-on-earth">We are all a part of nature</a></strong><span><strong>!</strong> People have been spending more time outdoors and have gained a new appreciation for nature. Many people have also been increasing the amount of exercise they do, making sure they are doing something active daily</span><a href="https://kdalive.com/category/physical/"><span> (Physical wellbeing is essential to ultimate wellbeing)</span></a><span>. Continuing to spend time outdoors and engaging in physical activity as much as possible in the future is super important and something that should be prioritized in order to make a better world.</span></li>
<li><span><strong>An increase in ethical action and activism, as well as a reduction in consumerism.</strong> People are engaging in political activism, donating to charitable causes, and understanding our interconnectedness better than ever. We are beginning to see less individualism – and more interest in investments for the greater good. Covid-19 has increased visibility of the social determinants of health. It has also pointed out how certain groups of people (racial and ethnic minorities, those of lower socioeconomic status) are disproportionately impacted by the negative effects of something like a pandemic. Recent protests surrounding Black Lives Matter and police brutality have made it so that more people are involved in ending systemic racism. This engagement in ethical activism and action must continue! Donate to a cause that you believe in, go to a protest, educate yourself about an issue. Take this increase in spare time to learn something and change something.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><strong>Pride and Respect in Everyone’s work: </strong><a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/differences-between-japanese-and-american-work-culture-2018-3#in-both-countries-employees-work-long-hours-and-take-few-breaks-5"><span>Japan has this</span></a><span>. America doesn’t. We have seen an increase in appreciation for our essential workers. Moving forward we should continue this respect for essential workers- from health care workers to postal workers and foodservice and farmers.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>We can use this ample time spent online to reform our digital lifestyles to be healthier and more productive.</strong> We should use time with our devices to rethink the community we can create through them. Spend this time following more content creators you admire and engaging with online communities that you support.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Less is more:</strong> Less travel is better for your life. Less stuff is better for the environment. </span><a href="https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/01/fashion-industry-carbon-unsustainable-environment-pollution/"><span>Less clothes shopping is better</span></a><span>. If you are going to shop for clothes, make an effort to shop at thrift stores as opposed to fast fashion corporations. There are even online thrift shops such as </span><a href="https://www.depop.com/"><span>Depop</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.thredup.com/"><span>ThredUp</span></a><span> that you can shop from without even having to leave the comfort of your home! Massive consumerism needs to stop.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Now is the time to support more local businesses.</strong> Especially those that are BIPOC owned. </span><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizfrazierpeck/2020/03/22/15-ways-to-support-local-business-during-the-coronavirus-shutdown/#77fc2d9a1b8f"><span>Support local business</span></a><span>: The rich got richer so what do we do? Supporting local businesses promotes growth in your very own community!</span></li>
<li><span><strong>We are all connected, whether we like it or not.</strong> Maybe you have thought that your individual contributions don’t matter in the long term- especially in regards to our climate or </span><a href="https://inthesetimes.com/article/22514/covid-19-coronavirus-wealthy-corporate-welfare"><span>economy</span></a><span>. If anything, COVID-19 has shown us that we suffer together (</span><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/05/30/865413079/what-do-coronavirus-racial-disparities-look-like-state-by-state"><span>but not equally</span></a><span>). Once we can get on the same page, we too can overcome lingering problems that will just harm us even more than Covid-19. Read more on connection in one of my favorite spiritual books,&nbsp; </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Rays-Dawn-Natural-Laws-Body/dp/0967184509"><i><span>Rays of Dawn.</span></i></a><i><span>&nbsp;</span></i></li>

Lee brings 20 years of expertise in information security and operating mission-critical services. He was most recently the Senior Vice President of Security Operations at Salesforce, and previously was Principal Director of Security Engineering at Microsoft. Lee will lead Zoom’s security team and report to Aparna Bawa, Zoom’s Chief Operating Officer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zoom is nearing the end of its 90-day security and privacy plan, put into place during a time of unprecedented growth that has made Zoom the platform of choice for over 300 million daily meeting participants, including those at some of the world’s largest enterprises.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                        
<p>Finding relevant information quickly speeds up performance. For example, while reading a book <span>in which you have to find a topic that you would like to read, if you know that it is in a certain chapter then you will simply go to that chapter, perhaps look through it and start reading the desired topic. </span></p>



<p><span>However if you don’t know then you can consult with the book index that’s usually available at the end of the book first, and find out which pages might list the desired topic. This way you will go only those pages to look for the topic. However if the index is not available then you will have to browse through the whole book looking for the pages of interest. This will obviously consume a lot of time in finding the relevant pages instead of quickly jumping to the desired pages right away.</span></p>



<p><span>The analogy of using a book index for searching the desired pages is similar to searching a database table for the desired tuples. If you can create an index on a database table the query execution may get quite fast and if you don’t have the index then it may end up taking quite a lot of time. I used the word “may” because in some cases a full table scan might be faster than an index scan, we will explore some of these in this blog moving forward.</span></p>



<p><span>PostgreSQL provides a variety of indexes and also quite a number of ways to create these indexes. The blog provides a brief introduction of all the different index types available in PostgreSQL, and also provides some examples to elaborate the index types.</span></p>



<h3><strong>1. B-Tree Index</strong></h3>



<p><span>It is the default index type in PostgreSQL that gets created when you do a ‘CREATE INDEX’ statement without mentioning the index name.</span></p>



<p><span>This index is much suitable for the data that can be sorted and can handle equality and range queries.</span> <span>The following command is used to create a btree index:</span></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="sql" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">CREATE INDEX name ON table (column); or
CREATE INDEX name ON table USING BTREE (column);</pre>



<h3><strong>2. Hash Index</strong></h3>



<p><span>The hash index prior to PostgreSQL version 10 were almost discouraged for various reasons such as:</span></p>



<ul><li><span>Not WAL logged hence not crash safe</span></li><li><span>Not replicated to stand-by server</span></li><li><span>Performance is not so good and may take a long time to build the index (depending on the&nbsp; table size)</span></li></ul>



<p><span>However since version 10, these problems have been resolved. They are now crash safe and are able to be replicated to standby server. They sometimes perform better than b-tree indexes and are also space efficient.</span></p>



<p><span>The Hash index only works with equality operators that means that you can only look up for data that matches exactly. However it is now much optimized and does a much faster lookup which makes this index a bit of specialized index that can be used where equal comparison is more important. </span><span>The following command is used to create a hash index:</span></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="sql" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">CREATE INDEX name ON table USING HASH (column);</pre>



<h3><strong>3. Gist Index</strong></h3>



<p><span>Gist or Generalized Search Tree are useful when the data to be indexed is more complex than to do a simple equate or ranged comparison like finding nearest-neighbor and pattern matching. The example of such data includes geometric data, network address comparisons and full-text searches.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p><span>The Gist index itself provides an infrastructure to implement different strategies for indexing data such as B-trees and R-trees. </span><span>The following command is used to create a hash index:</span></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="sql" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">CREATE INDEX name ON table USING gist (column);</pre>



<h3><strong>4. SP-Gist Index</strong></h3>



<p><span>SP-Gist or Space partitioned Gist indexes are useful when the data can be grouped into non-overlapping groupings. Like Gist index, it also provides an infrastructure for implementing different indexing strategies. However SP-Gist is non-balanced in nature and divides data in partitions, so it allows the implementation of </span><span>quad-trees, k-d trees, and radix trees (tries).</span></p>



<h3><strong>5. Gin Index</strong></h3>



<p><span>Generalized Inverted indexes are useful in indexing data that consist of multiple elements in a single column such as arrays, json documents (jsonb) or text search documents (tsvector).</span></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="sql" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">CREATE INDEX name ON table USING gin (column);</pre>



<h3><strong>6. BRIN Index</strong></h3>



<p><span>Block Range Indexes are useful for large size tables that have columns with some natural sort order. The BRIN index divides the table into block ranges and keeps a summary of those blocks. This summary includes min, max values of the range. </span><span>The following command is used to create a hash index:</span></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="sql" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">CREATE INDEX name ON table USING brin (column);</pre>



<p>The above list&nbsp;discribes&nbsp;the available&nbsp;index algorithms&nbsp;availble in&nbsp;postgres database, now lets see&nbsp;some of the characteristics of&nbsp;indexes&nbsp;that&nbsp;can be used to&nbsp;further&nbsp;tweek&nbsp;and&nbsp;enhance&nbsp;the performance of&nbsp;indexes.</p>



<h2><span>Multicolumn Indexes</span></h2>



<p><span>PostgreSQL does allow creation of an index on multiple columns. However you can only have a maximum of 32 columns and such indexes only work with Btree, Gist, Gin and Brin. An example of such index is:</span></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="sql" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">CREATE TABLE test (x int, y int);
CREATE INDEX multi_idx ON test (x, y);

postgres=# EXPLAIN (costs off) SELECT * from test WHERE x = 10 AND y = 100;
               QUERY PLAN                
-----------------------------------------
 Index Only Scan using multi_idx on test
   Index Cond: ((x = 10) AND (y = 100))
(2 rows)
</pre>



<h2><span>Unique Indexes</span></h2>



<p><span>A unique index enforces the uniqueness of the values in the column. In PostgreSQL a unique index can be created on one or multiple columns. If a unique index is created for multiple columns the uniqueness is ensured using the combined values of columns.&nbsp;however only&nbsp;B-tree&nbsp;index can be&nbsp;declared&nbsp;unique.</span></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="sql" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">CREATE TABLE test (x int, y int);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_idx ON test (x);
postgres=# \d test
                Table "public.test"
 Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default 
--------+---------+-----------+----------+---------
 x      | integer |           |          | 
 y      | integer |           |          | 
Indexes:
    "unique_idx" UNIQUE, btree (x)
</pre>



<p>Let’s create a multi-column index.</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="sql" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">CREATE UNIQUE INDEX unique_multi_col_idx ON test (x, y);
postgres=# \d test
                Table "public.test"
 Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default 
--------+---------+-----------+----------+---------
 x      | integer |           |          | 
 y      | integer |           |          | 
Indexes:
    "unique_idx" UNIQUE, btree (x)
    "unique_multi_col_idx" UNIQUE, btree (x, y)
</pre>



<p><span>NULL values are not considered equal, hence they are considered unique values. Adding multiple NULLs in a unique column won’t result in index violation.</span></p>



<p><span>Also note that, if you declare a unique constraint or primary key for a column, PostgreSQL automatically creates a unique index. An example of such index is:</span></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="sql" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">CREATE TABLE test (x int PRIMARY KEY, y int UNIQUE);
postgres=# \d test
                Table "public.test"
 Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default 
--------+---------+-----------+----------+---------
 x      | integer |           | not null | 
 y      | integer |           |          | 
Indexes:
    "test_pkey" PRIMARY KEY, btree (x)
    "test_y_key" UNIQUE CONSTRAINT, btree (y)
</pre>



<h2><span>Indexes on Expressions</span></h2>



<p><span>It is also possible in PostgreSQL database to create the indexed columns based on the result of a function or scalar expression computed from one or more columns of the table. Since the result of computed expression is stored on the index and it won’t be computed at run time, the access to table data becomes much faster. However the insertion and updation of the data becomes more expensive. Some example of this index are:</span></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="sql" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">CREATE TABLE test (x int, y text);
postgres=# EXPLAIN (costs off) SELECT * from test WHERE lower(y) = 'value';
              QUERY PLAN              
--------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on test
   Filter: (lower(y) = 'value'::text)
(2 rows)
</pre>



<p><span>Now lets create an indexed expression and see the query again. It should show the index being built using the expression now, instead of the table field.</span></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="sql" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">postgres=# CREATE INDEX expr_idx ON test (lower(y));
CREATE INDEX
postgres=# EXPLAIN (costs off) SELECT * from test WHERE lower(y) = 'value';
                   QUERY PLAN                   
------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on test
   Recheck Cond: (lower(y) = 'value'::text)
   -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on expr_idx
         Index Cond: (lower(y) = 'value'::text)
(4 rows)

postgres=# \d test
                Table "public.test"
 Column |  Type   | Collation | Nullable | Default 
--------+---------+-----------+----------+---------
 x      | integer |           |          | 
 y      | text    |           |          | 
Indexes:
    "expr_idx" btree (lower(y)
</pre>



<h2><span>Partial Indexes</span></h2>



<p><span>There are some situations where you don’t want to index the whole table, instead you will want to filter out some specific data based on some conditions. This kind of index is called a partial index. The partial index only contains the data for those rows that fulfill that specific condition.</span></p>



<p><span>These indexes contain a WHERE clause and result in much smaller index sizes than the usual indexes (without conditions). Since they have a smaller footprint, they result in faster data access. An example of such index is:</span></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="sql" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">CREATE TABLE test (x int, y text);
postgres=# EXPLAIN (costs off) SELECT * from test WHERE y IS NULL;
      QUERY PLAN       
-----------------------
 Seq Scan on test
   Filter: (y IS NULL)
(2 rows)
</pre>



<p><span>Lets create a partial index</span></p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="sql" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="false" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">postgres=# CREATE INDEX partial_idx ON test (y) WHERE y IS NULL;
CREATE INDEX
postgres=# EXPLAIN (costs off) SELECT * from test WHERE y IS NULL;
               QUERY PLAN               
----------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on test
   Recheck Cond: (y IS NULL)
   -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on partial_idx
(3 rows)
</pre>



<h2><span>Index-Only Scans</span></h2>



<p><span>Index only scans are the index where all the needed data by the query is available directly from the index. Normally when an index is created, it is stored separately from the table data and whenever a query is executed to fetch the data rows it is …</span></p></div></div>

<p><small><em>Fri, 26 Jun 2020 14:31:01 +0200</em></small></p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer: In this text, as all of mine, I am writing from a
perspective of a Linux user. Then my remarks won’t hold fully true for
MacOS users or Windows users as their setups might be different.</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/fb/ec/45/fbec45ac5ba8cdee978b3b460f982104.jpg">I am angry. Angry about GNOME and the modern GUI design.</a> After reading
<a href="https://tonsky.me/blog/monitors/">an article by tonsky</a>, I realised how most of projects have forgotten
about bitmap fonts. It is one of these weird occurences, as bitmap
fonts are much simpler to program and use. I think that BDF fonts are
the only font format that is human readable in the raw form.</p>



<p>In his blogpost tonsky argued that you should buy a 4K display as on
lower PPI displays outline fonts look terrible. They do, and it is a
fact for any person that cares about fonts. I hold that at &gt;150 PPI
outline fonts should be auxillary. They ought to be used in the
necessary cases (for example: typesetting, official documents, etc.).
In any other uses, they are unbearable to look at as they are not
designed to work without antialiasing nor hinting.</p>

<p>On the other hand, bitmap fonts are designed <em>against</em> antialising and
hinting. They are not meant to be resized so they stay at maximum in
couple of sizes. That keeps them predictable and efficient. There are
no issues related to bluriness, as pixels themselves are the determine
their borders and they follow the limitations of displays. Their
formats, such as ancient BDF are so simple that they are human
readable. Thus it is much easier to customise, than the sanity
questioning of outline fonts and the hellscape of <code>fontforge(1)</code>.</p>

<p>Look at this code of a glyph (from <a href="https://notabug.org/invest/atarist-lich">Atarist</a> font) in BDF format in 142 bytes.</p>

<pre><code>STARTCHAR HEBREW LETTER HE
ENCODING 1492
SWIDTH 512 0
DWIDTH 8 0
BBX 8 16 0 -2
BITMAP
00
00
7E
7E
06
66
66
66
66
66
66
66
00
00
00
00
ENDCHAR
</code></pre>

<p>You are instantly aware of each element of the glyph and how it will
behave within this format. Such is not as easy for outline fonts. I do
not need to give screenshots to explain what is going on.</p>



<p>As bitmap fonts just became non-standard fonts they are treated worse
than outline fonts. The change in <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/mclasen/2019/08/07/pango-1-44-wrap-up/">Pango 1.44</a> to only use .otb fonts
which are not something what indsutry was used to. Majority of
software which uses Pango now struggles with .otb bitmap fonts and
gives them wrong outlines, or just does not print them at all (i.e.
zathura or dunst).</p>

<p>The description of the change in Pango 1.44 shows the lack of
responsibiltiy of GNOME developers. They push the task of solving the
issue they created towards ‘the internet community’. These fonts are
supposed be easiest to handle and should not be treated like this.</p>

<p>Also, nobody offers any reliable solution for scaling bitmap fonts on
high DPI displays. There, a simple proportional scaling would be fine
for solving this problem.</p>

<p>I do not want to worry about fonts, I just want them to be readable
and non-blurry on my display. Such is not achievable (on low PPI
displays) with greatly promoted outline fonts. That’s that. When I
want a high PPI display, then I can use my e-reader, or better yet -
print it.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>I recently read a Substack post about Struck, an astrological dating app that was rejected from Apple’s app store 9 times.<sup>1</sup> Unfortunately, the post was flagged on Hacker News because the app’s creator claimed that Apple's rejection was a form of discrimination.<sup>2</sup> I agree with this claim but that’s not what I'd like to discuss.</p>

        <p>It seems that Apple is unwavering in their ideology that the app store should be a closed environment with inconsistent gatekeeping, so as  developers we should be thinking about how to circumvent the app store. The most obvious way this could happen is if developers started making mobile websites instead of apps. Remember that the iPhone originally only supported mobile website apps from outside developers.

        </p><blockquote>
            The full Safari engine is inside of iPhone. And so, you can write amazing Web 2.0 and Ajax apps that look exactly and behave exactly like apps on the iPhone. And these apps can integrate perfectly with iPhone services. They can make a call, they can send an email, they can look up a location on Google Maps.<sup>3</sup>
        </blockquote>
            
        <p>I think that this could again be a viable solution. It not only gives developers the freedom to develop whatever they want, but would allow them to build one product that would run across any mobile device with a browser. When I was on Twitter, I would visit twitter.com on my phone. The overall mobile web experience was basically the same so I never saw a reason to download the native Twitter app.</p>

        <p>The app store is such a terrible environment to deal with and the chances of your app trending on the platform is next to none, not to mention the exorbitant Apple developer fee of $100/year. It’s easy to get into the mindset that your app needs to exist in an app store but most apps really don't need to. Discovery is a big part of what the app store offers, but why can't we create an alternative directory on the web? Browser makers could do some work in this arena. Just think of a Firefox mobile web app directory.</p>

<p>We are slowly getting to a comfortable password situation.</p>
<p>Research has improved on which passwords are easier to remember.
Cryptographers have <a href="https://password-hashing.net/argon2-specs.pdf">strenghtened the cost</a> of cracking weak passwords.
People are more aware of the security risks,
and the usage of password managers grows.</p>
<p>The consensus on password handling is this:</p>
<ol>
<li>Keep a very strong master password in your head, stored nowhere.</li>
<li>Use it to unlock your password manager.</li>
<li>Use your password manager to store and create very random passwords for individual websites.
You would never be able to remember them, but you only need to remember the master password.
Typically, for alphanumerical outputs, you need ⌈128÷log2(26·2+10)⌉ = 22 characters.</li>
<li>The websites, and more importantly, the password manager,
use a key derivation function such as <a href="https://password-hashing.net/argon2-specs.pdf">Argon2</a> either on the front-end
(server relief) or on the backend, and only stores the output.
It ensures computation is both time-hard and memory-hard, with settings kept up-to-date
to ensure that each computation takes 0.5 seconds and/or 4 GB of RAM.</li>
</ol>
<p>But some details are left unset: exactly how strong should the master password be?
How do we even know?
Can this situation converge to an easier user experience for login on the Web?</p>
<h2>Password hashing</h2>
<p>Some accurate statements may be surprising to the general population.
This is one:</p>
<p><strong>Multiple passwords can unlock your account.</strong></p>
<p>The reason? Your password is not compared byte-for-byte (thankfully!)
but through a hashing method that does not map one-to-one.</p>
<p>Indeed, hashes have fixed sizes (typically 256 bits),
while passwords have arbitrary length.</p>
<p>Overall, this consideration is unimportant,
because virtually no password is strong enough
to even compete with the collision risk of the hash:
it is tremendously more likely for a collision to be caused by
the generation process, than by the hash,
whose collision risk is 2<sup>N÷2</sup>
where N is the size of the hash, typically 256 bits nowadays.</p>
<p>On top of this, some companies build their login system
in a way that is more resilient to user error,
such as <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/facebook-passwords-are-not-case-sensitive-update">having caps lock on</a>.</p>
<p>That too is irrelevant, since the search space is typically only reduced
by one bit (corresponding to the choice between setting caps lock or not).</p>
<h2>Target strength</h2>
<p><a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/60815/recommended-minimum-entropy-for-online-passwords-in-2018">Some suggestions target specific cryptographic algorithms</a>.
But this pushes machine limits into human constraints:
algorithms require 128-bit security, not because 127 is not enough,
but because it is a power of two that neatly fits with various engineering techniques.</p>
<p>The real human constraint is your lifetime.
Once you are dead, it does not matter too much to your brain whether your secrets are out,
since your brain becomes mulch.</p>
<p>The longest person alive is a French woman that died nearly reaching 123.
Let’s imagine that health will improve
such that someone will live double that amount, Y = 246 years.
What is the minimum strength needed to ensure they won’t have their secrets cracked alive?</p>
<p>Current compute costs hover around €3/month on low-end machines.
Let’s imagine that it will improve a hundredfold in the coming century.</p>
<p>The NSA yearly budget is estimated at B = €10 billion.
Can they hack you before you die?</p>
<p>First, under those assumptions,
assuming the NSA consumes its whole budget cracking you,
how many computers will it use to crack you in parallel?
The result is P = B ÷ 12 ÷ 0.03 = 28 billion servers.</p>
<p>If your password has an N-bit entropy,
it will take 2<sup>N-1</sup>·0.005÷P÷3600÷24÷365 years on average,
assuming the NSA is brute-forcing with CPUs that can do one attempt every 5 milliseconds
(a hundredth of the <a href="https://password-hashing.net/argon2-specs.pdf">Argon2</a> recommended setting,
to account for the possibility that the NSA has machines a hundred times more powerful
than the rest of us, which is both unlikely, and would not cost what we estimated).</p>
<p>As a result, our formula for picking strength is
N = log2(B÷12÷0.03 · Y·365·24·3600÷0.005) + 1 = 77 bits of security.</p>
<p>Note that we can assume that a good KDF is used,
since we are only worried about password strength for the password manager,
which should be pretty good at choosing the right design.
The password manager will generate all normal passwords above 128 bits of security anyway.
(Except for those pesky websites that inexplicably have an upper password length limit.
But those are beyond saving.)</p>
<p>I parameterized some values so that you can plug your own situation.
For instance, if you make a password for your startup
that you believe will beat the odds of an average 5-year lifespan,
and become a behemoth a thousand years into the future, you can set Y = 1000
and get a very slight increase to 79 bits.</p>
<p>If you instead believe that your adversary will spend a trillion euros every year,
you can bump things up to 83 bits of security.</p>
<h2>Master password generation</h2>
<p>How do you convert a number of bits of security into a master password?
Well, those bits represent the amount of entropy of the random generator.
Or in other words, the quantity of uncertainty of the password-making process.</p>
<p>Each bit represents one truly random choice between two options.
If you have four options, it is as if you made two choices, and so on.</p>
<p>A good way to make memorable master passwords is to pick words among large dictionaries,
since picking from a long list adds a lot of entropy (since there are so many binary choices)
but each word is very distinctively evocative.</p>
<p>However, each word is independent, and therefore,
making stories in your head that combines those words gets harder the more words there are.
So we randomize the word separators as symbols,
which both adds entropy (so that we can have less words),
and is not too hard to remember. Besides, breaking words apart ensures that
we don’t lose entropy by ending up with two words that, concatenated,
are actually a single word from the same dictionary.</p>
<p>I implemented these principles on <a href="https://espadrine.github.io/passphrase/">this passphrase generation page</a>.</p>
<h2>Thank you, Next</h2>
<p>I feel strongly that passwords are passé.
I would love to talk about my hopes for the future of Web authentication.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                                
<div><figure><img src="https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Evolution.png" alt="Precompute Evolution" srcset="https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Evolution.png 558w, https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Evolution-300x152.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 558px) 100vw, 558px"></figure></div>



<p>Precomputation is commonly used in information retrieval and analysis. With precomputation, we compute the results once and then store them in a table or other data structure, either on a disk or in memory. In this table, each input (or combination of inputs) maps to an output value. In order to answer a question, we just need to find the output value corresponding to the input value(s). </p>







<h2>Early Forms of Precomputation</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Multiplication-Table.png" alt="Figure 1: Multiplication Table (Wikipedia.org)"><figcaption><strong>Figure 1: Multiplication Table (Wikipedia.org)</strong></figcaption></figure></div>



<p> The form you are likely familiar with, and probably the most common form of precomputation, is the multiplication table (Figure 1). In this table, to find the result of 7*8, all you need to do is find row 7 (or 8) and then move across to column 8 (or 7) â€“ and there is your answer: 56! Most of us memorized the multiplication table in grade school, so we donâ€™t even realize that we are actually using this table when we perform these operations now.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Logarithms-Table.png" alt="Figure 2: Logarithms Table (Wikipedia.org) " srcset="https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Logarithms-Table.png 304w, https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Logarithms-Table-300x241.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 304px) 100vw, 304px"><figcaption><strong>Figure 2: Logarithms Table (Wikipedia.org)</strong> </figcaption></figure></div>



<p> Another, more advanced, example of precomputation is the logarithms table (Figure 2). If you donâ€™t remember how to use it, Iâ€™m sure youâ€™re not alone. Fun fact: The first tables of logarithms were published independently by Scottish mathematician John Napier in 1614 and Swiss mathematician Justus Byrgius in 1620. Napier actually started his work in 1594 and it took him 20 years to complete the tables </p>







<h2>From Database to Big Data to The Cloud</h2>



<p>Precomputation has been used in databases for many years. To
save time on joining tables and calculating columns, we can run these queries
upfront and save the results into materialized views. Future queries will be
directed to these materialized views to retrieve their results.</p>



<p>In 1993, Edgar F. Codd, the father of the relational database, coined the term <a href="https://kyligence.io/apache-kylin-overview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="OLAP (opens in a new tab)">OLAP</a> for On-Line Analytical Processing in a white paper published by Arbor Software. In OLAP, transactional data is extracted from operational systems and loaded into data warehouses where data is organized for fast reporting performance. However, the query performance is still not satisfactory for interactive analysis. </p>



<p>For this purpose, OLAP systems calculate common queries from data warehouses and store those results in a data structure called a cube. When an OLAP product receives a query, it simply looks up the data already stored in the cube and fetches the result. This method significantly reduces query times. Over time, â€œOLAPâ€� and â€œCubeâ€� became synonyms, although, later â€œOLAPâ€� was expanded into <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing#Multidimensional_OLAP_(MOLAP)" target="_blank">MOLAP</a>, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing#Relational_OLAP_(ROLAP)" target="_blank">ROLAP</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label=" (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_analytical_processing#Hybrid_OLAP_(HOLAP)" target="_blank">HOLAP</a> architectures. </p>



<div><figure><img src="https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Data-Cube.png" alt="Data Cube" srcset="https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Data-Cube.png 320w, https://siteprod-s3-azcdn.kyligence.io/2020/06/Data-Cube-300x259.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 320px) 100vw, 320px"></figure></div>



<p>As illustrated in the cube diagram here, if you need to analyze sales volume based on three attributes â€“ e.g. Products, Cities, and Time â€“ you can create a three-dimensional cube. This cube is basically a three-dimensional spreadsheet. </p>



<p>Keep in mind that although the data structure is called a <em>cube</em>, in reality most applications have more than three dimensions, but obviously there is no easy way to illustrate that in a diagram. OLAP cubes became quite popular in late 90sâ€™ with products like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Microsoft SSAS (opens in a new tab)" href="https://kyligence.io/solution/replace-ssas-and-scale-olap%e2%80%8b/" target="_blank">Microsoft SSAS</a>, <a href="https://kyligence.io/solution/cognos-olap%e2%80%8b-migration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Cognos (opens in a new tab)">Cognos</a>, MicroStrategy, etc. </p>



<p>In the big data and cloud era, we have seen various
technologies try to address query performance issues for large volumes of data.
From query engines to cloud data warehouses to data virtualization products,
these technologies use different forms of MPP (Massive Parallel Processing)
architecture. Although they have improved dramatically over the years, their
performances still degrade when running complex aggregate queries against a large
amount of data.</p>



<p>Caching, as a special type of precomputation, is commonly used by these products to improve performance. Query engines cache result sets in memory so the exact same query can reuse the same result set. Cloud Data Warehouses bring tables into the compute layer to avoid future network traffic between the compute and storage layers. </p>



<p>These techniques can speed up a very limited subset of queries and donâ€™t really solve the fundamental problem â€“ they donâ€™t truly support citizen analysts conducting ad-hoc analysis on large amounts of data, at the speed of thought. </p>







<h2>Kyligence â€“ A New Generation of Precomputation Technology</h2>



<p>Kyligence fundamentally changes how modern analytics is done with its breakthrough precomputation technology. When <a href="https://kyligence.io/blog/apache-kylin-through-the-eyes-of-the-founders-episode-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="the creators of the Apache Kylin project (opens in a new tab)">the creators of the Apache Kylin project</a> founded the company back in 2016, they had a vision to create a platform that could enable citizen analysts to do their jobs without worrying about the size of their data and the number of concurrent users. Today, its products are being used by some of the world largest banks, insurance companies, retailers, manufacturers, and so on.</p>







<p><strong>Know the Questions Before They Are Asked</strong></p>



<p>Wouldnâ€™t it be nice to be fully prepared and know all the questions you will be asked before you walk into an interview? Thatâ€™s exactly the approach Kyligence takes. By learning past query histories, analystsâ€™ behaviors, data profiles, and system logs, Kyligence automatically predicts the common questions people ask, and prepares answers based on its predictions. </p>



<p>This process is driven by its AI engine, and the more queries it processes, the more accurately it predicts the questions. The system analysts can further optimize the AI engineâ€™s work based on human knowledge about their business processes. </p>







<p><strong>Blazing Fast Processing Speed</strong></p>



<p>Knowing what questions users are going to ask is just the first step. The software needs to prepare the answers in time so they are available when users need them. This is the â€˜computeâ€™ part of precomputation technology. Kyligenceâ€™s Spark-based compute engine adopts many optimization techniques to speed up the building of aggregate indexes. </p>



<p>In addition to the typical batch mode, indexes can also be refreshed through a pre-scheduled incremental load, or real-time updates from messaging products such as Kafka. The fast processing speed allows users to incorporate the latest information into the aggregate index and gives them the most accurate picture of their business.</p>







<p><strong>Built for the Modern Data Platform</strong></p>



<p>Kyligenceâ€™s flagship products, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Kyligence Cloud (opens in a new tab)" href="https://kyligence.io/kyligence-cloud/" target="_blank">Kyligence Cloud</a> and <a href="https://kyligence.io/kyligence-enterprise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Kyligence Enterprise (opens in a new tab)">Kyligence Enterprise</a>, are built from the ground up for the modern data platform. They leverage the latest technologies to increase manageability and reduce infrastructure cost. </p>



<p>In the cloud, Kyligence can be deployed on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, either directly from the Kyligence portal or through the AWS and Azure Marketplace. It works with modern Cloud Data Warehouses as well as cloud data storage systems. Kyligence Cloud takes advantage of the elasticity of the cloud platform so that enterprises donâ€™t have to overpay for infrastructure and still have the capability to support usage spikes. </p>







<p><strong>Unlimited Scale</strong></p>



<p>Kyligenceâ€™s aggregate index is stored in Parquet files, a modern storage format best suited for analytics workloads. The aggregate index is stored either in cloud object stores or on Hadoop File Systems, when deployed on-premises. This type of distributed storage makes it possible to build an aggregate index 100s of times larger than other precomputation products. </p>



<p>One of our clients stores petabytes of data in the aggregate index so that <em>all</em> historical information is <em>always</em> available for their analysts. Businesses no longer have to choose between having complete access to historical data and the speed of their analytics.</p>







<p><strong>Constantly Improving</strong></p>



<p>Traditional precomputation products, such as OLAP Cubes, were very rigid. Adding an extra measure or dimension meant you had to rebuild the cubes, which lead to extra development costs and system downtime. Kyligence can handle the source schema changes and adjust measures and dimensions accordingly, and conveniently update the aggregate index. </p>



<p>The system also automatically adjusts the index to balance the often-conflicting requirements of query performance, storage space, update time, etc. Users can adjust these settings and the software will train itself to fine tune the indexes based on user behaviors.</p>







<h2>Summary<br></h2>



<p>In this blog, we looked at the history of precomputation and introduced Kyligenceâ€™s game-changing precomputation technology. This technology opens the doors for enterprises and their data scientists to conduct analytics at unprecedented speed and scale.</p>

        <p>Implementing OTA (Over The Air) firmware updates is a rite of passage for
firmware engineers. Device firmware update is a key component of most hardware
projects. Often, it is also one of the more complicated components.</p>

<p>I have worked on multiple firmware update systems over the year, and every time
I have learned something new. How do I package my images? How do I make sure I
don’t brick the device? How do I share information between my bootloader and my
application? Little by little all firmware engineers accumulate answers to
those questions and develop favored design patterns.</p>

<!-- excerpt start -->
<p>In this post, I share the device firmware update architecture I would implement
knowing everything I know now. I also highlight a few design patterns that are
particularly useful. The example comes with a fully functional example of a
multi-stage bootloader with DFU functionality.
<!-- excerpt end --></p>

<p>I learned some of these lessons in this post the hard way, and I hope I can spare
you and your colleagues a few sleepless nights spent debugging firmware update
problems in the wild!</p>

<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

<p>All the code in this post was written for the STM32F429 MCU by ST Micro. While
the examples run fine on the STM32F429i discovery board they were developed in
Renode, a popular MCU emulation platform.</p>

<p>You can find the complete code example for this blog post in the <a href="https://github.com/memfault/interrupt/tree/master/example/fwup-architecture">Interrupt
Github repository</a></p>

<h3 id="renode">Renode</h3>

<p>Since writing about Renode for Interrupt, I’ve been looking for an opportunity
to use it for another project. This blog post was the perfect pretext. If you
are not familiar with Renode, I recommend reading <a href="https://interrupt.memfault.com/intro-to-renode">my previous blog post</a> on
the topic.</p>

<p>Because we use true firmware images <code>.bin</code>’s rather than <code>elf</code> files in this post, I had to make two
change to the Renode configuration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>I used <code>sysbus LoadBinary $bin 0x8000000</code> rather than <code>LoadELF</code> to load the
firmware.</li>
  <li>I manually set the Vector Table Offset with <code>sysbus.cpu VectorTableOffset
0x8000000</code>. By default, Renode looks for the vector table at <code>0x0</code> which
different from the default behavior of the STM32.</li>
</ol>

<p>Additionally, I had to modify Renode slightly to enable software-controlled
resets. Cortex-M microcontrollers can be reset by writing to the AICR register,
which was not fully implemented in the emulator. As of this writing, this change
is still in review and not yet merged into the emulator. You can find the pull
request <a href="https://github.com/renode/renode-infrastructure/pull/15/files">on Github</a>.</p>

<p>Thankfully, building our own version of Renode is relatively
straightforward using <a href="https://renode.readthedocs.io/en/latest/advanced/building_from_sources.html">their
instructions</a>.</p>

<p>I updated my <code>start.sh</code> script to run my home-built Renode instance rather than
the installed binary:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/bin/sh</span>

<span>RENODE_EXE_PATH</span><span>=</span>~/code/renode/output/bin/Release/Renode.exe

mono64 <span>$RENODE_EXE_PATH</span> renode-config.resc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You will have to update this script to point at your own <code>Renode.exe</code>.</p>

<h3 id="toolchain">Toolchain</h3>

<p>I used the following tools to build my firmware:</p>
<ul>
  <li>GNU Make 4.2.1 as the build system</li>
  <li><code>arm-none-eabi-gcc</code> version 9.2.1 20191025 (release) as compiler</li>
</ul>

<p>Rather than the STM32Cube HAL, I used an open source MCU HAL called <code>libopencm3</code>
with excellent support for the STM32. I find it easier to use, and like that it
is open source and on Github. The included <code>Makefile</code> will clone <code>libopencm3</code>
during your first build.</p>

<h3 id="building--running-the-example">Building &amp; Running the Example</h3>

<p>The example can be built with Make. From the <code>examples/fwup-architecture</code>
directory:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$</span> make
<span>  LD            build/fwup-example-boot.elf
  OBJCOPY       build/fwup-example-boot.bin
  LD            build/fwup-example-app.elf
  OBJCOPY       build/fwup-example-app.bin
  XXD           build/app_bin.c
  LD            build/fwup-example-loader.elf
  OBJCOPY       build/fwup-example-loader.bin
  CAT           build/fwup-example.bin
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<p>After which you can call <code>./start.sh</code> to start Renode. You will need to type the
<code>start</code> command in the Renode window to get the emulation going.</p>

<h2 id="high-level-architecture">High-Level Architecture</h2>

<p>Over the years, I’ve come up with a set of basic requirements most DFU systems
should fulfill. Let’s walk through these one by one and iteratively design our
system.</p>

<p>We start with the simplest possible description of what we want to achieve with

<p>This is not a practical design. For one, self-modifying code is easy
to mess up. Let’s see how we might modify this architecture to get to something
we’re happy with.</p>

<h3 id="dfu-should-be-separate-from-the-application">DFU should be separate from the application</h3>

<p>The only time I ever broke DFU on a device, I did it without changing a line of
code related to DFU. Unbeknownst to me, our DFU processes accidentally depended on an
uninitialized variable which up until then had always ended up being <code>0</code>.
Inevitably a new version reshuffled the content of the stack, and all of a
sudden our uninitialized variable held a “1”. This prevented DFU from taking
place.<sup id="fnref:chris-dfu-debug"><a href="#fn:chris-dfu-debug">1</a></sup></p>

<p>The moral to this story: keep your DFU process and your application code
separate. Firmware update code is critical and should not be changed unless
absolutely necessary. Separating application code from firmware update code
allows us to update our application code without risking problems with DFU.</p>

<p>How do we modify our architecture to meet this requirement? We simply split the
firmware into a “Loader” and an “Application”. The loader verifies the
application, runs it, and can update it.</p>

<h3 id="dfu-code-should-be-updatable">DFU code should be updatable</h3>

<p>While we want to update our DFU code as little as possible, updating it should
still be <em>possible</em>. Inevitably we will find a bug in our firmware update code
which we must fix. We may want to change our memory map to allocate more code
space to our app, or to rotate a security key baked into our Loader.</p>

<p>But where should the code that updates our Loader live? It cannot be in the
application, or else we would violate the previous principle. It cannot be in
the Loader itself either. That leaves one option: a third program tasked with
updating the loader. We’ll call it the “Updater”.</p>

<p>The Updater is loaded by the Loader, perhaps when a specific input is received.
All it knows how to do is update the Loader.</p>

<h3 id="dfu-should-use-minimal-code-space">DFU should use minimal code space</h3>

<p>Every firmware project I’ve ever worked on has run out of code space. At Pebble,
we spent months porting our 3.0 firmware to the original watch; most of that
time was spent slimming down the code so it could fit within the 512KB of Flash
available on that device<sup id="fnref:pebble-3"><a href="#fn:pebble-3">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>With that in mind, we should make sure our Loader and Updater do not take more
code space than absolutely necessary. Are there ways we can update our design to
use less code space? Absolutely!</p>

<p>The key insight here is that the Updater needs to run very rarely and that it
never needs to coexist with the application. We can, therefore, use the same
“slot” in flash for both the Updater and the Application. The main tradeoff here
is that our Loader update flow becomes more complicated as we need to do a DFU
to get the Updater, then another to update the loader, then a third to load the
application back. In other words:</p>

<p>Go to Loader → DFU Updater in the Application’s place → Load Updater →
DFU the new Loader → Reboot into Loader → DFU the Application back in its slot</p>

<p>We can tolerate this complexity because it should not be used often.</p>

<h3 id="dfu-failures-should-not-brick-the-device">DFU failures should not brick the device</h3>

<p>This one should be obvious. Whether there is a bug in our DFU process, or a power loss event while we are
writing firmware, the device should be able to recover. It may operate in a
degraded mode for a bit, but it should at least be able to update itself back to
a good state.</p>

<p>Our design already does a reasonable job of this: if we lose power in the middle
of an Application update, we can reboot into our Loader and start our update
again. There are however two failure modes we must deal with.</p>

<p>First, in the event we lose power while updating the Loader, we could find
ourselves with no valid image at the address the chip boots from (<code>0x0</code> by
default for Cortex-M, but aliased to <code>0x80000000</code> on STM32). The solution is to
add a small, immutable bootloader whose sole job is to sit at the start address
and load our Loader.</p>

<p>Second, what happens if we find ourselves without a functional Loader? We would
want to fall back to the Updater. Here again, the small bootloader is the
solution. In the event no valid Loader is found, it should try to load whatever
is found in the “Application” slot.</p>

<p>In summary, we end up with four programs:</p>

<ol>
  <li>An immutable Bootloader whose sole job is to load the Loader, and fallback to
another image if the Loader is invalid.</li>
  <li>A Loader that can verify our Application image, load it, and update it.</li>
  <li>An Application which does not do any updates itself</li>
  <li>An Updater that temporarily replaces the Application and can update the
Loader.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is not the only valid firmware update architecture, but it avoids many of
the pitfalls of DFU without consuming too much code space.</p>

<h2 id="design-patterns--recipes">Design Patterns &amp; Recipes</h2>

<p>I have put together a full implementation of the Bootloader, the Loader, and the
Application in the <a href="https://github.com/memfault/interrupt/tree/master/example/fwup-architecture">Interrupt

repository</a>.
While discussing every line in detail is outside of the scope of this
conversation, I want to highlight a few patterns I have learned over the years.
These include ways to package firmware images, write them to flash, share data
between programs, and more!</p>

June 24, 2020 | https://remotedevdaily.com/python-django-2-upgrade-tutorial-common-problems/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://remotedevdaily.com/python-django-2-upgrade-tutorial-common-problems/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-957"><div><div><p>This tutorial will cover some of the common errors that you encounter when upgrading your Python Django application to Django 2.</p><p>Yes, Django 3 has been released, but it still doesn’t have an LTS version, so I imagine with Django 2.2 still supported until April 2022, Django 2 is still the version of choice for many individuals and companies.</p><p>When I upgraded a few projects from Django 1.11 to Django 2, I was bombarded with a number of different errors due to some breaking changes introduced in Django 2. So, I thought I would provide a record of the errors I encountered and how I fixed them.</p><h3>1. No module named ‘django.core.urlresolvers’</h3><p>In Django, it’s pretty common to use the reverse function to get the path of a url from its name.</p><p>The problematic line was the following:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br></p></td><td><p>from django.core.urlresolvers import reverse</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>The <strong>urlresolver</strong> module was removed in Django 2 and can no longer be used. Instead, you can use the <strong>resolve</strong> function from the <strong>urls</strong> module as such:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br></p></td><td><p>from django.urls import reverse</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>Awesome! One down. Let’s continue.</p><h3>2. missing 1 required positional argument: ‘on_delete’</h3><p>Django 2 now requires the on_delete keyword to be specified for foreign key fields that are used in your models. Previously, it would default to models.CASCADE.</p><p>In order to resolve this problem, you’re going to need to add the on_delete keyword arguement to every foreign key field. You also need to specify on_delete for the <strong>OneToOneField</strong> as well.</p><p>Your options for the on_delete keyword argument include:</p><ul><li>models.CASCADE</li><li>models.PROTECT</li><li>models.SET_NULL</li><li>models.SET_DEFAULT</li><li>models.SET()</li><li>models.DO_NOTHING</li></ul><p>You can read about the values you can pass to on_delete in the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.ForeignKey.on_delete">Django documentation</a>.</p><p>Here’s an example of what specifying the on_delete keyword looks like:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br></p></td><td><p>my_field = models.ForeignKey(MyModel, on_delete=models.CASCADE)</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>OK, moving on to the next error.</p><h3>3. Specifying a namespace in include() without providing an app_name</h3><p>This error is caused by a change in the api for Django’s <strong>include</strong> function. We need to make sure the <strong>include</strong> function is being passed the correct arguments.</p><p>First, you need to go to the urls.py file you are trying to include and add a variable called <strong>app_name</strong>. You can add it anywhere in the file, but I would recommend putting it at the top after your imports.</p><pre>
<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br>4<br>5<br>6<br>7<br></p></td><td><div><p># my_app/urls.py</p><p>

... your imports</p><p>

app_name="my_app"</p><p>

... rest of your code</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>

</pre><p>Now, go to the urls.py file that includes the other file. You can now add the <strong>app_name</strong> you specified as the second parameter to the include function.</p><p>Here is an example:</p><pre>
<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br></p></td><td><p>re_path(r"^api/my_path", include("my_app.urls","my_app")),</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>

</pre><h3>4. There are duplicate field(s) in fieldsets[][]</h3><p>In my case, there was an issue with my custom <strong>ModelAdmin</strong> class. It seems Django used to allow duplicate fields before, but now it does not.</p><p>Simply remove the duplicate fields from your custom admin class and you shouldn’t have any issues.</p><h3>5. JSONField default should be a callable instead of an instance so that it’s not shared between all field instances</h3><p>This is an issue you will only encounter if you are using PostgreSQL along with the PostgreSQL JSONField.</p><p>Basically, Django only wants you to pass a callable as the default value for this field. This is to avoid the default being shared among all objects which could lead to problems in the case of modification.</p><ul><li><p>If your default is <strong>{}</strong>, replace that with <strong>dict</strong>.</p></li><li><p>If your default is <strong>[]</strong>, replace that with <strong>list</strong>.</p></li></ul><h3>6. request.user.is_authenticated() TypeError: ‘bool’ object is not callable</h3><p>In Django 2, <strong>is_authenticated</strong> can no longer be called as a function. It is a boolean property and you need to call it like a property as follows:</p><div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br></p></td><td><p>request.user.is_authenticated</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div><h3>7. Optional Changes</h3><p>You are probably using the <strong>url</strong> function from <strong>django.conf.urls</strong>. Your code probably looks something like the following:</p><pre>
<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br>3<br></p></td><td><div><p>from django.conf.urls import url</p><p>

url(r^"books/$", views.BookList.as_view()),</p></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div>

</pre><p>The <strong>url</strong> function is an alias to <strong>django.urls.re_path()</strong> and it’s likely to be deprecated according to the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.2/ref/urls/#url">Django documentation</a>.</p><p>I highly recommend changing to <strong>import re_path</strong> to avoid future issues when the function is in fact deprecated.</p><p>Rewritten with <strong>re_path</strong>, the example from above would become:</p><pre>
<div><table><tbody><tr><td><p>1<br>2<br></p></td><td><p>from django.urls import re_path<br>
re_path(r^"books/$", views.BookList.as_view()),</p></td></tr></tbody></table></div>

</pre><p>And that about sums it up. I hope that this helped you have a smooth upgrade to Django 2.</p><h3>Still Need Some Help?</h3><p>If you are confused upgrading your Django project, or have any other issues, consider signing up for codementor where you can get help from a number of different mentors, including myself.

                        <p>
                            Simulation is a crucial component of any robotic system.
                            In order to simulate correctly, we need to write complex rules of the environment:
                            how dynamic agents behave, and how the actions of each of the agents affect the behavior of others.
                            In this paper, we aim to learn a simulator by simply watching an agent interact with an environment.
                            We focus on graphics games as a proxy of the real environment.
                            We introduce GameGAN, a generative model that learns to visually imitate a desired game by ingesting screenplay and keyboard actions during training.
                            Given a key pressed by the agent, GameGAN "renders" the next screen using a carefully designed generative adversarial network.
                            Our approach offers key advantages over existing work: we design a memory module that builds an internal map of the environment, allowing for the agent to return to previously visited locations with high visual consistency.
                            In addition, GameGAN is able to disentangle static and dynamic components within an image making the behavior of the model more interpretable, and relevant for downstream tasks that require explicit reasoning over dynamic elements.
                            This enables many interesting applications such as swapping different components of the game to build new games that do not exist.

                                We are interested in training a game simulator that can model both deterministic and stochastic nature of the environment. GameGAN is composed of three modules. 
                                1) <b>The dynamics engine </b> maintains an internal state variable which is recurrently updated. 2) For environments that require long-term consistency, an external <b>memory module</b> is used to remember what the model has generated so far
                                3) Finally, <b>the rendering engine</b> is used to decode the output image at each time instance. 
                                All modules are neural networks and trained end-to-end.

                        GameGAN learns to follow the user command - how Pacman moves - as well as other rules of the game.
                          It turns ghosts to purple when a capsule is consumed, and also learns their policy.
                          You can see that ghosts chase Pacman in the normal state, but they
                          start to run away when a capsule is consumed.

    <title>Kindleberry Wireless</title>
  
  
  
    
      <p>An updated, wireless version of the <a href="http://www.ponnuki.net/2012/09/kindleberry-pi/">kindleberry</a> using the kindle paperwhite</p>
      <p>
        <img src="https://maxogden.com/media/kindleberry-sun.png">
      </p>
      <p>Recently I got to go down to Australia to attend an awesome conference called <a href="http://campjs.com/">CampJS</a>. It isn't really a conference, actually, but instead a bunch of programmers in the woods for a few days hacking on side projects and learning new things. Getting out of the big city was really refreshing and at the same time made me realize how badly my glossy screened laptop works in the great outdoors.
      </p>
      <p>
        It got me wondering if there existed a laptop that was designed for hacking in direct sunlight... something that had a ridiculously long battery life and was still readable in high brightness situations. Instead I stumbled upon a more awesome solution: the <a href="http://www.ponnuki.net/2012/09/kindleberry-pi/">kindleberry</a>, a combination of the <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a> and the Amazon Kindle.
      </p>
      <p>The advantages of the kindleberry are pretty desirable for me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Week-long battery life: the pi and the kindle both have low power ARM processors so you can use any USB charger to power them</li>
        <li>The kindle screen is designed for use in direct sunlight</li>
        <li>The whole setup is small enough to carry around in a pouch inside my normal backpack along with my normal laptop. I work from coffee shops in Oakland and often move around by bicycle during the day -- now I can work from almost anywhere and still be at least a little productive.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><img src="https://maxogden.com/media/kindle-table.png"></p>
      <p>The idea of the kindleberry is to have the kindle just act as screen and have it log into an ssh session on the pi. Then you can plug a keyboard into the pi and it when you type it will show up on the kindle screen. This approach pretty much only works for terminals so you can't do anything except edit code in vim. I like this limitation as it gives me an option that is free from distraction for writing long pieces of code or text.
      </p><p>Since the screen on the kindle is e-ink it has a slower-than-normal refresh rate. If you are a touch typist this shouldn't be an issue, I would recon that between the wifi latency and the screen latency there is a ~200ms screen delay, but it doesn't bother me at all when typing.</p>
      <p>
        The first problem I ran into was that the kindleberry instructions only worked on Kindle 3 devices, and the newest generation of Kindles (e.g. the paperwhite) are Kindle 5's. While the end result is similar this just means that essentially all of the steps to set up and install the peripherals correctly were different, including the terminal software that runs on the kindle. The other issue was that I wanted a totally wireless version: no cords between the keyboard, kindle or pi.
      </p>
      <p>Here is a list of physical parts that I am using in my setup:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Raspberry Pi Model B with a 3D printed fork of <a href="http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:24945">this case</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VNKNEG/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">8gb SD card</a> to put the raspbian OS onto</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007OZNUCE/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Kindle Paperwhite</a> cause it has the fastest e-ink refresh rate of all the kindles + a nice backlight</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005DLDO4U/ref=oh_details_o03_s00_i03?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">Apple Wireless Keyboard</a> because I use a mac laptop and the layout is the same</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0018O9JIG/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">IOGEAR GBU421 bluetooth USB</a> because it is small and works on raspbian</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MTTJOY/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1&amp;redirect=true">Edimax EW-7811Un wifi USB</a> because it is small and works on raspbian</li>

        <li><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008YRG5JQ/ref=oh_details_o06_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1">EasyAcc USB LiPo battery pack</a> a friend recommended this and said he ran a raspi off of it for a week</li>
        <li><a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16833704134">TP-LINK TL-WR702N Travel Router</a> for establishing wireless connectivity between the kindle and the pi</li>

      </ul>
      <p><img src="https://maxogden.com/media/kindleberry-detail.png"></p>
      <p>
        For the software side of things, the best resource is <a href="https://gist.github.com/rvagg/5095506">this nice tutorial</a> that Rod Vagg has put together for getting the paperwhite set up with a terminal emulator. He even compiled node.js 0.10.0 for the kindle as well!
      </p>
      <p>My pi is configured to boot up and join the wifi hotspot that the TP-LINK router creates, then I can have the kindle communicate to the pi over wifi. There is probably a way to ad-hoc them together automatically but having a little hotspot is handy for other things like too like mobile web app development.

<p>For the last few years, Microsoft has stated during event keynotes and in other places that Linux is a rapidly growing operating system (OS) being used within Microsoft Azure. They had proudly stated that 50% of new VMs running in Azure were running Linux. (This is the latest stat I remember Microsoft saying publicly a while back already.) Well, I came across an interesting<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/adirron_linuxonazure-progress-activity-6665502370795003905-DY1G" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> infographic recently (thanks to Adir Ron) </a>that gives some statistics and other information regarding the percentage and overall usage of the Linux OS in Microsoft Azure.</p>



<p>Based on the past growth of Linux adoption in Microsoft Azure, I’ve long suspected that Microsoft Azure hosts more Linux VMs than Windows VMs. This infographic looks to shed some light on this most likely being true, as it states “More than 50% of VM cores runs Linux on Azure”.</p>



<p>Before you look at the infographic itself, here are a few stats listed in it that I’d like to point out:</p>



<ul><li>More than 50% of VM cores runs Linux on Azure</li><li>Linux-based images comprise 60% of Azure Marketplace images</li><li>Top 100 Microsoft customers deploy Linux workloads on Azure</li><li>Azure Tuned Kernels provide 25% faster network throughput</li><li>Microsoft supports all major Linux distros, like: Red Hat, SUSE, Ubuntu, Oracle Linux, Debian, CentOS, CoreOS, and OpenSUSE <em>(Related: Azure also supports FreeBSD)</em></li><li>Azure offers two natively supported managed Kubernetes orchestration services: Azure Kubernetes Service, and Azure Red Hat OpenShift</li></ul>



<p>Here’s the “Did you know? Linux is the fastest growing platform on Azure” <a href="https://build5nines.com/tag/infographic/">infographic</a> below:</p>

<p>We get the best performance when sending mesh data to the GPU in a single operation. In this post, I present the numpy library that can create such data.</p>



<p><em>This post is part of the <a href="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/series/opengl-2d-facade/">OpenGL 2D Facade series</a></em></p>



<h2>Vertices and Python lists</h2>



<p>In the previous post, we created rectangles thanks to the enumeration of 2D vertices:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">glVertex2f(-0.5, -0.5)
glVertex2f(-0.5, 0.5)
glVertex2f(0.5, 0.5)
glVertex2f(0.5, -0.5)</pre>



<p>We could store all these vertices in a Python list of lists:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">vertices = [
    [-0.5, -0.5],
    [-0.5, 0.5],
    [0.5, 0.5],
    [0.5, -0.5]
]</pre>



<p>Each item of the&nbsp;<code>vertices</code>&nbsp;list is a list with two float numbers. We can read each one using brackets&nbsp;<code>[]</code>. For instance, we can print all of them in the following way:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">for i in range(4):
    print(vertices[i])</pre>



<p>It leads to these messages in the console:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group=""> [-0.5, -0.5]
 [-0.5, 0.5]
 [0.5, 0.5]
 [0.5, -0.5]</pre>



<p>To read one float value in each item of the&nbsp;<code>vertices</code>&nbsp;list, we must use brackets a second time. For instance, we can print float values in the following way:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">for i in range(4):
    print("x =", vertices[i][0], "y =", vertices[i][1])</pre>



<p>We get this display:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">x = -0.5 y = -0.5
x = -0.5 y = 0.5
x = 0.5 y = 0.5
x = 0.5 y = -0.5</pre>



<h2>Numpy arrays</h2>



<p>Unfortunately, we can’t send Python list to a GPU, but we can with Numpy arrays.</p>



<p>First import Numpy:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">import numpy as np</pre>



<p>Note that I use an alias&nbsp;<code>np</code>. It means that, instead of writing&nbsp;<code>numpy.func()</code>&nbsp;we only need to write&nbsp;<code>np.func()</code>.</p>



<p>We can create Numpy arrays from Python list of lists:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">vertices = np.array([
    [-0.5, -0.5],
    [-0.5, 0.5],
    [0.5, 0.5],
    [0.5, -0.5]
], dtype=np.float32)</pre>



<p>The second argument&nbsp;<code>dtype=np.float32</code> tells Numpy that we want IEEE 754 32-bit float numbers, the one expected by OpenGL. There is also another option&nbsp;<code>order</code>&nbsp;that defines the order of values: row-major or column-major. The default value is row-major, the one excepted by OpenGL.</p>



<p>We can access values in a Numpy array with only of pair of brackets. For a 2D-array, the syntax is&nbsp;<code>array[i, j]</code>&nbsp;and is equivalent to&nbsp;<code>list[i][j]</code>&nbsp;with Python lists. We can get the same display as in the previous example with this syntax:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">for i in range(4):
    print("x =", vertices[i, 0], "y =", vertices[i, 1])</pre>



<p>All Numpy arrays know their size. At any time, you can ask for it with the&nbsp;<code>shape</code>&nbsp;attribute:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">print(vertices.shape)</pre>



<p>It displays (4, 2).</p>



<p>If you only need the size of one dimension, use the brackets:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">vertexCount = vertices.shape[0]
vertexDim = vertices.shape[1]</pre>



<p>In our example,&nbsp;<code>vertexCount</code>&nbsp;equals 4, and&nbsp;<code>vertexDim</code>&nbsp;equals 2.</p>



<p>Numpy arrays have many features that allow complex computations. I’ll show examples throughout this series.</p>



<h2>Vertex indexing</h2>



<p>Meshes are made of faces; in our case, since we focus on tileset-based 2D rendering, these faces are rectangles (or quads). Each face has four vertices, like the ones in the Numpy array we created in the previous section.</p>



<p>A first approach to create all these meshes is to define four vertices for each face. For instance, for two faces/quads/rectangles:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">vertices = np.array([
    [-0.5, -0.5],    # Face 0 vertex 0
    [-0.5, 0.5],     # Face 0 vertex 1
    [0.5, 0.5],      # Face 0 vertex 2
    [0.5, -0.5],     # Face 0 vertex 3
    [-0.3, -0.7],    # Face 1 vertex 0
    [-0.3, 0.3],     # Face 1 vertex 1
    [0.7, 0.3],      # Face 1 vertex 2
    [0.7, -0.7]      # Face 1 vertex 3
], dtype=np.float32)</pre>



<p>It is fine as long as there is no shared vertex between faces. In the opposite case, we lose memory, and more importantly, some processing is more complicated to run.</p>



<p>For instance, if we want to create a grid of tiles:</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/02_grid.png" alt="2D Mesh grid with vertex indexing" width="279" height="172" srcset="https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/02_grid.png 622w, https://www.patternsgameprog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/02_grid-300x185.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 279px) 100vw, 279px"></figure></div>



<p>You can see that there are three types of vertices:</p>



<ul><li>Vertices that belong to a single face (0, 2, 6, 8);</li><li>Vertices that belong to two faces (1, 3, 5, 7);</li><li>Vertices that belong to four faces (4);</li></ul>



<p>With vertex indexing, we can describe such shares. It requires two arrays: the first one with vertex coordinates, and the second one with vertex indices.</p>



<p>Let’s take the two previous rectangles to create such an index. There is no shared vertex, so I hope it is easier to understand.</p>



<p>The vertex array with coordinates in the same, and the corresponding faces/vertex indices is the following one:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">faces = np.array([
    [0, 1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6, 7]
], dtype=np.uint)</pre>



<p>The first four indices (0, 1, 2, 3) point to the first four vertices. The last four indices (4, 5, 6, 7) point to the last four vertices.</p>



<h2>Render from vertex index</h2>



<p>We can render the rectangles using the&nbsp;<code>vertices</code>&nbsp;coordinates and the&nbsp;<code>faces</code>&nbsp;vertex indices:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">glBegin(GL_QUADS)
for faceIndex in range(faces.shape[0]):
    for vertexIndex in faces[faceIndex]:
        color = colors[vertexIndex]
        glColor3f(color[0], color[1], color[2])
        vertex = vertices[vertexIndex]
        glVertex2f(vertex[0], vertex[1])
glEnd()</pre>



<p>Lines 1 and 8 start then end the rendering of rectangles.</p>



<p>Line 2 iterates through the faces. Since we have two faces in our example,&nbsp;<code>faceIndex</code>&nbsp;gets value 0 then 1.</p>



<p>Line 3 iterates through vertex indices in the current face. During the first iteration, when&nbsp;<code>faceIndex</code>&nbsp;equals 0, vertexIndex gets values 0, 1, 2, and then 3. During the second iteration, when&nbsp;<code>faceIndex</code>&nbsp;equals 1, vertexIndex gets values 4, 5, 6, and then 7.</p>



<p>Lines 4-5 set the color of the next vertex. I created another Numpy array&nbsp;<code>colors</code>&nbsp;with (red, green, blue) values for each vertex.</p>



<p>Lines 6-7 render a vertex. Note that could also write:</p>



<pre data-enlighter-language="python" data-enlighter-theme="" data-enlighter-highlight="" data-enlighter-linenumbers="" data-enlighter-lineoffset="" data-enlighter-title="" data-enlighter-group="">glVertex2f(vertices[vertexIndex, 0], vertices[vertexIndex, 1])</pre>

<p>This program renders the same rectangle as before but uses vertex indices. Note that you can play with the content of the Numpy arrays to change the rendering:</p>

<p>Microsoft has already brought Microsoft Teams to Linux as the first Microsoft Office app to officially be supported on Linux. We are still waiting for the full Microsoft Office suite of desktop applications to be released for Linux (assuming these will be). However, with the help of an open source project created by <a href="https://boxofcables.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hayden Barnes</a>, you can easily install a web app wrapper on Ubuntu that gives a more “native” way to run the Microsoft Office 365 Web Apps on Ubuntu.</p>



<br><h2>Office 365 Web Apps on Ubuntu Linux</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://github.com/sirredbeard/unofficial-webapp-office" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unofficial-webapp-office</a> open source project provides a minimalist web browser that embeds the Office 365 Web Apps in your Ubuntu Linux environment. This project is not supported by Microsoft, and is a community project created by Hayden Barnes to provide us all an alternative for running Office 365 apps on Ubuntu Linux until Microsoft releases officially supported versions themselves.</p>



<p>The project includes web app wrappers, based on QtWebEngine, that bring the following apps to your Ubuntu Linux Desktop experience:</p>



<ul><li>Outlook</li><li>Word</li><li>Excel</li><li>PowerPoint</li><li>OneDrive</li><li>OneNote</li></ul>

<p>How long <em>does</em> it take to prototype a startup? When we look at a product like <a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a>, it’s hard to imagine scheduling meetings without it. But when Tope Awotona first had the idea, it wasn’t obvious that it would take off. He had to build a prototype.</p>

<p>Prototyping is always a risk – it’s easy to spend months building something that nobody wants. But if you <em>have</em> a prototype, those conversations with initial customers are so much easier. So we’re setting out to see how fast we can get that crucial prototype. If we can get it down to days, or even hours, we’re onto a winner:</p>

<div>
    
    <div>
        <p>Launching a mediocre product as soon as possible, and then talking to customers and iterating, is much better than waiting to build the “perfect” product.</p>

<p>Our secret weapon is <a href="https://anvil.works/">Anvil</a>. It’s a platform for building web apps without the fuss: it’s got a visual interface designer, client- and server-side code is all in Python, and it deploys to the cloud with one click.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="the-build">The Build</h2>

<p>I’ll walk you through the design process, show you some screenshots, and give a breakdown of how long each stage took:</p>

<h3 id="1-google-integration-and-user-setup-30-minutes">1. Google Integration and User Setup (30 minutes)</h3>

<p>Calendly connects to your calendar to automatically check availability, so you don’t need those endless back-and-forth emails. Integrating an OAuth flow with Google Calendar could take all day, but Anvil’s <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/integrations/google">Google integration</a> makes it really simple:</p>

<div title="Client-side Python" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>anvil</span><span>.</span><span>google</span><span>.</span><span>auth</span><span>.</span><span>login</span><span>([</span><span>'https://www.googleapis.com/auth/calendar'</span><span>])</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>That gives us a login screen:</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/calendly/google_auth_screen.png" alt="Google OAuth Screen"> <figcaption>
                <p>Google OAuth Screen</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>And now we have the OAuth tokens to use with the Calendar API:
</p><div title="Server-side Python" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>refresh_token</span> <span>=</span> <span>anvil</span><span>.</span><span>google</span><span>.</span><span>auth</span><span>.</span><span>get_user_refresh_token</span><span>()</span>
<span>access_token</span>  <span>=</span> <span>anvil</span><span>.</span><span>google</span><span>.</span><span>auth</span><span>.</span><span>refresh_access_token</span><span>(</span><span>refresh_token</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>To keep the refresh token secure from prying eyes, we encrypt it with Anvil’s <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/security/encrypting-secret-data">Secrets Service</a>, then store it in a <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/data-tables">Data Table</a>:</p>

<div title="Server-side Python" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>user</span><span>[</span><span>'refresh_token'</span><span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>anvil</span><span>.</span><span>secrets</span><span>.</span><span>encrypt_with_key</span><span>(</span><span>'token_key'</span><span>,</span> <span>refresh_token</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div></div>


<hr>

<h3 id="2-basic-interaction-1-hour-15-minutes">2. Basic Interaction (1 hour 15 minutes)</h3>

<p>There are two parties here - the Organiser, who is advertising their availability, and the Attendee, who is picking a meeting time with them.</p>

<p>We make a <strong>Settings</strong> page, so the Organiser can specify the length of their meeting slots, and give them a unique URL they can provide to their attendees:</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/calendly/beta_settings.png" alt="The Organiser configures their settings"> <figcaption>
                <p>The Organiser configures their settings</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>When the Attendee clicks that link, they get the <strong>Booking</strong> page, where they can choose a meeting (at any time, for now), then provide their details to confirm their slot.</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/calendly/attendee_details.png" alt="The Attendee enters their details"> <figcaption>
                <p>The Attendee enters their details</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>We create a calendar event by POSTing to the <a href="https://developers.google.com/calendar/concepts">Google Calendar API</a>, using the Organiser’s OAuth tokens. (Google’s API docs are somewhat confusing, but the <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/integrations/google/google-rest-apis">Anvil docs</a> show us how.)</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/calendly/calendar_event.png" alt="Calendar event"> <figcaption>
                <p>Calendar event</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>We then send an email to tell the Organiser about the new booking:<br>(Sending email is <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/email/sending_and_receiving#sending-email">one line of code</a> with Anvil – it’s all built in!)

</p><div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/calendly/email_example.png" alt="Example email"> <figcaption>
                <p>Example email</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<hr>

<h3 id="3-adjust-availability-55-mins">3. Adjust Availability (55 mins)</h3>

<p>Of course, the real magic of Calendly is that the Organiser can specify their availability, and we avoid clashing with existing appointments.</p>

<p>Let’s tackle the first one first: We need a page for the Organiser to set up the times they’re willing to meet:</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil-website-static.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/learn/examples/calendly/availability.gif" alt="Booking a meeting"> <figcaption>
                <p>Booking a meeting</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<p>The data structure was the tricky part here, but Python’s <code>datetime</code> module simplified this process – especially as we can use <a href="https://anvil.works/python-browser">Python in the browser</a> too!</p>

<p>I didn’t need to keep translating from Python <code>datetime</code> objects, to JSON, to Javascript <code>Date</code> objects, and back again. This melted my brain a lot less than it might have done.</p>

<hr>

<h3 id="4-timezone-awareness-15-minutes">4. Timezone Awareness (15 minutes)</h3>

<p>Timezones are a minefield. Having an Organiser in one timezone and an Attendee in a different timezone is a real headache – we can’t sensibly ask the Attendee to mentally convert the times in their head!</p>

<p>Nobody wants to write their own timezone module, but Python has <code>pytz</code>, which is available on the Anvil server, and we can use Anvil’s <a href="https://anvil.works/docs/server/dealing-with-timezones">timezone library</a> to capture the timezone of the browser:</p>

<div title="Client-side Python" tabindex="0"><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>import</span> <span>anvil.tz</span>
<span>browser_tz</span> <span>=</span> <span>anvil</span><span>.</span><span>tz</span><span>.</span><span>tzlocal</span><span>()</span></code></pre></div></div>


<p>So if the Organiser is in the UK, and available from 12pm-3pm on Thursdays, and I’m in Malaysia…</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/calendly/timezone.png" alt="Pick a slot &amp;ndash; in my timezone!"> <figcaption>
                <p>Pick a slot – in my timezone!</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<hr>

<h3 id="5-avoiding-calendar-clashes-20-minutes">5. Avoiding Calendar Clashes (20 minutes)</h3>

<p>A booking system would be useless if it allowed two bookings at the same time! So we use the Google Calendar API to get a list of events when the Organiser is ‘busy’, and only offer Attendees slots when the Organiser is available:</p>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/calendly/calendar_busy_1.png" alt="Prior engagement"> <figcaption>
                <p>Prior engagement</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>


<div>
    <figure><img src="https://anvil.works/learn/examples/img/calendly/calendar_busy_2.png" alt="No slots due to prior engagement"> <figcaption>
                <p>No slots due to prior engagement</p>
            </figcaption>
    </figure>
</div>

<hr>

<h2 id="total-time-3-hours-15-minutes">Total Time: 3 hours 15 minutes</h2>

<p>And that’s it! We’ve prototyped a fully functioning booking system, and <strong>it’s not even lunchtime</strong>.</p>

<p>We can spend the afternoon showing it to potential users, and watching them interact with it. If they get stuck on something, we can rebuild it tomorrow!</p>

<![CDATA[Why is Customer Onboarding still handled with spreadsheets in 2020?]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="js-article">
    

<p>For a majority of B2B SaaS companies, the first thing a customer touches after signing a contract is a spreadsheet detailing what all they need to do! I’ve seen this as the standard at every startup I’ve worked for - and I’m sick of it. You and I both know our customers are as well.</p>

<h2 id="my-crash-course-in-customer-onboarding">My crash course in Customer Onboarding</h2>

<p>I’ll never forget the first time I learned that I had to share a spreadsheet with every new customer as part of the Customer Onboarding Process. It was my first job at an organization where the ACV for a customer was over $50k/year.  I was shown where the templates for these assets lived in Google Drive and what all I would have to change for each new customer I was assigned. Along with this, I was expected to manually update fields in our CRM to help us track our Customer Onboardings.</p>

<p>I was then drilled on this process for two weeks to ensure I understood how to do this. Here we were signing multi-year contracts for non-paltry sums of money and the first thing we were expected to do was send over a Google Sheet that looked like something a college intern had put together.</p>

<p>This “sheet” was all we provided for our customers to get started with using our “cutting-edge” solution. To top it off, my manager informed us that they were using the data we logged into our CRM as a proxy for measuring each Success Managers “capacity” aka “how many customers can you handle before it’s too much”. This whole experience left me feeling like we may not have been using tools and technology as effectively to  own and present a world-class customer onboarding experience.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it was only after I left that company and joined another that I discovered that almost all Success orgs follow this exact process and even consider it a best practice!</p>

<figure>
    <img src="https://blog.simplemnt.com/posts/customer-onboarding-with-spreadsheets/spreadsheet.png" alt="onboarding spreadsheet"> <figcaption>
            <p>This spreadsheet TOTALLY gets me excited to start with your product /s</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>


<h2 id="what-s-at-stake">What’s at stake?</h2>

<p>This approach presents a myriad of challenges to both your customer and your employee experience. For new customers, this spreadsheet becomes yet another headache for them to manage and attend to on top of their daily workload. For your success managers, this spreadsheet presents another data source that needs to be manually copied over into the CRM, another potential opportunity for misalignment amongst customer stakeholders, and more manual work to upkeep and manage.</p>

<p>With so much time and energy spent ensuring proper data hygiene and manually adhering the process, it is almost unfair to expect a CSM to also provide a proactive customer experience, prevent churn and unlock account growth from their portfolios.  For team leads, this spreadsheet becomes one of 100s that need to be tracked and measured manually with vigilant upkeep in order to properly gather insights on your onboarding process. While this makes sense in a perfect world. In reality, due to the entropic nature of most scaling organizations, these manual steps quickly get overlooked or forgotten.</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-customer-onboarding-so-difficult">What makes Customer Onboarding so difficult</h2>

<p>The Customer Onboarding Process is a cross-functional process at its core and is meant to be shared equally amongst Sales, Product and Customer Success. Unfortunately, due to the respective incentives of these organizations, there is a natural tension that comes up in terms of who owns the onboarding process (something we’ve <a href="https://blog.simplemnt.com/posts/the-sales-to-customer-success-handoff/">discussed in another post</a>) with Customer Success generally getting the short-end of the straw. The Product Organization always has higher priority features to work on and the Sales team isn’t interested because an investment in the onboarding process does not net them more new customers. This is why spreadsheets end up being the most common strategy organizations use to “fill the gaps” of the Customer Onboarding Process.</p>

<p>The cross-functional nature of this process also makes it very difficult to find out of box solutions that can properly encompass the Customer Onboarding process. This presents a huge dependence on proper systems integration to ensure you’re able to provide the best customer onboarding experience possible.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be this way!</p>

<h2 id="what-can-we-do-about-it">What can we do about it?</h2>

<p>If an organization properly integrates their internal systems and processes, they can present all of their internal teams as one unified team focused on proactively driving their customers to their desired outcomes. The best part is, these organizations can integrate their team to feel like an extension of their product experience; proactive, slick and futuristic. Properly integrating these systems also helps set up your product team to quickly and nimbly build and test new features that augment and automate key parts of your customer experience without needing to completely go off-roadmap.</p>

<p>The first option to create this integrated experience is to lean on your engineering team to build it in house. However, this can have many challenges. Pulling engineers to build your onboarding flow instead of new features can slow down product growth. And when the product does change, so does the onboarding, creating perpetual maintenance and overhead costs. I’ve seen these projects take multiple quarters and engineering hours just to be turned down in a few years due to lack of flexibility.</p>

<p>The second option is to tie together multiple tools to approximate the integrated experience. Using tools like Asana, TypeForm, AirTable, and Zapier, you can create a much more organized process without the engineering overhead and heavy upfront costs. However, a system put together like this can be fragile, full of compromises and feels a bit like a Rube Goldberg machine about to break down.</p>

<p>For the last year, I’ve been working on Simplemnt to help Customer Success teams deliver this integrated experience without these compromises. If you are frustrated by your requests being brushed aside by product and engineering. If you are sick of using tools that don’t do enough. If you are tired of staring at spreadsheets all day. Let’s talk.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><article><header></header><div><p>This week was really busy in the PEP side in Python. Three new PEPs were published touching internal and externals of the language. Here is a snapshot for y’all.</p><p>All PEPs are still under discussion but given the proponents, it is expected that they will progress well into the Python 3.10 timeline (which is also a PEP, PEP-619).</p><p><strong>PEP-620</strong>: Hide implementation details from the C API*</p><p>This one is under the hood for most of us but will enable more aggressive changes in the runtime. Many of us struggle with pure Python performance and sometimes even think that the core developers are kind of lazy on this aspect. Why other dynamically typed languages are so fast? (I am looking at you Javascript and Julia). One the reason is the badly exposed inner workings of the runtime. Any C extension can use internals and depend on it for years. Compatibility is a must, so Python core developers get stuck.</p><p>This PEP will allow internals to change without breaking compatibility. It is a work in progress, some of my patches in 3.9 were related to it.</p><p><strong>PEP-621</strong>: Storing project metadata in pyproject.toml</p><p>This could be the final of <code>setup.py</code>. Standardized metadata and move to TOML based files (no YAML, no .py), TOML are very sane and future proof.</p><p><strong>PEP-622</strong> Structural Pattern Matching</p><p>This is huge! If you have used Scala, Rust, and even Java in recent versions, pattern matching is a joy. It can transform very long if/elif/else blocks into readable code. This will probably change a little over the next year, but I expect this will be in 3.10 next year.</p><p>As the PEP says, this is more about object, dict and sequence destructuring than just a new way of using if/elif/else, so expect many new patterns to emerge from this new construct.</p><p>This work was possible after a new PEG-based parser landed in Python 3.9. The old parser was very limited and hard to work, according to Guido, the old parser was one of the first pieces he wrote in Python back in the 90s.</p><p>An example from the PEP, actual code from the standard library:</p><p>before:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="python"><span>def</span> <span>is_tuple</span>(node):

However we also believe that we can do an even better job at advocating it at the management level.</p><p id="viewer-43jln">Technical champions inside organisations sometimes have a hard time understanding the perspectives of various stakeholders inside their organisations, so we thought we'd make a "how to convince your boss" list of benefits of a Kubernetes transition to communicate its advantages more effectively.</p><p id="viewer-7j4al">Most benefits can be summarised in one word - standardisation, but let's dig a bit into specifics.</p><p id="viewer-9a4oj">Some of the benefits of a Kubernetes transition include:</p><ol><li id="viewer-cso6i"><p>Standardised hiring</p></li><li id="viewer-c7lvl"><p>Standardised configuration management, removing knowledge silos</p></li><li id="viewer-bblnl"><p>Enforcing standards</p></li><li id="viewer-117hv"><p>Easy access to a huge software ecosystem</p></li><li id="viewer-63hfg"><p>Removing vendor lock-in</p></li></ol><h2 id="viewer-1u0ie">Standardised hiring</h2><p id="viewer-24hq1">A standard job post for a backend/DevOps person just a few years ago used to include a list of requirements which usually included a permutation of several of the many technologies available at the time (Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Docker Swarm, Mesos...), mostly driven by the requirements bespoke backends of each company.</p><p id="viewer-4dcjd">To achieve things coming out-of-the-box with Kubernetes, backend and DevOps teams usually built their own solutions out of necessity, using tools they were personally familiar with. <span>This made finding people with exact needed skillsets hard and usually included a long onboarding time.</span></p><p id="viewer-5gpog"><span>Looking at job postings of companies utilising k8s right now we see a simplified job posting, focusing on Kubernetes experience with a few "nice to have" skills.</span></p><p id="viewer-b4hgh"><span>A big objection to keep in mind is that Kubernetes is a fairly young technology and finding qualified engineers can be harder, but a whole ecosystem of education and certification has sprung up in recent years (including MSB), so it's becoming less relevant.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-95rl0"><span>Standardised configuration management</span></h2><p id="viewer-3g20d"><span>A major advantage, that we feel is not being talked about enough is standardisation of configuration management inside k8s.</span></p><p id="viewer-51jbs"><span>In every company I've personally worked in the past, a large part of onboarding has been just knowing how to store, use and find various configurations necessary to access in my services. There were usually a few "old-timer" DevOps who knew how everything fits together and where the various configurations were stored, and they were indispensable to the running of the company.</span></p><p id="viewer-16kj9"><span>In companies that are advanced k8s users we currently see the DevOps teams being freed up to focus on process automation, building whole project templates that allow you spin up and integrate whole services in no time, with security, secret management and processes built in, so engineers can focus on building the actual services. This allows engineers not only to build their own services, but also to be able to quickly jump into other teams' services and have a good understanding of how things work.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-3frfv"><span>Enforcing standards</span></h2><p id="viewer-d1aau"><span>A big part of Kubernetes' mechanisms that don't get enough attention are mechanisms that allow you to encode various security and process requirements into the cluster itself, ensuring a standard baseline of security and governance practices that have to be respected before a workload is permitted to be deployed on the cluster.</span></p><p id="viewer-ckorf"><span>Various </span><a href="https://kubernetes.io/blog/2019/03/21/a-guide-to-kubernetes-admission-controllers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>admission controllers</u></span></a><span> allow you to enforce best practices through code and reduce micromanagement overhead of your teams.</span></p><p id="viewer-3hl1c"><span>This is a somewhat advanced topic, but we think it's not discussed enough and important enough that we have a </span><a href="https://msb.com/bootcamp" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span><u>whole day training</u></span></a><span> devoted just for this topic.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-c6e8"><span>Easy access to a huge software ecosystem</span></h2><p id="viewer-78d9r">Almost every open-source or commercial project currently offers a Helm chart or a Custom Operator to deploy directly into your cluster using a standardised and fully configurable interface.</p><p id="viewer-ekvv2">Here's an example of a highly available postgres cluster being deployed with one command and visualised using the MSB platform:</p><p id="viewer-1bh23">This allows teams to choose technologies needed for running their services and spend minimal time deploying them, while knowing best practices are followed. Most engineers are not experts in deploying things like high availability elasticsearch clusters, and before k8s a lot of preparation had to take place to ensure a production-ready system. Currently we get the benefit of the community or vendors spending time optimising their packages, so we can easily configure and use them.</p><h2 id="viewer-e3d4">Removing vendor lock-in</h2><p id="viewer-sgsh">This point has been reiterated multiple times, and research shows that organisations rarely take advantage of it, but it's still important to keep in mind. Kubernetes provides a standard API to which all cloud providers have to conform to, giving you the flexibility to negotiate and switch providers once operating at a significant scale.</p><p id="viewer-a1ig9">We hope you'll take these points into consideration when deciding on your Kubernetes strategy, or they will be useful to you to convince your organisation to make the switch.</p><p id="viewer-69s9s">If you'd like to hear first hand from a professional selling k8s into organisations, please have a listen to our <a href="https://www.msb.com/podcast/episode/37572d1a/001-kubernetes-enterprise-adoption-with-jeroen-overmaat" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>podcast episode</u></a> with Jeroen Overmaat, Rancher NEMEA Regional Director</p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first patient to receive a special gene editing treatment for sickle cell disease is surviving ― and even thriving ― a year later.</p><p>Victoria Gray, 34, whose story has been <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/07/29/744826505/sickle-cell-patient-reveals-why-she-is-volunteering-for-landmark-gene-editing-st" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chronicled by NPR for the past year</a>, was the first person with a genetic disorder in the U.S. to receive the cutting-edge treatment known as <a href="https://www.synthego.com/learn/crispr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CRISPR</a>, which stands for Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats.</p>        <!-- entry_paragraph_1_ad -->
    
<p>CRISPR allows scientists to directly alter a cell’s genome, and a 2019 Wired guide to the technology called it “<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/wired-guide-to-crispr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the genetic equivalent of Microsoft Word</a>,” enabling scientists to “edit DNA almost as easily as software engineers modify code” ― potentially leading to <a href="https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/02/cutting-edge-crispr-gene-editing-appears-safe-three-cancer-patients" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cures for diseases such as cancer</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>For the <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/sicklecell/data.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated 100,000 Americans affected by sickle cell disease</a>, which predominantly emerges in people with ancestry from sub-Saharan Africa, CRISPR holds the possibility of a new lease on life. The disease is caused by a mutation in hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that transports oxygen throughout the body and expels carbon dioxide. A sickle cell patient’s red blood cells deform into a “sickle” shape, limiting their ability to carry oxygen and leading to issues such as anemia and an increased risk of stroke. It can normally only be cured by a bone marrow transfusion, which requires a donor.</p><p>CRISPR technology, however, can <a href="https://www.synthego.com/crispr-sickle-cell-disease" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">theoretically edit a patient’s cells to produce normal hemoglobin</a>, and Gray, who has <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/12/25/784395525/a-young-mississippi-womans-journey-through-a-pioneering-gene-editing-experiment" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">suffered from sickle cell disease since infancy</a>, underwent treatment last July. Doctors removed bone marrow from her body, used CRISPR to modify the marrow’s blood cells, and then transferred the cells back into Gray.&nbsp;</p><p>Nearly a year later, Gray, who lives in Forest, Mississippi, is responding well to the treatment, according to <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/06/23/877543610/a-year-in-1st-patient-to-get-gene-editing-for-sickle-cell-disease-is-thriving" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NPR’s latest update</a>, and hasn’t suffered major pain or needed emergency room treatment or blood transfusions. Relapses may still be possible, and it is too early to tell if CRISPR can serve as a definitive treatment for sickle cell disease. Nevertheless, 2020 is a noticeable improvement for Gray compared to the previous two years, when she visited the hospital seven times on average and frequently took pain medication.</p><p>Gray told NPR that “it hasn’t been easy” caring for three children during a year shaken by COVID-19 as well as racial injustice protests throughout the United States, but she added that without CRISPR, she would have likely been hospitalized amid the pandemic and been unable to provide for her family.</p><p>“Since my treatment, I’ve been able to do everything for myself, everything for my kids. And so it’s been joy not only for me but for the people around me that’s in my life,” she said.</p><p>“High school graduations, college graduations, weddings, grandkids ― I thought I wouldn’t see none of that.... Now I’ll be there to help my daughters pick out their wedding dresses and we’ll be able to take family vacations, and they’ll have their mom every step of the way.”</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5">
		
	
	<div>
		
<p>I was browsing HackerNews recently and a (rare) agriculture news story popped up, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23208954">this one to be specific</a>, <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20899721">but there are others</a>. As these are of interest to me I clicked and read through the comments. These linked articles aren’t all that note-worthy, but they are indicative of a trend. As a casual follower of the Ag startup scene and witnessing the vertical farming fascination for the past ~10 years grow, I’ve been genuinely confused as to some of the approaches founders are taking with their startups. For the longest time, I believed the hype that vertical farming was <em>needed</em> and more importantly, coming to a city near you™. This implies and inherent inefficiency in both current food production and its distribution chains.</p>



<p>I can only conclude Silicon Valley thinks agriculture lacks innovation or is in need of ‘disruption’ and efficiency boosting and the truth couldn’t be more opposite. The truth is, modern agriculture as most people understand it <em>already have</em> the things SV-types desire and crave: massive scale, incredible automation, hyper-efficiency. Because we live in an urban based society (roughly 20% of people in America are classified into ‘rural’ aread <a href="https://www.census.gov/newsroom/press-releases/2016/cb16-210.html">according to the census</a>), most people don’t realize just how big agriculture is. The Midwest in the United States has close to 90M acres of corn, <a href="https://observablehq.com/@kickout/untitled">85M acres of soybean</a>, and 30M acres of wheat. Brazil has as much, and usually more, soybean acreage grown every year in their breadbasket (centered in Mato Grosso, Sorriso, Brazil). Truly incomprehensible scale. All of this is accomplished outdoors using soil that already exists, using the most cheapest energy source available–the sun–to convert carbon to a human usable form. To be clear, soil is a natural resource that will become endangered if we do not mitigate the severe erosion problems that stem from single species field that are barren (re: nothing actively growing) for 30-40% of the calendar year (in North America).</p>



<p>Modern agriculture is scaled and the modern row crop farmer is equally scaled–mostly enabled by robust automation (auto-steer tractors, precision planting machines, etc.). The average farm size is increasing and has been for quite sometime. As farm size increases, the number of people <em>directly</em> involved in agriculture for their livelihood continues to be <a href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Todays_Reports/reports/fnlo0419.pdf">exceedingly small</a> (there are only about ~ million farms in the United States). Sophisticated and (and generally physically massive) machines–with varying degrees of automation–have continuously driven the efficiency of a single farmer higher and higher requiring less hand labor and obtaining efficiencies of scale for cost. Farmers are the original innovators and scaled agricultural production has largely enabled the population growth seen in the last ~150 years (humans domesticated crops ~10,000 BC, well before written communication). Farmers have always been smart and savvy when evaluating decisions that affect their livelihood. They can detect when a company is trying to sell them something that actually holds no value. Why? Because if a farmer is continuously spending money on things that do not return value, they can (and do) go <a href="https://www.fb.org/market-intel/farm-bankruptcies-rise-again">out of business</a> quickly. There are no VC-funded farmers, so positive cash flow isn’t merely a good thing, its the only thing. So if a company is trying to sell a product for ~$15 an acre, a wise farmer will ensure they are getting &gt;$15 on profit from said product. This is a primary reason companies like The Climate Corporation has struggled to monetize ‘farm data’. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/10/10/4823004/monsanto-bets-the-farm-on-big-data">Big bets largely haven’t panned out as expected</a>. SV companies often claim data is worth <em>$x</em>, but that value generally only exists in the abstract and has poor basis on the farm and the lack of adoption suggest the product isn’t working as intended or its severely mispriced from its value. Compounding that and in addition to, University extension programs, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land-grant_university">mostly from Land Grant Universities</a>, have traditionally filled the role of keeping farmers up-to-date on the latest methods and profitability studies (e.g. <a href="https://coolbean.info/">Cool Bean</a>) using grant money (often funded via taxes or through ‘<a href="https://ncga.com/stay-informed/media/in-the-news/article/2020/03/corn-checkoff-assisting-teachers-with-online-curriculum-">check-off</a>‘ programs). These types of programs represent an already existing framework of farmers ‘paying’ for this type of knowledge. This model has proven scalable, even more so with the internet and social media making information readily available. Note this doesn’t prevent <em>bad</em> information from being shared, but since savvy farmers will try and eventually ignore unprofitable methods, one can assume this is an efficient system.</p>



<p>So why am I not worried about vertical farming or startups that are trying to reinvent the wheel? They are busy fighting battles that simply don’t exist for their competition (outdoor/field-based agriculture). Current agriculture doesn’t need an artificial energy source and the automation that exists <em>today</em> is breathtaking. It is completely reasonable for a single human, with assistance from machines, to comfortably farm 1,000 acres or more of traditional rows crops. It generally doesn’t matter if a vertical farm can ‘produce’ 365 days a year, the existing agriculture infrastructure in the breadbaskets of the world (United States, Brazil/Argentina/Eastern Europe) make any indoor advantage disappear, and quickly. These centers are ‘connected’ as well, with existing GPS and cellular networks available today. </p>



<p>The free advice I would give anyone looking to enter the ag startup scene: take advantage of the existing pros (scale, automation, mechanization). Startups that try to hitch along to already existing scale rather than trying to re-invent it present a much better opportunity for success.</p>

                    <p>For the past 6 months, I've been helping dozens of startups and newly formed RevOps &amp; Data teams that are hitting the limits of what I call the "Founder Data Stack" (one marketing/sales tool that holds most of your customer data). It usually combines a single tool like Intercom/Hubspot with events forwarded by Segment.</p><p>Overall, the founder stack looks something like this 👇</p><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/06/the_founder_data_stack.png" alt="The Founder Data Stack"></figure><p>🤔 Pretty simple right? So what is the problem?</p><p>As your company grows, new employees add new tools to the stack to help them do their jobs:</p><ul><li>Salesforce is added for sales</li><li>Hubspot, Marketo or <a href="http://customer.io/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Customer.io</a> for marketing automation</li><li>Pendo for product data analysis</li><li>Outreach, Salesloft, <a href="http://reply.io/" rel="noreferrer nofollow noopener">Reply.io</a> to help with sales engagement</li><li>People.ai, Mixmax, Yesware, to help with sales productivity</li><li>Livestorm, Zoom, Crowdcast for webinars</li><li>Wordpress Ghosts, Gatsby for their blog</li></ul><p>... and the list goes on. 6 months later, your stack of tools looks something closer to this.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/06/point_to_point_integrations_mess.png" alt="Point to Point Integration is a nightmare"></figure><p>This explosion of tools is not a problem in itself. The real issue lies in the fact that all of these dotted lines represent point-to-point integrations. This means that there's no unified control plane for how data gets to all the tools. If something goes wrong, or you need to make a change, nobody knows where to find it. These applications were never designed with this integration outcome in mind.</p><p>Even worse, these point-to-point integrations are usually built with custom one-off code, which makes it hard to maintain over time. This mess creates inconsistent data, duplication, and leads ultimately to <strong>data you can't trust.</strong></p><p>Don’t think you have this problem? Here's some classic symptoms, can you answer no to all of these?</p><ul><li>The Sales / CS / Support teams have 3-5 tabs open to understand what a customer is doing.</li><li>One of your tools might say the customer is on a free plan, and the other one shows they are paying $399 / month.</li><li>You have sent automatic emails to the wrong customers or multiple copies of the same email to one customer.</li><li>It takes 2+ weeks to run any in-depth report and analysis that uses a mix of product &amp; customer data. By the time you finish the analysis, the source data (usually based on CSV files) is out of date.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/06/Tabs_of_doom.png"></figure><h2 id="problem-no-single-source-of-truth">Problem: No Single Source of Truth</h2><p>Without a single source of truth, you will suffer from <strong>garbage in, garbage out</strong> across your whole stack. Because of this, teams won't trust their reports &amp; analysis because they think the data is inaccurate. Automations &amp; workflows will misbehave, sending the wrong emails to the wrong person with the incorrect personalized value. Incompatible IDs will generate tons of duplicates, which will lead to more bad data. The result is that you will have a recurring calendar task where you will spend your day cleaning the mess manually across your tools. </p><p>The solution is straightforward. As your company and the number of tools grow, you need to maintain a <strong>single source of truth</strong> that:</p><ul><li>enforces data consistency</li><li>syncs data across all of your tools</li><li>can be queried when in doubt</li></ul><h2 id="solution-the-modern-data-stack">Solution: The Modern Data Stack</h2><p>There's already a tool perfectly suited to storing massive amounts of data, that can be queried easily, and is connected to everything. A database or <strong>data warehouse</strong>. You probably already have one running in your company that you can reuse so you don't need to buy another CRM, CDP, DMP, MAP, or any other acronym.</p><p>Building around a data warehouse has additional benefits such as:</p><ul><li><strong>You own your data</strong>. It helps you comply with different regulations.</li><li><strong>Get value quicker.</strong> It is 10x easier to dump historical data in a DB than importing the data in yet-another-tool.</li><li><strong>Easier to sync with other tools</strong>. Databases integrate with everything, contrary to SaaS Tools that have limited APIs (and please don't get me started on APIs like Marketo).</li><li><strong>Reusability.</strong> Other teams in the company can use this trusted source of truth.</li></ul><p>In addition to a data warehouse, you will need 4 other key components:</p><ol><li><strong>An event tracking tool</strong>. You can continue using Segment here. It does the job well and allows you to collect events across all of your websites &amp; apps.</li><li><strong>A data loader</strong>. I recommend Fivetran. It’s easy to set up in a couple of clicks and amazingly reliable.</li><li><strong>A data modeling tool</strong>. DBT is the new power tool here. It allows you to transform and model your data.</li><li><strong>An Integration Platform.</strong> I’m a 100% biased here, but I recommend using Census. We integrate well with DBT and enable you to sync your clean and unified data models back to all of your other tools.</li></ol><figure><img src="https://blog.getcensus.com/content/images/2020/06/the_modern_data_stack.png"></figure><p>As a bonus, you can replace Amplitude with a BI tool like Mode or Chart.io, which is cheap and as good as Looker.</p><h2 id="what-do-you-get">What do you get?</h2><p>Done right, this stack will help you centralize all of your data in one accessible place so you can create unified models and sync them to the tools each business team uses. Here's some of the way you can put the resulting data to work:</p><ul><li>Create segments of users based on features they use to create personalized education campaigns</li><li>Create Account Health Scores and report in your CRM to help your CSM team prioritize their time</li><li>Use the same customer view across your tools</li><li>Notify Sales reps that there is activity in an account that is currently in a trial</li><li>Retarget on Facebook &amp; Google disengaged users based on actual product data</li></ul><p>Bonus, everyone gets to keep using the tools they love.</p><p>Finally, despite the look of it, this stack is straightforward to deploy and requires near-zero maintenance. Best of all, it is pretty affordable and costs will scale with you.</p><h2 id="how-to-get-started">How to get started?</h2><p>I would encourage you to start small. Take one end-to-end data flow and build the stack to solve that use case. It could be pushing aggregate product usage from your web app to Salesforce to give your sales team visibility on product adoption. Or it could be syncing payment data to your marketing automation tool to send emails to your best customers and turn them into champions.</p><p>If you have any questions, don't hesitate to contact us. We are happy to do a full review of your existing stack for free!</p><ul><li>Drop us an email 👉 <a href="mailto:contact@getcensus.com">contact@getcensus.com</a></li><li>☎️ or <a href="https://getcensus.com/schedule-a-call">schedule a call on this page</a></li></ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="html-wrapper"><div><p>When I first learned React and Redux in 2015, I made an enormous mess of the production codebase I was working on.</p>
<p>Back then, class-based components and Redux were the coolest kids on the block. This was my first time prepping up to work on a real-world React project, so I bought the best courses I could find on the topics and dove in.</p>
<p>After a couple of months, according to the React community, the way I was doing things was outdated. There were newer, cleaner, and recommended <em>best practices</em> for me to follow.</p>
<p>I think it's incredible that we question the way we do things. But my vast gap in knowledge of client-side architecture left me always finding it necessary to play catch up to refactor to the <em>new</em> approaches.  </p>
<p>These sentiments were also recently echoed in this painfully accurate Twitter thread from <a href="https://twitter.com/jhooks">Joel Hooks</a>. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>Developers are confused about where to start and what to choose when they start learning to write high-quality React applications. They want a strong foundation of knowledge and the confidence to architect React applications at scale built to current industry standards. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>They are frustrated that there are no widely accepted standards for building React applications consistently, coherently, and <strong>with minimal risks to their professional reputations and livelihoods</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>On top of that, there is a sea of choices and tradeoffs that React developers face every day. From how the project is even started, which framework to use, how to manage state, how does it get bundled, accessibility, and deployment just to get going.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>At each f🐬kin' stop, there's a new choice to make: a new chance to be wrong.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Trying to build a solid foundation in React feels like a slot machine. — <a href="https://twitter.com/jhooks/status/1273392253646434304">@jhooks, June 17th, 2020</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Some point later in my developer journey, I too realized this was happening. I realized I could never keep up to date with the current trends of the libraries and frameworks I was using. I also decided I didn't want those nuances to dictate my professional reputation or livelihood. It wasn't good enough for me. I needed something better.</p>
<p>Eventually, I sought out the originating principles— the fundamentals, to client-side architecture. I sought out to construct a standard for building client-side apps. A professional one. One based on the software design principles that have helped us design robust software for decades.</p>
<hr>
<p>This guide teaches you client-side architecture fundamentals. </p>
<p>It's the result of my research using <a href="https://www.julian.com/blog/mental-model-examples">first principles</a> on how to <strong>design and develop robust, flexible, testable, and maintainable client-side applications.</strong></p>
<p>During my experience working on client-side apps of varying sizes, I've realized that  <strong><em>some</em> serious upfront design</strong> on the architecture can have a significant impact on the quality of the code for the duration of its life.</p>
<p>From simple dashboards to multi-layered apps with rendering layers, domain logic, multiple types of users - this guide teaches you the essential design principles front-end developers inadvertently code around within their everyday programming jobs. </p>
<p><strong>This guide proposes architectural standards for client-side web development</strong>.</p>
<p>While we're primarily focused on React, because it's the most popular library with the least structure, the principles are transferrable to any configuration of view-layer library or framework. </p>
<p>Programming tends to seem more like a trade than a science. Each tool, be it a state management library, API, or a transport-layer technology, is best suited to solve a particular set of problems. As a developer and a tradesperson, it's good to know how the tools in our toolbox are best used. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>... if all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At the end of this guide, you'll learn a standard for web development. You'll have a clear understanding of the <strong><a href="https://khalilstemmler.com/articles/client-side-architecture/introduction/(view,%20interaction,%20routing,%20state%20management,%20networking,%20auth,%20etc)">discrete layers of concerns</a></strong> in a client-side app: from the view layer to various forms of state management, and how to handle interaction (app) logic. </p>

<p>Allow me to paint the picture of why we need a better client-side architecture. To start, let's look at the foundation we're all currently working on top of.</p>
<h3 id="Model-View-controller">Model-View controller<a href="#Model-View-controller" aria-label="Model View controller permalink"></a></h3>
<p>You've probably heard of <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller">Model-View-Controller</a></strong>, the architectural pattern that describes how to design apps involving user interfaces.</p>
<p><strong>MVC</strong> says that we should split our application into <em>model</em>, <em>view</em>, and <em>controller</em> layers. This is so each layer can focus on their own respective responsibilities. </p>
<ul>
<li>The model handles data and logic</li>
<li>The view handles presentation</li>
<li>and the controller turns user events into changes to the model</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://khalilstemmler.com/img/blog/client-side-architecture/Untitled.png" alt="img/blog/client-side-architecture/Untitled.png"></p>
<p>Model-view-controller architectural pattern. Used to separate the concerns between a client-side web app and backend services.</p>
<p>Most full-stack apps are comprised of a <strong>client-side portion,</strong> utterly separate from <strong>backend services</strong>. When users ask to make a change from the UI, it makes things happen by interacting with the backend through some API: in MVC, the API is the <em>controller</em>.</p>
<p>This works! And we like it. At least, we <em>must</em> — it's one of the first architectural patterns we teach to new developers learning how to build full-stack apps.</p>
<h3 id="Model-View-presenter">Model-View presenter<a href="#Model-View-presenter" aria-label="Model View presenter permalink"></a></h3>
<p>Where <em>Model-View-Controller</em> explained how to separate the concerns of a <strong>full-stack web application</strong>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93presenter">Model-View Presenter</a>, a derivation of MVC, told us how to separate the concerns of <strong>the client part</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="https://khalilstemmler.com/img/blog/client-side-architecture/model-view-presenter.png" alt="Model-View-Presenter"></p>
<p>Model-View-Presenter is the architectural pattern typically used within client applications. It's a derivation of the MVC pattern.</p>
<p>In <em>Model-View-Presenter</em>, the <strong>view</strong> creates user events. </p>
<p>Those user events get turned into <strong>updates</strong> or <strong>changes</strong> to the model. </p>
<p>When the <strong>model</strong> changes, the <strong>view</strong> is updated with the new data.</p>
<p>It's heartening to realize that <b>every client app uses some form of the model-view presenter pattern</b>.</p>
<!-- TODO: Add this -->
<!-- <p class="special-quote">Additionally, astute developers might notice this is a fancy way to say <i>Observer pattern</i>. It turns out that <a href="/articles/client-side-architecture/observer-pattern/">most client apps are built around the Observer Pattern</a>. Hold some data, subscribe to it from elsewhere, then notify subscribers when it changes. Each framework/library (React, Vue, Angular) implements this pattern in a slightly different way.</p> -->
<h3 id="MVC--MVP-are-too-generic">MVC &amp; MVP are too generic<a href="#MVC--MVP-are-too-generic" aria-label="MVC  MVP are too generic permalink"></a></h3>
<p>MVC and MVP are great starters. They give you a <em>good enough</em> understanding of the communication pathways from a 5000-ft view. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, they both suffer from the same problem: being <em>too generic</em>.</p>
<p>In both MVC and MVP, <strong>the biggest challenge is that the <code>M</code> is responsible for way too much</strong>. </p>
<p>As a result, developers don't know <em>which tools</em> are responsible for <em>which tasks</em>.</p>
<p><img src="https://khalilstemmler.com/img/blog/client-side-architecture/Frame_42_(1).png" alt="img/blog/client-side-architecture/Frame_42_(1).png"></p>
<p>In MVC and MVP, the model is ambiguous. This makes matching the correct tool up to the task feel like a puzzle.</p>
<h3 id="Tasks-of-the-model">Tasks of the model<a href="#Tasks-of-the-model" aria-label="Tasks of the model permalink"></a></h3>
<p>In the real world, the model portion in most client-side web apps does a lot.</p>
<p><strong>State management —</strong> Most apps need a way to fetch state, update state, and configure reactivity to when state changes, the <em>view</em> can re-render.</p>
<p><strong>Networking &amp; data fetching —</strong> The actual <em>data-fetching</em> concern is sometimes conflated as part of the model. The data fetching and networking aspect of an app need to know about backend services, formulate requests, handle responses, and marshall data, but it also needs to signal request <em>metadata</em> (ie: <code>isLoading</code>, <code>error</code>). What about features like optimistic updates? Is that a concern of the model? I think it is.</p>
<p><strong>Model behavior (ie: domain, app, or interaction logic) —</strong> Deciding what happens next when a user clicks <em>submit</em>, or wants to interact with something on the page is a form of <em><a href="https://www.notion.so/Client-Side-Architecture-Basics-Generic-0f4a99f4f7a9445e928f67d058656a52#025b4ebebef64948a0fc5bfaa598309f">interaction logic</a></em>. Sometimes there are rules we need to enforce. They can be simple — like validation before sending off an API call. They can be complicated — like deciding if a chess piece can be dropped on the selected square.
Some call this <em>app logic</em>, which I believe to be sufficient since it describes how our app responds to user events. Alternatively, I call it <em>interaction logic</em> because it explains what happens in response to <em>user interaction</em>.
There's one another kind of logic here, and that's <em>domain logic</em>. Domain logic doesn't normally have anything to do with the application itself. Instead, it originates from an understanding of the domain. For example, while displaying a modal <em>before move a chess piece</em> might be <strong>application/interaction logic</strong>, enforcing the policy that <em>a knight can only move in an L-shaped fashion</em> is a form of <strong>domain logic</strong>. That rule originates from understanding the domain of <em>chess</em> where the application-specific logic holds rules about how the user interacts with the app. Usually, domain logic lives behind backend services, and if we break the rules, we can get an error back as a response. Still, sometimes we co-locate it on the client-side, especially for more complex applications.</p>
<p><strong>Authentication &amp; authorization logic (specific type of model behavior) —</strong> This is another specific type of model behavior, but it's common enough to mention. Most of the time, authN &amp; authR finds itself being used from within the view layer (show <em>Login screen if not authenticated</em>). Sometimes, it manifests in the <strong>application/interaction</strong> layer as well, preventing access to specific operations.</p>
<h3 id="Tools-used-within-the-model">Tools used within the model<a href="#Tools-used-within-the-model" aria-label="Tools used within the model permalink"></a></h3>
<p>These are all common challenges to solve. In 2020, the developer toolbox for a React developer looks a little something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>React hooks</li>
<li>Redux</li>
<li>Context API</li>
<li>Apollo Client</li>
<li>xState</li>
<li>react-query</li>
<li>and now, recoil</li>
</ul>
<p>Each of these are capable of addressing a particular piece of the <em>ambiguous model</em> we described, but matching the correct tool to the proper concern can be tricky.</p>
<p>Of course, it's tricky. We don't have a standard language to describe the different concerns. Instead of thinking about the tools right away, I think we need to back up and look at the bigger picture of the problems to be solved.</p>

<p>We need a shared language to describe these architectural concepts upon which we either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configure a library or a framework to solve</li>
<li>Write the code ourselves for</li>
</ul>
<p>Most React developers know the implementation-specific terminology like hooks, reducers, context, and props, but architectural concerns are sometimes misunderstood.</p>

June 24, 2020 | https://mohamed.attahri.com/posts/how-to-fix-apple-app-store | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://mohamed.attahri.com/posts/how-to-fix-apple-app-store">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article data-type="essay">
<p>I took the weekend to digest a lot of the complaints voiced by developers of all sizes, from Microsoft to Basecamp, to solo developers. I’ve identified three main issues:</p>
<ol>
<li>The 30/15% commission is unfair;</li>
<li>The store guidelines are unclear, and their application inconsistent;</li>
<li>There’s no real alternative to the App Store on Apple’s mobile devices.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think the frustration about the commissions stems from Apple conflating two kinds of fees into one. On one hand, you have fees necessary to run the store, and benefit from everything it has to offer (friction-less payments, customer support, updates, free OS upgrades to minimize backward compatibility, etc.). On the other, you have referral fees, which would make sense if they existed to reward Apple for generating business for developers.</p>
<p>There’s probably little debate about the legitimacy of the store fees, but the referral fees are problematic because Apple takes a full commission whether the purchase originated from the developer’s website, or a direct search on the App Store.</p>
<p>A possible solution would be to split the two fees. There would be a 15% commission dedicated to supporting the store, charged for every transaction as it is the case today. An additional 15% would only be charged when Apple actively brings the customer to the developer, via a search, and ad, a recommendation card, etc. </p>
<p>What Apple announced today is a good step towards solving some of the issues related to the guidelines and their application. I would add two minor suggestions:</p>
<ol>
<li>More efforts to show they’re open to dialogue;</li>
<li>No special treatment.</li>
</ol>
<p>As for alternatives to their store, Apple has been promoting the web (i.e. PWAs) as one, but everyone agrees they’re falling short. There’s been notable efforts, specifically with the recent support for service workers, but the lack of important features such as push notifications is a clear sign of the disconnect between their claims and their actions. </p>
<p>No reasonable developer expects the web to be on par with native platforms. The former relies on a common-denominator approach, and is consensus-driven. The latter allows for differentiation, and is solely under the control of the platform’s owner. This is to say that the lag between the two is incompressible. However, all developers expect Apple to be up to speed on web standards, so that lag is at least uniform between the web, and all the more advanced native platforms they have to support.</p>

          <p>
 A new Icelandic technology intended for aluminum production offers hopes of eliminating CO2 emissions from the production,

  </a>
 </em>
 reports.
</p>

        
          <p>
 The company Arctus Metals, in cooperation with Innovation Center Iceland, reached a milestone recently, when it successfully produced aluminum with this new method in a large pot. Instead of creating CO2 emissions, the process emits oxygen.
</p>

        
          <p>
 The main part of the innovation consists of using multiple,&nbsp;vertical inert metal-alloy anodes and ceramic cathodes, instead of using electrodes made of carbon.
</p>

        
          <p>
 This innovation could potentially eliminate CO2 emissions from aluminum smelters in Iceland and elsewhere.
</p>

        
          
  
  

  



        
          <p>
 “Iceland’s three aluminum smelters produce more than 800,000 tons of aluminum a year and emit more than 1.6 million tons of CO2 a year,” states Arctus Metals CEO Jón Hjaltalín Magnússon. “Their emissions make up 30 percent of Iceland’s total CO2 emissions.”
</p>

        
          <p>
 “If all our aluminum smelters adopted this new technology, Iceland’s CO2 emissions would be reduced by 30 percent,
 <span>
  ”
 </span>
 he adds,
 <span>
  “
 </span>
 enabling us to fulfill our international obligations and more. Using the new Arctus Metals method, an aluminum smelter, the size of [Rio Tinto’s] in Straumsvík [Southwest Iceland] would produce as much oxygen as a forest covering 500 square kilometers.”
</p>

        
          <p>
 Jón reports that a cooperation agreement has been signed between the German company Trimet Aluminum, one of the world’s largest producers of aluminum, which will continue the development process by starting production in larger pots, and planning to eventually convert production in their four smelters to this method.
</p>

        
          <p>
 The project was presented to Icelandic President Guðni Th. Jóhannesson yesterday at the offices of Innovation Center Iceland.

<p>Create wonderful things, be good, have fun</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the credo of Klutz Press, the most important book publisher of my childhood. It being summer and all, Hobbes, ol' buddy... let's going exploring!</p>
<h2>The magic of a Klutz book</h2>
<p>If you've heard of Klutz, then you've likely seen their debut: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0932592007/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whatrocks09-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0932592007&amp;linkId=adaa512e8af09feab7c571ec8f2863cc">Juggling For the Complete Klutz</a>. </p>

<p>If not, I highly suggest seeking out a copy. Keep in mind, it's more than just a <em>book</em> -- <em>Juggling for the Complete Klutz</em> has these amazing attributes:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's spiral-bound</li>
<li>It has hilarious drawings</li>
<li>It comes attached with three real-life bean bags!</li>
</ul>
<p>These are book super-powers, in my book (a Klutz-worthy pun?). In our day, my sister and I owned, devoured, and treasured these Klutz titles:</p>

</ul>
<p>As a kid, there was nothing better than getting a new Klutz book (ok, maybe a Super Nintendo game). But unlike a replay of <em>Super Mario RPG</em>, these Klutz books require no nostaglia goggles. Here's why I think they're magic:</p>
<h3>Klutz books are spiral-bound</h3>
<p>Books for learning stuff should be able to open up and stay flat. The old 1980s computer manuals for computers like the Commodore VIC-20, the Commodore 64, and <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/my-new-old-apple-iie-computer">my new old Apple IIe</a> knew this much -- their manuals were spiral-bound and spell-binding.</p>
<p>So, why don't we see more spiral-bound books? Without knowing that much about printing costs, I imagine they're more expensive. Also, they do look slightly worse on a bookshelf, especially if you're going for that 'grammable color pattern look (so, just don't do this).</p>
<h3>Klutz books come with the required materials</h3>
<p>The little "paper" football that came with the <em>Table Top Football: A Guide to the Classic Lunchroom Sport</em> was a revered grail of mine. I remember that my dad took a sheetrock knife and made a small incision in its plastic case attached to the book so that the football could be slid in and out, with the explicit rule that the football must either be <em>in the case</em> or <em>being used in a game</em>. This is much like the inexorable <a href="https://hypercritical.co/">Jon Siracusan</a> rule for Airpods. Obey, or the Airpods will be instantly lost forever.</p>

    <span></span>
  <img alt="football" title="football" src="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/e4a351feccb1c6d3e7524fa014860c7c/20f07/football.jpg" srcset="https://www.charlieharrington.com/static/e4a351feccb1c6d3e7524fa014860c7c/d2f63/football.jpg 163w,

  </a>
    </span></p>
<p>Side note that there are some people who just love making small cuts into the plastic cases for things, so that you easily return them to their "pristine" condition. I, myself, don't understand these people. I like wripping these cases to shreds instantly.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to these Klutz books. By including juggling bean bags, yarn for friendship bracelets, or a real harmonica, Klutz Press books gave you everything you needed to get your hands dirty. "Active learning", or something like that. Playing = learning. Etcetera.</p>
<h3>Klutz books have hilarious art</h3>

<p>Just look at that paper airplane stuck in the teacher's hair!</p>
<p>Klutz had a particular art direction that spoke to me as a child. The goofy people in their guides made me feel like it was <em>okay to be a klutz</em>. </p>
<p>Which brings me to the most important reason that Klutz books are special.</p>
<h3>Klutz books embrace the Beginner's Mindset</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities. In the experts mind there are few - Shunryū Suzuki</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Everyone starts out as a klutz. No matter what. That means it's okay to make mistakes. It can even be funny - in fact, it should be funny! Because it's fun to learn new things.</p>
<p>Being a klutz, making mistakes, having fun, this is the path to wonderful things.</p>
<h2>Who's behind Klutz Press?</h2>
<p>According to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klutz_Press">Wikipedia</a>, Klutz Press was founded in 1977 by three friends in Palo Alto.</p>
<p>The apocryphal story is that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Cassidy_(author)">John Cassidy</a>, a recent Stanford grad working as a high school teacher, brought a bucket of tennis balls and some hand-written instructions for juggling to his remedial reading class. The laughs and learning and genuine reading and genuine juggling that ensued inspired Cassidy and his buddies from Stanford to publish <em>Juggling For the Complete Klutz</em> under their new company: Klutz Press.</p>
<p><em>Juggling For the Complete Klutz</em> has sold over 2.5 million copies. But Googling for Klutz Press is somewhat challenging these days. In 2000, Klutz was acquired by a company called Nelvana for $74 million, and in 2002 Klutz became a subsidiary of Scholastic, Inc. This latter merger is a good match in my book, as the Scholastic Book Fair also ranks heavily in my childhood memories of learning to love reading. The only other company I'd feel comfortable with owning Klutz Press is Pizza Hut - thanks to their delicious <a href="https://www.bookitprogram.com/">BOOK-IT!</a> reading program, which brought me dozens of delicious cheese Personal Pan Pizzas during the 1990s. My parents couldn't decide if they hated or loved Pizza Hut for this.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Klutz.com redirects to the Scholastic website, and it's unclear what's out-of-print or available from the voluminous Klutz catalog. So if you do find a genuine Klutz book and kit, I'd snag them quickly!</p>
<p>Luckily, I was able to find a good interview with Cassidy from 1995 on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110616182712/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1154/is_n5_v83/ai_16857996/">Wayback Machine</a>. In 1995, Klutz was at the height of their power and influence in kid's minds. Here are some choice quotes from Cassidy:</p>
<p>On their company culture at Klutz Press:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In terms of being laid back, we take a back seat to nobody."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On their "teaching" style:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Talk to a kid about fun and math, and it's like you're talking about two different sides of the universe. If we can climb this mountain, there's nothing we can't tackle."</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kids don't learn all that much by listening or reading. They need to get elbow-deep in a subject and touch it, feel it, and smell it."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This reminds me of Seymour Paypert's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0465046746/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=whatrocks09-20&amp;creative=9325&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;creativeASIN=0465046746&amp;linkId=2949aefc36d4bd9d9f632170d2ac23de">Mindstorms book</a> about his work with LOGO and the Turtle machine (you can check out <a href="https://www.charlieharrington.com/mindstorms">my notes</a> on the book)</p>
<p>The article explains a bit about their business:</p>
<ul>
<li>All of Klutz' books sell for less than $20</li>
<li>They can have low prices because: (1) the books (with their accompanying "stuff") are viewed as more than books - but "toys/novelties", so more retailers than booksellers are interesting in carring them, and (2) they do large printing runs (150k copies vs the usual 10k for children's books)</li>
</ul>
<p>And, importantly, the final word from Cassidy:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can hang a spoon off my nose," Cassidy boasts, "and I take a lot of pride in that".</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Create wonderful things, be good, have fun</h2>
<p>I just wanted to write that out again. I've decided to adopt their credo as my own life motto.</p>
<p>I learned so much from Klutz Press as a kid. I'm still learning now. Thank you, John Cassidy and team, for making these wonderful books. My juggling is finally starting to get pretty good, but I'll always be a klutz.</p></div></div>]]>

June 24, 2020 | https://relay.sh/blog/relay-public-beta/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://relay.sh/blog/relay-public-beta/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Today we announce <a href="https://relay.sh/">Relay</a>, an event-driven automation platform. <a href="https://app.relay.sh/signup">Sign up now</a> and try it out! Relay connects infrastructure and operations platforms, APIs, and tools together into a cohesive, easy-to-automate whole. Relay is simple enough for you to start automating common, <em>if-this-then-that</em> (IFTTT) style DevOps tasks in minutes and powerful enough to model multi-step, branching, parallelized DevOps processes when the need arises.</p>
<p>Why bother? Because for all the progress we’ve made as builders and operators, <a href="https://landscape.cncf.io/">things are more complicated than ever</a>. Modern applications comprise a growing variety of runtimes, clouds, infrastructure platforms, 3rd party services, and APIs. Mounting sophistication (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dtI5dMpBmQo">and complexity</a>) of how applications are constructed complicates how we operate and manage them. As a result, accomplishing many basic operational tasks can involve touching many different components, with different APIs, different semantics, from different upstreams, vendors and dev teams. Connecting all of these components together is tough, and automating anything across them all can range from tedious to nightmare fuel.</p>
<p>At layers above the plumbing, <a href="https://relay.sh/blog/rise-of-the-apis/">managing infrastructure stops looking like classic configuration management and starts looking like orchestrating workflows</a>. However, workflows can be tricky. Connectivity, secrets handling, event listening, ordering, parallelism, error handling, and control flow all conspire to make writing workflows from scratch pretty gnarly. The complexity adds up fast. We can do better!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Automated workflows are the bedrock of all software organizations.”<br>
— Jason Warner, CTO @ GitHub</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Relay lets you represent any DevOps workflow as code, composed of triggers that listen for incoming events, and steps that define the task you’re automating. Relay does not limit what you can talk to. A single workflow could listen for alerts from PagerDuty, query metrics from DataDog, reconfigure infrastructure with Terraform, and send a notification via Slack. It’s easy to leverage pre-existing triggers, steps, and workflows, and it’s simple to make your own if the need arises.</p>
<p>As a hosted service, Relay supervises things on your behalf. It will automatically trigger your workflow based on incoming events, execute your workflow’s steps in parallel, notify you if you need to intervene, and keep meticulous records of everything done. Relay does this all automatically, so you don’t have to.</p>
<p>Today, we’re proud to announce <a href="https://relay.sh/">beta availability</a> for Relay. Read on to see how it works!</p>
<h2>Workflows</h2>
<p>Relay’s core method of automation is <a href="https://relay.sh/docs/using-workflows/"><em>the workflow</em></a>. Workflows combine useful activities together to accomplish a particular task:</p>
<ul>
<li>When we detect an unused Azure Disk, delete it <em>(so we can save money)</em></li>
<li>When they go unused, nuke any AWS authentication keypairs <em>(so we can reduce our attack surface)</em></li>
<li>When a PagerDuty alert fires with a certain severity, create tickets in Jira and a room in Slack <em>(so we can more quickly troubleshoot issues)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Relay lets you succinctly express these types of workflows, and beyond, <a href="https://relay.sh/docs/reference/relay-workflows/">as code</a>. And like code, workflows can be versioned, reviewed, refactored, and reused. We’re Puppet; <a href="https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=puppet%20infrastructure%20as%20code">we wouldn’t have it any other way</a>.</p>
<p>Running your first workflow is easy, and should only take you about a minute. As tradition demands, here’s “Hello, world” (<a href="https://app.relay.sh/login">log in</a> and follow along!):</p>
<p><img src="https://relay.sh/debec11953b60317076234251dc8c4f0/hello-world.gif" alt="Hello, world!"></p>
<p>Because workflows are code, you can treat them like code. Modifying a workflow is straightforward. Let’s change the workflow, adding a step to emit the current date:</p>
<p><img src="https://relay.sh/2105fe13ad95afadea7d0e9dc45e3976/cli.gif" alt="Change the workflow using the CLI"></p>
<p>That covered <a href="https://relay.sh/docs/getting-started/#install-the-cli">getting the CLI installed</a>, authenticating against the service, downloading your workflow, modifying the logic, and then letting Relay know the code is updated.</p>
<h2>Triggers and steps</h2>
<p>Workflows contain <em>triggers</em> and <em>steps</em>: Triggers determine when Relay should execute your workflow: manually, on a schedule, or when pinged by an external source. Steps represent the set of actions and activities necessary to make your workflow accomplish its goals. Steps are just <a href="https://www.docker.com/resources/what-container">containers</a>, so you’re pretty unconstrained when it comes to what a step can do. Both triggers and steps <a href="https://relay.sh/docs/integrating-with-relay/">are easy to create, remix, and share</a>. With these building blocks, Relay is capable of modeling a huge variety of workflows, and executing them on your behalf. There are a bunch already written, and it’s straightforward to <a href="https://relay.sh/docs/getting-started/">make your own</a>.</p>
<p>Here’s a more interesting example workflow that <a href="https://relay.sh/workflows/ec2-reaper/">cleans up some unneeded EC2 instances</a>. It has more steps, including some that consume AWS credentials, and one which represents a <em>manual approval</em> gate:</p>
<p><img src="https://relay.sh/18f91058f6a39345a357bc6d72855ed8/ec2-reaper.gif" alt="Cleaning up some EC2 instances"></p>
<p>It’s easy to add, remove, or replace triggers and steps to suit your liking. Some modifications for the preceding example could include adding a webhook-based trigger for the workflow, adding a notification step at the end, or better integrating it into your GitOps setup. Perhaps a step that takes the list of terminated instances, computes their money you just saved, then buys an equivalent amount of stuff from your Amazon wish list? Ops is hard work - treat yourself!</p>
<p>Our examples thus far have shown short, linear sequences of steps but you can also express some pretty elaborate processes just as easily. Here’s a picture of the execution graph of one of workflows we use to manage Relay itself:</p>

<h2>The Relay service</h2>
<p>Listening for events and running workflows might appear conceptually simple, but there are a lot of practical details that need to be worked out. Relay’s execution environment (and <a href="https://github.com/puppetlabs/relay-core">underlying engine</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li>Manages <a href="https://relay.sh/docs/using-workflows/adding-connections/">connections</a> to upstream/downstream APIs and services, making them securely available to the workflows that need them</li>
<li>Automatically creates <a href="https://relay.sh/docs/reference/relay-workflows/#push"><em>push triggers</em></a> for your workflows, complete with workflow-specific security tokens, so you can easily kick it off from all kinds of other tools</li>
<li>Automatically constructs an environment for running webhooks, so your workflows can respond to events from webhook-only services</li>
<li>Sandboxes workflow and step execution, for fault isolation</li>
<li>Manages your workflows with all the necessary <em>ops accoutrements</em> (e.g. monitoring, logging, error handling)</li>
<li>Supervises the execution of your workflows, invoking steps in the right order (with automatic parallelization)</li>
<li>Standardizes the interfaces between all these pieces so steps, triggers, and connections are reusable and remixable across workflows</li>
</ul>
<p>Relay takes care of this stuff so you don’t have to. Instead, you can focus on the logic of your workflow, the core of what you’re trying to automate.</p>
<p>After all, isn’t that the point?</p>
<h2>Automation for everyone</h2>
<p>How many unique applications are running out there across the planet (<a href="https://twitter.com/lkanies/status/1182350689529298944">or above it</a>)? Thousands? Millions? <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bajillion">Bajillions</a>? How many of them are running on identical infrastructure stacks, built with identical technology stacks, managed in identical ways at an identical scale? There’s a truly staggering variety of approaches and constraints.</p>
<p>If there’s no <em>One True Stack</em>, then there’s no <em>One True Way To Manage It</em>. The tools you employ should thrive in this sort of world because that’s the world we’ve got.</p>
<p>Relay’s core value lies in letting you tie a <a href="https://relay.sh/integrations/">wide variety of services, APIs, and platforms</a> together. It’s constructed in a deliberately pluggable way. Users can readily extend the system to talk to new technologies, respond to new kinds of events, and take action in new ways…no CS degree required. Those extensions should be easy to share, so the entire user community can benefit. The ecosystems around the tools we use are every bit as important as the tools themselves.</p>
<p>Even though it’s early days, Relay can already do quite a lot. The future holds many possibilities: new workflows, more integrations with more tools and platforms, higher-level workflow syntax, a more streamlined authoring experience, simplified input/output from steps, and more. Early users have already given us a ton of great suggestions, and we’d love to hear yours!</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>The next step (and best step) is to <a href="https://relay.sh/">try it out</a>! And if you’d like to learn more about Relay, you can check out:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://relay.sh/blog/relay-and-open-source/">How to get involved</a>, extend Relay to better meet your needs, and become part of Relay community</li>
<li><a href="https://relay.sh/docs/">The documentation</a> does a great job of introducing Relay, its usage, core concepts, and extension points</li>
<li><a href="https://relay.sh/workflows/">Peruse some workflows</a> to see what they can do. The code and its graphical execution plan are available on every workflow’s page.</li>
<li><a href="https://puppetcommunity.slack.com/archives/CMKBMAW2K">Slack</a> - come linger in the #relay channel! The more the merrier</li>
</ul>
<p>Thanks, and let a thousand workflows bloom!</p></section></div>]]>

                    This is a P.O.C. of a flexible and visually configurable platform for creation of different 
                    kinds of applications, from small micro-services to enterprise-level information systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In a nutshell, Sborex is a visual diagram

                    What's Inside

                <p>
                    This is a demo app to try how the system will work. 
                   The entities described below are automatically deployed for demonstration purposes.
                </p>

                <h3>

                <p>
                    The Register flowchart defines a process that acquires a customer data file via web or from a filesystem, 
                    transforms it and then passes to a Customer process, iterating over each line of the input file.

                <h2>
                    Technical Details
                </h2>
                <p>
                    The system is written in Java and is able to run on versions 8+. It doesn't utilize Spring Boot or Spring whatsoever. 
                    It's not based on any of the opensource BPMN engines.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Apache Camel included in the system is of version 2.24.0. It runs an embedded Jetty webserver 
                    for the web pages, rest services and websockets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the demo it is configured to run with Derby database, also embedded version. It can be configured to use 
                    PostgreSQL or any other relational database servers or Elasticsearch as its datastore.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The neat <a href="https://bpmn.io/">bpmn.io</a> library is used for displaying and editing the process definitions. 
                    There are plans to add a modeler specifically designed for Sborex to ease the use of the system's features that are not 
                    actually compliant with BMPN standard.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is also a thirdparty web page designer that opens by Edit Layout button wherever the element is accompanied with 
                    a web page template. (Please note that it is not yet fully integrated.)
                </p>

                <h2>
                    Status and Prospects
                </h2>
                <p>
                    Sborex is currently not production ready and requires further investment. 
                    The current refactoring iteration may experience performance problems under high load.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As mentioned before, the current process modeler will also be redesigned. Visual editors 
                    for transformation, service, configuration artifacts will also be added to provide a 
                    "low code" experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The latest refactoring effort was taken to get the product ready for embedding the neural 
                    networking solutions and distributed computing for higher loads.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Active Record provides a great balance between the ability to perform simple queries simply, and also the ability to access the raw SQL sometimes required to get our jobs done. In this article, we will see a number of real-life examples of business needs that may arise at our jobs.</p>
<p>They will come in the form of a request for data from someone else at the company, where we will first translate the request into SQL, and then into the Rails code necessary to find those records. We will be covering five different types of subqueries to help us find the requested data.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at why subqueries matter:</p>

<p>In the first case, without subqueries, we are going to the database twice: First to get the average salary, and then again to get the result set. With a subquery, we can avoid the extra roundtrip, getting the result directly with a single query.</p>
<h2 id="working-with-active-record-in-rails"><a href="#working-with-active-record-in-rails" aria-label="working with active record in rails permalink"></a>Working with Active Record in Rails</h2>
<p>Active Record is a little like a walled garden. It protects us as developers (and our users) from the harsh realities of what lies beyond those walls: Differences in SQL between databases (MySQL, Postgres, SQLite), knowing how to properly escape strings to avoid <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection">SQL injection attacks</a>, and generally providing an elegant abstraction to interact with our database using the language of our choice, Ruby.</p>
<p>But, SQL is extremely powerful! By understanding the SQL that Active Record is executing, we can open the gate in our walled garden to <strong>reach beyond what you may think is possible to accomplish in Rails</strong>, taking advantage of optimizations and flexibility that may be difficult to achieve otherwise.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-subqueries-in-rails"><a href="#what-are-subqueries-in-rails" aria-label="what are subqueries in rails permalink"></a>What are Subqueries in Rails</h2>
<p>In this article, we will be learning how to use subqueries in Active Record. Subqueries are what their name implies: A query within a query. We will look at how to embed subqueries into the <code>SELECT</code>, <code>FROM</code>, <code>WHERE</code>, and <code>HAVING</code> clauses of SQL, to meet the demands of our business counterparts who are asking to view data in different and interesting ways.</p>
<p>We'll be playing the role of a developer fielding questions from HR. They are asking for reports about our employees at BCE (Best Company Ever), and we'll do our best to find the data they need using Active Record.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/pganalyze/subqueries-rails-example">source code for this article</a> is available on GitHub.</p>
<h2 id="an-overview-of-our-data"><a href="#an-overview-of-our-data" aria-label="an overview of our data permalink"></a>An Overview of our Data</h2>
<p>Our database has 4 tables:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>roles</strong>: The job roles of our employees (Finance, Engineering, Sales, HR, etc...)</li>
<li><strong>employees</strong>: The people that work for BCE</li>
<li><strong>performance_reviews</strong>: Performance reviews carried out by an employee's manager, giving them a score between 0 and 100</li>
<li><strong>vacations</strong>: Keeping track of when employees have taken vacation</li>
</ul>
<p>Using <a href="https://dbdiagram.io/">https://dbdiagram.io/</a> we're able to see how these tables relate to each other:</p>

<p>If you are following along, the <code>rails db:seed</code> command will generate 1,000 employees, 1,000 vacations, and 10,000 performance reviews.</p>
<h2 id="the-where-subquery"><a href="#the-where-subquery" aria-label="the where subquery permalink"></a>The Where Subquery</h2>
<p>Now that we have our data set and we’re ready to go let’s help our HR team with their first request:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Leigh, could you find us all the employees that make <em>more than the average salary</em> at BCE?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Here we will use a subquery within the <code>WHERE</code> clause to find the employees that match HR's request:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
<span>FROM</span> employees
<span>WHERE</span>
  employees<span>.</span>salary <span>&gt;</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>avg</span><span>(</span>salary<span>)</span>
    <span>FROM</span> employees<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>My first attempt at replicating the query above looked like this:</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code><span>Employee</span><span>.</span>where<span>(</span><span>'salary &gt; :avg'</span><span>,</span> avg<span>:</span> <span>Employee</span><span>.</span>average<span>(</span><span>:salary</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p><em>But what it produced was two queries</em>: One to find the average, and a second to query employees with a salary greater than that number. Not technically wrong, but <strong>it doesn't line up with the SQL we were going for.</strong> There is also a potential performance impact of two round-trip requests to the database server, along with potential inconsistencies if a new employee making $1B/year is hired between queries one and two. Although this is unlikely in this particular scenario, it’s something to consider as a potential risk.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code>
<span>SELECT</span> <span>AVG</span><span>(</span><span>"employees"</span><span>.</span><span>"salary"</span><span>)</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>"employees"</span>

<span>SELECT</span> <span>"employees"</span><span>.</span><span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>"employees"</span> <span>WHERE</span> <span>(</span>salary <span>&gt;</span> <span>99306.4</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>What we shouldn’t forget about <a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html">Active Record</a> is that certain methods, such as <code>average(:salary)</code>, actually execute the query and return a result, while other methods implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_chaining">Method Chaining</a>, allowing you to chain multiple Active Record methods together, building up more complex SQL statements prior to their execution.</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code><span>Employee</span><span>.</span>where<span>(</span><span>'salary &gt; (:avg)'</span><span>,</span> avg<span>:</span> <span>Employee</span><span>.</span>select<span>(</span><span>'avg(salary)'</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This produces the SQL we want, but note that we had to wrap the placeholder condition <code>:avg</code> in brackets, because the database wants subqueries wrapped in brackets as well.</p>
<p>Because the seed data is generated randomly, your results will vary from mine, but I am seeing <em>487</em> matching employees, getting a result that looks like this:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>#&lt;ActiveRecord::Relation [#&lt;Employee id: 4, role_id: 5, name: "Bob Williams", salary: 127053.0, created_at: "2020-04-26 18:42:53", updated_at: "2020-04-26 18:42:53"&gt;, #&lt;Employee id: 5, role_id: 4, name: "Bob Florez", salary: 149218.0, created_at: "2020-04-26 18:42:53", updated_at: "2020-04-26 18:42:53"&gt;, ...]&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h3 id="where-not-exists"><a href="#where-not-exists" aria-label="where not exists permalink"></a>Where Not Exists</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Leigh, we would like to encourage employees to have a healthy work-life balance, and were hoping you could provide us with a list of all the <em>employees who have yet to take any vacation time</em>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For this case, <code>NOT EXISTS</code> is a perfect fit, since it only matches records that <strong>do not</strong> have a match in the subquery. An alternative is to perform a left outer join, only choosing the records with no matches on the right side. This is referred to as an <a href="https://gerardnico.com/data/type/relation/sql/anti_join">anti-join</a>, where the purpose of the join is to find records that <strong>do not</strong> have a matching record.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span>
<span>FROM</span> employees
<span>WHERE</span>
  <span>NOT</span> <span>EXISTS</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>1</span>
    <span>FROM</span> vacations
    <span>WHERE</span> vacations<span>.</span>employee_id <span>=</span> employees<span>.</span>id<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you're interested in the <strong>LEFT OUTER JOIN</strong> equivalent, it might look like this:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> employees<span>.</span><span>*</span>
<span>FROM</span>
  employees
  <span>LEFT</span> <span>OUTER</span> <span>JOIN</span> vacations <span>ON</span> vacations<span>.</span>employee_id <span>=</span> employees<span>.</span>id
<span>WHERE</span> vacations<span>.</span>id <span>IS</span> <span>NULL</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The subquery depends on a match between the <code>employees.id</code> column and the <code>vacations.employee_id</code> column, making it a <a href="https://learnsql.com/blog/correlated-sql-subqueries-newbies/">correlated subquery</a>. Because Rails follows standard naming conventions when querying (the downcased plural form of our model), we can add the above condition into our subquery without too much difficulty.</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code><span>Employee</span><span>.</span>where<span>(</span>
  <span>'NOT EXISTS (:vacations)'</span><span>,</span>
  vacations<span>:</span> <span>Vacation</span><span>.</span>select<span>(</span><span>'1'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>where<span>(</span><span>'employees.id = vacations.employee_id'</span><span>)</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Using my seed data, I am seeing <em>369</em> employees that have yet to take any vacations.</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>#&lt;ActiveRecord::Relation [#&lt;Employee id: 2, role_id: 2, name: "Alice Florez", salary: 86920.0, created_at: "2020-04-26 18:42:53", updated_at: "2020-04-26 18:42:53"&gt;, #&lt;Employee id: 5, role_id: 4, name: "Bob Florez", salary: 149218.0, created_at: "2020-04-26 18:42:53", updated_at: "2020-04-26 18:42:53"&gt;, ...]&gt;</code></pre></div>
<h2 id="the-select-subquery"><a href="#the-select-subquery" aria-label="the select subquery permalink"></a>The Select Subquery</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Leigh, could you provide us with a list of employees, <em>including the average salary</em> of a BCE employee, and how much this <em>employee's salary differs from the average</em>?</p>
</blockquote>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  <span>*</span><span>,</span>
  <span>(</span><span>SELECT</span> <span>avg</span><span>(</span>salary<span>)</span>
    <span>FROM</span> employees<span>)</span> avg_salary<span>,</span>
  salary <span>-</span> <span>(</span>
    <span>SELECT</span> <span>avg</span><span>(</span>salary<span>)</span>
    <span>FROM</span> employees<span>)</span> above_avg
<span>FROM</span> employees</code></pre></div>
<p>Because the subquery is repeated, we can save ourselves a little bit of hassle by placing the subquery SQL into a variable that we'll embed into the outer query. The <code>to_sql</code> method is perfect for this, but it's also fantastic to peak into the SQL that Rails is producing without actually executing the query.</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code>avg_sql <span>=</span> <span>Employee</span><span>.</span>select<span>(</span><span>'avg(salary)'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>to_sql

<span>Employee</span><span>.</span>select<span>(</span>

  <span>"(<span><span>#{</span>avg_sql<span>}</span></span>) avg_salary"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"salary - (<span><span>#{</span>avg_sql<span>}</span></span>) avg_difference"</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This query does not limit the results in any way, but instead selects two additional columns (<code>avg_salary</code> and <code>avg_difference</code>). Looking at the first three results, I am seeing:</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code><span>[</span>
  <span>{</span><span>"id"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>"role_id"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>1</span><span>,</span> <span>"name"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>"Joe Serna"</span><span>,</span> <span>"salary"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>86340.0</span><span>,</span> <span>"avg_salary"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>99306.4</span><span>,</span> <span>"avg_difference"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>-</span><span>12966.399999999994</span><span>}</span><span>,</span> 
  <span>{</span><span>"id"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>"role_id"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>2</span><span>,</span> <span>"name"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>"Alice Florez"</span><span>,</span> <span>"salary"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>86920.0</span><span>,</span> <span>"avg_salary"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>99306.4</span><span>,</span> <span>"avg_difference"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>-</span><span>12386.399999999994</span><span>}</span><span>,</span> 
  <span>{</span><span>"id"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>"role_id"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>3</span><span>,</span> <span>"name"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>"Amanda Florez"</span><span>,</span> <span>"salary"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>93600.0</span><span>,</span> <span>"avg_salary"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>99306.4</span><span>,</span> <span>"avg_difference"</span><span>=</span><span>&gt;</span><span>-</span><span>5706.399999999994</span><span>}</span>
<span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As with any SQL query, there are often many ways to arrive at the same result. In this example we used subqueries to find the average employee salary, but it may have been better to use <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/tutorial-window.html">window functions</a> instead. They give us the same result, but provide a simpler query which is actually more performant as well. Even on a small dataset of 1000 employees, this query takes approximately 12ms vs 18ms for the subquery equivalent.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span>
  <span>*</span><span>,</span>
  <span>avg</span><span>(</span>salary<span>)</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> avg_salary<span>,</span>
  salary <span>-</span> <span>avg</span><span>(</span>salary<span>)</span> <span>OVER</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>AS</span> avg_salary
<span>FROM</span>
  employees</code></pre></div>
<p>The window function approach is actually easier to write in Rails as well!</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code><span>Employee</span><span>.</span>select<span>(</span>
  <span>'*'</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"avg(salary) OVER () avg_salary"</span><span>,</span>
  <span>"salary - avg(salary) OVER () avg_difference"</span>
<span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="the-from-subquery"><a href="#the-from-subquery" aria-label="the from subquery permalink"></a>The From Subquery</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Leigh, we'd like to know the <em>average performance review score</em> given across all our managers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After clarifying with HR, they are looking to take the average score each manager has given, and then take the average of those averages. In other words, the average average. When you are dealing with an <strong>aggregate of aggregates</strong>, it needs to be accomplished in two steps. This can be done using a subquery as the <code>FROM</code> clause, essentially giving us a temporary table to then select from, allowing us to find the average of those averages.</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>avg</span><span>(</span>avg_score<span>)</span> reviewer_avg
<span>FROM</span> <span>(</span>
  <span>SELECT</span> reviewer_id<span>,</span> <span>avg</span><span>(</span>score<span>)</span> avg_score
  <span>FROM</span> performance_reviews
  <span>GROUP</span> <span>BY</span> reviewer_id<span>)</span> reviewer_avgs</code></pre></div>
<p>To keep our Ruby code clean, we'll place the subquery into a variable which can then be embedded into the main query.</p>
<div data-language="ruby"><pre><code>from_sql <span>=</span>
  <span>PerformanceReview</span><span>.</span>select<span>(</span><span>:reviewer_id</span><span>,</span> <span>'avg(score) avg_score'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>group<span>(</span>
    <span>:reviewer_id</span>

<span>PerformanceReview</span><span>.</span>select<span>(</span><span>'avg(avg_score) reviewer_avg'</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>from<span>(</span>
  <span>"(<span><span>#{</span>from_sql<span>}</span></span>) as reviewer_avgs"</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span>take<span>.</span>reviewer_avg</code></pre></div>
<p>The result of this query is <code>50.652</code>. This makes sense given that the seed data …</p></div></div></div>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Analytics Engineer: this term has started showing up in blog posts and job listings. It all happened quickly; just a couple of years ago, it wasn't a thing our friends in the data ecosystem talked about. So how did it start trending, what is it exactly, and is it here to stay? We decided to take a closer look, and here's what we found out.</p>

<h2>Naming the Need</h2>
<p>At present, there's an unmissable connection between the 'Analytics Engineer' term and the ecosystem around <a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a>, the command line data transformation tool developed by <a href="https://www.fishtownanalytics.com/">Fishtown Analytics</a>. However, the company's Head of Marketing <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/janessalantz">Janessa Lantz</a> told us that they wouldn't take credit for coining it:&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>"It started popping up in the dbt community in 2018.&nbsp;</i><span><i>Michael Kaminsky was probably the first to formally write anything about it when he published [his] post in early 2019.</i></span><i>"</i></p>
<p><a href="https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/analytics-engineer/" rel=" noopener"><span><img src="https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png?width=2364&amp;name=The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png" alt="The Analytics Engineer post" width="2364" srcset="https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png?width=1182&amp;name=The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png 1182w, https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png?width=2364&amp;name=The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png 2364w, https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png?width=3546&amp;name=The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png 3546w, https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png?width=4728&amp;name=The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png 4728w, https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png?width=5910&amp;name=The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png 5910w, https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png?width=7092&amp;name=The%20Analytics%20Engineer%20post.png 7092w" sizes="(max-width: 2364px) 100vw, 2364px"></span></a>Janessa is referring to <a href="https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/analytics-engineer/">"The Analytics Engineer"</a>, a post published by Locally Optimistic and authored by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-the-data-guy-kaminsky/">Michael Kaminsky</a>, currently a consultant, and formerly a Director of Analytics at <a href="https://www.harrys.com/">Harry's</a>. As Michael recalled in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s-KYV9zsWM">recent Locally Optimistic webinar discussing his blog post</a>, not many were using that term at the time, but the need for it had started to emerge:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>"I realized pretty early on that we had this need for an analytics engineer, […] who would be on the analytics team working with us, pursuing our goals, and not necessarily being on the data engineering team, but [who still] had software engineering skills. And&nbsp;</i><i><span>it was a real battle with my organization to actually be able to hire for that role because no one had ever heard of it before.</span> […] So after going through that experience and talking with lots of other people who were having similar experiences, I wanted to write this blog post about why this role is so important and what it actually means."</i></p>
<p>Well, what it actually means is still somewhat open for debate – and we'll come back to it – but Michael's seminal post took a pretty good stab at coming up with a general definition:</p>
<p><i>"</i><i><span>The analytics engineer sits at the intersection of the skill sets of data scientists, analysts, and data engineers.</span>They bring a formal and rigorous software engineering practice to the efforts of analysts and data scientists, and they bring an analytical and business-outcomes mindset to the efforts of data engineering."</i></p>
<h2>An Epiphany</h2>
<p>One year later, it is fair to say that the Locally Optimistic post resonated deeply with those who were already doing analytics engineering, even when they weren't calling it that. In the above-mentioned webinar, dbt Community Manager <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/clrcrl/">Claire Carroll</a> recalls how she felt at the time:&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>"I remember reading Michael's post in January of 2019 and feeling very seen. I had given a presentation six months earlier where I wrote my title as "Data Something" […] so <span>as soon as I saw that analytics engineer title I was like, ‛yeah, that's what I am!’</span>"<br></i></p>
<p>Claire also wrote <a href="https://blog.getdbt.com/what-is-an-analytics-engineer/">her own post about this topic</a>, in which she shares a key point made by Michael and several other people we talked to: the evolution of data tools has played a key role in this shift. While she still recalls a time when Excel was her primary tool, that changed quickly, and <span>the analytics engineering toolkit is now much more technical and multifaceted.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylangbaker/">Dylan Baker</a> is well-placed to know this: he started doing what ended up being analytics engineering work at <a href="https://simbasleep.com/">Simba Sleep</a> and <a href="https://www.growthstreet.co.uk/">Growth Street</a>, before starting <a href="https://dbanalytics.co/">his analytics engineering consultancy</a>. The tools he uses the most right now are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a>, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery">BigQuery</a> and <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/">Redshift</a> for data warehouses;</li>
<li><a href="https://fivetran.com/">Fivetran</a> and <a href="https://www.stitchdata.com/">Stitch</a> for data extraction and loading;</li>
<li><a href="https://www.getdbt.com/">dbt</a> for the transformation layer;</li>
<li><a href="https://looker.com/">Looker</a> on the BI/modeling side.</li>
</ul>
<p>Others use similar stacks with small variations, for instance with <a href="https://mode.com/">Mode</a> or <a href="https://chartio.com/">Chartio</a> as alternatives to Looker. If you are considering which tools to use right now, we recommend reading this overview on Locally Optimistic: <a href="https://www.locallyoptimistic.com/post/0-to-60-analytics-stack/">"Building an Analytics Stack in 2020"</a>.</p>
<p>One might also note, unsurprisingly, that in the same way the analytics engineering toolset is evolving, dbt's focus is also expanding, as Janessa told us:&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>"We used to describe dbt as the "T" in "ETL", but it also does testing and documentation, and integrates with version control so that description is no longer comprehensive enough. </i><i><span>Increasingly, we describe dbt as "analytics engineering software"</span> which better captures the range of work that happens between loading data into your warehouse and analyzing it in your BI tool."</i></p>
<p><span>New tools have also emerged to support this workflow</span> and integrate best practices from the software engineering world. For instance, <a href="https://greatexpectations.io/?utm_source=data-council&amp;utm_medium=blog-mention">Great Expectations</a> focuses on fighting pipeline debt thanks to data testing and documentation; while Dylan is working on <a href="https://spectacles.dev/">Spectacles</a>, a command-line, continuous integration tool for Looker and <a href="https://docs.looker.com/data-modeling/learning-lookml/what-is-lookml">LookML</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://spectacles.dev/" rel=" noopener"><img src="https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Spectacles.png?width=2822&amp;name=Spectacles.png" alt="Spectacles" width="2822" srcset="https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Spectacles.png?width=1411&amp;name=Spectacles.png 1411w, https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Spectacles.png?width=2822&amp;name=Spectacles.png 2822w, https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Spectacles.png?width=4233&amp;name=Spectacles.png 4233w, https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Spectacles.png?width=5644&amp;name=Spectacles.png 5644w, https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Spectacles.png?width=7055&amp;name=Spectacles.png 7055w, https://www.datacouncil.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/Spectacles.png?width=8466&amp;name=Spectacles.png 8466w" sizes="(max-width: 2822px) 100vw, 2822px"></a></p>
<h2>A Catalyst for Analytics</h2>
<p>With this stack in mind, you might be wondering what differentiates an analytics engineer from a data engineer. The exact answer will vary depending on each organization, but <span>a common denominator seems to be that analytics engineers are much more concerned with </span><a href="https://dev.to/tiffany/what-is-business-logic-1gdf">business logic</a> and are better positioned to grasp the true implications of their work in terms of business value.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's also the case at <a href="https://www.chewy.com/">Chewy</a>, where analytics engineers differ from data engineers in terms of both skill set and responsibilities. Director of Business Intelligence at Chewy, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-gerstl-48a907/">Michael Gerstl</a>, explained in Locally Optimistic's May 5th webinar:</p>
<p><i>"I look at our analytics engineers – my BI engineers – as jack of all trades, master of none. They're not going to be ETL engineers, but they're going to be able to write Python, they're going to be able to use Knime to build data pipelines, they're going to do data validation testing, they're going to use Git, they're going to use Tableau, and&nbsp;</i><i><span>they're going to be able to sit with business users and walk with them through their problems</span></i><i> – which is probably the biggest thing for me."</i></p>
<p>This is what makes analytics engineers an almost immediate catalyst for analytics teams, and more generally, for the businesses who hire them; and explains why they are increasingly in high demand.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>The Making of an Analytics Engineer</h2>
<p>While there is no unique path to get into analytics engineering, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielle-leong-nyc/">Danielle Leong</a>'s career trajectory is an example of how someone can transition into this field. Although she never officially had "Analytics Engineer" as her job title, this new term very much represents the work she has been doing for the last couple of years, including in her current role at <a href="https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/">Teachers Pay Teachers</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The transition took place during Danielle's former role at <a href="https://starry.com/">Starry</a>, where she was hired as an analyst but ended up becoming a top contributor to the company's dbt repo. Based on this experience, she encourages recruiters to <span>"look for a mindset, not a skill set."</span> This can be found in workers with a large range of profiles. For instance, breaking problems down is something that professionals with a STEM education like her are familiar with, as are software engineers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More generally, people can go directly into analytics engineering either from a data engineering background or from an analyst one. According to Danielle, coming from the latter is probably easier, since that person will already be familiar with the business context and other 'soft' skills, which aren't the easiest to learn.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In contrast, there is an increasing amount of resources available for an analyst to develop into an analytics engineer. In a conversation, Danielle pointed out <a href="https://learn.getdbt.com/">dbt learn</a> and dbt's <a href="https://github.com/fishtown-analytics/jaffle_shop/blob/master/README.md">jaffle shop tutorial</a> as some of the resources she wishes existed when she got started. She thinks the fictional e-commerce store project is particularly helpful, because it gives learners a business context that they can use as a playground to learn dbt skills.</p>
<p>Even if this is a good substitute for direct experience, Danielle advises recruiters and managers against making previous analytics engineering knowledge a prerequisite for new hires. Instead, she recommends them to look for candidates who could grow into their roles. By doing that, companies might also end up saving money, she <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6VCr30ZFxZ0">noted in a talk</a> at an NYC dbt meetup last February:</p>
<p><i>"One thing that I noticed talking to a handful of companies and […] a variety of in-house recruiters and managers is that right now <span>for someone who has some analytics engineering skills […] the price range seems to be about $120k to $130k. […] </span>From my experience […] </i><i>I would say that<span> this is probably more of an $80k to $100k range if you want to take the opportunity to really train someone up.</span></i><i>"</i></p>
<p>Of course, your mileage may vary depending on the city you are in and the overall job market, but one thing is for sure: analytics engineers are in demand, and flexible requirements will bring more candidates.</p>

<h2>What's Next?</h2>
<p>With analytics engineering becoming one of the first responsibilities of new data hires, is it destined to become a career path in which people will spend decades? There are reasons to think it might not, according to Claire Carroll. Admittedly "playing devil's advocate" during Locally Optimistic's May 5th webinar, she noted that the curiosity and learning appetite of people who typically become analytics engineers might cause them to move on to other roles – especially positions that are less internally-facing and where they can more directly sense their impact.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Michael Kaminsky hopes that it will be more than a stepping stone, becoming instead a long-term practice at which people get better over time&nbsp; –&nbsp; and a crucial one for companies, to the point that analytics engineers could eventually become a bigger group than data engineers.</p>
<p>Obviously, it is still early to know which, if any, of these predictions is right, but the notion of "practice" seems to be key here. In our …</p></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

<p>Back when there were rumors of Google building an operating system, I thought<span></span> <span>“</span>Lol.”</p>
<p>Then I watched then-PM Sundar Pichai <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QRO3gKj3qw">announce Chrome <span>OS</span></a>. My heart raced. It was perfect.</p>
<p>I got my email through Gmail, I wrote documents on Docs, I listened to Pandora, I viewed photos on TheFacebook. Why did I need all of Windows Vista?</p>
<p>In 2010, I predicted that by 2020 Chrome <span>OS</span> would be the most popular desktop <span>OS</span> in the world. It was fast, lightweight, and $0.</p>
<p><span>“</span>Every Windows and <span>OS</span> X app will be re-built for the browser!” I thought. Outlook-&gt;Gmail. Excel-&gt;Sheets. Finder-&gt;Dropbox. Photoshop-&gt;Figma. Terminal-&gt;Repl.it.</p>
<p>All of your files would be accessible by whoever you wanted, wherever you wanted, all the time. It was obvious. Revolutionary.</p>
<p>I haven’t installed <span>MSFT</span> Office on a machine since 2009. Sheets and Docs have been good enough for me. The theoretical unlimited computing power and collaboration features meant Google Docs was better than Office (and free!).</p>
<p>Then something happened at Google. I’m not sure what. But they stopped innovating on cloud software.</p>
<p>Docs and Sheets haven’t changed in a decade. Google Drive remains impossible to navigate. Sharing is complicated. Sheets freezes up. I can’t easily interact with a Sheets <span>API</span> (I’ve tried!). Docs still shows page breaks by default! <span>WTF</span>!</p>
<p>Even though I have an iPhone and a MacBook, I’ve been married to Google services. I browse Chrome. I use Gmail. I get directions and lookup restaurants on Maps. I’m a YouTube addict.</p>
<p>Yet I’ve been ungluing myself from Google so far this year. Not because of Google-is-reading-my-emails-and-tracking-every-keystroke reasons, but because I like other software so much more that it’s worth switching.</p>
<p>At <span>WWDC</span>, Apple shared Safari stats for macOS Big Sur. It reminded me how much Chrome makes my machine go <span>WHURRRRRR</span>. Yesterday, I made Safari my default browser again.</p>
<p>My Gmail inbox has become a mailbox stuffed with clothing flyers, SaaS mailers, and Rollbar alerts. I love when people respond to Second Breakfast, but their responses get lost amid a sea of plastic bottles. I started using <span>HEY</span> last week. My new email is <a href="mailto:billy@hey.com">billy@hey.com</a>. I love it so far.</p>
<p>I’ve given up on Google Docs. I can never find the documents Andy shares with me. The formatting is tired and stuck in the you-might-print-this-out paradigm. Notion is a much better place to write and brainstorm with people.</p>
<p>The mobile Google results page is so cluttered that I switched my iPhone’s default search to DuckDuckGo. The results are a tad worse, but I’m never doing heavy-duty searches on the go. And now I don’t have to scroll past 6 ads to get the first result. DuckDuckGo’s privacy is an added bonus.</p>
<p>I still use Google Sheets heavily. But wow, Airtable makes Sheets feel decrepit. Where’s the easy API? New ways of formatting? Better collaboration? Simple sheet-as-a-database?</p>
<p>My new usage patterns:</p>
<ul>
<li>Email: <del>Gmail</del> <span>HEY</span></li>
<li>Search: <del>Google</del> DuckDuckGo (mobile) and Google (desktop)</li>
<li>Maps: Google</li>
<li>Docs: <del>Google</del> Notion</li>
<li>Sheets: Google</li>
<li>Video: YouTube (but increasingly I’m noticing other people use Twitch, Instagram, and TikTok)</li>
<li>Video Calls: <del>Google Meet</del> Zoom</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m a long shareholder of Google. It’s amazing how they have four monopolies and only monetize one of them. I’m confident they have a bright future ahead.</p>
<p>But the lack of innovation is frustrating. The product goals are all over the place. Microsoft has a new clear mission: The Cloud. What’s Google’s clear mission?</p>
<p>It feels like they blew a 10 year lead.</p>

arbitrary syntax to generate valid Rust code at compile time. I use them all

</span></code></pre></div><p>Unfortunately once you need to do more than these trivial macros, the
difficulty tends to go through the roof…</p><p>I recently encountered a situation at work where a non-trivial technical
problem could be solved by writing an equally non-trivial macro. There are a
number of tricks and techniques I employed along the way that helped keep the
code manageable and easy to implement, so I thought I’d help the next adventurer
by writing them down.</p><div><p>The code written in this article is available <a href="https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/non-trivial-macros">on GitHub</a>. Feel free to
browse through and steal code or inspiration.</p><p>If you found this useful or spotted a bug, let me know on the blog’s
<a href="https://github.com/Michael-F-Bryan/adventures.michaelfbryan.com">issue tracker</a>!</p></div><h2 id="the-back-story">The Back-Story</h2><p>In one of the big projects I work on, we made a design decisions you won’t
see in most typical Rust codebases:</p><blockquote><p>Major systems must be isolated in their own crate with all requirements
declared via traits, and <strong>where possible these traits should be
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch17-02-trait-objects.html#object-safety-is-required-for-trait-objects">object-safe</a></strong>.</p></blockquote><p>The reasoning for this is quite straightforward, the application may need to
reconfigure both its behaviour and hardware bindings at runtime, and allowing
the possibility of dynamic dispatch makes this a lot easier.</p><p>This is a soft-realtime motion controller which can control several related
families of machine using the same electronics and electrical components, but
with different mechanical configurations.</p><p>Now, imagine the controller is initially configured to run machine A with
particular assumptions about the world (which inputs things are attached to,
available optional components, etc.) and the user changes some settings to
make it behave like machine B with its own assumptions about the world.</p><p>You have a couple options for how to implement this:</p><ol><li>Load the machine configuration on startup and jump to the corresponding
code… This requires a restart for any settings changes to take effect</li><li>Use enums to encapsulate the different IO layouts or business logic…
Congratulations, your code now has 10x more <code>match</code> statements</li><li>Take an object-oriented approach, replacing the conditionals from option 2
<a href="https://refactoring.guru/replace-conditional-with-polymorphism">with polymorphism</a> (i.e. dynamic dispatch)… Adds
constraints on the behaviour you can expect from dependencies, but reduces
cognitive load and lets you switch between things at runtime by pointing at
a different object</li></ol><p>The last option looked like the least-bad of the 3, but no doubt you’ll find
out if it doesn’t work for us… Just look out for the blog post exploring
different architectures for complicated systems 😛</p><p>Making allowances for dynamic dispatch where possible adds its own set of
interesting challenge, though.</p><p>Imagine you’re programming the flashing lights on an operator console and come
up with something like this:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>/// Port A of the on-board General Purpose IOs.
</span><span></span><span>struct</span> <span>GPIOA</span><span> </span>{<span> </span>...<span> </span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>flash_periodically</span>(gpio: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span>GPIOA,<span> </span>pin: <span>usize</span>,<span> </span>interval: <span>Duration</span>)<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span>current_state<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>loop</span><span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>        </span>gpio.set_state(pin,<span> </span>current_state);<span>
</span><span>        </span>current_state<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>!</span>current_state;<span>
</span><span>        </span>sleep(interval);<span>
</span><span>    </span>}<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>Now, being a good developer you pull the hardware-specific logic out into its
own trait.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>trait</span><span> </span>DigitalInput<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>set_state</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span>self,<span> </span>new_state: <span>bool</span>);<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>flash_periodically</span><span>&lt;</span>D<span>&gt;</span>(lamp: <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span>D,<span> </span>interval: <span>Duration</span>)<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>where</span><span> </span>D: <span>DigitalInput</span><span>
</span><span></span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>let</span><span> </span><span>mut</span><span> </span>current_state<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>false</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span>    </span><span>loop</span><span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>        </span>lamp.set_state(current_state);<span>
</span><span>        </span>current_state<span> </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>!</span>current_state;<span>
</span><span>        </span>sleep(interval);<span>
</span><span>    </span>}<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>On the surface this looks quite good, we are only coupling to the functionality
declared by the trait.</p><p>We can even make our own <code>DigitalInput</code> and verify it compiles as expected.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>struct</span> <span>Pin</span>;<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>impl</span><span> </span>DigitalInput<span> </span><span>for</span><span> </span>Pin<span> </span>{<span>
</span><span>    </span><span>fn</span> <span>set_state</span>(<span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span><span> </span>self,<span> </span>new_state: <span>bool</span>)<span> </span>{<span> </span>unimplemented<span>!</span>()<span> </span>}<span>
</span><span></span>}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>fn</span> <span>main</span>()<span> </span>{<span>

</span><span></span>}<span>
</span></code></pre></div><p>However, the <code>DigitalInput</code> trait has a couple quirks that prevent it from doing
dynamic dispatch. The easiest way to see this is by creating an
<code>assert_is_digital_input()</code> function.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>fn</span> <span>assert_is_digital_input</span><span>&lt;</span>D<span>&gt;</span>()<span> </span><span>where</span><span> </span>D: <span>DigitalInput</span><span> </span><span>+</span><span> </span><span>?</span><span>Sized</span><span> </span>{}<span>

new method to a trait means you need to fix the trait object impls as well as
any other real downstream implementations. Multiply by half a dozen systems

copy-pasta gets annoying pretty quickly.</p><p>My solution is to use a macro (i.e. compile-time codegen) to automatically
generate the necessary impl blocks.</p><p>This <em>could</em> be implemented using procedural macros, but they can have a
negative impact on compile times and I’d like an excuse to play around with
Rust’s declarative macros.</p><h2 id="getting-started">Getting Started</h2><p>Now you have a better understanding of the problem we’re trying to solve, the

pattern matching which, instead of relying on the type system, uses parsing
machinery from the compiler itself. For example, when you write <code>$value:expr</code>
in a macro, that asks the compiler to try and parse some tokens as an
expression, and assign the AST node to <code>$value</code> on success.</p><p>Our first step is to write a macro that can match a method signature.</p><p>Matching something like <code>fn get_x(&amp;self) -&gt; u32;</code> isn’t too difficult. The only
bits that will change are <code>get_x</code> and <code>u32</code>, where <code>get_x</code> is some identifier
for the item name and <code>u32</code> is our return type.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="rust"><span>// src/lib.rs

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    
    <p>Have you ever wondered when joining a new project, or exploring a public project on GitHub why specific decisions were made, what was the motivation behind those decisions, if any, what were the alternatives considered? I definitely am. </p><p>Projects might have nice architectural diagrams, API, technical documentation, this is all good, and valuable assets,  but without knowing the reasoning behind why that exact architecture or even stack was chosen will impact the in-depth of the project understanding,  quality of the project in the longer term and maybe even the passion around the project the developers have.</p><p>Sure, eventually you might reach the point where everything starts making sense, but it would be much better if it was an explicit document, instead of gossips and rumors which are inevitable if decisions making process is hidden.</p><p>Before we start the discussion you might take a look into one of possible <a href="https://github.com/zshamrock/stonesgame.io/blob/master/decisions.md">decisions.md</a> in action.</p><h3 id="what">What</h3><p>What should you document. It is all about <strong>Why, Alternatives, Risks</strong>:</p><ul><li><strong>Why</strong> that specific decision was made (even if it was just a personal taste, make it clear)</li><li>What were the <strong>alternatives</strong> considered (it is ok to state that no alternatives were considered at all, this is still valid, as it is clear for everybody now that this was a deliberate choice)</li><li>What are the potential <strong>risks</strong> you have foreseen by making this decision (risks could be from any aspects, like cost, extendibility, maintenance, learning curve, literally anything, or none, if you could not foresee any)</li></ul><p>It is important to understand that the purpose of this document is not to build the "perfect" architecture and the system from the beginning (as it is impossible, while software development being partially an art, and as every art it requires iterations, and refinements in the process). </p><p>It is about transparency, and if you like, maybe even about respect for everybody who is and will be involved in the project now and in the future.</p><p>What exact decisions could be? The rule of thumb - anything you consider important to mention, or would like to read yourself if you would join your own project. But the minimal core should cover such areas as:</p><ul><li>technology stack (language, frameworks, libraries) (both backend and frontend)</li><li>application architecture (again, not what, but why)</li><li>building tools</li><li>testing framework</li><li>provisioning and deployment</li><li>hosting</li><li>CI/CD</li><li>application/http server</li><li>persistence storage (which database and why)</li><li>caching</li><li>security</li></ul><p>If you don't have a specific decision yet made regards some of the aspects mentioned above (and they are relevant to your project), it still makes sense to say it explicitly, that this area is important and will require some revisiting later in the project's stage. Again it is all about transparency.</p><h3 id="how">How</h3><p>Keep it simple. Markdown or any human readable/friendly format will do the job. It is good to put a date when you add the entries into the file, like "Sun 1 Nov, 2015".</p><p>It should be part of your source code, so every developer can easy access it, and track the history.</p><p><strong>Never change anythig, but append only!</strong> Do not try to change the past, if you have to change the decision you made before, just make a new decision and document it, keeping the old there as well, so the progress, and thinking process will stay visible. </p><p>And this imperfection is what makes this document so valuable.</p><h3 id="when">When</h3><p>Whenever the new important decision or step was made. When you feel comfortable and have time to do so. But, never postpone it for too long, as there is a danger, that then it will not reflect the exact thinking process you had in the moment of making the decision.</p><h3 id="ok,_if_it_is_so_coll,_why_nobody_does_it?">Ok, if it is so coll, why nobody does it?</h3><p>Good question ;) I can't answer for sure, I can only guess. I think it is fear:</p><ul><li>fear of sharing the knowledge with people around you, which is a bad sign by itself, as true leaders grow other leaders, and in order to have more power you have to share the power</li><li>fear of being wrong, and the desire to have a "perfect" decisions making history record (again true leaders will admit their mistakes and learn from them, and it is easier to learn if you have all the thinking process documented, and true leaders respects the people they work with, and don't afraid of them)</li><li>fear to be a human, to be yourself, no matter what the title you have, courage to admit, that some decisions were made, just because you feel confident with the technology, or just like it, or feel it is a right thing to do, don't play politics, be a human</li><li>fear of transparency, that you are no longer the source of "secret" data and privileged access</li><li>fear of taking responsibilities of the decisions made</li></ul><h3 id="give_it_a_try">Give it a try</h3><p>In the early beginning of the project, with lack of the information, it is difficult to make the right decisions. So, the goal is don't waste the time, and either make the reasonable decisions if possible (to provide a roadmap) or postpone it until more information and more important understanding is revealed.</p><p>The goal is not to build the perfect architecture/decisions from the beginning, but <strong>document</strong> the <strong>why</strong> of the important decisions made, so everyone can access the decisions making process, check which assumptions were right, which were changed while the project evolved, which were completely wrong, etc. So, everybody could learn, and it would be transparent to everyone, why the project is in the state it is at the moment.</p><p>I think that if just a fraction of enterprise and open source projects would integrate this practice in its software development process, it could be a huge step forward to make an IT industry a better place to work in.</p><p>People spent time and efforts to draw the final product architecture, but they miss the part of explaining why.</p><p>It is a decisions making history.</p>

We keep hearing it over and over from Spark beginners and experts alike: </p><ul role="list"><li>"It's hard to understand what's going on"</li><li>"Even if there's a critical information, it's buried behind a lot of noisy information that only experts know how to navigate"</li><li>"There's a lot of tribal knowledge involved"</li><li>"The Spark history server is a pain to setup"</li></ul><p>At Data Mechanics we have the crazy ambition of replacing the Spark UI&nbsp;and&nbsp;Spark History Server with something delightful, let's call it the Spark Delight.</p><p>We plan to make it work on top of any Spark platform, entirely free of charge.&nbsp;We started prototyping it.&nbsp;Before we move to production, we'd like to get feedback and sense the interest from the community.&nbsp;If you find this project interesting, share this article and fill up the form at the bottom of this page - we'll email you when the Spark Delight is out.</p><h2>What's wrong with the current Spark UI?</h2><figure id="w-node-0caf7a68bd55-34f13c63"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5ef2169d2d8a1cf2e5922ef8_sparkui.jpg" alt=""></p><figcaption>The familiar Spark UI&nbsp;(jobs page)</figcaption></figure><h5>It's hard to get the bird's eye view of what is going on. </h5><ul role="list"><li>Which jobs/stages took most of the time? How do they match with my code?</li><li>Is there a stability or performance issue that matters?</li><li>What is the bottleneck of my app (I/O bound, CPU bound, Memory bound)?</li></ul><h5>The Spark UI lacks essential node metrics (CPU, Memory and I/O usage).</h5><ul role="list"><li>You can go without them, but you'll be walking in the dark.&nbsp;Changing an instance type will be a leap of faith.</li><li>Or you'll need to setup a separate metrics monitoring system: Ganglia, Prometheus + Grafana, StackDriver (GCP), or CloudWatch (AWS).<br>You'll need to jump back and forth between this monitoring system and the Spark U trying to match the timestamps between the two (usually jumping between UTC and your local timezone, to increase the fun).</li></ul><h5>The Spark History Server (rendering the Spark UI after an application is finished) is hard to setup.</h5><ul role="list"><li>You need to persist spark event logs to long-term storage and often run it yourself, incurring costs and maintenance burden.</li><li>It takes a long time to load, and it sometimes crashes.</li></ul><h2>What would the Spark Delight look like?</h2><p>A picture is worth a thousand word, so here's a GIF&nbsp;of our prototype:</p><figure id="w-node-52171ed34cc9-34f13c63"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5ef23be7c40e3df997a03146_gif4.gif" alt=""></p><figcaption>Our prototype for a Spark UI replacement. Let us know your feedback!</figcaption></figure><h4>What is new about it? </h4><p>The main screen (overview) has a lot of new information and visuals.</p><h5>Summary statistics</h5><figure id="w-node-711ca6fcf576-34f13c63"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5ef23d3390f01fa9c7b7c4bd_summary.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>What was the duration of the app, the amount of resources (CPU uptime) that were used, the duration of all the Spark tasks (should be close to your CPU uptime unless you suffer from bad parallelism or long phases of driver-only work/idleness).</p><h5>Recommendations</h5><figure id="w-node-ce308d4fc039-34f13c63"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5ef23f0906fd7620fa29cc47_recos.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This section pinpoints stability and performance issues at a high-level to help developers address them. Examples:</p><ul role="list"><li>"The default number of tasks (200) is too small compared to the number of CPU cores (400) available. Increase spark.sql.shuffle.partitions to 1200."</li><li>"Job 4 suffers from an input data skew. Consider repartitioning your data or salting the partition key".</li><li>"An executor crashed due to an OutOfMemory error in stage 7 with 85% of the memory used by Python, consider increasing the memory available per executor or setting spark.executor.pyspark.memory".</li></ul><p>This section builds upon the capability of the Data Mechanics platform to automatically tune infrastructure parameters and Spark configurations (e.g. instance type, memory/cpu allocations, configs for parallelism, shuffle, I/O) for each pipeline running on it based on its history. This high-level feedback will complement the serverless features of the platform by helping developers understand and optimize their application code.</p><h5>Executors CPU Usage</h5><figure id="w-node-98a33325b07a-34f13c63"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5ef313d60eb44a31f2671575_CPU%20cropped.png" alt=""></p></figure><p><strong>‍</strong>What were your executor CPU cores doing on average? If there is a lot of unused time, maybe your app is overprovisioned. If they spend a lot of time doing shuffles (all-to-all data communications), it's worth looking if some shuffles can be avoided, or at tuning the performance of the shuffle stages. This screen should let you see quickly if your app is I/O bound or CPU bound, and make smarter infrastructure changes accordingly (e.g. use an instance type with more CPUs or faster disks).</p><p>What's great with this screen is that you can visually align this information with the different Spark phases of your app. If most of your app is spent in single shuffle heavy stage, you can spot this in one second, and in a single click dive into the specific stage.</p><h5>Executors Peak Memory Usage</h5><figure id="w-node-cc3d4316744b-34f13c63"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5ef313cbf911d3f320e886ac_Memory%20cropped.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>This screen shows you the memory usage breakdown for each executor when the total memory consumption was at its peak. You'll be immediately able to see if you went close to the memory limit (narrowly avoiding an OutOfMemory error), or if you have plenty of leg room. The Spark Delight gives you the split between the different types of memories used by the JVM and the python memory usage. This data is crucial but as far as we know Spark developers have no easy way to get this today.</p><p>‍</p><h5>Stage and Executor Pages</h5><figure id="w-node-301b783408b9-34f13c63"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5ef23e68f29e653026787c41_task%20metrics.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>You can then dive in and find similar information at a finer granularity on a Spark stage page or an executor page. For example, on a specific stage page, you'll see graphs showing the distribution of a metric (e.g. duration or input size) over all the tasks in this stage, so you can immediately visually notice if you suffer from skew. Check the animated GIF for a full tour.</p><h4>What is NOT new about it? </h4><p>The Spark UI also has many visuals that work really well. Our goal is not to throw it all away. On the contrary we would like the Spark Delight to contain as much information as the current Spark UI. We plan to reuse many elements, like the tables for the list of jobs, stages, and tasks, the Gantt chart illustrating tasks scheduled across executors within a stage, the DAG views, and more.</p><h2>How does debugging with the Spark Delight work in practice?</h2><p>We'll use two concrete scenarios we recently encountered with some of our customers.</p><h4><strong>A parallelism issue</strong></h4><p>One of our customer was running an app with 10 executors with 8 CPU cores each, such that the app could run 80 Spark tasks in parallel. But a developer had set the `spark.sql.shuffle.partitions` configuration to 8, such that during shuffles only 8 tasks were generated, meaning 90% of the app resources were unused. This configuration was a mistake (probably set during local development), but the fact is that this critical issue is completely silent in the current Spark UI, unless you know really well where to look for it. In the Spark delight, the issue would be obvious:</p><figure id="w-node-02c7552f9875-34f13c63"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5ef23887f5a2fe55d3ddb390_CPU.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>This graph of average executors CPU&nbsp;usage over time shows that there is a lot of unused capacity due to bad parallelism, particularly during the last few jobs and stages of the app.</figcaption></figure><p>This parallelism example might seem planted, but note that it's more common than you think — it also happens when the default value (200) is too small compared to the total app capacity, or when the input data is incorrectly partitioned (which takes more than a configuration change to fix).</p><h4>A&nbsp;memory issue </h4><p>Memory errors are the most common source of crashes in Spark, but they come in different sorts. The JVM can get an OutOfMemory error (meaning the heap got to its maximum size, needed to allocate more space, but even after GC couldn't find any), this can happen for many reasons like an imbalanced shuffle, a high concurrency, or improper use of caching. Another common memory issue is when a Spark executor is killed (by Kubernetes or by YARN) because it exceeded its memory limit. This happens a lot when using PySpark, because the Spark executor will spawn one python process per running task.</p><figure id="w-node-5fc11bcf693a-34f13c63"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5e72486289a61e0d8c9dbb56/5ef239752653776e4b979cec_Memory.png" alt=""></p><figcaption>This graph of executors memory breakdown at peak usage shows that Python processes were using most of the allocated container memory.</figcaption></figure><p>Few monitoring tools let you see the breakdown between memory usage by the JVM (heap and non-heap) and Python, and yet this information is crucial for stability. In this screenshot, we can see that the executor with the highest memory usage got very close to the limit. </p><p>PySpark users are often in the dark when it comes to monitoring memory usage, and we hope this new interface will be useful to them and avoid the dreaded OOM-kills.</p><h2>How does the Spark Delight work? How can I use it?</h2><p>For technical reasons, we will not implement the Spark Delight directly in Spark open source.&nbsp;But we do plan to make it work on top of any Spark platform, entirely free of charge.&nbsp;The first version (MVP) will only work for terminated apps a few minutes after they have run. <strong>So the MVP&nbsp;would be more of a Spark History Server replacement than a Spark UI replacement</strong>. We hope it will be useful to you nonetheless!</p><p>To use it, you'll need to install an agent (a single jar) to Spark -- we'll provide init scripts to do this automatically. The code for the agent will be open-sourced. The agent will send the Spark event logs to our backend. Once this is set up, no more action required from you. In the MVP the agent will probably just print a unique URL&nbsp;at the top of the driver log, and this URL&nbsp;will give you access to the Spark delight for your app.</p><blockquote>Note: Spark event logs make up the source of truth for the Spark UI — this is the information the Spark History Server reads to render the Spark UI. They're metadata logs about the tasks run by Spark (task-id #123 was run on executor #3 from timestamp t1 until timestamp t2 etc) in a structured format. They do not contain any of the actual data processed by Spark (in particular they do not contain Personally Identifiable Information). These logs will be automatically deleted by Data Mechanics after a retention period.</blockquote><h2>Conclusion: we need YOU to make this happen</h2><p>Data Mechanics is a serverless Spark platform which tunes the infrastructure parameters and Spark configurations automatically for each pipeline running on it, to optimize performance and stability.</p><p>The Spark Delight project would be a great addition to our platform, as it will give Spark developers the high-level feedback they need to develop, …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div>

What makes you check your phone 100 times per day? Why do you always use Google instead of Bing? Or why do lay awake at night, scrolling through your Instagram feed, even when you know you should be sleeping?</p>
<p>In <a href="https://amzn.to/2Bww2Ak">Hooked: How to Build Habit Building Products</a>, Nir Eyal provides the exact model that many digital products use to make us addicted. According to the author, all these apps use the Hook model — finding ways to intertwine their usage into our daily lives, routines and habits.</p>
<p>The book has been praised by many well-known entrepreneurs, such as Eric Ries (the Lean Startup), Dave McClure (500 Startups) and Boris Veldhuijzen van Zanten (The Next Web). So clearly, Hooked is a great read for company founders, particularly when you want to dive into the psychology of user interaction and making your app or product ‘stick’. So if you want a quick overview of the model without needing to read the entire book, you can find a summary and my book review of Hooked below.</p>


<h2>Highlights of Hooked: The Hook Model</h2>
<p>In summary, the book Hooked provides a model to ‘hook’ users. It’s a model to make them come again and again (I suppose ‘Addicted’ could have been an alternative title for the book but one with a bit less flair).</p>
<p>As you can see in the image below, the Hook model consists of four different steps. The Trigger, the Action, the Variable Reward, and the Investment. Specifically, users are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Triggered to open your app or product;</li>
<li>After which they perform an action within the product;</li>
<li>This results in a variable reward;</li>
<li>And finally they make an investment to improve their experience.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://cdn0.tnwcdn.com/wp-content/blogs.dir/1/files/2014/01/the_hook-520x403.png" alt="the_hook"></p>
<p>Take any social media platform as an example, such as Instagram. Suppose you’re at work, and suddenly your phone shows a notification. A friend commented on your Instagram photo! This notification serves as a trigger for you to open the Instagram app. You look at the picture, and perhaps you like your friend’s comment. This is the action you’ve just taken. Consequently, you mindlessly scroll through your feed, hoping to find interesting photos, videos or other hidden gems. Considering that you sometimes find a hidden gem, and sometimes you don’t, this is the variable reward. And finally, you leave a comment somewhere, and perhaps you take a work selfie that you upload to the app. This is the investment you make.</p>
<p>This is a simple example of the Hooked model; in the book, the author expands on each different section — which I will do here shortly too.</p>
<h3>Trigger</h3>
<p>The Hook Model starts with the trigger. In this example, the trigger was a notification on your phone. According to Eyal, the trigger can be both internal and external.</p>
<p>In this case, the Instagram notification is an external trigger. Similarly, an advertisement, email, or even word-of-mouth marketing may be the external trigger you need as a user to start engaging with a product.</p>
<p>Alternatively, a trigger can be internal. This is the case when users have already gone through the Hooked model (and the circle in the image above) once or several times. You yourself trigger a need or want to open the Instagram app, without any external interference.</p>
<h3>Action</h3>
<p>What is the action you want a user to take in/with your product? The goal of the product team is to (among many other things) make the action as easy as possible.</p>
<p>In both this model and life in general, an action consists of three aspects: motivation, ability, and trigger. This is also called the Fogg Behavioral Model, represented as B = MAT. Take a simple example: the behavior (or action) of doing groceries. If you do groceries you need to be 1) motivated to do so, 2) able to do so, and 3) you need a certain trigger. So if it’s Friday night and you don’t feel like going outside (motivation), if your car has stopped working (ability) or if you have a full fridge (trigger), you’re not very likely to go to the supermarket.</p>
<h3>Variable Reward</h3>
<p>Interestingly, a reward a user gets from a product should not be the same every time. Just like with gambling, there should be a variable reward — sometimes you get X, sometimes you get Y, or perhaps sometimes you get nothing at all.</p>
<p>Preferably, a product has so-called “infinite variability”. You can find this infinite variability in the un-ending scroll of products like Instagram, Reddit, Pinterest or even certain news sites. You never know what you can expect, making the product new and exciting, every time you open it.</p>
<h3>Investment</h3>
<p>Users making an investment into your product helps them get back to the product in several ways. First, investing in the product usually improves the product itself. For instance, LinkedIn adding more information to their profile makes the entire platform more useful for other users.</p>
<p>In addition, one bias (or fallacy) we all face is the sunk cost fallacy. I’ve mentioned <a href="https://jochemgerritsen.com/2019/11/making-unrestricted-choices/">cognitive biases</a> before, and the sunk cost fallacy is the idea that when you put more effort or energy into something, it becomes more difficult to let it go or step away. In this sense, a user’s investment in your product will make it more likely for him/her to stick with your product, even if there are better alternatives on the market.</p>

<h2>Applying the Lessons of Hooked</h2>
<p>Whenever you read a business book, it’s important to look at how to apply it to your specific case. Luckily, Nir Eyal provides several questions and small to-do’s at the end of every chapter that you can use to apply the Hooked model to your product.</p>
<p>Specifically, you could look at your product (or service) and answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which internal trigger does your user experience most frequently?</li>
<li>Which resources are limiting your users’ ability to accomplish the tasks [or actions] that will become habits?</li>
<li>What are 3 ways your product might increase users’ search for variable rewards?</li>
<li>What ‘bit of work’ [or investment] are your users doing to increase their likelihood of returning?</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just a couple of questions from the book; if you truly want to apply this model to your product, I recommend reading (and answering) all of them.</p>

<h2>Hooked Book Review by an entrepreneur</h2>
<p>In my opinion, the Hooked model and book is particularly relevant for entrepreneurs and company founders building B2C digital products. Whether you’re building a new kind of social media platform, a videogame, an app to order groceries, or something else, the Hooked model can help you to increase the chances of your users returning to your product.&nbsp;That said, the ideas in the book are useful for B2B products too, but it really depends on your product whether the model is relevant.</p>
<p>While the book’s theory isn’t entirely ground-breaking, I think it’s very useful to have a model which you can apply to the interactions of your users with your product. As founders or product managers, we often talk about a <em>customer journey</em>, which is a good way of looking at it. However, by using the Hooked model, you may find new improvements you can make to that customer journey, that you wouldn’t have found otherwise.</p>
<p>This particularly applies to the ‘variable reward’ and ‘investment’ steps of the Hooked circle. Most people designing a product know the trigger leading to a user interaction, and the action they want their users to take. However, creating a variable reward, and ensuring that a user goes beyond ‘just interacting’ to actually investing in the product, is something that often comes as an after-thought. Applying this model to your product, makes you really think about the different ways and new functionalities you could implement to enable these two steps.</p>
<p>Overall, I found the book quite enjoyable. As is usually the case with books that offer a model, it is not entirely necessary to read the whole book. By reading this article, you already have a fair understanding of the model, and otherwise you could simply read some extra material on <a href="https://www.nirandfar.com/hooked-user-behavior-resources/">the author’s blog</a>. However, reading the entire book does make everything sink in better, and if you want to apply the model directly to your product, it may be useful to <a href="https://amzn.to/2Bww2Ak">get yourself a copy</a>.</p>

<p>Specifically, at any one point in time, this site is powered by one of a bunch of different <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="ARM Cortex-A72 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_Cortex-A72" target="_blank">ARM Cortex-A72</a> processors. In other words, it runs across a bunch of Raspberry Pi 4 devices.</p>



<p>There is a long history of where this blog has been hosted. Back in 2008 it was running in a virtual machine on a Dell OptiPlex PC.</p>



<p>Since then I’ve moved it to various hosting services, cloud services and such, until recently when I spun down my <a href="https://www.shogan.co.uk/kubernetes/how-to-setup-a-basic-kubernetes-cluster-and-add-an-nginx-ingress-controller-on-digitalocean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Digital Ocean Kubernetes cluster (opens in a new tab)">Digital Ocean Kubernetes cluster</a> and migrated this site to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="my own personal Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.shogan.co.uk/kubernetes/building-a-pi-kubernetes-cluster-part-3-worker-nodes-and-metallb/" target="_blank">my own personal Raspberry Pi Kubernetes cluster</a>.</p>



<p>I don’t need anything powerful to run Shogan.tech. Most of my web traffic comes in steadily over the working week during typical working hours.</p>



<p>I have done some basic load testing though and the setup I have is capable of handling a few tens of clients per second, or as in this particular test, around 500 clients over 1 minute.</p>



<figure><a href="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/load-test-500-clients.gif" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src="https://www.shogan.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/load-test-500-clients.gif" alt="load test on this site with 500 clients over 1 minute making requests to the main page."></a></figure>



<p>The response times may not be brilliant, but they’re OK. Especially considering the route a typical request/response takes:</p>



<ul><li>A request hits my ‘outer’ router from the internet and goes through some firewall rules.</li><li>Then, the request enters my ‘inner’ network router and is routed over a WiFi link to a Raspberry Pi device running a bunch of iptables rules.</li><li>This Raspberry Pi ‘router’ directs the request through another physical network interface into my dedicated Raspberry Pi cluster.</li><li>The request hits an IP address being used as a software Load Balancer (Metal LB) where Kubernetes directs it to the backing NGINX ingress service (and hence pod).</li><li>The Ingress Controller figures out which pod to direct the request to and sends it there.</li><li>Finally the request hits the actual container running this site, and the software serves the response back to the requesting client.</li><li>Not to forget there is also a request to the database container that the web container makes too!</li></ul>



<p>ARM technology for me personally has been great. I’ve been able to play with cheap hardware and come up with interesting use cases for it.</p>



<p>I’ve enjoyed <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="hacking away on Raspberry Pi devices since 2013 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.shogan.co.uk/vmware/vm-provisioning-from-e-mail-using-python-and-the-vmware-perl-sdk/" target="_blank">hacking away on Raspberry Pi devices since 2013</a>.

<h2>The future of computing with ARM</h2>



<p>When I look back at this request/response lifecycle, I’m always impressed that a tiny Raspberry Pi board the size of a credit card is responsible for doing this.</p>



<p>To me, ARM architecture has seemingly been slowly changing the computing landscape over the last 5 years, accelerating in pace in the last year or so.</p>



<p>Let’s take a look at some notable cases of this:</p>



<h3> Fugaku (Super computer)</h3>



<p>Earlier this week’s big news in the super computing space was that <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Fugaku (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fugaku_(supercomputer)" target="_blank">Fugaku</a>, a super computer built in Japan is now online. </p>



<p>This supercomputer is built with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fujitsu_A64FX">Fujitsu A64FX</a> microprocessor (which is based on ARM architecture).</p>



<p>Even though its not yet fully online, it leads the way with a peak performance of 0.54 exaFLOPS rated in the TOP500.</p>



<h3>Microsoft Surface hardware</h3>



<p>Microsoft have been making big moves within the ARM processor space. Here are some notable points:</p>



<ul><li>Surface Hardware released over the recent year(s)</li><li><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/porting/apps-on-arm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Windows 10 on ARM (opens in a new tab)">Windows 10 on ARM</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Surface Pro X (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/surface/business/surface-pro-x/processor" target="_blank">Surface Pro X</a> and the 3GHz Microsoft SQ1 (ARM) processor</li></ul>



<h3>Amazon AWS EC2 instances powered by ARM</h3>



<p>AWS have started ramping up their own processor production with their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Graviton  (opens in a new tab)" href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/" target="_blank">Graviton</a> chips.</p>



<p>These power newer generation EC2 instances and have allowed AWS to focus down on improvements that they know their customers will benefit from.</p>



<p>In a competitive cloud space, this gives AWS an advantage where they can design their own processors to deliver faster performance in key areas like compression, video encoding, machine learning, and more.</p>



<p>Another key advantage here is if you think about the plethora of recent Intel vulnerabilities that have been patched out and resulted in slower processor performance across various providers.</p>



<p>AWS can design their new chips with multi-tenancy and security as first class considerations. (Always-on 256-bit DRAM encryption etc…)</p>



<h3>Apple macOS on ARM</h3>



<p>Of course the big news the last couple of weeks has been Apple announcing they will be moving their Mac hardware over to ARM too.</p>



<p>In addition to longer term benefits they can realize with their own chip designs, this also allows them to unify their mobile and desktop ecosystem. </p>



<p>Soon users will be able to run their iOS and macOS apps on the same hardware.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen how the transition goes, but there is no doubt they’ll be breaking out <a rel="noreferrer noopener" aria-label="Rosetta v2 (opens in a new tab)" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosetta_%28software%29" target="_blank">Rosetta v2</a> to help support existing software on the new platform and ease the move from Intel to ARM for their customers.</p>



<h2>Thoughts</h2>



<p>Considering these examples of massive investments into ARM technology, I think there is certainly a big change coming to the CPU landscape in the near future.</p>



<p>For us consumers, more competition means better prices and more options. Cloud pricing will continue to reduce. But how will the software landscape change?</p>



<p>Software houses will certainly need to be on the ball and get their existing apps ready for ARM if they’re not already on it.</p>



<p>What about the future of x86? I personally can’t see the PC gaming market changing very soon. I love my Steam library collection of games. Those won’t work on ARM any time soon. The same goes for a lot of enterprise software.</p>



<p>So with cheaper hardware, decreasing power requirements, processors that are designed for specific workloads, and more competition across the board on the horizon, I have one closing thought.</p>



<p>As long as we don’t pay the price in performance loss for power efficiency, and we don’t end up with a massive chasm for software compatibility, I’ll be happy.</p>



<p> This is post #2 in my effort towards <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/100DaysToOffload" target="_blank">100DaysToOffload</a>. </p>

Simple upgrades are an underrated aspect of reliable software.</li><li id="be44">Holistic health checking. An Ambassador container has a single set of integrated, end-to-end health checks that measure the full health of Ambassador. If the health check fails, the container is restarted by Kubernetes.</li><li id="8c59">Simple(r) troubleshooting. Data center edge architecture is complex enough, with external load balancers, Ambassador, web application firewalls, and more. A single container for managing L7 traffic gives operators fewer places to search for issues and telemetry.</li><li id="1386">Simpler versioning. We use <a href="http://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SemVer</a> and have a single version that applies to the entire container.</li></ul><p id="7a91">The importance of operational simplicity cannot be overstated. The Uptime Institute reports that <a href="https://journal.uptimeinstitute.com/how-to-avoid-outages-try-harder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">70% of outages are caused by human error</a>. Moreover, 60% of respondents believed that downtime can be prevented with better configuration or processes. Operational complexity is the enemy of uptime, so we continuously strive for simplicity.</p><h2 id="d25d">Distributed monoliths: Control Plane and Data Plane</h2><p id="5bd3">Some popular projects such as <a href="http://istio.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Istio</a> separate the control plane from the data plane. This approach enables more fine-grained deployment control at the expense of operational complexity. Separating the control plane and data plane results in a <a href="https://www.microservices.com/talks/dont-build-a-distributed-monolith/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">distributed monolith</a>.</p><p id="2a78">Upgrading a distributed monolith is a complex operation, since care must be taken to ensure that the new version of the control plane works with the old version of the data plane (or vice versa). Rollbacks, in the event of an issue, are even more difficult. Istio’s <a href="https://istio.io/latest/docs/setup/upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgrade documentation</a> recommends a canary release of the control plane and incrementally migrating the data plane to the new control plane by manually restarting all deployments. The upgrade documentation does not cover a rollback process.</p><p id="251f">With Istio, it was necessary to separate the control plane and data plane into two independent components, since deploying the control plane on every pod in the mesh is impractical. As an API Gateway managing North/South traffic, Ambassador is not deployed on every pod in a cluster. In fact, a small number of Ambassador pods is usually sufficient for most workloads. In our real-world deployments (some of which exceed 500K RPS) and performance benchmarking, we have yet to encounter a situation where separating the control plane and data plane makes sense. Given our use case, we optimized for operational simplicity.</p><p id="a5f9">Infrastructure software is only as good as its test coverage. Over the years, testing has been a significant area of investment for the Ambassador team. We started with a series of simple tests that compared configuration generated by the Ambassador control plane to a static set of “known good” configuration files. Since then, we’ve extended our test framework in many different areas:</p><ul><li id="c94e">Parallelized end-to-end tests that exercise all of Ambassador in on-demand Kubernetes clusters</li><li id="4220">Automated performance tests around multiple different scenarios run in multiple cloud Kubernetes providers and different Kubernetes versions</li><li id="a47e">Thousands of unit tests covering every component of the system</li><li id="8a30">Documented release testing, review, and checklists</li></ul><p id="8501">No matter how much design and testing that may occur, bugs inevitably happen. We’ve invested in an extensive amount of engineering in our release processes, so that we’re able to rapidly release critical updates to customers. Some examples of this include:</p><ul><li id="24ba">Redundant container registries that are hosted in both Amazon and Google data centers so that your uptime is not affected by the downtime of a single registry.</li><li id="1f6e">Use of <a href="http://semver.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Semantic Versioning</a> and detailed <a href="https://github.com/datawire/ambassador/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changelogs</a>, so our users know exactly what has changed. In addition, the Ambassador Operator uses SemVer to reduce operational overhead and let you choose how frequently to upgrade from every incremental release or only major changes or anywhere in between.</li><li id="7c51">In the classic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capability_Maturity_Model" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CMM Level 5</a> approach, we continuously improve our engineering processes alongside continuously improving the Ambassador software. This includes activities such as <a href="https://codeascraft.com/2012/05/22/blameless-postmortems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blameless postmortems</a>, metrics-driven refactoring, and hiring experienced enterprise-scale software engineers from companies such as Red Hat, Puppet, New Relic, Intel, and more.</li><li id="0606">Automated release processes, which run all of our tests, no matter how small the code change, because small changes could have large consequences.</li></ul><p id="6c99">Ambassador has only supported Kubernetes for production deployment. This enables the Ambassador architecture to delegate some of the challenges of engineering reliable software to Kubernetes. For example, Ambassador relies on Kubernetes as a single source of truth for configuration, leaving the hard parts of distributed system engineering to a proven data store. Kubernetes also has a rich set of high availability features. Ambassador is able to rely on these features for automated health checking, deployment scheduling, and more.</p><p id="1d31">In addition to simplifying the overall architecture of Ambassador, Kubernetes also enables greater operational simplicity in Ambassador itself, since Ambassador is configured like any other Kubernetes <code>deployment</code> or <code>DaemonSet</code>.</p><p id="01aa">No amount of automated testing and architectural design can substitute for real-world testing. So we’re also incredibly grateful to our extensive community (currently, 3,400+ Slack members) who frequently test and give feedback on early builds of Ambassador. We’ve also had 144 people (and counting!) directly contribute code to Ambassador that cover <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://blog.getambassador.io/the-ambassador-edge-stack-ambassador-api-gateway-1-5-now-available-436d62a35839">all areas of functionality</a>.</p><p id="90de">In designing for availability, we’ve consciously optimized for your operational simplicity. Backed by an ever-improving testing and ever-growing community, we’re continuously working to ensure that Ambassador is highly available and reliable.</p></div></div></section></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Over the past few years, <a href="https://kubernetes.io/">Kubernetes</a> has emerged as the go-to for container orchestration, and yet Kubernetes security remains a challenge. We talk to teams every day that have clusters in production with no processes or tools for Kubernetes security—and we don’t blame them.</p> <p>There are <strong>so many</strong> layers to Kubernetes security.</p> <p>You have to analyze the security of your cloud or hosting environment, your host OS instances, the container images you’re placing into your cluster, the configuration of the resources you deploy, and finally, the security of your application code. That’s no small feat for even the most seasoned DevOps teams. We’re excited to help those teams tackle this problem so they can focus on building and shipping code.</p> <p><strong><a href="https://checkov.io/">Checkov</a>, our open-source infrastructure-as-code analysis tool, now scans Kubernetes manifests and identifies security and configuration issues in Kubernetes workloads.</strong></p>  <h2>How it works</h2> <p>Checkov already covers infrastructure-as-code security scanning of <a href="https://bridgecrew.io/blog/announcing-checkov-prevent-cloud-misconfigurations-during-build-time/">Terraform</a> and <a href="https://bridgecrew.io/blog/announcing-cloudformation-support-in-checkov/">CloudFormation</a> for AWS, Azure, and GCP, enabling you to catch infrastructure misconfigurations such as publicly exposed resources as well as helping maintain cloud security best practices.</p> <p>With the addition of Kubernetes manifest scanning, you can now maintain security best practices for Kubernetes resources and catch issues such as over-privileged containers, bad image lifecycle practices, QoS and health check misconfiguration, and many more. Finding and preventing these issues as part of every build minimizes the risk of your workloads being compromised and saves time remediating issues in production.</p> <p>In this post, we’ll walk you through using Checkov to scan sample Kubernetes manifests, but you can easily get started on your own project.</p>  <h3>Installing Checkov</h3> <pre>#install via pip:
pip install checkov

#install via homebrew:
brew tap bridgecrewio/checkov https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov
brew update
brew install checkov</pre>  <h3>Scanning for Kubernetes misconfigurations</h3> <p>Once installed, you can see the checks we run with:</p> <pre>checkov -l --framework kubernetes</pre> <p>Now point Checkov at some Kubernetes manifests and scan.</p> <pre>git clone https://github.com/kubernetes/examples

checkov -d examples/</pre> <p>View the results:</p> <pre>       _               _

Alternatively, you can run Checkov with GitHub Actions or in a CI/CD pipeline to block security issues from being deployed.</p> <h3>Suppressing checks</h3> <p>If a failed check doesn’t apply to your workload, you can suppress it for future scans. For example, the memory requests check above is not applicable if you wanted to run MongoDB with a QoS class of BestEffort.</p> <p>To do that, use annotations with the check name and a suppression reason. Below is an example of using an annotation to suppress a check in <code>examples/staging/meteor/mongo-pod.json</code>:</p> <pre>{
  "kind": "Pod",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "mongo",
    "labels": {
      "name": "mongo",
      "role": "mongo"
    },
    "annotations": {
      "checkov.io/skip1": "CKV_K8S_12=QoS of BestEffort Desired"
    }
  },</pre> <p>This example is JSON, but the same approach applies to YAML.&nbsp;Retest the file using a single check to confirm it has been skipped:</p> <pre>checkov -f examples/staging/meteor/mongo-pod.json -c CKV_K8S_12</pre> <pre>       _               _

File: examples/staging/meteor/mongo-pod.json:25-39</pre> <h2>Kubernetes Cluster Resource Scanning</h2> <p>While we originally built Checkov for build-time static analysis, its application for Kubernetes is more extensive and unique. Because all Kubernetes resources deployed in a cluster can be described in code, you can also use Checkov in run-time for analyzing deployed Kubernetes resources. There are several ways to deploy Checkov in a Kubernetes environment. Here’s an example using a job:</p> <pre>kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/master/kubernetes/checkov-job.yaml</pre> <p>Depending on the size of your cluster this may take 30+ seconds to execute.&nbsp; You can check progress with the following:</p> <pre>kubectl get jobs -n checkov</pre> <p>Once completed, you can review the logs:</p> <pre>kubectl logs job/checkov -n checkov</pre> <p>And clean them up with:</p> <pre>kubectl delete -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/master/kubernetes/checkov-job.yaml</pre> <h2>Unifying Kubernetes build-time scan results with run-time scanning</h2> <p>We built and open-sourced <a href="https://checkov.io/">Checkov</a> to make infrastructure-as-code scanning straightforward and accessible to all. To take that to the next level, <a href="https://bridgecrew.io/platform">the Bridgecrew platform</a> (<strong>which is free to use up to 100 cloud resources</strong>) automates remediation in code.</p> <p>By unifying run-time and build-time scanning, Bridgecrew enables you to fix cloud misconfigurations at the source to keep them from resurfacing down the road.</p> <h2>Next Steps</h2> <p>In the coming weeks, we’ll be adding more Kubernetes checks as well as adding support for other templating tools such as Helm and Kustomize.</p> <p>Check out <a href="https://www.checkov.io/1.Introduction/Getting%20Started.html">our docs</a> for a complete guide to getting started with Checkov. We hope you give it a try and that it helps you gain visibility into the security of your Kubernetes workloads. Feel free to reach out to us on <a href="https://codified-security.herokuapp.com/">Slack</a> with any Checkov feedback—and don’t forget to <a href="https://github.com/bridgecrewio/checkov/">give it a ⭐️&nbsp; on GitHub</a>!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page">




<p>Lisp advocates are famous for having extravagant reasons for why Lisp is their favorite language.
You might have heard that its the <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/avg.html">most powerful language</a>,
due to feature like <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/onlisp.html">macros</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homoiconicity">homioconicty</a>.
Certainly, Common Lisp and Scheme have no shortage of beautiful ideas,
but due to their influence, most of their benefits have now been included
in modern languages, and as you may know fancy language abstractions <a href="https://justinmeiners.github.io/think-in-math/">don’t
appeal to me</a>.
I am now interested in it for very simple and practical reasons;</p>

<ol>
<li>Lisp is a fully standardized language. Consequently, it is well understood, cross-platform, and has multiple implementations, including several with free licenses.</li>
<li>Lisp has great documentation, books, and learning resources. SICP is “the book” for Scheme. Common Lisp has several good ones.</li>
<li>Lisp is mature and extremely stable. Code be written once, and run again years later, without modification.</li>
<li>Lisp implementations are reasonably fast. The true believers claim Common Lisp is as fast as C. In general it’s not even close, but for a high-level, dynamic, language, <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/lisp.html">it’s pretty fast</a>.</li>
<li>Lisp is well designed and follows solid computer science principles.
It has a focused selection of features and an elegant evaluation model which make it easy to
write and compose functionality.</li>
</ol>


<p>These features don’t appear too remarkable or unique to Lisp.
In fact, this pattern of requirements was actually established by ANSI C first, and later adopted by Lisp.
But, the surprising thing is how few languages since have followed the pattern.
Of course satisfaction lies on a spectrum; some languages do more than others,
but very few follow it to a degree that can be asserted with confidence.
Usually, you can say a language somewhat satisfies it, followed by a list of ugly qualifications.</p>

<p>Take Python for example. It’s well designed, has great resources, is fairly stable.
It has an <a href="https://norvig.com/python-lisp.html">elegant design</a> like Lisp.
But, is it standardized? Kind of, they have a spec, but it has one defacto implementation.
CPython does whatever they want, and others follow along.
The alternative implementations all have compatibility compromises.
Neither is it fast, unless you use a [JIT] implementation which makes it tolerable,
but that has its own quirks, and you can’t use many libraries with it.</p>

<p>So are Lisp and C the only languages that do this? No, but there aren’t as many as you think.
Lisp just happens to be one of them, and it’s a design that I enjoy using and learning about.</p>

June 24, 2020 | https://tractific.com/blog/mvp-vs-beta | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://tractific.com/blog/mvp-vs-beta">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As startups become viral, we see MVP and Beta versions everywhere. However, a lot of founders misuse these terms. Some even use them as synonyms. In this article, we will explain what MVP and Beta are and also the differences between them. Let's start with MVP:</p><h2>Minimum Viable Product</h2><p>Minimum Viable Product, (MVP) is often misused by a lot of people. To be clear,&nbsp;<strong>MVP is not a prototype, not a beta version, but rather an experiment</strong>&nbsp;designed to test your value proposition’s assumptions by measuring behavior and learning from the results. For example,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xy9nSnalvPc">this video</a>&nbsp;of Dropbox is their MVP. It is a banal video that lasts 3 minutes. But it is a video that was made for early adopters of Dropbox. It is clear what it does, its features, and its benefits for the early adopters. At the time there was no service like Dropbox so founders wanted to test if there is an audience that faces the same problem so they, hopefully, sell it to them. After this video, there was a crowd waiting for Dropbox to launch so the video worked well for founders to understand if there is a demand for their product. The experiment was successful. Another great example is&nbsp;<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/19991127151543/http://www.zappos.com/">Zappos' MVP from 1999</a>. Their MVP was a simple landing page where you can understand that Zappos is an online shoe store and their unique selling point is being the world's largest shoe store. With this landing page, they experiment to validate their idea. They posted their landing page on websites that are relevant to online shopping and bought some ads. After all, they validated the idea: There was an audience that wants to buy shoes online!</p><p><img src="https://tractific.com/res/images/5eea4454a93dd3d3b38982db_1.png" alt="MVP Presentation"><span>From Drew Houston's presentation on their MVP.</span></p><h3>Key takeaway:</h3><ul><li>MVP is an experiment designed to validate your idea.</li><li>MVP can be in a lot of forms like a landing page or a video.</li><li>MVP must explain what does the product does and who is the product for.</li></ul><h2>Beta</h2><p>On the other hand, the beta version is launched after the idea is validated and an amount of contact is collected. Beta is no longer an experiment, it is a product with fewer features. You can launch beta after collecting emails of potential customers with your MVP version. What you should focus on beta are feedbacks and feature requests you receive from beta users. To use the power of word-of-mouth, you should treat your beta users as royalty.

<h2 id="overview%3A-private-static-methods-and-accessors">Overview: private static methods and accessors&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The following kinds of private static methods and accessors exist:</p>
<pre><code>class MyClass {
  static #staticPrivateOrdinaryMethod() {}
  static * #staticPrivateGeneratorMethod() {}

  static async #staticPrivateAsyncMethod() {}
  static async * #staticPrivateAsyncGeneratorMethod() {}
  
  static get #staticPrivateGetter() {}
  static set #staticPrivateSetter(value) {}
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="an-example-with-private-static-methods">An example with private static methods&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The following class has a private static method <code>.#createInternal()</code>:</p>
<pre><code>class Point {
  static create(x, y) {
    return Point.#createInternal(x, y);
  }
  static createZero() {
    return Point.#createInternal(0, 0);
  }
  static #createInternal(x, y) {
    const p = new Point();
    p.#x = x; // (A)
    p.#y = y; // (B)
    return p;
  }
  #x;
  #y;
}
</code></pre>
<p>This code shows the key benefit of private static methods, compared to external (module-private) helper functions: They can access private instance fields (line A and line B).</p>
<h3 id="pitfall%3A-don%E2%80%99t-access-private-static-constructs-via-this">Pitfall: Don’t access private static constructs via <code>this</code>&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Accessing public static constructs via <code>this</code> lets us avoid redundant use of class names. It works because those constructs are inherited by subclasses. Alas, we can’t do the same for private static constructs:</p>
<pre><code>class SuperClass {
  static #privateData = 2;
  static getPrivateDataViaThis() {
    return this.#privateData;
  }
  static getPrivateDataViaClassName() {
    return SuperClass.#privateData;
  }
}
class SubClass extends SuperClass {
}

// Works:
assert.equal(SuperClass.getPrivateDataViaThis(), 2);

// Error:
assert.throws(
  () =&gt; SubClass.getPrivateDataViaThis(), // (A)
  {
    name: 'TypeError',
    message: 'Cannot read private member #privateData from an object whose class did not declare it',
  }
);

// Work-around for previous error:
assert.equal(SubClass.getPrivateDataViaClassName(), 2);
</code></pre>
<p>The problem in line A is that <code>this</code> points to <code>SubClass</code> which does not have the private field <code>.#privateData</code>. For more information, see <a href="https://2ality.com/2019/07/private-class-fields.html#this-and-private-static-fields">the blog post “Private class fields”</a>.</p>
<h2 id="the-specification-for-private-static-fields%2C-methods%2C-and-accessors">The specification for private static fields, methods, and accessors&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2>
<h3 id="the-foundations-laid-by-private-prototype-methods">The foundations laid by private prototype methods&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Support for static methods and accessors is based on mechanisms that were introduced for prototype methods and accessors (<a href="https://2ality.com/2019/07/private-methods-accessors-in-classes.html#how-are-private-methods-handled-in-the-ecmascript-specification%3F-(advanced)">more information</a>).</p>
<p>We will only examine private methods, but everything we discover also applies to private getters and setters.</p>
<h4 id="storing-private-methods">Storing private methods&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Consider a method <code>.#privateMethod()</code> that is created “inside” an object <code>HomeObj</code>. This method is stored externally, in a specification data structure called <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-private-methods/#sec-private-names"><em>private name</em></a>. Private names are also used to represent other private class elements. They are looked up via <em>private environments</em>, which map identifiers to private names and exist next to environments for variables. Private environments are explained later.</p>
<p>In this case, the private name has the following slots:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>.[[Description]] = "#privateMethod"</code></li>
<li><code>.[[Kind]] = "method"</code></li>
<li><code>.[[Brand]] = HomeObj</code></li>
<li><code>.[[Value]]</code> points to the method object (a function)</li>
</ul>
<p>The <em>brand</em> of a private method is the object it was created in.</p>
<h4 id="the-private-brands-of-objects">The private brands of objects&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Each object <code>Obj</code> has an internal slot <code>Obj.[[PrivateBrands]]</code> which contains the brands of all methods that can be invoked on <code>Obj</code>. There are two ways in which elements are added to the private brands of an object:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a class <code>C</code> is <code>new</code>-invoked, it adds <code>C.prototype</code> to the private brands of <code>this</code>. That means that <code>C</code>’s private prototype methods (whose brand is <code>C.prototype</code>) can be invoked on <code>this</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a class <code>C</code> has private static methods, <code>C</code> is added to the private brands of <code>C</code>. That means that <code>C</code>’s private static methods (whose brand is <code>C</code>) can be invoked on <code>C</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="private-brands-vs.-prototype-chains">Private brands vs. prototype chains&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Therefore, the private brands of an object are related to the prototype chain of an object. Why has this mechanism been introduced if it is so similar?</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Private methods are designed to be actually private and to have integrity. That means that they shouldn’t be affected by outside changes. If the private brands of an object were determined by its prototype chain, we could enable or disable private methods by changing the chain. We could also observe part of the executions of private methods by observing the traversal of the prototype chain via a Proxy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>This approach guarantees that, when we invoke a private method on an object, its private fields also exist (as created by constructors and evaluations of class definitions). Otherwise, we could use <code>Object.create()</code> to create an instance without private instance fields to which we could apply private methods.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="lexical-scoping-of-private-identifiers">Lexical scoping of private identifiers&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Execution contexts now have three environments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>LexicalEnvironment</code> points to the environment for <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> (block scoping).</li>
<li><code>VariableEnvironment</code> points to the environment for <code>var</code> (function scoping).</li>
<li><code>PrivateEnvironment</code> points to an environment that maps identifiers prefixed with <code>#</code> to <em>private name</em> records.</li>
</ul>
<p>Functions now have two lexical environments:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>[[Environment]]</code> refers to the environment of the scope in which the function was created.</li>
<li><code>[[PrivateEnvironment]]</code> refers to the environment with the private names that was active when the function was created.</li>
</ul>
<p>The operation <code>ClassDefinitionEvaluation</code> temporarily changes the current execution context for the body of a class:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>LexicalEnvironment</code> is set to <code>classScope</code>, a new declarative environment.</li>
<li>The <code>PrivateEnvironment</code> is set to <code>classPrivateEnvironment</code>, a new declarative environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>For each identifier <code>dn</code> of the <code>PrivateBoundIdentifiers</code> of the class body, one entry is added to the <code>EnvironmentRecord</code> of <code>classPrivateEnvironment</code>. The key of that entry is <code>dn</code>, the value is a new private name.</p>
<h3 id="the-specification-for-private-static-constructs">The specification for private static constructs&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>The following parts of the runtime semantics rule <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-static-class-features/#runtime-semantics-class-definition-evaluation"><code>ClassDefinitionEvaluation</code></a> are relevant for static private constructs (<code>F</code> refers to the constructor):</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Step 28.b.i: Perform <a href="https://tc39.es/proposal-class-fields/#sec-method-definitions-runtime-semantics-propertydefinitionevaluation"><code>PropertyDefinitionEvaluation(F, false)</code></a> for each static <code>ClassElement</code></p>
<ul>
<li>Step 28.d.ii: If the result is not empty, it is added to a list <code>staticFields</code> (so that it can be attached to <code>F</code> later).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 33.a: If there is a static method or accessor <code>P</code> in <code>PrivateBoundIdentifiers</code> of <code>ClassBody</code> and <code>P</code>’s <code>.[[Brand]]</code> is <code>F</code>: Execute <code>PrivateBrandAdd(F, F)</code>. Intuitively, that means: object <code>F</code> can be receiver of methods stored in object <code>F</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 34.a: For each <code>fieldRecord</code> in <code>staticFields</code>: <code>DefineField(F, fieldRecord)</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-internal-representation-of-private-static-methods-and-private-instance-fields-illustrated-in-javascript">The internal representation of private static methods and private instance fields illustrated in JavaScript&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Let’s look at an example. Consider the following code from earlier in this post:</p>
<pre><code>class Point {
  static create(x, y) {
    return Point.#createInternal(x, y);
  }
  static createZero() {
    return Point.#createInternal(0, 0);
  }
  static #createInternal(x, y) {
    const p = new Point();
    p.#x = x;
    p.#y = y;
    return p;
  }
  
  #x;
  #y;

  toArray() {
    return [this.#x, this.#y];
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Internally, it is roughly represented as follows:</p>
<pre><code>{ 

  <span><span>class</span> <span>Object</span> </span>{
    
    __PrivateFieldValues__ = <span>new</span> <span>Map</span>();

    dist() {

      __computeDist.__Value__.call(<span>this</span>);

Javascript has a native way to achieve this. <code>console.time</code> marks the start of time, <code>console.timeEnd</code> stops the timer and gives the total time taken. <code>console.time</code> takes label as a parameter in case you want to use multiple timers. <code>console.timeLog</code> can be used anywhere in between to check time elapsed till then.</p>

<h3><center> console.(count/countReset) </center></h3>
<p>There are times where we want to count how many times a function is called, we need to create a dummy counter just for logging, <code>console.count</code> handles this, every time it is called it increments by 1 and consoles the value against the passed <code>label</code> or <code>default</code>. We can use multiple counters in the same code with different labels. Any counter can be reset with <code>console.countRest</code> passing respective label or nothing in case of <code>default</code>.</p>

From a simple, finicky API a few years ago, ARKit has grown into a seamless integration between cutting edge hardware and advanced software. With the introduction of ARKit 4 during WWDC20, augmented reality connects virtual objects to the real world better than ever. In this article, you’ll learn about the latest from Apple in augmented reality.</p></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="6f0c">Last year, Apple announced the ability to share augmented reality experiences across devices — so two users could simultaneously interact with the same experience. This year, ARKit will allow augmented reality scenes to be linked to physical locations.</p><p id="83e3">Using a technique that Apple calls “visual localization,” ARKit will use machine learning techniques to map a physical scene to 3D data from Apple Maps. This way, a virtual object can remain anchored to the physical map and appear in the exact same position every time. Apple’s map data already contains feature points, which means that that you don’t need to handle any of the location matching — it’s all handled by the API!</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*NZSvCTpMKy4gnsF5JGpMDQ.png?q=20" width="1816" height="1082" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3632/1*NZSvCTpMKy4gnsF5JGpMDQ.png" width="1816" height="1082" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*NZSvCTpMKy4gnsF5JGpMDQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*NZSvCTpMKy4gnsF5JGpMDQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*NZSvCTpMKy4gnsF5JGpMDQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*NZSvCTpMKy4gnsF5JGpMDQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Using map-based virtual localization to determine a user’s exact location.</figcaption></figure><p id="7aa6">Location anchors are available for development in most major US cities and are compatible with iOS devices that have a GPS chip and an A12 Bionic chip or newer. The API requires you to check for these capabilities before starting the augmented reality experience. By far, location anchoring is one of the biggest updates to ARKit 4 this year.</p><p id="93bc">Using <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/the-new-ipad-pros-lidar-sensor-changes-the-augmented-reality-game-5ee067058a7a">the new iPad’s LiDAR scanner</a>, ARKit 3.5 could create an accurate topological map of the surroundings. The iPad Pro’s LiDAR sensor, in short, shoots laser beams at the environment and then uses a scanner to check how fast the light gets reflected back to the sensor.</p><p id="e4a3">The idea is that the longer the light takes to come back, the farther the object is. If you want, you can learn more about this in <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://heartbeat.fritz.ai/the-new-ipad-pros-lidar-sensor-changes-the-augmented-reality-game-5ee067058a7a">one of my previous articles</a>:</p><p id="1f5b">With the release of ARKit 4, semantic segmentation of scenes is now possible, which allows us to recognize objects in a given scene for more dynamic augmented reality experiences. So — instead of only creating a map, ARKit can detect what types of objects are present in the map.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*hUwQVvKUUgTK3mviUdPWcA.png?q=20" width="1816" height="1082" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3632/1*hUwQVvKUUgTK3mviUdPWcA.png" width="1816" height="1082" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*hUwQVvKUUgTK3mviUdPWcA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*hUwQVvKUUgTK3mviUdPWcA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*hUwQVvKUUgTK3mviUdPWcA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*hUwQVvKUUgTK3mviUdPWcA.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Semantic segmentation with ARKit.</figcaption></figure><p id="708b">Live object recognition can allow augmented reality experiences to occlude — or cover — virtual objects with physical objects and differentiate between different objects. For example, you could have a virtual pet be occluded by living room couches but not by the table. This fine-tuned control over the experience has tremendous potential for developers.</p></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="d4f1">The new Depth API provides detailed information about the topography of the environment. A depth map is available for each frame of a live video feed at up to 60 frames per second — that’s a lot of frames to do depth analysis on! This API combines data from the LiDAR sensor and maps it onto images to generate a dense depth map.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*1suVlGPLsrngHcsIUg1ZxQ.png?q=20" width="1600" height="953" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/1*1suVlGPLsrngHcsIUg1ZxQ.png" width="1600" height="953" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*1suVlGPLsrngHcsIUg1ZxQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*1suVlGPLsrngHcsIUg1ZxQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*1suVlGPLsrngHcsIUg1ZxQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*1suVlGPLsrngHcsIUg1ZxQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>A dense depth map generated from image and LiDAR data.</figcaption></figure><p id="6281">In addition to a depth map, the Depth API also provides a confidence map, which indicates how accurate the depth reading is. This can help developers evaluate when to rely on the depth map reading or to use an alternate method for determining depth. The depth and confidence maps are lower in resolution than the actual image because they use individual pixel values to convey the depth information.</p><p id="397f"><em>Ray casting</em> is a technique used to place virtual objects in augmented reality environments and has been optimized for precision in ARKit 4 — especially on devices with LiDAR sensors. In the past, hit testing was the recommended technique for ARKit experiences, and Apple now recommends ray casting.</p><blockquote><p id="210d">Ray casting provides a 3D location in physical space that corresponds to a given 2D location on the screen. When you call this function, it succeeds in returning a result when a mathematical ray that ARKit casts outward from the user intersects with any real-world surfaces that ARKit detects in the physical environment.</p><p id="6aa2">— Apple Documentation</p></blockquote><p id="8367">If you aren’t familiar with ray casting, it’s a technique that uses a mathematical ray to determine the position of a point on a 3D plane. In essence, ray casting is a better method than hit-testing and allows for faster and more precise object placement.</p><p id="3168">Face Tracking was previously only available on devices with a TrueDepth camera — in other words, Face ID-supported devices. With ARKit 4 comes support across all devices with the A12 processor or newer. The API no longer requires TrueDepth cameras to operate, making face tracking capabilities more widely accessible.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*tm5vrdVDr2DAulgPvDMRow.png?q=20" width="1816" height="1082" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3632/1*tm5vrdVDr2DAulgPvDMRow.png" width="1816" height="1082" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*tm5vrdVDr2DAulgPvDMRow.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*tm5vrdVDr2DAulgPvDMRow.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*tm5vrdVDr2DAulgPvDMRow.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*tm5vrdVDr2DAulgPvDMRow.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Face tracking is now supported on more devices.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="7d44">Now, augmented reality is more connected to the actual environment than ever before with the release of ARKit 4.

<article>
  <p>There has been a sudden resurgence of interest in my <a href="https://www.a1k0n.net/2006/09/15/obfuscated-c-donut.html">“donut” code from 2006</a>, and I’ve
had a couple requests to explain this one.  It’s been five years now, so it’s
not exactly fresh in my memory, so I will reconstruct it from scratch, in great
detail, and hopefully get approximately the same result.</p>

<p>This is the code:</p>
<pre>             k;double sin()
         ,cos();main(){float A=
       0,B=0,i,j,z[1760];char b[
     1760];printf("\x1b[2J");for(;;
  ){memset(b,32,1760);memset(z,0,7040)
  ;for(j=0;6.28&gt;j;j+=0.07)for(i=0;6.28
 &gt;i;i+=0.02){float c=sin(i),d=cos(j),e=
 sin(A),f=sin(j),g=cos(A),h=d+2,D=1/(c*
 h*e+f*g+5),l=cos      (i),m=cos(B),n=s\
in(B),t=c*h*g-f*        e;int x=40+30*D*
(l*h*m-t*n),y=            12+15*D*(l*h*n
+t*m),o=x+80*y,          N=8*((f*e-c*d*g
 )*m-c*d*e-f*g-l        *d*n);if(22&gt;y&amp;&amp;
 y&gt;0&amp;&amp;x&gt;0&amp;&amp;80&gt;x&amp;&amp;D&gt;z[o]){z[o]=D;;;b[o]=
 ".,-~:;=!*#$@"[N&gt;0?N:0];}}/*#****!!-*/
  printf("\x1b[H");for(k=0;1761&gt;k;k++)
   putchar(k%80?b[k]:10);A+=0.04;B+=
     0.02;}}/*****####*******!!=;:~
       ~::==!!!**********!!!==::-
         .,~~;;;========;;;:~-.
             ..,--------,*/
</pre>
<p>…and the output, animated in Javascript:
</p>
<pre id="d"></pre>

<p>At its core, it’s a framebuffer and a Z-buffer into which I render pixels.
Since it’s just rendering relatively low-resolution ASCII art, I massively
cheat.  All it does is plot pixels along the surface of the torus at
fixed-angle increments, and does it densely enough that the final result looks
solid.  The “pixels” it plots are ASCII characters corresponding to the
illumination value of the surface at each point: <code>.,-~:;=!*#$@</code> from dimmest to
brightest.  No raytracing required.</p>

<p>So how do we do that?  Well, let’s start with the basic math behind 3D
perspective rendering.  The following diagram is a side view of a person
sitting in front of a screen, viewing a 3D object behind it.</p>

<center><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/perspective.png"></center>

<p>To render a 3D object onto a 2D screen, we project each point (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) in
3D-space onto a plane located <em>z’</em> units away from the viewer, so that the
corresponding 2D position is (<em>x’</em>,<em>y’</em>).  Since we’re looking from the side,
we can only see the <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> axes, but the math works the same for the <em>x</em>
axis (just pretend this is a top view instead).  This projection is really easy
to obtain: notice that the origin, the <em>y</em>-axis, and point (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) form a
right triangle, and a similar right triangle is formed with (<em>x’</em>,<em>y’</em>,<em>z’</em>).
Thus the relative proportions are maintained:</p>



<p>So to project a 3D coordinate to 2D, we scale a coordinate by the screen
distance <em>z’</em>.  Since <em>z’</em> is a fixed constant, and not functionally a
coordinate, let’s rename it to <em>K<sub>1</sub></em>, so our projection equation
becomes .  We can choose
<em>K<sub>1</sub></em> arbitrarily based on the field of view we want to show in our
2D window.  For example, if we have a 100x100 window of pixels, then the view
is centered at (50,50); and if we want to see an object which is 10 units wide
in our 3D space, set back 5 units from the viewer, then <em>K<sub>1</sub></em> should
be chosen so that the projection of the point <em>x</em>=10, <em>z</em>=5 is still on the
screen with <em>x’</em> &lt; 50: 10<em>K<sub>1</sub></em>/5 &lt; 50, or <em>K<sub>1</sub></em> &lt; 25.</p>

<p>When we’re plotting a bunch of points, we might end up plotting different
points at the same (<em>x’</em>,<em>y’</em>) location but at different depths, so we maintain
a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-buffering">z-buffer</a> which stores
the <em>z</em> coordinate of everything we draw.  If we need to plot a location, we
first check to see whether we’re plotting in front of what’s there already.  It
also helps to compute <em>z</em><sup>-1</sup>  and use that when depth
buffering because:</p>

<ul>
  <li><em>z</em><sup>-1</sup> = 0 corresponds to infinite depth, so we can pre-initialize
our z-buffer to 0 and have the background be infinitely far away</li>
  <li>we can re-use <em>z</em><sup>-1</sup> when computing <em>x’</em> and <em>y’</em>:
Dividing once and multiplying by <em>z</em><sup>-1</sup> twice is cheaper than
dividing by <em>z</em> twice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, how do we draw a donut, AKA <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torus">torus</a>?  Well, a torus is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solid_of_revolution">solid of
revolution</a>, so one way to do it is to draw a 2D circle around some point in
3D space, and then rotate it around the central axis of the torus.  Here is a
cross-section through the center of a torus:</p>

<center><img src="https://www.a1k0n.net/img/torusxsec.png"></center>

<p>So we have a circle of radius <em>R</em><sub>1</sub> centered at point
(<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>,0,0), drawn on the <em>xy</em>-plane.  We can draw this by sweeping
an angle — let’s call it <em>θ</em> — from 0 to 2π:</p>

<p>\[
(x,y,z) = (R_2,0,0) + (R_1 \cos \theta, R_1 \sin \theta, 0)
\]</p>

<p>Now we take that circle and rotate it around the <em>y</em>-axis by another angle
— let’s call it φ.  To rotate an arbitrary 3D point around one of the
cardinal axes, the standard technique is to multiply by a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix">rotation matrix</a>.  So if
we take the previous points and rotate about the <em>y</em>-axis we get:</p>





<p>But wait: we also want the whole donut to spin around on at least two more axes
for the animation.  They were called <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> in the original code: it was a
rotation about the <em>x</em>-axis by <em>A</em> and a rotation about the <em>z</em>-axis by <em>B</em>.
This is a bit hairier, so I’m not even going write the result yet, but it’s a
bunch of matrix multiplies.</p>



<p>Churning through the above gets us an (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>) point on the surface of our
torus, rotated around two axes, centered at the origin.  To actually get screen
coordinates, we need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Move the torus somewhere in front of the viewer (the viewer is at the
origin) — so we just add some constant to <em>z</em> to move it backward.</li>
  <li>Project from 3D onto our 2D screen.</li>
</ul>

<p>So we have another constant to pick, call it <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>, for the distance
of the donut from the viewer, and our projection now looks like:</p>

<p>\[
\left( x’, y’ \right)
=
\left( \frac{K_1 x}{K_2 + z} , \frac{K_1 y}{K_2 + z} \right)
\]</p>

<p><em>K</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>K</em><sub>2</sub> can be tweaked together to change the field
of view and flatten or exaggerate the depth of the object.</p>

<p>Now, we could implement a 3x3 matrix multiplication routine in our code and
implement the above in a straightforward way.  But if our goal is to shrink the
code as much as possible, then every 0 in the matrices above is an opportunity
for simplification.  So let’s multiply it out.  Churning through a bunch of
algebra (thanks Mathematica!), the full result is:</p>



<p>Well, that looks pretty hideous, but we we can precompute some common
subexpressions (e.g. all the sines and cosines, and )
and reuse them in the code.  In fact I came up with a completely different
factoring in the original code but that’s left as an exercise for the reader.
(The original code also swaps the sines and cosines of A, effectively rotating
by 90 degrees, so I guess my initial derivation was a bit different but that’s
OK.)</p>

<p>Now we know where to put the pixel, but we still haven’t even considered which
shade to plot.  To calculate illumination, we need to know the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_normal">surface normal</a> —
the direction perpendicular to the surface at each point.  If we have that,
then we can take the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot
product</a> of the surface normal with the light direction, which we can choose
arbitrarily.  That gives us the cosine of the angle between the light direction
and the surface direction: If the dot product is &gt;0, the surface is facing
the light and if it’s &lt;0, it faces away from the light.  The higher the
value, the more light falls on the surface.</p>

<p>The derivation of the surface normal direction turns out to be pretty much the
same as our derivation of the point in space.  We start with a point on a
circle, rotate it around the torus’s central axis, and then make two more
rotations.  The surface normal of the point on the circle is fairly obvious:
it’s the same as the point on a unit (radius=1) circle centered at the origin.</p>

<p>So our surface normal (<em>N<sub>x</sub></em>, <em>N<sub>y</sub></em>, <em>N<sub>z</sub></em>) is
derived the same as above, except the point we start with is just (cos
<em>θ</em>, sin <em>θ</em>, 0).  Then we apply the same rotations:</p>



<p>So which lighting direction should we choose?  How about we light up surfaces
facing behind and above the viewer: .  Technically
this should be a normalized unit vector, and this vector has a magnitude of
√2.  That’s okay – we will compensate later.  Therefore we compute the
above (<em>x</em>,<em>y</em>,<em>z</em>), throw away the <em>x</em> and get our luminance <em>L</em> = <em>y</em>-<em>z</em>.</p>



<p>Again, not too pretty, but not terrible once we’ve precomputed all the sines
and cosines.</p>

<p>So now all that’s left to do is to pick some values for <em>R</em><sub>1</sub>,
<em>R</em><sub>2</sub>, <em>K</em><sub>1</sub>, and <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>.  In the original donut
code I chose <em>R</em><sub>1</sub>=1 and <em>R</em><sub>2</sub>=2, so it has the same
geometry as my cross-section diagram above.  <em>K<sub>1</sub></em> controls the
scale, which depends on our pixel resolution and is in fact different for <em>x</em>
and <em>y</em> in the ASCII animation.  <em>K</em><sub>2</sub>, the distance from the viewer
to the donut, was chosen to be 5.</p>

<p>I’ve taken the above equations and written a quick and dirty canvas
implementation here, just plotting the pixels and the lighting values from the
equations above.  The result is not exactly the same as the original as some of
my rotations are in opposite directions or off by 90 degrees, but it is
qualitatively doing the same thing.</p>

<p>Here it is: </p>

<canvas id="canvasdonut" width="300" height="240">
</canvas>

<p>It’s slightly mind-bending because you can see right through the torus, but the
math does work!  Convert that to an ASCII rendering with <em>z</em>-buffering, and
you’ve got yourself a clever little program.</p>

<p>Now, we have all the pieces, but how do we write the code?  Roughly like this
(some pseudocode liberties have been taken with 2D arrays):</p>

Get it? Because he says they're "doxxing" him.</p><p>

"Doxxing" is a type of cyber-bullying in which the bully publicly reveals private information about the target, such as their home phone number or address, their employer's information, photos of the target's children, and so on. This is considered to be extremely threatening. Imagine that someone publicly posts a photo of your small child playing at the park, along with the Google Maps link to the park and a comment to the effect of, "This is where that racist Joe plays with his kids." That's doxxing. Yes, it's bad.</p><p>

But that's not what's happening to Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So. Let's dive in.</p><h3>
First, The Back-Story</h3>
<p>
Go ahead and cruise on over to slatestarcodex.com to get Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So's version of the story. It goes something like this: A writer from <i>The New York Times</i> wanted to write a story about a popular blog that generates a lot of interest and that maybe got some things right about COVID-19 early on. That was fine with Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So until the journalist said, "By the way, I've been able to figure out what the So-and-So stands for, and I'm going to put that into my story." Dr. Scott freaks out a little and says no, don't do that. The journalist says it's company policy.</p>

<p>
So, Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So deleted his whole blog, saying that <i>The New York Times</i> was trying to endanger him by doxxing him "for clicks."</p>

<p>
Before I go on, I would like to remind my readers of my previous posts about Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So. <a href="https://www.stationarywaves.com/search?q=slate+star+codex" target="_blank">Here's a link</a>. You will see from what I've written before that I consider the guy to be really weird. It's not just that I dislike his blog - and I do - it's that he seems emblematic of a very bizarre strain of Silicon Valley culture, and the deeper you get into this crowd, the heebier the jeebies, if you catch my drift.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
His blog rose to prominance when some well-regarded bloggers started linking to his posts. They all seemed to consider him very smart and thoughtful. Soon enough, "everyone" was reading him. Over time, his posts have become more performative. He started out writing like a self-conscious nerd, and now he writes as though he is playing the part of a self-conscious nerd who thinks he is a really smart and funny guy. That's fine. Fame changes you. I don't care.</p>

<p>
What I do care about is the content of his blog. Each post tackles any number of topics. He's written on climate science and economics and technology and artificial intelligence and psychiatry and biology and sociology and anything else. He always presents his views as though he is an expert, but quite often it's painfully obvious that he's just done a couple of hours of internet research. There's no shame in doing some casual research and blogging about it, but when everyone starts calling you an expert, and you keep doing light research and presenting it as Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So Presents The Answer To A Problem That People Have Been Trying To Solve For Decades, then it starts to get on my nerves.</p>

<p>
I mean, it's <i>dorky</i> to do what effectively amounts to college homework assignments as an adult passing the time. But it's problematic to be taken seriously for it. </p>
<br>
<h3>
An "Anonymous" Blogger</h3>
<p>
Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So openly admits that his name is a pseudonym. First question: Why is he using a pseudonym? Maybe it's like a stage name. Lots of people have stage names. Stage names can be a lot of fun. But that's not why Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So says he uses a pseudonym. Instead, he says it's because he wants to remain anonymous.</p>

<p>
But Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So <i>also</i> says that Scott Alexander is his real-life first and last name. That sure is an odd choice of pseudonyms for someone who wishes to remain anonymous. The legendary whistleblower "Deep Throat" wasn't a guy named Deep Throat McInnis, and if he was, going by "Deep Throat" wouldn't exactly be a cloak of anonymity. "Deep Throat" was not a pseudonym that resembled his or her real name at all. It was an obviously made-up moniker; it was intended to be <i>obviously</i> made up, because if everyone knows that Deep Throat's real name is nothing whatsoever resembling Deep Throat, then no one has any idea what Deep Throat's real name is. That's true anonymity. That's not what Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So wanted, obviously. If he wanted <i>that kind</i> of anonymity, then he would have chosen a pseudonym more like "Deep Throat," or "Alone" (the pseudonym of the writer of <i>The Last Psychiatrist</i> blog), or "Slate Star Codex Guy" or something.</p>

<p>
Pretty much everyone knows that Mark Twain is Samuel Clemens. Samuel Clemens didn't choose "Mark Twain" as a pen name because he wanted to be anonymous. He chose it because he thought he could sell more books under the name "Mark Twain" than under the name "Samuel Clemens," and he was probably right. Mark Twain sounds way better. But when the press discovered his real name, Samuel Clemens didn't delete all his books and complain about being doxxed. He just did what any normal person using a pen name would do: He said, yep, but I write books under the name Mark Twain. And there was no issue.</p>

<p>
The matter was slightly different with "Publius," or "Publicus," or whatever name they were using to write <i>The Federalist Papers</i>. In that case, they had to be anonymous because they could have been killed for treason. Notice again how "Publius" bears scant resemblance to "John Jay" or "John Adams."</p>

<p>
It gets worse, of course. Not only did Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So choose a "pseudonym" that was actually just his real name, he published many old links to all his old blog posts, in which he discussed personal details of his life. He discussed the experiences of the patients he saw in his clinical psychiatric practice. He held public meet-ups, advertised on his blog and on his social media accounts, where he agreed to meet with pretty much any old person who happened to read his blog or follow him on Twitter. He didn't meet strangers with a cloak and a mask, either. He met them using his real face and his real name and as his own, real, self. In short, he presented himself publicly as Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So, Please Don't Use My Last Name Because I Want To Be Anonymous, Honest.</p>

<p>
Not exactly the behavior of a man who seeks anonymity, is it?</p>

<h3>
Playing At Being Famous</h3>
<p>
But okay, maybe he was just naive about the matter. That could be the explanation, right?</p>

<p>
Still, <i>fifteen years</i> of naivete over the course of progressively building internet fame seems to strain credulity. Once you start getting calls from <i>The Times</i>, wouldn't you reconsider your willy-nilly attitude toward divulging personal details? I mean, if it mattered to you that you remain anonymous, and you started to become famous, wouldn't you then quietly cull your blog of all references to your real life and real identity, and then just stick to publishing bi-weekly homework essays? Wouldn't you cool it with the public meet-ups and stuff?</p>

<p>
You would indeed, <i>if you cared about anonymity</i>.</p>

<p>
So, another possible explanation here is that Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So liked being famous and well-regarded for publishing homework essays on the internet. He liked being able to organize meet-ups and watch strangers show up, wanting to meet him. He got a taste for fame, and decided he wanted to keep up with it. That's find and dandy, too. I don't fault a man for wanting to be famous. Lots of people want that.&nbsp;</p>

<p>
Then, this feature in the <i>New York Times</i> should be his big break, right? Finally he gets his big spotlight in the press. Finally he can divulge his true identity, set up a Patreon account, publish a book, and maybe secure a regular writing spot at <i>Slate Magazine</i>, or Vox, or The Atlantic or something. If you wanted to be a famous public intellectual, isn't that what you'd do? That's what I would do. I would work hard for my big break, and when it finally came, I would try to make the most of it. I'd try to capitalize.</p>

<p>
But that's not what Dr. Scott Alexander So-and-So would do. What would he do? <i>Delete his whole blog and complain that he's being persecuted.</i> Weird, right?</p>

<h3>
Another Possibility</h3>
<p>
I'm just going to float this theory. I have no idea if it's true, and no skin in the game one way or the other. But it's a theory that makes sense to me.</p>

<p>
Imagine you did homework essays for fun. Imagine you were kind of a nerd who lived with ten other people in the same house, you've gone on record saying that you don't have much luck with women, and you're basically just a clinical psychiatrist somewhere. Then imagine one day a lot of genuinely smart public intellectuals start reading your homework and say, "Hey, look at this guy. He seems smart."</p>

<p>
So then imagine that you decide to keep up with the homework. People are reading your posts. You feel well-regarded. Heck, you <i>are</i> well-regarded. You get a taste of fame, and you decide you enjoy it and you want more of it. So you keep at your homework, and people keep reading you and linking to you.</p>

<p>
And it's all pretty nice because it comes easy to you. You can do a couple of hours of internet research and write about it, no problem. So that's what you do. But at the bottom of it all, you know you're not really solving any problems. You know that your lengthy essays aren't really all that meritorious. You don't think you're all that smart, but everyone keeps saying that you are anyway. Thus, you enjoy the position you're in, you love the fame and the accolades, you like the meet-ups, maybe you even get more romantic attention than you did before.</p>

<p>
But you don't have what it takes to capitalize on your fame because, at the bottom of it, you only have the willingness to do a couple hours' internet research per week. You know that people who write books - people like Malcolm Gladwell and James Altucher - actually spend a lot of time and money on research and interviews and collecting information. You know that it's their full-time job. And you know …</p></div></div></div>

		<p>Or… how insecure is the two wire video doorbell implementation from Avidsen.</p>

<p>About a month ago I bought the <a href="https://www.avidsenstore.com/visiophone-ylva-2-lecteur-rfid-p.html">Avidsen Visiophone YLVA 2+</a> and the reason why I chose to buy a wired video doorbell over a wireless one, was due to security concerns. Lucky me… I found that with the current device it takes almost the same time for someone with a Quick Charge enabled Power Bank to enter my house as with someone with the door’s key!</p>
<p>Immediately after unboxing the doorbell and removing the single screw from the doorbell for an initial inspection I noticed that both Entry Gate’s and Door’s control electrical contacts where located at the doorbell site. Wait… it couldn’t be, I may be wrong… let’s read the <a href="https://www.avidsen.com/cache/documents/product/notice-112249-avidsen.pdf">manual</a>.</p>

<h2>How to get 12V from a QC Power Bank</h2>
<p>Power Bank’s rated as QuickCharge 3 (QC3) and later, can output 12V by using Sam Mallicoat’s <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/03/04/unlocking-12v-quick-charge-on-a-usb-power-bank/#comment-4199744">reply from hackaday</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It’s easy to set a QC3 supply to 12V with just two resistors and a toggle or push button switch. Here’s how: Take a 10K Ohm and a 2.2K Ohm and solder in series across the Vbus (red) to ground(black wire). The tap between the two resistors will measure about a Volt. Solder D+ (green to this tap. Then wire the D- (white) through a N.O. switch to the same tap.<br>
Apply adapter or power pack supply and wait 1.5 seconds to push the button. Presto, 12V @1.5! No need to hold the button, the supply stays at 12.</p>

<h2>This is a serious security issue and every owner should be aware of.</h2>

<h2>Be careful… this is not the only company with this vulnerability</h2>
<p>After my findings with the current device, I found out that there are many companies out there using two wire implementations for doorbells leaving entrance control exposed. Pay special attention if you plan to buy or already using a wired doorbell for the way the entrance control works. Most of the times the manuals are online, so you can avoid situations like this one.</p>

		<p>Tuvalu, a tiny island midway between Hawaii and Australia with a population of just 9,860, receives yearly payment of almost $4 million for literally doing nothing at all. The reason? This is the money that the Tuvalu government receives from royalties from the country’s domain name, <strong>.tv</strong>!</p>
<p><img src="https://factinator.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/tv.jpg" alt="tv" width="268" height="175"></p>
<p><span id="more-14"></span>Before you all fire up your calculator, let me burst your bubble that the money comes down to just about $405 per person and also that this money goes to the Tuvalu’s government. Tuvalu commercialized its internet TLD, .tv, in 1988 and started receiving royalties which now account for almost 10% of the government’s total revenue.</p>

<p>Isn’t it amazing that a country that’s merely a speck in ocean (10 sq miles to be exact) with nothing but hundreds of miles of water around it controls something so crucial to the internet world?!

June 24, 2020 | https://imgeself.github.io/posts/2020-06-19-graphics-study-rdr2/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://imgeself.github.io/posts/2020-06-19-graphics-study-rdr2/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                

<p>One of my favorite games of all time, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption" target="_blank">Red Dead Redemption</a>
returned with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Redemption_2" target="_blank">prequel</a> for consoles in 2018. Then it came for PCs in 2019.
I finally managed to play the game and amazed by its graphics immediately.
But I got upset because I can barely play the game on medium settings at 25 FPS with a 1050Ti laptop GPU.
I know that I don't have a good rig but 25 FPS on medium settings?</p>

<p>Today, we are going to look at some frame captures from the game and try to analyze graphics techniques used in the game.</p>

<h2 id="foreword">Foreword</h2>

<p>This isn't an official breakdown of the game. It just me analyzing <a href="https://renderdoc.org/" target="_blank">RenderDoc</a> frame captures.
If you want to learn from the actual developers,
you can check the slides from a SIGGRAPH talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/globbbe" target="_blank">Fabian Bauer</a>.
<a href="https://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2019/index.htm" target="_blank">Slides</a> (At the bottom of the page), <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3305366.3335036" target="_blank">Video</a> (starts at 1:58:00)</p>

<p>You can also read a graphics analysis of GTA5 by Adrian Courrèges <a href="https://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/" target="_blank">here</a>.
Since both RDR2 and GTA5 are from the same company and uses the same engine, some of the techniques from GTA5 present here as well.</p>

<p>Another important thing is that, I am not a senior graphics programmer or anything like that.
I am still a junior in this field.
So, there will be plenty of things that I don't understand. If you find any mistakes or things that can be improved, please reach out to me. Here we go!</p>

<h2 id="dissecting-a-frame">Dissecting a frame</h2>

<p>Here is the main frame for dissecting:</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/mainframe.jpg" alt="MainFrame">
<em>Captured on PC, medium settings.</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>When it comes to a game like RDR2, it's almost impossible to see all the techniques in one frame.
It amortizes its work across multiple frames.
Because of that, I captured more than a single frame but this is the main one we are going to be focusing on.
It contains a lot of properties like; spot and point lights, directional light (it's very subtle but it's there), buildings, NPCs, a horse, trees, vegetation, clouds, etc. It should demonstrate most of the rendering techniques used in the game.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>RDR2 is an open-world game that streams data constantly. Because of that, the frame starts with a bunch of tasks like creating and deleting textures, shader resource views, unordered access views, updating descriptors, buffers, etc.</p>

<h3 id="mud-map">Mud map</h3>

<p>Mud plays a big role in the game. Beside being a game mechanic, it makes envrionments more realistic. The game renders footprint textures of humans and horses into a displacement map along with trail textures of horse wagon wheels. This accumulated texture is used for <a href="https://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2012/10/Tatarchuk-POM.pdf" target="_blank">Parallax Occlusion Mapping</a> when rendering terrain.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/mudmap.png" alt="MudMap">
<em>Mud map: 2048x2048 <code>R16_UNORM</code></em></p>

<h3 id="sky-and-clouds">Sky and clouds</h3>

<p>After the mud pass, the game does a lot of work on GPU compute. Most of them related to sky and clouds.
Clouds, fog, and volumetrics are RDR2's prominent effects.
You can find more information about this stage on Fabian's slides. He explains in far more detail than I could ever explain.</p>

<h3 id="environment-map">Environment map</h3>

<p>Environment maps are the main source of reflections in RDR2 as well as GTA5.
<a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/#environment-cubemap" target="_blank">Like the GTA5</a>, RDR2 generates an environment cubemap from the camera position.
It generates a thin GBuffer for the envrionment map, similar to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rD6KcxcCl_8" target="_blank">Far Cry 4</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/envalbedo.jpg" alt="EnvironmentMapAlbedo">
<em>Environment Cubemap Faces (Albedo): <code>RGBA8_SRGB</code></em></p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/envnormal.jpg" alt="EnvironmentMapNormal">
<em>Environment Cubemap Faces (Normal): <code>RGBA8_UNORM</code></em></p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/envdepth.jpg" alt="EnvironmentMapDepth">
<em>Environment Cubemap Faces (Depth): <code>D32S8</code></em></p>

<p>Environment cubemap generation in every frame can be a heavy task. RDR2 does some optimizations to reduce the cost.
For example, the game only draws static and opaque objects, does <a href="https://www.gamedev.net/tutorials/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/frustum-culling-r4613/" target="_blank">frustum culling</a> before rendering each face, and draws lower LOD versions of models.
Although, I've found that poly count of the terrain is still very high for environment maps.</p>

<p>After the G-Buffer pass, a sky environment cubemap is generated using a sky paraboloid map and cloud-related textures.
The next step is convolution. RDR2 uses <a href="https://blog.selfshadow.com/publications/s2013-shading-course/karis/s2013_pbs_epic_notes_v2.pdf" target="_blank">split sum approximation</a> for Image Based Lighting.
That method uses a pre-filtered environment cubemap along with an environment BRDF LUT.
For filtering, the game convolutes an environment cubemap and stores convoluted versions in the cubemap's mipmap levels.</p>

<p>Before executing a lighting pass for the environment cubemap, RDR2 renders baked large-scale ambient occlusion into another cubemap texture.
The game uses screen space ambient occlusion but SSAO can help you on a small scale.
Baked ambient occlusion helps to darken on a large scale such as darkening in patios and interiors.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/envao.jpg" alt="EnvironmentMapBakedAO">
<em>Environment Cubemap Faces (Baked AO): <code>R8_UNORM</code></em></p>

<p>The game uses <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1023510/Advanced-Graphics-Techniques-Tutorial-Day" target="_blank">tile-based deferred rendering</a> path for calculating the lighting of environment maps.
The light culling and the lighting are calculated together in one compute pass for each environment map face. (thanks <a href="https://twitter.com/benoitvimont" target="_blank">@benoitvimont</a> for pointing that out)
The game also uses the "top-down world lightmap" technique, <a href="https://www.gdcvault.com/play/1017710/Rendering-Assassin-s-Creed" target="_blank">similar to Assassin's Creed III</a>, for baked lighting.</p>

<p>For each cubemap face, RDR2 renders the final color on top of the sky environment texture.
Then it filters the environment cubemap same as the sky environment cubemap.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/envfinal.jpg" alt="EnvironmentMapFinal">
<em>Environment Cubemap Faces (Final): <code>R11G11B10_FLOAT</code></em></p>

<p>RDR2 also loads envrionment maps that located in building interiors when the player is near a building.
These are also cubemap G-Buffers streamed from the disk.</p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/bakedenvalbedo.jpg" alt="BakedEnvironmentMapAlbedo">
<em>Baked Environment Cubemap Faces (Albedo): <code>BC3_SRGB</code> (Baked AO stored in alpha channel)</em></p>

<em>Baked Environment Cubemap Faces (Normal): <code>BC3_UNORM</code></em></p>

<p><img src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/bakedenvdepth.jpg" alt="BakedEnvironmentMapDepth">
<em>Baked Environment Cubemap Faces (Depth): <code>R16_UNORM</code></em></p>

<p>The game calculates the lighting of these maps and filters them like the previous ones.
It only calculates one baked environment map at a time and only recalculates them when the time of day changes.
All of the environment maps are stored in a texture cubemap array. There isn't any <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/#cubemap-to-dual-paraboloid-map" target="_blank">cubemap to dual-paraboloid map conversion</a>.</p>

<h3 id="g-buffer-pass">G-Buffer Pass</h3>

<p>This stage starts with terrain depth prepass and then the game renders scene into G-Buffers.</p>

</tbody>
</table>

<p>This buffer contains baked ambient occlusion in the red channel, the same as in the environment map stage.
But there are other channels in this texture. The green channel contains some data that looks like the data in GBuffer 3's blue channel.
Again, I don't know what is this data used for. And I can't find any data in blue and alpha channels on my captures. I will investigate this further.</p>

<h3 id="shadow-map-generation">Shadow Map Generation</h3>

<p>After the G-Buffer stage, the game starts to render shadow maps.
It uses 2D texture arrays for point light shadow maps and texture cube arrays for point light shadow maps.</p>

<p>Some games use big shadow atlas texture for shadow maps (<a href="http://advances.realtimerendering.com/s2016/Siggraph2016_idTech6.pdf" target="_blank">e.g DOOM</a>).
One of the advantages of that method is shadow map size can vary based on distance.
When you use texture arrays, you lose that flexibility because all of the textures in texture arrays must be the same size.
RDR2 has 3 different texture arrays for different quality.
For example, spotlights have:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>512x768 D16</strong> for distant lights</li>
<li><strong>1024x1536 D16</strong> for medium distance(and closer distance on medium setting) lights</li>
<li><strong>2048x3072 D16</strong> for closer lights (on high/ultra settings)</li>
</ul>

<p>Point lights cast shadows in all directions. To deal with that problem, games use a technique called <a href="https://learnopengl.com/Advanced-Lighting/Shadows/Point-Shadows" target="_blank">Omnidirectional Shadow Mapping</a>
where you render the scene into a depth cubemap from the camera position. Campfire shadows and shadows from Arthur's lantern are rendered using this technique.
Point light shadows have 3 different arrays for different quality settings same as spotlights.</p>

<p>Most of the static point lights in the game have baked shadow cubemaps.
So, the game uses baked shadows whenever it can and only generates shadow maps when the player is near a light-volume.
But things get more interesting than that.</p>

<p>Most of the lights on walls are spotlights but the game doesn't generate an omnidirectional shadow map for them.
Instead, it generates a spotlight shadow map and copies that shadow map's memory into pointlight shadow map cube array.</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td><img width="512" height="768" src="https://imgeself.github.io/img/spotshadow.jpg"></td>

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p><em>Left image is a 1024x1536 spotlight shadow map, right image is the same image data in 512x512 texture cube format</em></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that local light shadow maps stores linear z.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That explains why they are not using a square sized shadow map for spotlights.
Pixel count for spotlight shadow and point light texture cubemap should be the same.
I am sure you noticed some slice pattern in the right image.
That happens because the width of spot and point light shadow map is different.</p>

<p>Also note that this texture doesn't cover 360 degrees.
But luckily, lights on buildings generally have a wall on their backside and baked shadow maps cover it.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing is that this process is vice-versa.
For example, in Saint Denis -one of the biggest cities in the game- the game generates omnidirectional shadow maps for spotlights
and copies that data into spotlight shadow map array.
I don't know why RDR2 doing shadow mapping like this. I couldn't find any similar technique on the internet.</p>

<p>Directional light shadow mapping in RDR2 is pretty much the <a href="http://www.adriancourreges.com/blog/2015/11/02/gta-v-graphics-study/#shadows" target="_blank">same as in GTA5</a>. <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dxtecharts/cascaded-shadow-maps" target="_blank">Cascaded Shadow Mapping</a> with 4 cascades.

<p>This is a directory of websites that <strong>primarily stick with
simple, marked up, hyperlinked text</strong>. I appreciate these sites
because they load quickly, scroll smoothly, spare my battery, are more
compact, and lack the usual nonsense that infects many websites.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When you choose a machine learning tool, you choose your future. We all know how quickly everything changes in the world of artificial intelligence, so it is important to keep the balance between “old dog, old tricks” and “just made it yesterday”.</p><p>In this post, we are going to have a look at 18 popular machine learning tools. This review will cover ML platforms, frameworks, and ML libraries.</p><h2 id="top-machine-learning-frameworks%2C-libraries-and-platforms">Top machine learning frameworks, libraries and platforms</h2><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/do/dogamq3v.1_(24).jpg" alt="top ML tools and platforms"></p><p>First, we are going to talk about platforms. They are built on a single channel architecture and designed in a way that it is convenient to program tasks. They may offer other services like work in the cloud, collaborative working options, or graphic processors for data visualization. They also use popular frameworks by Google, Microsoft, or Amazon.</p><p>Then, we will have a look at the frameworks to use when developing an ML application.</p><h3 id="machine-learning-platforms">Machine learning platforms</h3><p>If you are starting to work with ML, a platform with ready-made datasets and standard model templates will allow you to create your first solutions quicker and with fewer bugs. These platforms install all the necessary tools to let you start working in no time.</p><h4 id="1.-ai-platform-and-datasets-on-google-cloud">1. AI Platform and Datasets on Google Cloud</h4><p>The fundamental problem of any ML model is that you need a correct dataset to train it. They are expensive to make and take lots of time. <a href="https://cloud.google.com/public-datasets">Google Cloud Public Datasets</a> are datasets curated by Google that are regularly updated. The formats are very different: from images to audio, video, and texts. The data is intended for a wide range of researchers with different use cases.</p><p>In addition, Google offers other <a href="https://cloud.google.com/ai-platform">useful services</a> that you could find interesting:</p><ul>
<li>AI platform for training and managing ML models;</li>
<li>Natural language processing services;</li>
<li>Vision AI (models for computer vision);</li>
<li>Speech synthesis software in more than 30 languages etc.</li>
</ul><p>Google is known for their expertise in AI, so you can feel confident about using their solutions for your own projects.</p><h4 id="2.-amazon-web-services">2. Amazon Web Services</h4><p><img src="https://serokell.io/files/o7/o7x09kqd.2_(16).jpg" alt="Amazon Web Services"></p><p><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/machine-learning/">AWS</a> is a platform that provides artificial intelligence and machine learning services to developers. It is possible to choose one of the pre-trained AI services to work with computer vision, language recognition, speech generation, build recommender system and prediction models.</p><p>Using <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/">Amazon SageMaker</a>, you can quickly create, train, and deploy scalable machine learning models, or create custom models that support all the popular open-source ML platforms.</p><p>You can also use Amazon’s services to provide new functionality to existing business solutions.

                    <p>Let me preface by adding "to Computer Science/Engineering majors". I think Python is a fine language and that it is very useful in a lot of situations, but I also think using Python as a foundational language is setting students up for a lot of unnecessary headache later on.</p><h3 id="syntax-and-semantics">Syntax and semantics</h3><p>My main gripe with Python is the syntax and semantics. Python looks something like this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>def some_func(var_one, var_two):
	for i in range(10):
    	num = i
    	print(i)
    # we can still see num here
    print(num)
    
some_func("thing1", "thing2")</code></pre><!--kg-card-end: code--><p>Right off the bat you should notice a few things, the lack of types, functional scope, and the lack of curly braces. The typing issue I can get over, Python is meant to be dynamically typed, and it is not as weird about it as <a href="https://thedropout.dev/javascript-the-bad-parts/">JavaScript is</a> and it recently added support for defining variable types in function parameters so it's OK in my book. </p><p>However Python does suffer from the same scoping issue as JavaScript, and scoping is done on a functional, rather than block, level. This can be confusing, especially since Python takes the insanity a step further and gets rid of the <code>var</code> ,<code>let</code> ,<code>const</code> keywords entirely, meaning there is not even a concept of a constant variable in Python. </p><p>Lastly, the most obvious difference from most languages you have likely seen is that there are no curly braces. This is because Python decided it would be a fun idea to govern blocks using whitespace, instead of wrapping everything in braces. In theory this might seem OK since you should already be properly indenting blocks of code, however in practice I find that it is much less legible and more kludgy to work with.</p><h3 id="naming-quirks">Naming Quirks</h3><p>Python also decided to go above and beyond and do things differently from most other languages. Part of this is the break from C-Style syntax, and they also name things differently. For instance, what is called an "Array" in pretty much every mainstream language, is instead called a "List" in Python. Key-Value stores that are usually called a "Map" or a "HashMap" are instead referred to as a "Dictionary".</p><h3 id="strings">Strings</h3><p>Then there are Strings, Strings in Python are horribly over-complicated. In most languages you have a <code>char</code> which is a single character, you can have a <code>char[]</code> or just an array of characters, and then a <code>String</code> that is usually some fancy wrapper around a regular <code>char[]</code>. When creating a string in most mainstream languages you can usually just do something along the lines of <code>var s = "string"</code> or for a <code>char</code> you usually use single quotes <code>var c = 'c'</code>. Python decided this was too simple and not specific enough. You can create a string the "normal" way, <code>s = "string"</code> or you can use single quotes <code>s = 'string'</code> or if you want a unicode string you would do <code>uni = u'unicode'</code> or you can craft a binary string <code>bin = b'some binary'</code>. You can also tell it directly what encoding you want to use, <code>utf = "some string".encode("utf-8")</code>. And you can also cast to string using <code>string = str("something")</code> because why not add another way to do things? Now I'm not saying its bad to specify what encoding you're using, but maybe if you could make it a bit more clear or use a syntax that is more common. </p><h3 id="version-split">Version split</h3><p>Another issue with Python is that it is essentially two different languages, there's Python 2.7 and Python 3+. Code written using Python &lt;= 2.7 will <em>sometimes </em>work on Python 3+, and code written using Python 3+ will <em>sometimes</em> work with Python &lt;= 2.7. This is because there were quite a few breaking changes introduced, that make many features that worked in 2.7, no longer work, or work differently in 3+. This as simple as the <code>print</code> function now work differently, for instance:</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>print 'Hello World'</code></pre><!--kg-card-end: code--><p>will work using Python &lt;= 2.7, however with Python 3+ this will raise a SyntaxError as you have to do</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>print('Hello World')</code></pre><!--kg-card-end: code--><p>Another popular feature in Python 2 was <code>xrange</code> which basically created an iterable object that is useful, and a bit quicker than <code>range</code>, in for loops. However, it was simply removed in Python 3. So, if I wanted to write the same code as above to be compatible for python 2.7, I would do something like this:</p><!--kg-card-begin: code--><pre><code>def some_func(var_one, var_two):
	for i in xrange(10):
    	num = i
    	print i
    # we can still see num here
    print num
    
some_func("thing1", "thing2")</code></pre><!--kg-card-end: code--><p>It is very common for languages to introduce new, backwards incompatible features. Especially with major revisions. However it is fairly uncommon to break so many widely used parts of the language that most code written before 3 simply cannot be run on the newer interpreter. The fact is that so much was broken that the community essentially split, and many people are staying on Python 2.7 as their libraries wont work on 3+ or they don't want to maintain 2 version of their codebase for backwards compatibility. This means that even though you are coding in 'Python', depending on which version you pick you are isolating yourself to a subset of the possible libraries or dependencies you can use. </p><p>All of these issues, and more, contribute to some serious headaches for new programmers. If you start by learning Python as a foundational language, when you inevitably switch to another language like C++ or Java, you have to learn an entire new vocabulary and grammar on top of the more difficult concepts as well. And Python's many quirks and irregularities don't make it the simplest language to learn from the get-go either.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>WebRTC is cool, and hard. Group audio chat with WebRTC is even harder. Besides learning those  glossaries including STUN, TURN, ICE, OPUS, BUNDLE, RTP, RTCP and so on, you need to decide between mesh and SFU, or even MCU.</p>

<p>I have built a real time group video chat app a few years ago, so I was familiar with these concepts. But it still feels frustrating to pick up them again when we recently decided to add <a href="https://vec.io/posts/end-to-end-encrypted-audio-conferencing">E2EE group audio chat</a> to our Mixin Messenger app. Anyway, after we finally mastered those things, and tried to choose an open source SFU solution, we failed.</p>

<p>Because we need E2EE, so MCU is not an option as it decodes plain audio frames to merge them into one single frame, encryption will prevent audio codecs from working. And many experiment have proves that a mesh of more than four peers will make the group chat almost unusable, cause every peer needs to upload its stream to all other peers. So SFU is our only solution, which allows peer upload only one stream despite participants count.</p>

<p>We used Janus in our previous WebRTC application years ago, and it’s our first candidate when we choose SFU for our new project, because we knew its API and flow, and it has very good performance and stability. But After read through its docs and issues, we find its development is so slow, without UNIFIED-BUNDLE support yet, that’s our goal which will make service more stable and development easier. And we recalled our pain experience tuning Janus RPC calls, too complicated and some unexpected behaviors to hack around. The most important thing is that it’s written in C/C++ and difficult for us to maintain or improve its codebase.</p>

<p>Then we researched Jitsi and Mediasoup, their APIs are designed too obscure and both recommend use of their client libraries. Too much to learn about them and we suspect that they would perform better even after we mastered their usage. And again, their primary languages are difficult for us to maintain the code and do urgent fixes.</p>

<p>I have never thought about to roll out our own SFU server, because I knew the complications to do all WebRTC things correctly and combine them together, until I read ION from hacker news. I was amazed that there is such an SFU by pure Go, which is our primary language. Then I played around with it, and soon made a working audio conferencing service, Mornin. We put it in production and even on the front page of Product Hunt.</p>

<p>However, after trying to integrate ION with our existing Mixin Messenger API we still find its API too difficult to handle correctly, and its codebase is really huge. Most of its code are related to video stream and live broadcast, but we don’t need those features. So we tried to remove these features from the code to make it easier for our audio only usage. We failed on it.</p>

<p>During the process of refactoring ION, we learnt enough about Pion, the pure Go WebRTC library used by ION. Why not write an audio only SFU with Pion? And finally we made Kraken born, it works flawlessly and we are able to fix things very fast. In the creation of Kraken, we even made some contributions to the Pion code.</p>

<p>Kraken is by far the most simple and intuitive WebRTC SFU, which doesn’t bind you to any client libraries, strange protocols other than plain HTTP JSON-RPC API. Four easy steps to create or join an existing group audio chat.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Create a PeerConnection, offer SDP, then RPC <code>publish</code> the SDP to a room.</li>
  <li>In pc.onicecandidate callback, do RPC <code>trickle</code>.</li>
  <li>Do RPC <code>subscribe</code> and <code>answer</code> to get notified on your pc.ontrack callback whenever new audio stream available.</li>
  <li>In pc.ontrack, play the audio stream.</li>
</ol>

<p>Kraken utilizes all most recent WebRTC features, e.g. Unified Plan, which allows all audio streams in a single UDP port and PeerConnection. Assumes you have 100 participants in a room, only 100 UDP ports needed, instead of 100x100.</p>

<p>Another cool thing is <code>subscribe</code> will notify all available audio streams to the client, so when anyone joins a room with 100 participants, they just need to subscribe once instead of 100 times.</p>

<p>Give Kraken a try in our GitHub, and we also have Mornin open sourced there.</p>

June 24, 2020 | https://www.blog.nodrama.io/rust-opencv-eye-center-localisation/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.blog.nodrama.io/rust-opencv-eye-center-localisation/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    

<p>Ever since finding <a href="https://github.com/twistedfall/opencv-rust/">OpenCV Rust bindings</a> I’ve been looking for a good project to try it out.
Than a <a href="https://github.com/jpmonettas/">friend</a> sparked my curiosity when talking about gesture recognition project he was implementing.</p>

<p>This inspired me to create a tool which can read frames from the camera, track eye movements and translate them to mouse cursor movements.
I reckoned Rust is a good fit for writing performant, numerical code.
First step would be to implement an algorithm responsible for tracking the location of eye center in a frame (the pupil), and this blog post is dedicated to describing one possible approach.</p>

<p>I started researching the subject and quickly found that the current state-of-the art is described in <a href="https://www.inb.uni-luebeck.de/fileadmin/files/PUBPDFS/TiBa11b.pdf">Timm and Barth, 2011</a> - I highly recommend reading the paper.
A bit more searching revealed that <a href="https://github.com/trishume/eyeLike">trishume</a> did all the hard work of implementing the algorithm in C++ using OpenCV.
Armed with this reference implementation and the original paper I could easily port it to Rust.</p>



<p>The algorithm described in the paper, which I will colloquially refer to as Timm-Barth, aims at finding a centre of a circular object.
It does so by optimizing (finding a maximum) of an objective function, which is a (weighted) sum of dot products of two vectors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>the normalized gradient vector  at pixel position  such that  and</li>
  <li>the displacement vector 
where  is a possible center.</li>
</ul>

<p>Formally:</p>



<p>The weights  are a way of incorporating prior knowledge: since the pupil is darker than the sclera or facial skin, darker pixels are more likely to be the centers.
If we consider that $I^*$ is the (smoothed and in a greyscale, as per paper’s suggestion) input frame, than at pixel with coordinates  we have that: .</p>



<p>An image gradient is a directional change in the or color intensity of the image.
At each pixel point of the frame, the gradient is a vector that points in the direction of the largest intensity increase, and the length of this vector corresponds to the rate of the change.</p>

<p>More formally the gradient of a two variable function  is defined as a vector of partial derivatives of that function in each direction:</p>

<!-- $$\nabla f = {\begin{bmatrix}g_{x}\\g_{y}\end{bmatrix}}={\begin{bmatrix}{\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}}\\{\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}}\end{bmatrix}$$ -->
<p><img src="https://www.blog.nodrama.io/images/2020-07-01-rust-opencv-eye-center-localisation/CodeCogsEqn.gif" alt="_config.yml"></p>

<p>Since the intensity function of a digital image is known only at discrete points, derivatives of this function cannot be defined, unless we assume some known, differentiable function which has been sampled at these points.</p>

<p>This is why typically the derivative of an image is approximated using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite_difference">finite differences</a>
The <a href="https://github.com/trishume/eyeLike">implementation by trishume</a> implements a procedure where for inner rows of a given frame  which calculates the gradient for inner rows as a central difference.
<!-- For $$\forall (i,j), \: i\neq j$$ the gradient in direction $$x$$ is: --></p>



<p>and in direction :</p>



<p>For the edge rows the gradient value is the difference between the value and the adjacent position.</p>



<p>I decided to deviate a bit from the reference implementation.
Similar to what the paper describes I start by detecting the face region using framework descibed by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220660094_Robust_Real-Time_Face_Detection">Viola and Jones, 2004</a>:</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The article posits selecting the eye regions as fractions of the face region.
I opted for using viola-jones algorithm again, but this time with a model trained to detect eyes in the face region:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>faces</span><span>.len</span> <span>()</span> <span>&gt;</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>// region of interest (submatrix), first detected face</span>

  <span>let</span> <span>face</span> <span>=</span> <span>faces</span><span>.get</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>// calls viola-jones eyes classifier</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>eyes</span> <span>=</span> <span>detect_eyes</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>face_region</span><span>,</span>
                          <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>eyes_model</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
 <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally for each detected eye I apply the implemented Timm-Barth algorithm:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>if</span> <span>eyes</span><span>.len</span> <span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>2</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>left_eye</span> <span>=</span> <span>eyes</span><span>.get</span> <span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>left_eye_region</span> <span>=</span> <span>Mat</span><span>::</span><span>roi</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>face_region</span><span>,</span> <span>left_eye</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>left_eye_center</span> <span>=</span> <span>timm_barth</span><span>::</span><span>find_eye_center</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>left_eye_region</span><span>,</span> <span>left_eye</span><span>.width</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>

  <span>let</span> <span>right_eye</span> <span>=</span> <span>eyes</span><span>.get</span> <span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>right_eye_region</span> <span>=</span> <span>Mat</span><span>::</span><span>roi</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>face_region</span><span>,</span> <span>right_eye</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
  <span>let</span> <span>right_eye_center</span> <span>=</span> <span>timm_barth</span><span>::</span><span>find_eye_center</span> <span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>right_eye_region</span><span>,</span> <span>right_eye</span><span>.width</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The implementation itself can be found in a repository <a href="https://github.com/fbielejec/rust-opencv/blob/master/src/timm_barth.rs#L142">here</a>,
and pretty-much follows the reference implementation.
The same repository contains the working code, as well as instructions on installing the OpenCV framework (see <a href="https://github.com/fbielejec/rust-opencv#install-image-and-video-io-libraries">README</a>).</p>

<p>Here is a video of the algorithm in action:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-td-block-uid="tdi_29_ff5">

<div>
<div id="slimcalltoaction"><p>This is box title</p><p>All content, including this exclusive article, is free to access during the launch month of June. View our subscription options <a href="https://4thquadrant.io/subscribe">here.</a></p></div>



<p>HEY is the new email client pledging to make email great again, it’s landing page is an open letter detailing the failed state of current email services, naming Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook and Apple as the service providers that simply “let it happen”. Along with its ‘reinvention’ of email, HEY is also introducing a $99 annual subscription model – with 2 character emails costing up to $999 per user. Its justification for the pricing is that free email charges users in the form of data mining and advertising, acknowledging that while $99 is expensive for certain (developing) markets it is the price tag of a private, ad-free email space.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the outset it’s obvious that HEY is targeted at a niche user base, the aim here isn’t to be a ‘fresh start’ for the hundreds of millions of people using free email at the moment. In fact moving away from a ubiquitous, free model toward a premium subscription model is akin to the friction of returning to SMS texting rather than Whatsapp or Messenger. HEY’s premium user experience is a product strategy used to target niche high-frequency users. While this limited user base is willing to move away from ingrained digital habits, the true disruption of email would require a widely accessible innovation of its core utility.</p>



<h3>Returning to the ‘wonder’ of emails: necessity or marketing</h3>



<p>UI/UX differentiation is a competitive method used to service saturated markets, it is targeted at carving out segments of the existing market rather than creating new demand. HEY is addressing the ‘experience problem’ of emails, hoping to make it more effective, personable and enjoyable. The idea is that email has devolved into a heap of spam and unwanted contact, becoming a chore to wade through. HEY’s vision statement implies that it wants to get back to the days when email used to be a “wonder”, tapping into the nostalgia of what snail-mail used to represent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let’s address this first: is email supposed to be enjoyable? Maybe at the outset it was a replication of snail mail, holiday cards from family or the primary way of keeping in contact with long-distance friends. While these are still things we treasure, social media, instant messaging and niche applications have replaced the need for email to serve this function. Email has very much become a practical function of our lives, aggregating bills and newsletters – that isn’t necessarily a ‘problem’.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>Converting free users into subscription users</h3>



<p>In a saturated market like email services, capturing a niche comes at the cost of servicing the masses. Where HEY cannot preserve its private and ad-free proposition while maintaining a free or even a more affordable subscription model, it opts to provide a premium service. A profit making alternative to the currently free email model is yet to emerge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The conversion of free users into subscription users hinges on HEY’s ability to convince these users that its features are more value adding than the $99 fee. From the user’s end there is also the need to relearn email habits – even when these are seemingly more efficient habits, this is a big ask in the world of user services. This leaves HEY with access to a smaller set of users who are already looking to renovate their email habits – their marketing strategy needing to play a big role in expanding this user pool.</p>



<p>Hey is basically targeting two focus areas, improved user experience (ad-free, organisational features) and better privacy. These can act as two separate user desires, users may be drawn in on the premise of either or both. The privacy based niche is already being competed for by several contenders. HEY’s premium pricing might prompt users to opt for other privacy focused email services, free or subscription-based, like Protonmail or Fastmail. This makes HEY’s UI/UX offering all the more important, their one point of unique potential to win customer loyalty. Given that UI/UX improvements – no matter how great – are only marginal improvements in the eyes of the user (as opposed to product innovation) this strategy often falls back on aggressive marketing efforts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In this scenario there are two ways that this business model can extract value:</p>



<ul><li>Subscription model that is more suitable for a niche market&nbsp;</li><li>Free service that banks on similar monetisation avenues available in the existing services&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p>UI/UX solutions for ubiquitous and free services tend to opt for a subscription-based offering as a form of capturing value, reaping the rewards of a more condensed user base and opting out of the tradeoffs necessary for disrupting the ubiquitous forms of use. However, a subscription model, as we discussed earlier, creates a ceiling on adoption – relegating it in the near term to a novel solution.</p>



<p>Regardless of speculation on the true motive behind it, HEY’s recent and very public dispute with Apple over its IOS App store listing was a boon for the product’s virality. HEY’s strategy initially started with an invite-only exclusive approach, but the apparent struggle with Apple has had much further reaching impact on product awareness. As HEY leans into the anti-big-tech narrative to leverage its marketing potential, it needs to tread carefully such that it doesn’t risk seeming intellectually dishonest – especially given that it is not providing a truly accessible alternative to the large email service providers it claims to be competing with.&nbsp;</p>



<p>HEY’s ability to retain users on the platform will become dependent on their ability to continue convincing users that there is value in the experience of an email – especially where functionality remains abundant on much larger competing platforms. HEY’s annual subscription is an intentional habit building funnel, user’s who subscribe will have a year to become familiar with – and hopefully attached to – the service’s features. Given that there is always the potential for habits to be transferred across platforms though, it will be imperative that HEY continues innovating its unique proposition.</p>



<p><span>Down the Rabbit Hole</span>

<h3>1. Red ocean traps demonstrate the pitfalls faced by founders attempting to find or create fertile grounds for products and services</h3>



<p>As market power increasingly moves from companies to consumers, competition intensifies. Long-term success will increasingly “depend on the ability to generate new demand and create and capture new markets.” “Red ocean traps” are pitfalls that hinder the creation or identification of new markets.</p>



<p>“We have come to think of them as red ocean traps, because they effectively anchor managers in red oceans—crowded market spaces where companies engage in bloody competition for market share—and prevent them from entering blue oceans, previously unknown and uncontested market spaces with ample potential.”</p>



<p>Red ocean traps confuse strategies for competitive advantages with creating new markets.</p>



<p><strong>Trap one: seeing market-creating strategies as customer-oriented approaches</strong></p>



<p>Focusing on existing customers keeps companies mired in red oceans.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>“</strong>an organization needs to turn its focus to noncustomers and why they refuse to patronize an industry’s offering. Noncustomers, not customers, hold the greatest insight into the points of pain and intimidation that limit the boundary of an industry.”</p>



<p><strong>Trap two: treating market-creating strategies as niche strategies</strong></p>



<p>Segmenting existing markets into finer segments to identify niches is not the same as creating new markets.</p>



<p>“Successful market-creating strategies don’t focus on finer segmentation. More often, they “desegment” markets by identifying key commonalities across buyer groups that could help generate broader demand.”</p>



<p><strong>Trap three: confusing technology innovation with market-creating strategies</strong></p>



<p>“Value innovation, not technology innovation, is what launches commercially compelling new markets. Successful new products or services open market spaces by offering a leap in productivity, simplicity, ease of use, convenience, fun, or environmental friendliness. But when companies mistakenly assume that market creation hinges on breakthrough technologies, their organizations tend to push for products or services that are too “out there,” too complicated, or, like the Segway, lacking a necessary ecosystem.“</p>



<p><strong>Trap four: equating creative destruction with market creation</strong></p>



<p>Creative destruction refers to a new invention replacing an existing product or technology. But creating new markets does not always require creative destruction.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Many market-creating moves are nondestructive, because they offer solutions where none previously existed. We’ve also seen this happen with the social networking and crowdfunding industries. And even when a certain amount of destruction is involved in market creation, nondestructive creation is often a larger element than you might think. Nintendo’s Wii game player, for example, complemented more than replaced existing game systems, because it attracted younger children and older adults who hadn’t previously played video games.”</p>



<p><strong>Trap five: equating market-creating strategies with differentiation</strong></p>



<p>Differentiation is when a competitor stands out from the competition by providing premium value and the trade-off is higher costs for both the consumer and the competitor.</p>



<p>“In reality, a market-creating move breaks the value-cost trade-off. It is about pursuing differentiation and low cost simultaneously… A market-creating move is a “both-and,” not an “either-or,” strategy. …when companies mistakenly assume that market creation is synonymous with differentiation, they often focus on what to improve or create to stand apart and pay scant heed to what they can eliminate or reduce to simultaneously achieve low cost.”</p>



<p><strong>Trap six: equating market-creating strategies with low-cost strategies</strong></p>

        <!-- <h1 class="post-title">Lottery Odds: Jackpot Rolldown Edition</h1> -->

        <section>
            <p>Does this special game event mean it’s time to play the lottery? Let’s break out the statistics to find out.</p>

<p><img src="https://niallbunting.com/assets/images/daily/2020-06-23-lottery.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Tomorrow in the UK we have a special case of the ‘Lotto’ called a Jackpot Rolldown. This means that if nobody wins the jackpot (matching 6 numbers) the entire 12.8M jackpot will be shared between all other winners.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If no one matches all 6 main numbers in a Must Be Won draw, the Jackpot will be shared by all cash winners, so they’ll win an even bigger prize.</p>

  <p>For example, that could mean winning £100 for matching 3 main numbers instead of £30!</p>

  <p><cite>– national-lottery.co.uk</cite></p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m interested to see how this affects the expected value aka how much you gain each time you play. For example, Roulette has an expected value of 0.947% (on red/black) so for every £1.00 spent you can expect to receive £0.95 back.</p>

<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Nobody wins the jackpot (including us on the rolldown).</li>
  <li>The payout on Match 3 is exactly £100.</li>
  <li>All ‘Free lucky dips’ lose or win after one more draw.</li>
  <li>Free lucky dips can win the jackpot and it’s the same value.</li>
  <li>Lottery costs £2 to play.</li>
  <li>Don’t have to share prizes (essentially everyone else enters but loses).</li>
  <li>My statistics skills can handle this and I haven’t made a mistake.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gathering-the-data">Gathering the data</h2>

<p>From the marketing material we can gather values that are relevant for tomorrows game:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Jackpot is £12,800,000 (12.8M).</li>
  <li>Match 3 will get you £100 rather than the £30.</li>
</ul>

<p>We need to gather more data from the depths of the <a href="https://www.national-lottery.co.uk/games/lotto/game-procedures">lottery procedures page</a>, giving us the following table.</p>

<h2 id="calculating-the-new-prizes">Calculating the new prizes</h2>

<p>We can work out the other roledowns total prize pool by assigning that percent of the jackpot to the each of the possible rolldowns. However, to work out how much this increases each individual prize we need to estimate how many people we expect to win each prize.</p>

<p>Therefore, we need to estimate how many tickets will be sold. This can be done by using the size of the prize pool for Match 3 and the £70 increase of the usual prize value.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>Estimated Entries = ( Match 3 rolldown) / (Match 3 prize increase) / (Match 3 chance of winning)
Estimated entries = (9472000 / 70) / 0.0103950104 = 13,017,234
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With this calculated, just use the chance of winning to estimate how many people will be sharing the prize pot and how much that increases their prize:</p>

<table>

<h2 id="lucky-dip">Lucky Dip</h2>

<p>The lucky dip allows us to play again in the next draw with random numbers. We can just use the expected value of regular draw for calculating this. Reducing it by the fact that we need to win a lucky dip on the initial draw first.</p>

<h2 id="expected-value">Expected value</h2>

<p>The expected value is made up of two parts the winnings that you expect to win minus the wager required you expect to lose.</p>

<p>For the roulette example this is:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>P(Red) * (Value of X for Red) + P(Not Red) * (Value of X for Not Red) = (18/38 * 1) + (20/38  * -1) = -0.053.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>For the lottery we can do this for each prize type, then sum them to get the overall positive value. We can also calculate the cost of playing the game and the chance that we will lose.</p>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>It seems overall, we have (remember it costs £2 to play):</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Draw</th>
      <th>Expected Return</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Rolldown (no jackpot)</td>
      <td>£1.80</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Regular (or rolldown with claimed jackpot)</td>
      <td>£1.10</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>These values seem sensible to me as they say that about 50% of the value of the ticket are paid out as prizes.</p>

<p>At about 15.5M the expected return turn positive (assuming everything else stays the same). Maybe this is why they have rolldowns to stop this from happening even though it would be a good story.</p>

<p>This means that a rolldown (with all the assumptions) would have slightly better odds than the roulette table. Ignoring the fact that with this amount of entries we should expect a 29% chance that someone wins.</p>

<p>As other people are likely to share our numbers and therefore prizes these results would get worse.</p>

<p>It seems like once again the roulette table has won, it seems you really can’t beat the house.</p>

<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

<p>There are likely errors in these calculations feel free to point them out. You can find the spreadsheet I used <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1y817IsyF9hRF_Tndg2_pob41YmBxWP5-npUW7v62Qxc/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</p>

<p>That Hacker News comment struck a chord with me, as I think the phrase
“impregnable abstraction castle” perfectly captures something that is commonly
encountered in software.</p>
<p>An abstraction castle appears as follows. An area of a codebase seems to develop
into a fortification that is resistant to change, apparently designed to defend
against all envisioned future scenarios and to keep out every encroachment of
the outside world that the designers could imagine.</p>
<p>The abstraction castle is an unbreakable joined-up piece surrounded by a moat
and a drawbridge. It’s difficult to isolate any single area for potential
alternative use cases. Inside the moat, everything is dry (especially the
firewood) and there is only one ordained way to get things done in the castle.
Trying to change any single piece is a threat to the abstraction castle’s
integrity and must be thwarted.</p>
<p>At the same time, the abstraction castle is not self-sufficient. It must depend
on the surrounding landscape for all of its essential supplies. It pulls
everything towards its centre and relies on the assumptions of its designers to
not fail during a crisis.</p>
<p>Change is coming, change is the enemy, and the abstraction castle is
impregnable. Either there’s a prolonged siege of trying to force the castle to
adapt to the change, or the castle is just left alone entirely to sit in its
moat while the change continues elsewhere.</p>
<p>An abstraction castle is the polar opposite of code that is <a href="https://www.hughgrigg.com/posts/write-code-that-is-easy-to-delete/">easy to
delete</a>. For every advantage of
code that is easy to delete, an abstration castle has the corresponding
disadvantage:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Easy to delete</th>
<th>Abstraction castle</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>“Make it easy to delete.”</td>
<td>“Make it hard to delete.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“Keep it simple.”</td>
<td>“Make it elaborate.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“Be self-sufficient.”</td>
<td>“Consume everything in the surroundings.”</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>“Make fewer assumptions about other areas.”</td>
<td>“Dominate the landscape for miles around.”</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The idea of an abstraction castle also ties in well with these jokes, which
gain extra meanings in this context:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“All castles had one major weakness. The enemy used to get in through the
gift shop.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://libquotes.com/peter-kay/quote/lbv7u0s">Peter Kay</a></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Oblivious tourist: ‘Why did they build this castle right next to a
noisy airport?’”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– clichéd joke about whatever group of tourists is unpopular at the time.</p>
<p>These feel relevant to the idea of abstraction castles because they vividly
highlight how what was once supposed to be a permanent and undefeatable solution
is made ridiculous when the context changes. And the context will always change,
because it is out of our control.</p>
<p>One more quote, this one from the field of systemantics as described in The
Systems Bible (which I love):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The army is now fully prepared to fight the previous war.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>– <a href="https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=mrOsbi2pjXcC&amp;pg=PA31">The Systems Bbible, p.31</a></p>
<p>Again, this gets at the idea that predicting the future is difficult, so we
should expend our limited resources cautiously when dealing with such
uncertainty. Abstraction castles do the opposite of this – they try to expend
the maximum amount of resources on building absolute certainty that they are
correct and should be highly resistant to change (just like a physical castle).</p>

<h2>Defining Entropy</h2>



<p>Entropy is a measure of chaos, or disorder, in a system.</p>



<p>My college physics professor described entropy using two shoe closets.</p>



<p>Imagine a clean shoe closet, where all shoes are paired and sorted by color. The closet’s entropy is the total number of arrangements its shoes can have. A clean closet’s entropy is relatively small. There may be a few pairs of grey or blue shoes that can be switched around – but this doesn’t add much complexity. In a closet with low entropy, it’s easy to add or remove shoes from that closet as needed.</p>



<p>Now imagine a messy shoe closet. None of the shoes are paired, and they’re all tangled in a big pile. How many possible combinations can these shoes be in? You can quickly find out by trying to pull out the pair you want. The messy shoe closet has a much greater entropy than the clean one.</p>



<p>In short, we measure entropy by counting the number of possible states a system can be in. More states mean more entropy.</p>



<h2>Entropy in Software</h2>



<p>In software, our building blocks are simple enough for us to measure entropy in a crude way. Take this model for example:</p>


<pre title="">Transaction(
  createdAt: String
  buyerId: String,
  sellerId: String
  amount: Int
)
</pre>


<p>As simple as it seems, this model is like our messy shoe closet. There are many more ways for this model to be wrong than there are for it to be right. We can see that by comparing it to an organized shoe closet:</p>


<pre title="">Transaction(
  createdAt: DateTime,
  buyerId: UserId,
  sellerId: UserId,
  amount: Price
)
</pre>


<p>When `createdAt` was an arbitrary string, it could take on invalid values “foo” and “bar” just as easily as a valid value “06-23-2020”. There are many more possible states that the field can be in, and most of them are invalid. This choice of a broad data type allows chaos into our model. This unwanted chaos leads to misunderstandings, bugs, and wasted energy.</p>



<p>When each model is strongly typed to a strict set of values, this chaos is minimized. DateTime, UserId, and Price are typed such that all possible values are valid. Accordingly, these types are more predictable, easier to manipulate, and lead to less surprises in practice.</p>



<p>As in life, entropy is not all bad – some of it is desirable and some of it is not. In software, we need entropy to a certain extent: our code is valuable <em>because </em>it supports a variety of possible dates, users, and prices. But when this chaos grows beyond the value it adds, our software becomes painful to use and painful to maintain.</p>



<h2>Modeling Software Entropy</h2>



<p>Given our observations, we can describe a simple rule:</p>



<p><code>complexity = number of total possible states</code></p>



<p>A construct with only a few possible states is simple. Booleans and enums are much simpler than strings. A system with one moving piece is much simpler than a system with many moving pieces.</p>



<p>Sometimes, our problems are essentially complex. In these cases, our solutions need some essential complexity to match. But when does essential complexity become unnecessary? In these cases, we can use another rule:</p>



<p><code>cleanliness = number of <strong>valid</strong> possible states / number of <strong>total</strong> possible states</code></p>



<p>If there are thousands of total possible states, but only two of them are valid: it’s a messy solution. A simple example of this is representing a boolean value as a string.</p>


<pre title="">if value == "true": do this
else if value == "false": do that
else: throw error
</pre>


<p>There are many ways for this code to go wrong; not just in execution but also in interpretation. Keeping our solutions clean improves correctness, readability, and maintainability. It’s one of the primary measures of “quality” in my view.</p>



<h2>Minimizing Software Entropy</h2>



<p>Given these definitions, we can ask ourselves some questions to guide our software decisions:</p>



<ol><li>How many possible states does this solution have?</li><li>How many of those states are invalid?</li><li>Is there any way to make the solution simpler, by trimming the number of <em>total</em> possible states?</li><li>Is there any way to make the solution cleaner, by trimming the number of <em>invalid</em> possible states?</li></ol>



<p>The power of this concept is that it smoothly scales up and down the ladder of abstraction. It applies to basic data types just as well as it does to solution architecture and product development.</p>



<p>How many moving pieces does our solution need? When an unimaginable requirement flies in and tries to blow our solution to the ground, how many pieces can be left standing? When an unexpected input arrives, do invalid states propagate across the system, or are they contained and eliminated on sight? In short, how clean is our solution?</p>



<p>To make life possible, we utilize chaos by creating complex systems that support a diversity of people and their use cases. To make life predictable, we combat undesirable chaos by keeping those systems as clean and orderly as possible.</p>



<p>In software, we work in a world where chaos is measurable and cleanliness is achievable. We just need the right set of signals and responses to make it happen.</p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Python’s <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html"><code>itertools</code></a> package is the gold standard for working with iterable streams of data.</p>

<p>It always irked me that Python needed an entire package to do things that I felt like the base language should easily support. I know Raku treats <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#index-entry-lazy_list_%E2%80%A6">lazy lists as first class objects</a>, so that made me start to wonder: how well does Raku stack up?</p>

<p>To answer this question, I’m just going to go through every function in the <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html"><code>itertools</code></a> and provide a one liner Raku equivalent. These will all work with normal iterables as well as infinite lists and sequences. Let’s begin:</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.count"><code>count()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>-&gt; $start, $end = * { $start ... $end }
</code></pre>
<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.cycle"><code>cycle()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>-&gt; @p { lazy gather { loop { for @p -&gt; $p { take $p } } } }
</code></pre>
<p>From CIAvash on the Raku IRC:</p>
<pre><code>-&gt; @p { |@p xx * }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.repeat"><code>repeat()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>-&gt; $elem, $n = * { $elem xx $n }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.accumulate"><code>accumulate()</code></a>:</p>
<pre><code>-&gt; @p, &amp;func = * + * { [\[&amp;func]] @p }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.chain"><code>chain() / chain.from_iterable()</code></a>:</p>

<p>This is the default behavior of <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Signature#Types_of_slurpy_array_parameters">slurpy arguments</a>.</p>
<pre><code>-&gt; *@p { @p }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.compress"><code>compress()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt; @d, @s { flat @d Zxx @s }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.dropwhile"><code>dropwhile()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt; &amp;pred, @seq { lazy gather for @seq { take $_ if &amp;pred ff * } }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.filterfalse"><code>filterfalse()</code></a>:</p>

<p>This is a builtin: the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/List#routine_grep"><code>grep</code> method, using a <code>none</code> Junction</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.groupby"><code>groupby()</code></a>:</p>

<p>This is a builtin: the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/List#routine_categorize"><code>categorize</code> method</a> or the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/List#routine_classify"><code>classify</code> method</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.islice"><code>islice()</code></a>:</p>

<p>This is a builtin: basic <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/List#routine_categorize">positional list slices</a> are capable of this.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.starmap"><code>starmap()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt; &amp;func, @seq { @seq&gt;&gt;.&amp;{ func(|$_) } }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.takewhile"><code>takewhile()</code></a>:</p>

<p>I could write this the same as <code>dropwhile()</code> but just break out of the <code>for</code> loop early, but I’m gonna take full advantage of the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/language/operators#infix_...">sequence operator</a> here instead.</p>
<pre><code>-&gt; &amp;pred, @seq { |@seq ...^ { !pred($_) } }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.tee"><code>tee()</code></a>:</p>

<p>Not really sure that this one makes sense to implement, as we’re technically working with lazy lists for the most part here and not generated sequences.</p>

<p>For that matter, <code>Seq</code> does provide a builtin, the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/type/Seq#(PositionalBindFailover)_method_cache"><code>cache</code> method</a>, that may be used effectively the same way in practice.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.zip_longest"><code>zip_longest()</code></a>:</p>

<p>Probably the hardest one to implement. Nothing in Raku really naturally does this operation. Without accounting for length, and stopping at the shortest list, it would simply be:</p>
<pre><code>-&gt; **@p { [Z] @p }
</code></pre>
<p>Going to think about this one overnight, actually. I feel like there’s an elegant way to do this really quickly but I can’t put my finger on it. Pester me using the links down below if I haven’t filled this one in yet.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.product"><code>product()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt; +p { [X] p }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.permutations"><code>permutations()</code></a>:</p>

<p>This is a builtin: the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/permutations"><code>permutations</code> method</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations"><code>combinations()</code></a>:</p>

<p>This is a builtin: the <a href="https://docs.raku.org/routine/combinations"><code>combinations</code> method</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p><a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/itertools.html#itertools.combinations"><code>combinations_with_replacement()</code></a>:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt; @p, $r { |@p.combinations($r), |([Z] @p xx $r) }
</code></pre>

<hr>

<p>Well, that’s about all of them. Every <code>itertools</code> function written on one page, in Raku one liners. This is all just food for thought: there really is no reason for Python to be as verbose and yet so lacking in features, and I suppose this is some sort of proof.</p>

<h3><strong>1. Hello! Who are you and what is your business?</strong></h3>



<p>I’m Paul, I run a company called <a href="https://thechurchco.com/">The Church Co</a>. It’s a website builder for churches. The key difference being that, compared to other website builders out there (building your own), we build the websites for the church in 7 days and then hand it over for them to maintain. We think that maintaining a website and building a website are two different skill sets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I got my degree in digital media in The Internet and Interactive Design back in 2007. Then I decided to go to Bible school. I moved to Sydney, Australia (where I went to Bible school) and ended up getting hired at a church there, going back and doing web design. During that process, I started learning about using my skills together and combining two of the passions that I had. I started The Church Co years later, which is ultimately the combination of both of those things.</p>



<p>I had some friends that worked at different churches and was able to reach out to them to trial it. We ran it for free for a year and a half before ever taking payments. We lost half of our customers the day we turned the payments on, and then just started building them back. It all grew word of mouth via happy customers and Facebook groups.</p>



<p>The Church Co makes <strong>$30k-32k a month</strong> in subscriptions. We have optional add-ons like custom themes, sermon and blog imports. If you need more than the 15 pages that will do for free in the build. There are one-time fees which accounts for around $3,000 a month in addition to the subscriptions.</p>



<p>Our pricing plans start at $20 for basic, $50 at premium, and ultimate for $199. The basic plan is simply everything you need for a standard website: web pages, blogs, sermons (which are podcast events systems). The premium plan has nice church features that we’ve added that are geared towards interaction with members that come to your church. One example is a sermon note-taker where the pastor can outline their sermon notes and you can follow along via your phone, add your own notes, and then compile and send them to yourself. We also have a small group locator, which shows small groups that meet in the community that are all part of your church. We’ve got options for live streams, chats, and online giving/donations through stripe.</p>



<p>These features are all niche-targeted features that make it easier to manage and get more interactions. From here, we incentivize people to upgrade as well. The ultimate plan has all the same features as premium, but we manage your content for you. You’ll basically never have to log into your website — just email us and tell us to do something for Christmas and we’ll spin up a page for you.</p>



<p>For expenses, we vary between like $9k-11k each month. This includes salaries, servers, intercom, etc. We pay contractors in addition to our full-time people (myself and one other individual) that we have to build other websites for the churches. This varies with how many people sign up and how many hours it takes them to build the sites.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before COVID I would’ve considered a customer a day (totaling about 30 for the month) to be a great month. Then we started doing the same amount in a week when stay-at-home orders came to the point of gaining 100 new customers in a month — which was wild! We spend a lot of time on customer support and brought on a lot of contractors to kind of help get that done.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was mind-blowing that there were so many fully functioning organizations that had never had websites. It was an unfortunate event that was bad for a lot of people, but it really pushed many into a digital space, which we were prepared for. In the last three months, we did the equivalent of how many sites we did all of last year, so it scaled quickly. And luckily the processes were all in place to make that happen.</p>



<h3><strong>2. How do you attract and retain your customers?</strong></h3>



<p>The main way we’ve grown is word of mouth, especially through really niche Facebook groups. My background from working in the communications role at a church helped me get involved in those groups, just to be a help to other people. I never spammed my product (nor did I ever have to). We haven’t invested money into any ads except maybe a few dollars for some Google ads and a few dollars for some retargeting Facebook ads.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As far as retaining customers, one of the beauties of websites is, you don’t change them that often. We work really hard to get you on your domain name, and once you’re on that, then you’re typically going to stay for 3+ years. We do a lot of work in the beginning stages to onboard people, build their site, and get them up through launching. What makes it different to most SaaS products is that you can see if someone stops logging in — that’s when they churn. But for us, that’s when they’re happy, and good to go. Really happy customers could log in once a week just to add a new event or upload a podcast from the weekend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One of the reasons that we found why organizations churn is when they get a new volunteer that is familiar with another website builder. We ensure they stick around by separating the data from the design, which means you can change your theme at any time and it auto adjusts the layout.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We release new themes every year. The goal is that if you’ve been on the platform for 5 or so years, and want a new look, you can just browse our theme library, preview and activate without needing additional work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is the big focus: getting people onto the domain and then making sure we’re releasing new features. It’s helped with keeping customers.&nbsp;</p>



<h3><strong>3. What were your challenges and obstacles of growing your business?</strong></h3>



<p>When I started this company, I thought people would see the website and think that it’s much better than what they could build themselves. I realized that <strong>you’re not actually selling the final product — it’s the experience of making the product.</strong>&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was within the first 6 weeks with our first trial customer that I realized people were not going to build their own websites (or they’d take 6 months to do it, which was way too long of a sales cycle). I thought, <em>well, I built the system, I can do it pretty quick.</em> So we started offering our done-for-you website building, which was a game changer. It ran great for a while when we did it all for free (but requested payment for site launch).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then we burned out a few times. So we started asking for credit card information first, as a commitment to do this, and we would build a website — which worked great until we got websites that requested 500 pages. That would take us a month to build, and there’s no way it was sustainable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was iterated down to the point we are today: we start building the website which is a free 15 pages, (about the average size of a church website). Making money was never the goal.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before I had contractors I used to get up at 5am and go to a coffee shop, build three websites and go to my day job for 8 hours. Then I’d come home, have some family time and then, after everyone’s asleep, jump back on and build more websites. It wasn’t the most fun in that stage, and it continued that way until it scaled enough with revenue to hire people to do that for me. I think a lot of people quit when they hit that first wall, instead of thinking: <em>what’s the wildest solution to this (even if it’s not like a fun one)?</em>&nbsp;</p>



<p>We pivoted from my original idea, in that I thought people would build their own websites (which was not the case). Currently, I’m in the middle of a bit of a pivot as well, adding design to our service.</p>



<p>We’ve never been a design tool. We’re no code and we’re no design. Our ideal customer is a church that doesn’t have a creative staff member. and the value is on the content. We convert about 25% of trials into customers, which is pretty high; but the feedback we get from the other 75% are usually about design related things (i.e. they have a design in mind they wanted to implement). Part of the big push on version 2 is adding more design capabilities and flexibility for the people that want it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were a lot of assumptions I made around design in the initial version that looking back, I would have done a little bit more research: i.e. surveying a few people working in churches that weren’t my friends to see what they were struggling with and what they needed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I would have also made strategic partnerships earlier (I was very anti-affiliates for a long time). I would see 10 people spamming affiliate links in the Facebook groups and would immediately be biased against the products because it needs affiliates to sell. While I don’t think we suffered from refusing to do affiliates, a lot of competitors did which kept paired them up with influencers in the space. We ended up caving and now have an affiliate plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another challenge was letting go of control on intercom, but it needed to happen. It’s the only communication we have; there’s no phone line. Anyone who gets the role needs to be well vetted in communication skills and sales, the ability to convert someone that’s just browsing into a paying customer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was a bit too close to the product. I’m more prone to talk about specific technical things that customers would simply not understand. Handing the role off to someone else has made more sales and has overall been one of the best moves I’ve made.</p>



<h3><strong>4. What has been helpful to help you to grow your business?</strong></h3>



<p>The Indie Hackers community. I think having really ‘<em>switched-on’</em> people that are willing to give you constructive and honest feedback is really valuable. I suppose it’s a bit like having a life coach. It’s gotten us to where we are today.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When we added a chat to the dashboard, it helped drive sales (despite chat being the bane of my existence). You can’t log into any of the major competitors’ sites (that I know of), and live chat with a web developer to ask them questions. We do, and it was a tool that really …</p></div></div></article></div></div>

        <p>I came across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/haskell/comments/hee4r4/ihp_is_a_modern_batteriesincluded_web_framework/">IHP is a modern batteries-included Web Framework, built on top of Haskell and Nix</a> today and being about web frameworks <em>and</em> nix it immediately caught my eye. I read the comments first, got mildly annoyed at the first comment being about “it’s nix only”, and kept scrolling until I saw a comment (you’ll see in the stream) that properly motivated me to actually read the link attached :D</p>
<p>I then resolved to stream playing around with this cool framework and also to do it from an ubuntu vm in virtualbox to show how seamless nix can make the setup (or can it?!?). Here’s a video of the stream in case you missed it:</p>

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Computer users organize their files into folders because that is the primary tool offered by operating systems. But applying this standard hierarchical model to my own files, I began to notice shortcomings of this paradigm over the years. At the same time, I used some other information systems not based on hierarchical path names, and they turned out to solve a number of problems. I propose a new way of organizing files based on tagging, and describe the features and consequences of this method in detail.</p>
<p>Speaking personally, I’m fed up with <abbr title="hierarchical file systems">HFSes</abbr>, on Windows, Linux, and online storage alike. I struggled with file organization for just over a decade before finally writing this article to describe problems and solutions. Life would be easier if I could tolerate the limitations of hierarchical organization, or at least if the new proposal can fit on top of existing HFSes. But fundamentally, there is a mismatch between the narrowness of hierarchies and the rich structure of human knowledge, and the proposed system will not presuppose the features of HFSes. I wish to solicit public feedback on these ideas, and end up with a design plan that I can implement to solve the problems I already have today.</p>
<p>This article is more of a brainstorm than a prescriptive formula. I begin by illustrating how hierarchies fall short on real-life problems, and how existing alternative systems like Git and Danbooru bypass HFS problems to deliver a better user experience. Then I describe a step-by-step model, starting from basic primitives, of a proposed file organization system that includes a number of desirable features by design. Finally, I present some open questions on aspects of the proposal where I’m unsure of the right answer.</p>
<p>I welcome any feedback about anything written here, especially regarding errors, omissions, and alternatives. For example, I might have missed helpful features of traditional HFSes. I know I haven’t read about or tested every alternative file system out there. I know that my proposed file organization scheme might have issues with conceptual and computational complexity, be too general or not expressive enough, or fail to offer a useful feature. And certainly, I don’t know all the ramifications of the proposed system if it gets implemented, on aspects ranging from security to sharing to networks. But I try my best to present tangible ideas as a start toward designing a better system. And ultimately, I want to implement such a proposed file system so that I can store and find my data sanely.</p>
<p>In the arguments presented below, I care most about the data model and less about implementation details. For example in HFSes, I focus on the fact that the file system consists of a tree of labeled edges with file content at the leaves; I ignore details about inodes, journaling, defragmentation, permissions, etc. For example in my proposal, I care about what data each file should store and what each field means; I assert that querying over all files in the file system is possible but don’t go into detail about how to do it efficiently. Also, the term “file system” can mean many things – it could be just a model of what data is stored (e.g. directories and files), or an abstract API of possible commands (e.g. mkdir(), walk(), open(), etc.), or it could refer to a full-blown implementation like NTFS with all its idiosyncratic features and characteristics. When I critique hierarchical file systems, I am mostly commenting at the data model level – regardless of the implementation flavor (ext4, HFS+, etc.). When I propose a new way of organizing files, I am mainly designing the data model, and leaving the implementation details for later work.</p>

<hr>

<h2 id="hierarchical-file-systems-are-useful">Hierarchical file systems are useful</h2>
<p>Hierarchies are popular because they serve a useful purpose. They do organize files to a certain extent, and are better than having nothing at all. (Older computer systems simply had a flat file system where every file is stored in the root directory of a drive.)</p>
<dl>
	<dt id="physical-storage-analogy">Physical storage analogy</dt>
	<dd>
		<p><abbr title="hierarchical file systems">HFSes</abbr> imitate how information is stored in the physical world. If you have a set of papers, you’d put them into a labeled folder, folders into a filing cabinet, cabinets into aisles, aisles into rooms, rooms into buildings, and so forth. Each piece of paper is stored in only one place, which can be described by a unique address. The content on a sheet of paper can be updated and the page can be stored back in the same place.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="ubiquitous-availability">Ubiquitous availability</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>HFSes are already available on every major computing platform – Unix (ext, XFS, ZFS, etc.), Windows (FAT, NTFS, ReFS), macOS (HFS+), Android, and web services (Dropbox, OneDrive, etc.). As a user or a developer, if you need hierarchical file organization, you will almost certainly get it.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="reducing-repetition">Reducing repetition</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Instead of labeling each relevant file with a particular aspect, you group the files together and put them all in one folder named with the aspect. For example instead of writing “Bicycle” within each file name among a set of photos, you can put those files into a folder named “Bicycle” and not need to touch the individual file names.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="filtering-out-items">Filtering out items</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Browsing a hierarchy is powerful because it inherently filters out unwanted information and brings wanted information to the forefront. For example when you open a folder called “Tax Documents”, you will not see the party photos which are stored elsewhere.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="naturally-hierarchical-phenomena">Naturally hierarchical phenomena</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Some natural concepts have a nested structure and are already labeled in a hierarchical way. Geographic locations are hierarchical – a city belongs to a state which belongs to a country which belongs to a continent. For example if you want to organize a set of travel photos, you can make a folder for each country, a subfolder for each city, and so on. Each photo belongs to only one place, never two countries or two cities at once. Divisions of time are hierarchical. You can create a folder for each year, and put each document in one year folder. Or you can go finer and create a subfolder for each month, et cetera.</p>
	</dd>
	<dt id="simple-implementation">Simple implementation</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Hierarchical file systems are relatively easy for an operating system designer to implement, compared to fancy relational databases or such. At their core, HFSes involve rooted trees (or directed acyclic graphs), node pointers, edge labels (directory entry names), and file blobs. Writing user-level applications that operate in a hierarchical file system is quite manageable too. A simple program might just work on single files, or list a directory non-recursively. Even in the full case of walking over files and directories recursively, the data model is simple and easy to work with.</p>
		<p>Another benefit is that data retrieval can be fast in practice even when directories are stored on disk naively as unsorted lists (without applying advanced data structures like B-trees). This is because users are naturally inclined to keep the number of items in a directory at a manageable number – if a user sees a directory with a thousand items, she will likely create a few subfolders and put a few hundred items into each. This benefit of fast linear searching does not apply to flat file systems, where a root directory might have tens of thousands of files (thus B-trees must be used, but flat file systems are obsolete anyway).</p>
	</dd>
</dl>

<hr>

<h2 id="hierarchical-organization-is-clumsy">Hierarchical organization is clumsy</h2>
<p>With the benefits of hierarchical file systems out of the way, let’s discuss how they seriously fall short in helping us organize files – or more broadly speaking, how they represent and retrieve knowledge. A tricky aspect about the upcoming arguments is that <abbr title="hierarchical file systems">HFSes</abbr> appear to behave okay at the small scale (say 100 to 1000 files), but they become increasingly painful to use at the large scale (say 100&nbsp;000 files).</p>
<dl>
	<dt id="forced-unique-names">Forced unique names</dt>
	<dd>
		<p>Every file within a folder must have a unique name. (Or phrased more formally: For each directory in the file system, each item in that directory has a name different from all other items in that directory.) This seems like a reasonable design on the surface – after all, you need some way to identify and access each file – but its implications are troubling.</p>
		<p><a href="https://www.nayuki.io/res/designing-better-file-organization-around-tags-not-hierarchies/cat-pictures-file-names.png"><img src="https://www.nayuki.io/res/designing-better-file-organization-around-tags-not-hierarchies/cat-pictures-file-names.png" alt=""></a>
		</p>
		<p>Example: You browse the web and download a bunch of cat pictures one by one. You just want to name every file “Cat.jpg” because it’s the best description you can think of without spending extra mental effort. But saving them into the same folder, each file needs a unique name. So you might decide to append a number to them, like “Cat-0.jpg”, “Cat-1.jpg”, “Cat-2.jpg”, etc. – fine. Or you might start to describe each one in more detail, like “Cat-in-hat.jpg”, “Cat-sleeping.jpg”, “Cat-chase.jpg”. But eventually you will see a picture that deserves the same description, so you’ll still end up with numbered names like “Cat-in-hat-2.jpg”, etc. Either way, once you start numbering files, you need to check the highest existing number every time you save a file. This procedure increases mental burden without actually improving the information being stored – it merely works around the unique name requirement imposed by the system.</p>

		</p>
		<p>Example: You do a photoshoot and capture a series of images, say “Fred-01.jpg”, “Fred-02.jpg”, ..., “Fred-30.jpg”. You delete some outtakes, leaving holes in the sequential file numbering. If you publish this subset of photos as is, the consumer might wonder why there are gaps in the numbering, and get unintended insight into how many raws were shot. But it gets worse – your coworker Mary was shooting alongside you, and offers you her collection of photos of the same subject. In a stroke of bad luck (or great minds thinking alike?), she also named her photos “Fred-01.jpg”, “Fred-02.jpg”, ..., “Fred-19.jpg”. You want the benefit of being able to use her files, but now you are left with a …</p></dd></dl></article></div>

				  <p>Sales and customer data provide important insight for companies. Analytics has today an important role in providing data about sales trends, customer profiles, warnings about (un)profitable products, sales volume forecasts and stock supply as well as personalizing customer relationships and giving product recommendations.

Using for example SQL queries, a subset of the data can be exported to CRM and KPI sales software. This offers a lot of flexibility for data analyses. Let us experiment with some very useful SQL queries, such as select and filter. We first need to register the DataFrame as a temporary table in the SQLContext. <br></p>    <p>We first select a couple of columns, for example <em>Description</em> and <em>Quantity</em>. If you want to select all columns, simply use the star: <span color="#8d7824">spark.sql("select * from df").show(5)</span><br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f12_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Select the columns <em>Description</em> and <em>Quantity</em> and only those rows where <em>Quantity</em> has value = 6<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f13_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Select the columns <em>Description</em>, <em>Quantity</em>, and <em>Country</em> where <em>Quantity</em> has value = 6 and <em>country</em> is United Kingdom.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f14_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>SQL can also be used to show distinct (unique) values in a column. To limit space, only five are displayed here.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f15_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>And we can count the number of distinct values, that is how many countries are in total in the data.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f16_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>Using SQL we can also exclude certain values. For example, exclude all records with United Kingdom.<br></p>    <div><div> <p><a> <img src="https://www.rrighart.com/uploads/8/3/7/7/83774724/f17_orig.png" alt="Picture"> </a></p> </div></div>  <p>It would be possible to add a new column that categorizes UK (1) or not-UK (0). You could then use <span color="#8d7824">df.filter(df.Country == "United Kingdom").limit(5)</span> and <span color="#8d7824">filter(df.Country == "France").limit(5)</span> to check if the column is correctly coding UK versus not-UK.<br></p>    <p>Next, we could count UK versus not-UK using the new column <em>Country_UK</em>.<br></p>    <p>And compute mean <em>Amount</em> and summed <em>Quantity</em>.<br></p>      <div><p>That is it for now! In the current blog I have chosen to write out the code line by line. The code can of course be wrapped in several functions with the advantage that it can be used as a pre-processing script for different datasets, where you can set your own parameters. Further, smaller subsets of data can easily be exported and visualized in for ex. Plotly.</p><p>There are many other exciting features and developments in Spark:<br>1. Koalas is a Pandas API in Apache Spark, with similar capabilities but in a big data environment. This is particularly good news for people who already work in Pandas and need a quick translation to PySpark of their code.<br>2. Pandas UDF is a new feature that allows parallel processing on Pandas DataFrames.<br>3. There are excellent solutions using PySpark in the cloud. For example, AWS has big data platforms such as Elastic Map Reduce (EMR) that support PySpark.<br>4. Spark streaming allows real-time data analysis.<br>5. MLlib allows scalable machine learning in Spark.<br>6. GraphX enables graph computations.</p><p>If you have any questions or anything you think is missing in this tutorial, please feel free to share.

                Published on <em>June 24th, 2020</em>
                By <em>zooboole </em>
                        </p>
          
          
              <p>Well, as surprising as this could sound, you and I have been experiencing the surge of many articles and videos all over youtube suggesting tricks and interview plans to get you into some of the well-known big tech companies like Google, Amazon, Facebook, etc. They easily mention salaries like hundreds of thousands of USD. They rent and live expensive lives and they say to change jobs and careers anytime they wish. They start blogs and other types of internet businesses and in just a few months they speak of thousands of dollars in income.</p>

<p>Honestly speaking, I am not going to say that I know what exactly that's, either true or false. But I want you to usually look at one important parameter — their location. In which country are they? </p>

<p>I want you and me to be aware that it's all information. It comes from developed countries and seems to be generalized to other parts of the world and looks like a standard for others. It shouldn't be like that. No, No. Another thing is that people have "non-catholic" tricks they are ready to use to generate incomes. This way of success is not also universal since they cannot tell you exactly how they make it. Besides, it's almost impossible for someone to give you the exact way they make money. </p>

<p>So, looking at the situation, most of us and especially, the new generation of developers tend to fall into that illusion without knowing that they are consuming information that's not necessarily for them. </p>

<p>Do not get discouraged if your blog is not paying yet, or if you haven't got any client since you started learning.</p>

<p>The Internet is a global market. The size of its population can transform anyone into a rich in a matter of no time. But, how things work on it still depends on real-life laws. Your ability to succeed offline can also be used online. The same privileges your country provides you in real life are available to you on the Internet as well. Inversely, what your country laws do not offer you is also not available on the Internet for you, of course, with some exceptions here and there.</p>

<p>What do you mean? you may ask. </p>

<p>Well, the key to success on the Internet is mostly financial transactions. Because after all, you want people to send you money. Due to the number of people on the Internet, having a way of collecting funds from people located all over the world is a great game-changer. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, it's not everyone from everywhere who is allowed to receive or send money. Only a few countries have that privilege and when you are legally in them you also benefit from those advantages. Have a look at PayPal, one of the giants in the online payment market. They only allow a few countries to fully use their services. To make it worst, the majority of countries, especially poor countries do not have the privilege to receive money, but they can send. Strange right? </p>

<p>You can continue to empty your country, but you will not be allowed to fill it up. Another great service of payment online is Stripe. Unfortunately too, they do not even bother to consider Eastern Europe, Africa, Asia. If you try to look at local solutions such as banks, you will be disappointed to see that the same limitations await you.</p>

<p>Wait! before you start throwing stones to those companies, have a look at your local politics. Sometimes, your countries have laws and policies which prevent them from servicing it. Plus, the attitude of people too can be a problem, and a good example can be that your country may be full of scam activities or other financial crimes like money laundering.</p>

<p>The point I am trying to make is that, as far as you are not allowed to receive money, you can not sell any value, service, or resource on the Internet. And not being able to make sales means no income for you.</p>

<p>On the other hand, you have affiliation and advertisement solutions like Google Adsense, Amazon affiliation, Patreon, etc. that allow you to have your income saved in an escrow account until you reach a certain threshold. Once you reach it you can request for them to send it to you. And guess what? they usually also require you the same things you have not access to such as a PayPal account. Look at a website like Skillshare. They only pay you out via PayPal. They hide behind PayPal's filtering system of regions. They don't have to say "Hey, you guys from Nigeria or Nepal are not allowed in here". PayPal already did that and it's not Skillshare's fault. It's yours.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You will receive payments for each month on the 16th of the following month. For example, you would receive payments for the minutes watched in your classes and referrals made from July 1st to July 31st on August 16th.</p>
  
  <p><strong>We send payments through PayPal</strong>. Unfortunately at this time, if you do not have a PayPal account, you cannot earn revenue from teaching on Skillshare.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonetheless, you are allowed to create an account, and share your content for free to increase their reputation and give them more content. For that you're welcome.</p>

<p>When you also consider some local efforts like ExpressPayGhana, SlidePay, or Paystack and Flutterwave from Nigeria, they all suffer the same limitations. The process of getting them implemented and getting your payout is so frustrating that you need to think twice before using them in a serious business model. To me, Paystack and Flutterwave are far better than the others. And they will surely free us one day if our governments <strong>get the chance</strong> to allow them to use their full potential. One major challenge they have now is that most people from developed countries do not like to use those systems to us down here for reasons such as security, trust, and cost.</p>

<p>The limitations I've just mentioned are just the tip of an iceberg. The situation is more complicated than you could imagine. But when you hear them talk they make it sound like "if you want it, you go for it". Noo! it doesn't work everywhere. The world is not perfect for everyone. What a blogger can earn in three months in Europe or the USA, an African blogger will take more than three years to make half of it, that's if they even get to earn something at all. Following these people blindly is actually what helps them accomplish such success, hence putting you astray. Stop it and do your thing.</p>

<p>Many people out there work harder than you could imagine. They put in an amazing amount of determination and consistency, but their system cripples them every day.</p>

<p>To add a little to all I just said, in these developed countries jobs are granted (in most cases) to people with merit due to their effort and knowledge. Contrary to most of our poor countries where jobs are granted through nepotism. People with less knowledge and experience end up being employed and they will be in charge of judging(interviewing) those who have the experience. Friends and families are afraid of referring to each other because they don't want them to come and take their positions. In short, knowledge here doesn't necessarily matter much. So, making the #100daysOfCoding and posting on twitter or LinkedIn does not work here. Nobody cares.</p>

<p>That's why I always preach hard work. Learn hard as if you were going to create the next Google for yourself. Do not do to impress people. They won't your time because they are also busy. At some point, you will still acquire the required skills to work at Google. With some little luck, you could meet people who will recommend you to great people and brands. That makes it even less stressful.</p>

<![CDATA[Indexing Jsonb Columns in PostgreSQL]]>

June 24, 2020 | https://vsevolod.net/postgresql-jsonb-index/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://vsevolod.net/postgresql-jsonb-index/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
        <p>Since time immemorial PostgreSQL supports JSON fields and can even index
them. By immemorial I mean this functionality was added in versions 9.2 and 9.4
that are unsupported now. </p>
<p>I perfectly remember the world where PostgreSQL had no JSON support because 9.2
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/release-9-2.html">was released</a> in 2012,
and before that, I worked in a company that used MongoDB (we suffered
greatly<a href="https://vsevolod.net/postgresql-jsonb-index/#note1"><sup id="back1">[1]</sup></a>). It was an ample bit of marketing
for Mongo back then: "you can store any document without tediously defining an
ungodly schema! You gain so much flexibility!"</p>
<p>Little did we know back then that the world does not work that way, and
relational SQL databases are actually way more flexible than document-oriented
DBs, columnar DBs, or whatever.<a href="https://vsevolod.net/postgresql-jsonb-index/#note2"><sup id="back2">[2]</sup></a> Because
often we don't know what exactly are we going to do with the data, and with
relational DBs we can lay out the data however seems reasonable, and then add
indexes to support our use cases. </p>
<p>In document-oriented DBs you need to lay out your data exactly the way you're
going to query it later. Or else you'll need to migrate data inside your
schema-less database to another layout, which is way more cumbersome and
error-prone than adding some indexes and JOINs. </p>
<p>Don't trust me - there is an exceptional talk on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaEPXoXVf2k">Advanced Design Patterns for
DynamoDB</a> by Rick Houlihan, a
Principal Technologist at AWS. He explains that and so much more - it's a very
information-dense presentation with interesting ideas. I found it useful even
though I don't plan to use DynamoDB nor MongoDB in the near future.</p>
<p>Anyway, JSON support was added into PostgreSQL a long time ago, because
sometimes it is useful to store some documents in the database. And it can be
indexed in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-json.html#JSON-INDEXING">two different
ways</a> -
full <abbr title="Generalized Inverted Index">GIN</abbr> and a special
<code>jsonb_path_ops</code> that supports indexing the <code>@&gt;</code> operator only. It means
"contains" and can be used like this:</p>
<pre><span>SELECT * FROM table WHERE jsonb_field @&gt; '{"employer": {"country": "ZA"}}';
</span></pre>
<p>Let me tell you a story about how I cleverly used this feature and it bit me in
the ass.</p>
<h2 id="story-time">Story time<a href="#story-time" aria-label="Anchor link for: story-time">🔗</a></h2>
<p>I am a co-founder at <a href="https://www.prophy.science/">www.prophy.science</a> which is
a product that can understand, search and recommend scientific papers and
experts. To do that well, we need a collection of all scientific papers, and
papers are often provided by many different providers with different ids. There
are <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/">PubMed</a> (30M+ articles), <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/">PubMed
Central</a> (6M+ articles),
<a href="https://www.crossref.org/">Crossref</a> (80-100M+),
<a href="https://inspirehep.net/">INSPIRE</a>, there are preprint servers like
<a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>, <a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/">biorXiv</a>,
<a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/">medRxiv</a> and many others.</p>
<p>There is a widespread system of <abbr title="Digital object
identifier">DOIs</abbr> that are used to persistently identify journal articles,
research reports and data sets. It was introduced in the year 2000, and, as many
of these bibliographic databases predate DOI standard, they have their own
identifiers. Sometimes they even cross-link their IDs between different
services, and sometimes they cross-link wrong articles.</p>
<p>Some monitoring services download data from Crossref, Pubmed, PMC and some other
sources, add them and report that they have 180 million articles, 220 million,
or some other bullshit. We strive to merge the same article from different
sources into one entity with many external identifiers. We called these
identifiers "origin ids" and stored them in a special <code>jsonb</code> column, so one row
could have a record like this:</p>
<pre><span>{"pubmed": "3782696", "pmc": "24093010", "doi": "10.3389/fnhum.2013.00489"}
</span></pre>
<p>It was a simple key-value document with a <code>jsonb_path_ops</code> index on it. And
whenever we needed to fetch an article by an origin id, we queried it using a
<code>@&gt;</code> operator like that:</p>
<pre><span>SELECT id FROM articles WHERE origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}';
</span></pre>
<p>It is a bit easier to store ids this way, no need to maintain a separate table
with hundreds of millions of rows.</p>
<p>One problem arose when we tried to query the index with many different origin
ids. There is no <code>IN</code> nor <code>ANY()</code>, so we stitched lots of <code>OR</code>s together:</p>
<pre><span>SELECT id FROM articles WHERE 
    origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}' OR 
    origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "654321"}' OR 
    origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123321"}' OR 
    origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "456654"}';
</span></pre><h2 id="explain-everything">Explain everything<a href="#explain-everything" aria-label="Anchor link for: explain-everything">🔗</a></h2>
<p>And with enough <code>OR</code>s the query gets really slow. Why? <code>EXPLAIN</code> helpfully says
that it becomes a sequential scan (I shortened output for clarity):</p>
<pre><span>EXPLAIN
 SELECT id, origin_ids
   FROM articles
  WHERE origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}' OR
        origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "654321"}' OR
        ....;   - x200
                        QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on articles  (rows=7805036)
   Filter: ((origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}') OR
            (origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "654321"}') OR   ...x200)
</span></pre>
<p>Why? For some reason it thinks that this query will return millions of rows. But
one origin id can match at most one article if my data is correct, so 200
filters should only match 0..200 rows. Let's look at <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> to check:</p>
<pre><span>EXPLAIN ANALYZE
 SELECT id, origin_ids
   FROM articles
  WHERE origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}' OR
        origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "654321"}' OR
        ....;   - x200
                        QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on articles  (rows=7805036) (actual rows=200)
   Filter: ((origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}') OR
            (origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "654321"}') OR   ...x200)
</span></pre>
<p>It does indeed return only 200 rows. Hmmm... Let's check one row:</p>
<pre><span>EXPLAIN ANALYZE
 SELECT id, origin_ids
   FROM articles
  WHERE origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}';
                        QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------
 Bitmap Heap Scan on articles  (rows=43038) (actual rows=1)
   Recheck Cond: (origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}')
    -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on  ... (rows=43038) (actual rows=1)
         Index Cond: (origin_ids @&gt; '{"pubmed": "123456"}')
</span></pre>
<p>Supposedly 43 thousand rows for only one filter! And 7.8 million rows are 39
thousand times more than 200, which is pretty close. At the time I fired these
queries we had only 43 million of articles. PostgreSQL <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/planner-stats.html">gathers some
statistics</a> about
values in different columns to be able to produce reasonable query plans, and
looks like it's shooting blanks for this column.</p>
<p>What's the simplest fix? Oftentimes
<a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-analyze.html"><code>ANALYZE</code></a> on a table
is enough to fix broken statistics, but this time it didn't help at
all. Sometimes it's useful to adjust how many rows are analyzed to gather
statistics, and it can be adjusted down to a per-column basis with <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html"><code>ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS</code></a>, but
here it had no effect as well.</p>
<p>Since version 10 PostgreSQL supports <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createstatistics.html"><code>CREATE STATISTICS</code></a>
to gather complex statistics for inter-column dependencies and whatnot, but our
filter is single-column, no luck here as well.</p>
<h2 id="contsel">Contsel<a href="#contsel" aria-label="Anchor link for: contsel">🔗</a></h2>
<p>So I dug some more, and more... And found that operator <code>@&gt;</code> uses something
called <code>contsel</code>. It was mentioned in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/23452.1288288224@sss.pgh.pa.us">PostgreSQL mailing
list</a>
in 2010. I tried to decrypt what <code>contsel</code> means and I think it stands for
"contains selectivity". Then I tried searching PostgreSQL sources for <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/search?q=contsel&amp;unscoped_q=contsel"><code>contsel</code>
mentions</a>
and found exactly <a href="https://github.com/postgres/postgres/blob/master/src/backend/utils/adt/geo_selfuncs.c#L80">one
place</a>
in C code which mentions it:</p>
<pre><span>Datum
contsel(PG_FUNCTION_ARGS)
{
	PG_RETURN_FLOAT8(0.001);
}
</span></pre>
<p>0.001? That looks exactly like the ratio between 43 million rows in the table
and an estimated 43 thousand rows in the result. However, if we just multiply 43
thousand by 200 filters we should get 8.6 million, and PostgreSQL estimated only
7.8M. This discrepancy bothered me for a minute because I like to understand
things completely, so they won't set me up for an unpleasant surprise later<a href="https://vsevolod.net/postgresql-jsonb-index/#note3"><sup id="back3">[3]</sup></a>.</p>
<p>After a minute of contemplating the difference I realized that it's probability
in play - PostgreSQL thinks that every filter can match 0.1% of the total number
of rows and they can overlap. The actual math is:</p>
<pre><span>1 - 0.999 ** 200 = 1 - 0.819 = 0.181
</span></pre>
<p>18.1% of 43 million is 7.8 million (I'm rounding numbers here). Itch scratched
successfully.</p>
<p>And, depending on the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-query.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-QUERY-CONSTANTS">different
costs</a>
of various factors in the config, Postgres will select either sequential scan or
will use an index. Our first solution was to slice these filters into batches
with no more than 150 of them per query. It worked quite well for a couple of
years.</p>
<h2 id="domain-modeling-failure">Domain modeling failure<a href="#domain-modeling-failure" aria-label="Anchor link for: domain-modeling-failure">🔗</a></h2>
<p>Until we learned that one article could have more than one such external
identifier per type. For example, some pre-print services grant new DOI for each
version. <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.11938173.v8">10.26434/chemrxiv.11938173.v8</a>
has eight of them at the time of writing. And then it has the main DOI without
version
<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv.11938173">10.26434/chemrxiv.11938173</a>, and
will have another one if it will be published after peer review. There are other
cases for some other identifier types (we call these types "origin name").</p>
<p>We had two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Store origin ids in a separate table with columns <code>article_id</code>, <code>origin_name</code>
and <code>origin_id</code> with two indexes - one on <code>article_id</code> and the other on
<code>(origin_name, origin_id)</code>;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Accommodate many values per key in <code>jsonb</code>. Two more possible options here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Many values per key: <code>{"doi": ["10.26434/3", "10.26434/3.v1"]}</code></li>
<li>List of pairs: <code>[["doi", "10.26434/3"], ["doi", "10.26434/3.v1"]]</code></li>
</ul>
<p>Both can be queried with <code>@&gt;</code>, but it's getting even more uglier than it was.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We ended up doing kind of both - we created a separate table that's much easier
to query with many origin ids at once, and we store a list of pairs in a
separate non-indexed column so it's convenient to query.</p>
<h2 id="separate-table-speed-up">Separate table speed-up<a href="#separate-table-speed-up" aria-label="Anchor link for: separate-table-speed-up">🔗</a></h2>
<p>As a bonus, it's much-much faster to query a btree index with lots of filters
than a GIN one. With a GIN every <code>@&gt;</code> turns into a separate Bitmap Index Scan
that costs approximately millisecond for each (0.7-1.2 ms each if in
cache). With a btree index on two columns we construct a query that looks like
this:</p>
<pre><span>SELECT article_id FROM articles_origin_ids WHERE
    (origin_name = $1 AND origin_id = ANY($2)) OR
    (origin_name = $3 AND origin_id = ANY($4)) OR
    (origin_name = $5 AND origin_id = ANY($6));
</span></pre>
<p>Accessing a btree index is faster even by itself, I get 0.07 ms for Bitmap Index
Scan node in <code>EXPLAIN ANALYZE</code> for one <code>origin_name</code>, <code>origin_id</code> pair. …</p></section></div>

        <blockquote>
  <p>Now I a fourfold vision see<br> And a fourfold vision is given to me:<br>Tis fourfold in my supreme delight,<br>And threefold in soft Beulah’s night,<br>And twofold Always. May God us keep <br>From Single vision &amp; Newton’s sleep!<br>
— William Blake, A Letter To Thomas Butt, 22 November 1802</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Before the Age of Enlightenment could shroud the body of society in it’s shadow it had to first
decenter man from pre-existing traditional structures of control and understanding of knowledge.
Enter René Descartes who augured in across multiple domains of human thought, a vision of the
natural world that continues to exude a gravitational pull upon modern discourse. This
reconfigured the mystical character of neo-scholastic natural philosophy into one built upon a
budding mechanistic paradigm of his era.</p>

<p>For Descartes his radical notion of doubt was only a detour to a more secure edifice of knowledge
one that Descartes believed resided in the power of the mind to capture and represent reality in a
box. Ironically, or perhaps unironically, reframing the question of what is true to be what one can
be certain of, was a Trojan Horse of a particularly corrosive strain when the object of
interrogation is of the theological character. Considering the political climate Descartes found
himself in it isn’t surprising that it maintains the dogmatic attributes of Christian faith while
simultaneously attempting to render it epistemological.</p>

<p>The cartesian self is built as a function that serves to reason insulated against the swamp waters of
alterity stripped of the relations other than those mediated by divinity. As Oswald Spengler put it, “The symbol of the West is an idea of which no other Culture gives even a hint, the idea of Function” - plotted here in Cartesian coordinates. Reason is an assiduously crafted function that acts as a fort against this ocean It is a fortified boundary, sealing out everything uncertain, irresoluble, a sea-wall much like those built by the Dutch during the 1500s against the unknown. Cloistered within the bounds of such a sea-wall, one is well protected from the existential oceanic despair that exists beyond, a Faustian memorandum of understanding deal with the evil demon that resides beyond these walls. An amphibian stuck on dry land.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>🇫🇷 Si tu souhaites lire cet article en français, je l’ai écris à l’origine <a href="https://www.jesuisundev.com/7-techniques-pour-reprendre-le-controle-de-ton-legacy-code/">en tant qu’article invité sur jesuisundev.com</a>.</em></p><p>Let’s face it: we spend most of our time changing existing code. Usually, we didn’t even write that code in the first place. Often, there’s no test. Sometimes, the authors of the code are long gone! And yet, we have to understand and modify this code – without introducing any bug, thank you.</p><p>You’d love to change any part of the code with confidence… but you never have time! This change has been estimated as a 2-day task and there are many others to ship before the end of the Sprint/demo to the client/delivery/<em>&lt;insert your deadline here<!-- -->&gt;</em>. Nightmare!</p><p>But what if you had a secret weapon? Techniques to approach this Legacy efficiently, reach your goal without getting distracting with all the Technical Debt? You could regain control of this project and make it easier to maintain, each iteration!</p><p>Working on Legacy Code is indeed no fun… but it could be.</p><p>Here are 7 concrete techniques that will help you regain control of your Legacy.</p><h2 id="1-the-brain-dump-🧠"><a href="#1-the-brain-dump-%F0%9F%A7%A0" aria-label="1 the brain dump 🧠 permalink"></a>1. The Brain Dump 🧠</h2><p>Your brain is not optimized to memorize a lot of things. You can only juggle with a limited number of thoughts.</p><p>The problem is: your Legacy is a jungle. It’s full of badly named variables, non-standard structures, useless indirections, bad abstractions… To reach your goal, you need to go through a lot of traps you can’t anticipate. When you move something, you reveal 3 more issues that were hidden behind!</p><p>If you try to juggle with all of these things in your head, you’ll get lost.</p><p>It’s the “I’m almost done on this ticket” effect. You have been repeating that for the past 3 days during stand-up. This usually ends up with Pull Requests that are too long and contain many more changes than expected.</p><p>You need to get these ideas out to not getting lost. The easiest way to do that is <strong>a sheet of paper</strong>.</p><p>Take a sheet and a pencil. Start by dumbing everything you want to do on this code. Write down a TODO list.</p><p>Then, choose a first task and start doing it.</p><p>As you move on this task, you’ll have new ideas. New tasks that you discover. Refactors you want to do. When it happens, don’t do them: <strong>write them down!</strong></p><p><undefined>

Thus, you’ll stop rehashing this idea every 5 minutes and you can focus on the ongoing task!</li><li><strong>You’ll avoid the tunnel effect.</strong> You’ll end what you started before you start something else. You’ll cross off the task that is done, commit, and take a break! You’ll have a clearer vision of your progress instead of a vague feeling of “almost done”.</li></ol><p>If you know <a href="https://gettingthingsdone.com/">the GTD method</a>, this will feel familiar.</p><h2 id="2-the-mikado-method-🥢"><a href="#2-the-mikado-method-%F0%9F%A5%A2" aria-label="2 the mikado method 🥢 permalink"></a>2. The Mikado Method 🥢</h2><p>The Mikado Method is a similar concept than the Brain Dump, but with more structure. It’s perfect when you want to reach a particular goal and you don’t know what will get in your way.</p><p>Here again, you just need a sheet and a pencil.</p><p>Start writing down your main goal. Circle it twice. Then, try to achieve it.</p><p>If you realize you need something else to do this task, do these 2 very important things:</p><ol><li>Cancel your pending changes (<code>git reset --hard</code>)</li><li>Write down the subtask you need to do and link it to the main task.</li></ol><p>Then, start over from the subtask. Iterate if you realize you miss something again.</p><p><undefined>

Commit that, cross off that task, and celebrate internally!</p><p>Then, take another subtask and continue. As you achieve subtasks, you make the main one easier. At some point, doing it will be really easy!</p><p>Just like the Brain Dump, you’ll feel less stressed and you’ll have a better view of your progress. You’ll be able to push intermediate Pull Requests that will progressively make the main goal easier to achieve.</p><p>If you want to learn more, I’ve dedicated <a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/a-process-to-do-safe-changes-in-a-complex-codebase">a full post on this</a> and <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/the-mikado-method">there’s a book on that</a>.</p><h2 id="3-over-committing-"><a href="#3-over-committing-" aria-label="3 over committing  permalink"></a>3. Over-committing ➿</h2><p>When you work on Legacy Code, it’s very easy to get stuck in a position where nothing works anymore and you don’t really know why.</p><p>In this context, I recommend taking a safer approach.</p><p>I mean, if only you had a way to have checkpoints for every single step you take in the right direction! With this, you won’t have to start over again if you do one or two wrong moves. You could just go back to the last checkpoint!</p><p>Well, this is <em>exactly</em> where your version control system excels. Create checkpoints.</p><p>My advice: when you work on Legacy Code, commit very very very often. You should commit more often than you imagine. Here are 2 options:</p><ol><li><strong>Commit every 5 minutes.</strong> That’s easy to do, you only need a timer. Each time it rings, commit and run the timer again.</li><li><strong>If you practice the Mikado Method, commit every subtask you achieve.</strong> The technique is optimized to make you do small changes, therefore it’s perfect for frequent commits.</li></ol><p><undefined>

    </undefined></p><p>It’s OK if your commit messages are messy or duplicated. You can (should) edit them before you push on the shared repository. I frequently create commits that I squash later. Having too many commits will help you more than not having enough.</p><p>Practice this technique and you’ll see the quality of your Pull Requests raise up after a few weeks. But most of all, you’ll have your checkpoints!</p><h2 id="4-adrs-"><a href="#4-adrs-" aria-label="4 adrs  permalink"></a>4. ADRs 📝</h2><p>Sometimes, you’ll hit a very annoying obstacle: lack of context.</p><p>It’s terrible when you don’t know why something is written that way. It makes you face a dilemma: keep the code as it is and work around, or change it and take the risk of breaking something unexpected. At best, this will just take longer to solve. Tracing back to the original decision behind the code you have in front of you feels like archaeology, and it’s not easy!</p><p>Unfortunately, I don’t have a magic spell to generate missing documentation for you. But I still have a technique that will stop your code from bleeding so hard. Here’s an advice that’s more pragmatic than “just write the doc”.</p><p>Meet <strong>Architecture Decision Records</strong> (ADRs).</p><p>Here’s the concept: each time you make a non-trivial decision, write a note about it. The good news is that you don’t really have to maintain this note. It captures the “why” behind your decision like a snapshot. Your future self will thank you for taking 5 extra minutes to write this down!</p><p>Here’s what it looks like:</p><p><undefined>

Explain why you’re going this way instead of another. Describe your constraints, what you know, how things work today, etc. Everything that motivates this decision.</li><li>The decision itself</li><li>Consequences of this decision, good and bad. Maybe this comes with compromise, document them!</li></ol><p>Keep ADRs versioned along with the code. It’s simple, easy to find, and to search when you’re looking for a particular decision.</p><p>Make a habit to write these ADRs. It’s a little investment that quickly pays off. From my experience, that also helps the reviewer of the Pull Request!</p><p>Finally, I’d recommend you use <a href="https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools">the adr-tools CLI</a>. It makes all of this so easy that you won’t have any excuse not to write them.</p><p>If you want to learn more about ADRs, <a href="https://understandlegacycode.com/blog/earn-maintainers-esteem-with-adrs">I wrote a detailed post on this topic</a> too.</p><h2 id="5-approval-testing-"><a href="#5-approval-testing-" aria-label="5 approval testing  permalink"></a>5. Approval Testing ✅</h2><p>This technique feels like a secret weapon.</p><p>This is the fastest way I know to write tests on existing code, so you can refactor it safely.</p><p>You may know it under a different name: Characterization Tests, Golden Master, or Snapshot Tests.</p><p>It comes in 3 main steps:</p><ol><li>📸 Generate an output you can snapshot</li><li>✅ Use test coverage to find all input combinations</li><li>👽 Use mutations to verify your snapshots</li></ol><h3 id="1--generate-an-output-you-can-snapshot"><a href="#1--generate-an-output-you-can-snapshot" aria-label="1  generate an output you can snapshot permalink"></a>1. 📸 Generate an output you can snapshot</h3><p>The first step is also the most complex. Generate a text you can write in some file: this will be your snapshot.</p><p>If the code you’re testing returns a value, you already have it. Otherwise, you’ll likely need to intercept calls made in your code to log the parameters that are given… A different approach is to introduce logs in your code.</p><p>Here’s an example using the Jest library, in JavaScript:</p><pre data-language="js"><code><span><span>it</span><span>(</span><span>"should update quality"</span><span>, () </span><span>=&gt;</span><span> {</span></span>
<span><span>  </span><span>expect</span><span>(</span><span>updateQuality</span><span>(</span><span>"foo"</span><span>, </span><span>0</span><span>, </span><span>0</span><span>)).</span><span>toMatchSnapshot</span><span>()</span></span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><header><img src="https://blog.teller.io/images/authors/stevegraham.jpg"></header><p>As you may or may not know, banks do not generally provide third party developers with API access. This is because providing developers with easy API access to customer accounts means actual competition and ultimately compressed margins. In fairness to banks, building a new API channel costs a lot of money and if all it does is increase competitive pressure why would you spend any time or money on it? It's a rational response given their incentives.</p>

<p>Despite this people still want to connect their bank accounts to services they trust, and companies still want to build those services.</p>

<p>So, where does this leave us? Thankfully the market has stepped in to provide solutions that enable us all to connect trusted apps with our financial accounts, despite this banks still actively block third party access by blocking their traffic.</p>

<h2 id="all-ip-addresses-are-not-created-equal">All IP addresses are not created equal</h2>

<p>The way we have solved this is to route our financial institution traffic onto the public internet via mobile phone carrier networks.</p>

<p>The great thing about carrier IP ranges is that carriers have significantly more customers than they have IP addresses, meaning public internet breakout is heavily <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_address_translation">NAT</a>-ed, i.e. a single address is shared and used by many customers simultaneously. The other great thing is there is good chance you're on mobile data when you use your bank's mobile app and your IP address is in the carrier’s IP range.</p>

<p>By sending our traffic onto the internet using the same IP addresses shared by millions of a bank’s own customers using the bank’s mobile app, we both make it significantly more difficult to identify and subsequently block our traffic and we also increase the collateral damage of any hostile action a bank might take against us and our users, i.e. erroneously blocking their own customers using their mobile banking app.</p>

<p>Until recently we used a third party provider for mobile carrier network transit, but suddenly without warning their performance and availabilty degraded to unacceptable levels. Requests occasionally took 20-30 seconds to complete. A single Teller API transaction might actually involve several requests to the financial institution, and even if we can parallelize some of these it's a disaster for us if any of them take 30 seconds.</p>

<p>Teller provides live access to financial accounts. <strong>When you request an account balance, Teller synchronously fetches that data live from the financial institition and returns it to you</strong>. Fast and reliable network access is an absolute must in order for us to provide that level of access. Other providers can get away with lesser network performance because they don't actually ever return live data in an API call. They periodically poll the institution a couple of times a day, and give you the most recent data they have when you make your API call.</p>

<p>We immediately began to design and build an in house solution to solve this problem once and for all.</p>

<h2 id="introducing-telnet">Introducing Telnet</h2>

<p>Telnet is our propietary mobile carrier proxy network. The name is a portmanteau of Teller Network, but if we're honest it began as an internal joke as it's built on top of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Secure_Shell">SSH</a>, the remote access protocol that obsoleted the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telnet">Telnet</a>.</p>

<p>Telnet is composed of a large number of edge nodes, which are single board Linux computers with LTE modems attached running our own software written using <a href="https://www.nerves-project.org/">Nerves</a>. When nodes boot they reverse SSH into our network and register themselves as available to route API traffic. Our infrastructure then routes our financial institution traffic via our Telnet edge nodes, egressing onto the internet on carrier IP ranges.</p>

<p><strong>It works amazingly well</strong>. We have not only cut the latency overhead to the bone, according to our logs requests failing due to proxy errors have become a thing of the past too.</p>

<p>Credit goes to the team for shipping this so quickly. They went from bare git repo to production deployment of a fleet of embedded devices with OTA software updates in weeks. I'm very proud of them.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
				
				<p>We support many of our clients to bring clarity to their customer communications.</p>
<p>This includes creating quick start guides and other types of product documentation. Although our clients’ products and services are often very different, their objectives are usually similar and based on supporting customers or improving understanding.</p>
<p>We first need to find out how an installation or onboarding process is intended to work and how it currently does so for the client. We do this through initial research, often assessing existing materials and observing people as they work through specific tasks such as installing or upgrading a new product. This could be one of our own team or someone from the client.</p>
<p>When working on quick start guides, observing participants using the products and supporting materials is essential to provide the best user experience possible. This research method is incredibly useful in understanding challenges, gathering insights and testing potential solutions.</p>
<p>Observation sessions help identify strengths and weaknesses of a product or service through one-on-one sessions where a ‘real-life’ user performs tasks and is observed.</p>
<p>Sessions can be conducted with an existing product or service or, if this is not available, a prototype and associated materials. They can take place in either a controlled or natural environment. Natural environments are preferred as they generally produce more realistic results. This activity helps clarify the user experience, including overarching goals and the steps that users take to achieve them.</p>
<p>In this article, we’ve outlined the key stages of the process we use for observation research and included some tips based on our experience of planning and conducting this method of research.</p>
<p>Define objectives</p>
<p>This first stage is always a collaborative approach involving the relevant stakeholders. The first task we complete is agreeing the objectives with the client in order to outline what we are looking to achieve in the project. Defining the number of sessions for the activity is our next step. We’ve found the minimum observation sessions needed to generate valuable results and actionable insights is six.</p>
<p>Another task we complete in this stage is agreeing who is responsible for recruitment. This is often done internally with the client, however, in some cases we have considered an external research recruitment agency. In order to allow enough time for users to find a suitable slot, recruitment begins at least 2 weeks before sessions are due to take place.</p>
<p>Lastly for this stage, we confirm where the sessions will take place. The ideal location is the participant’s home so they feel most comfortable. This isn’t always possible and in your observation research you may find that you need to book a testing environment.</p>
<p>Participants are often required to provide a fair amount of time and effort so incentives are likely to be needed to encourage their attendance.</p>
<p>Write the list of tasks</p>
<p>After completing those steps, we propose the initial list of tasks for the observation session and review this with our client in order to ensure it covers everything. This is compared to the objectives of the session and this activity should be done at least a week or so before the testing is scheduled to allow enough time for feedback and revisions.</p>
<p>The participant should be asked to complete a set of tasks relevant to the product or service, with post-task questions used to assess their views on the activity. Tasks should include any relevant context required, particularly if the participant is unfamiliar with the product.</p>
<p>For the post-task questions consider including ratings and other quantifiable questions to enhance reporting on the research as a whole.&nbsp;We’ve found it’s important to conduct internal practice sessions to check the validity of the tasks and expected run-time before finalising the script and tasks.</p>
<p>Conduct the sessions</p>
<p>Observing users is a skill that improves as you complete more sessions. It’s important to set the tasks for the session and let the participant work through them independently, or as closely to how they would complete these on their own. A notepad and pen are the most important tools we take into these sessions as they allow you to quietly take notes. The noise of tapping on a keyboard when something happens can be distracting and influence the participant!</p>
<p>We start the session with a friendly introduction, small talk to put the participant at ease and an explanation of the purpose of the research. Sessions are structured by the tasks outlined to the participant at this stage. Questions are only asked about the process they completed after these tasks are finished.</p>
<p>As an observer, it is crucial that we attend sessions in-person, but we have to remember never to guide, facilitate or otherwise influence the process that the user is completing. In some circumstances, interaction may be required, particularly at points of failure in the tasks or where prototypes do not yet contain full functionality. These moments should be noted.</p>
<p>As one of our best practices, we record the audio and video of the session for future reference. The audio and video are then something we can return to for reporting, along with the comprehensive set of observer notes.</p>
<p>Report on the findings</p>
<p>For any research we complete, the report is how findings are communicated to the majority of client stakeholders. We consider the purpose of the research and write the report based on answering those key objectives outlined in stage 1. We like to write our key themes with a descriptive title and a short detailed explanation to show the breadth of the user experience.</p>
<p>The report details the activity, covering observations and the major themes that were identified through the process. We also include a summary of each participant’s responses to the rating questions that are often asked at the end, as well as any quotes or specific insights. A summary of each user’s profile may also be provided, if the participants were selected according to specific characteristics.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello to <em>Nagger in Reddit</em>, it’s like LWIAY but for devs and not with its own group. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaredevelopment/comments/cxfuh4/what_is_the_worst_behaviour_you_observed_while/">Nine months ago I asked you</a>: What is the worst workplace behaviour you observed while helping someone at work? And the replies were quite interesting. First, I had to deal with trolls that instantly downvoted my post. Not only that but their comments clearly reflected they did not bother reading the question. Let alone the description that expends it. After making them realised they removed their comments while the community shared some experiences. Let’s jump into it!</p><h2>The overseas Russian doll switcharoo</h2><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaredevelopment/comments/cxfuh4/what_is_the_worst_behaviour_you_observed_while/eykxere">Card</a></p><p>That one doesn’t count that much but I found it interesting enough to share here. I find insane that this contractor did not even bother checking commit history. Commit history that ends up being his downfall, ModeratePal definitely did the right thing by bringing this up to his manager. When you hire someone you don’t want to pay for an overseas developer’s work. First, it’s unfair for that overseas guy but the hiree is paid for doing nothing. Also, if that overseas dev is good, bring him in not the fraud paying him.</p><h2>Overwatch, underwhelming code</h2><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaredevelopment/comments/cxfuh4/what_is_the_worst_behaviour_you_observed_while/eylkev7">Card</a></p><p>That Overwatch guy feeds the engine that makes it harder for people to work from home. Yet the story is about him in an office. If that’s the face he shows while pair programming I can’t imagine what he does when out of sight. That’s exactly what any manager, well person for that matter would think. And they would be right to worry considering the poor result he yields.</p><p>Another thing that grinds my gears here is the blame on not having time to finish work while watching streams. Even though there could be a genuine time issue he makes things harder for himself and his colleagues. How can you go and complain to a manager you don’t have enough time to work after a coworker gets sacked for watching streams? You can’t, or not before a replacement comes in and undeniably struggles time for stories.</p><h2>Wrapping up</h2><p>Thanks for reading this first of <em>Nagger in Reddit</em>. Hopefully, you enjoyed it and will share it with your friends and family. If you want to read the other replies feel free to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/softwaredevelopment/comments/cxfuh4/what_is_the_worst_behaviour_you_observed_while/">have a look</a>. If you want to read some guidance to build a helpful workplace by providing helpful code reviews check out <a href="https://www.codingnagger.com/2017/08/11/helpful-pull-request-reviews/">this post</a>.</p><p>Did you enjoy reading about others’ worst workplace behaviour witnessed? What should I tackle next? Let me know if you want more, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://twitter.com/CodingNagger" target="_blank">tweet at me</a>, intervene when I post on Reddit and so on. See you next time!</p><p><em>Cover by&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/@olly?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Andrea Piacquadio</a></strong>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/mad-formal-executive-man-yelling-at-camera-3760790/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Pexels</a></strong></em></p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Learn how to leverage integromat and other tools to build an HTTP API that could be integrated with thousands of different applications and platforms</p><div><p>Think about this:</p><p><strong>How do you retrieve information from computer?</strong></p><p>Take this scenario - you have navigated to your favourite news site or subreddit to procrastinate for a while on that thing you really <strong>should</strong> be doing. In doing so, how often do you think about <em>how</em> the website appeared on your screen? Where do those cat memes on your screen actually come from?</p><p>Humans and computers comprehend data very differently. We as humans can read words on a screen, or process the experiences presented to us in the form of websites, applications and command line interfaces. We can make assumptions about things that we see, based on our previous experiences and memories.</p><p>Computers, on the other hand, cannot. They process numbers at their lowest level. Based on the sequences of numbers, the computer will perform a specific set of tasks. This makes computers extremely good at repetitive tasks that would be either very tedious or very difficult for a human to do as quickly and as consistently as a computer can.</p><p>There are a a lot of intermediate steps that occur between the purely logical, number crunching power of your computers internals and the beautiful, highly immersive visual experiences that modern technology allows us to enjoy today. How does the computer perform its work and tell us what we want to know in a format <em>we</em> understand?</p><p>A website making it from a web server to your eyeballs is not possible without an <strong>Application Programming Interface</strong> (API).  APIs are how your computer interacts with data and are the foundations on which a majority of the modern web is built. An API is a simplified interface allowing a developer to integrate their program with another existing one. You could think of an API as a book that only your computer knows how to read from or write in.</p><p><img src="https://www.martinmck.com/images/daria-nepriakhina-xY55bL5mZAM-unsplash.jpg"></p><p>Some simple examples:</p><ul><li>When you visit your favourite news site, you get the latest news stories from that sites API.</li><li>You can build an app that sends email by using the gmail API.</li><li>You can sign in to many websites with just your facebook account by using the facebook authentication API</li></ul><p>APIs generally define a contract which details the operations the application that uses the API can and cannot do. Staying with the book analogy above, this would mean certain books only let you write specific words in them, in a specific language. This helps prevent bad actors from doing rather annoying things such as abusing your API and potentially crashing your server, or getting access to your data.</p><p>With hundreds of thousands of APIs available and thousands more being created every day, thereâ€™s really no escaping APIs when you are building software. Most applications are enhanced a great deal when they are integrated with others. This is true regardless of whether you are building applications with code or no-code tools.</p><p>To build an API <em>with</em> code, you generally need knowledge around the following software development topics:</p><ul><li>Server side programming languages (Python, Ruby, Java, NodeJS etc.)</li><li>Databases</li><li>HTTP (the protocol that powers the internet by allowing communication between web browsers and web servers)</li><li>Infrastructure and deployment - getting your code to run on a public server so other people can use it</li></ul><p>There are many tools that make the above much easier, but thereâ€™s still a lot to learn if you just want to a simple API that works for you.</p><p>In this post, we are going to build our very own web API <em>without</em> any code at all. </p><p>In a time where <a href="https://a16z.com/2011/08/20/why-software-is-eating-the-world/" title="Software is eating the world">software is eating the world</a>, itâ€™s increasingly important to understand the concepts behind the devices and technology that you are likely to use for a large portion of your day. Being able to explore technical topics without learning programming is a very powerful for anyone with interest in how the world around them works.</p><p>Letâ€™s get into it.</p><h2>Our Tools</h2><p>We are going to use 3 tools in this tutorial:</p><ul><li><strong>Integromat</strong> - an automation platform that lets us glue different applications together without code</li><li><strong>Postman</strong> - an API testing tool. We are going to use this to interact with our API</li><li><strong>Google Sheets</strong> - We are going to use google sheets as our â€œdatabaseâ€�. This is where the data sent to our API will be stored.</li></ul><h2>Our API</h2><p>We are going to use the slightly contrived example of building an HTTP API allowing people to vote for places to go for lunch near the office. We want consumers of the API to be able to register their vote for a particular lunch spot near the office. This will increment the count of a particular lunch spot by one. </p><h3>Setting Up Our Google Sheet</h3><p>First of all we need to create a google sheet. Nothing particularly challenging here. Just go to google sheets and create a blank spreadsheet. Letâ€™s call it â€œLunch Voterâ€�.</p><p><img src="https://www.martinmck.com/images/Screenshot%202020-06-20%20at%2013.43.20.png"></p><h3>Integromat</h3><p>We now have our â€œdatabaseâ€� set up. Letâ€™s create our actual API now to interact with it. First of all, you will need to <a href="https://www.integromat.com/en/register" title="create an integromat account">create an integromat account</a> to get started.</p><p>Integromat is billed as the â€œglue of the internetâ€� and for good reason. It allows you to connect well over 200+ different applications with each other. For example if you want to automatically save gmail attachments to your dropbox account, or send you zoom links directly via WhatsApp for an upcoming calendar meeting, Integromat is your friend. </p><p>The above example are some of the simplest things you could possibly do with integromat - you can automate almost anything with the platform.</p><p><img src="https://www.martinmck.com/images/Screenshot%202020-06-20%20at%2013.48.26.png"></p><h4>Creating an Integromat Scenario</h4><p>Integromat uses a very intuitive flowchart structure for you to define your workflows or â€œscenariosâ€� as they are known. Letâ€™s create a new scenario for our lunch voter API by Navigating to the integromat dashboard and clicking the â€œCreate a new scenarioâ€� button. </p><p>You will be taken to a page allowing you to select integrations you want to use. This step is optional, as we will have access to all the integrations that we need when we get into the integromat builder. Letâ€™s click â€œskipâ€� for now.</p><p><img src="https://www.martinmck.com/images/Screenshot%202020-06-20%20at%2013.56.53.png"></p><p>You will then be presented with the integromat scenario builder. This is where we configure and edit our scenario. Before we build anything, itâ€™s always important to outline the steps we plan to take before we execute. For our lunch voter API, we want to:</p><ul><li>Allow someone to interact with our API telling us the name of the restaurant they want to upvote</li><li>If it doesnâ€™t exist, create a new row in our spreadsheet</li><li>If it exists, update itâ€™s vote count by 1</li></ul><p>Letâ€™s focus on the first item, and provide a way for people to interact with our API. The way we do that is through a <strong>webhook</strong>, which is at its core a way to let applications notify each other of events over the internet. </p><p>Letâ€™s build one.</p><h3>Creating a Webhook</h3><p>To create a Webhook in integromat, click the first module (with the large question mark) and you will see a menu to select an integration. Search for â€œWebhooksâ€� and select it and you will see the options for your webhook. Select â€œCustom Webhookâ€�.</p><p><img src="https://www.martinmck.com/images/Screenshot%202020-06-20%20at%2014.09.36.png"></p><p>Click â€œAddâ€� to add a new webhook. We are going to call ours â€œLunch Voter Webhookâ€�.</p><p><img src="https://www.martinmck.com/images/Screenshot%202020-06-20%20at%2014.10.04.png"></p><p>Click save and you will see a URL. This is how we will talk to our API. Copy this URL to your clipboard by clicking â€œCopy address to clipboardâ€�. </p><p><img src="https://www.martinmck.com/images/Screenshot%202020-06-20%20at%2014.10.43.png"></p><h3>Testing the Webhook</h3><p>We now have an API to interact with, but it isnâ€™t very useful yet. We need to tell the webhook what our data will â€œlook likeâ€� so itâ€™s able to understand when we interact with it.</p><p><img src="https://www.martinmck.com/images/Screenshot%202020-06-20%20at%2014.21.14.png"></p><p>The webhook is now waiting for you to interact with it. We do this by making an HTTP request to that URL. For context, an HTTP request is what happens when you visit a website. Your browser makes an HTTP request for google.com when you try to navigate there, for instance. </p><p>We are going to use a tool called Postman to make our HTTP request. You can download it <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/" title="Download Postman">here</a>.  Open up postman and create a new request then paste in the URL you copied earlier from your webhook in integromat. Change the dropdown beside your URL from <strong>GET</strong> to <strong>POST</strong>.  Finally: </p><ul><li>click the â€œBodyâ€� tab</li><li>click the â€œrawâ€� option</li><li>Select â€œJSONâ€� from the dropdown on the right</li><li>paste in the following to the large textarea:</li></ul><pre><code>{
  "restaurant": "My Favourite Restaurant"
}
</code></pre><p>Your Postman Screen should look something like this:</p><p><img src="https://www.martinmck.com/images/Screenshot%202020-06-20%20at%2015.25.40.png"></p><p>Click the blue â€œSendâ€� button to send your HTTP request and interact with your integromat webhook.</p><p>Back in integromat, you will see a message telling you that the shape of your data has been successfully determined. Letâ€™s store it in our spreadsheet!</p><h3>Google Sheets</h3><p>In order to update our google sheet, we need to check whether or not a row for the restaurant already exists before either updating the vote count by one or creating a new row. Hereâ€™s a reminder of our steps to save you scrolling:</p><ul><li>Check if a row exists with the restaurant name we sent in our JSON data</li><li>If it doesnâ€™t exist, create a new row in our spreadsheet</li><li>If it exists, update that restaurants vote count by 1</li></ul><h4>Searching For An Existing Row</h4><p>Letâ€™s set up the google sheets module in integromat to search for a row. Click your webhook module and click the plus button to creae a new module in your integromat scenario. </p><ul><li>Search for â€œgoogle sheetsâ€� in the search bar, click it </li><li>Select the â€œSearch Rowsâ€� module.</li></ul><p><img src="https://www.martinmck.com/images/Screenshot%202020-06-20%20at%2021.52.04.png"></p><p>To configure your search rows module, you need to authenticate integromat with your google account by adding your google account connection. Once you have done that, then select your Lunch Voter spreadsheet and sheet.</p><p>Finally, set up your filter. This is how integromat will search your google sheet to check if a restaurant already exists. We want to check if any value in column <strong>A</strong> matches the data we are passing to our API. Your module setup should look like the following:</p><p><img src="https://www.martinmck.com/images/Screenshot%202020-06-20%20at%2021.05.59.png"></p><p>Click OK when done.</p><h4>If This, Then That</h4><p>Now to move on to the next step, which is to perform one action if the restaurant exists, or another if it doesnâ€™t. In order to do that in integromat, we must use a <strong>router</strong>. A router is basically a fork in the road, where you can perform 2 different actions …</p></div></div>

				<p>There are 3 common themes in private market fundraising: </p><p>VC's are easy to find. <br>Angel Investors self identify. <br>Family offices want to be left alone.</p><p>A VC will only select a handful of startups from the hundreds of meetings they take. In order to generate that interest, they need to be well known to LP's, startups, and entrepreneurs.</p><p>Angel investors can come from within your network, or as an introduction from a VC/Business connection. Lawyers usually know a few. Their status as an investor depends on their liquid capital at hand. </p><p>A family office looks at long term wealth preservation. A founder with a bright new idea but no business model, track record or money, is seen as a risk. FO's with a mandate for growth will commonly contribute to Venture Capital <u>funds</u>. This way there is no need for extra manpower or an expensive in-house VC. There is significantly less risk, and it is easier to have a VC partner with a track record and network that you can pay in management and performance fees.</p><hr><h2 id="the-hunt">The Hunt</h2><p>Your startup needs money? The most logical place to start is to tap into your immediate, local network. &nbsp;Once you've looked at your inner circle, branch out a layer. All of the information available in the public domain is your best aid.</p><p><strong>The Tools</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://www.google.com/">Google</a>, <a href="https://www.bing.com/">Bing</a> (you should be comfortable using search parameters*)</li><li><a href="https://www.google.com/maps">Google Maps</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/">Crunchbase</a></li><li>Municipal or National Business Registry Data </li><li>Conference Profiles</li><li>Publications</li><li><a href="https://opencorporates.com/">OpenCorporates</a></li><li>Media</li><li>Investment Directory Websites</li></ul><p><a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/google-advanced-search-operators/">Google Search Parameters</a>, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/ultimate-bing-guide">Bing Search Parameters</a></p><p><strong>Research Before You Approach</strong></p><p>Know the investment background of the company. You will be ignored if you approach an organization outside of their targeted mandate (a company focused on investing in battery tech will not invest in your SaaS for video conferencing). </p><p>The more you know about them, the easier it will be pitching and convincing them that your company is a sound place to park and multiply cash. </p><hr><p><strong>Finding a VC</strong></p><p>Google</p><p>It's as easy as a quick Google. </p><p>Search Terms:</p><ul><li>"City" + "Venture Capital"</li><li>"Continent"/"Country" + "Venture Capital"</li></ul><p><em>Example Results: Boston Venture Capital groups</em></p><figure><img src="https://www.readevergreen.com/content/images/2020/06/Annotation-2020-06-23-183638.png" alt="" srcset="https://www.readevergreen.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Annotation-2020-06-23-183638.png 600w, https://www.readevergreen.com/content/images/size/w786/2020/06/Annotation-2020-06-23-183638.png 786w"></figure><hr><p><strong>LinkedIn</strong></p><p>Follow the same principles as a google search. Except, now you are building a view of who works at the firm. Peel back another layer of the onion. Look past the website and learn about the people.</p><p><strong>Questions to ask yourself:</strong></p><ul><li>What is their investment theme and size? How much are you looking to raise?</li><li>Why are you interesting? What makes your company special?</li><li>Of the VC firms you've found, what successful exits have they had?</li><li>Who are their partners? Who are their LP's?</li><li>Who is an associate that would look at your company? </li><li>Who is a partner that would look at your company?</li><li>Is the size you need to raise within their target? </li><li>What languages do they speak? </li><li>Do they have further social media accounts?</li><li>Is there a known connection you can leverage?</li></ul><p>Take the time to read about their profiles, backgrounds, history, languages. Get to know the people who make executive decisions within the company. Look at some of their investments, what do they say about their focus?</p><hr><p><strong>Finding Family Offices</strong></p><p>Search Parameters:</p><ul><li>"Single family office" AND "City"</li><li>"Single family office" AND "Country"</li><li>"Multi family office" AND "City"</li><li>"Multi family office" AND "Country"</li><li>"family office" AND "City"</li><li>"family office" AND "Country"</li><li>"private investment office" AND "City"</li><li>"private investment office" AND "Country"</li><li>"family holding" AND "City"</li><li>"family holding" AND "Country"</li><li>"investment holding" AND "City"</li><li>"investment holding" AND "Country"</li><li>"investment" AND "City" AND "family office"</li><li>"investment" AND "Country" AND "family office"</li><li>"wealthyFamilyLastName" + "Capital"</li></ul><p>These are just some examples to get you started. It can be extremely difficult to find any information. The website of an SFO is usually not designed to pull in lots of traffic. Be creative and think about how a wealthy family would identify themselves. The lengths many go to, to hide their names from public knowledge. Many family offices will only have the name of a primary signatory, which in some cases could be a Corporate Director, or CEO of the FO. <br>If VC related, it would be good to add "Venture", "VC", or "Venture Capital" into your search parameters for better, more specific results.</p><p>You can repeat the following search for LinkedIn, although without heavy parameter use.</p><p><em>Example Result: "Single Family Office" AND "Chicago"</em></p><figure><img src="https://www.readevergreen.com/content/images/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-21-at-14.19.47.png" alt="https://hobanfamilyoffice.com/direct-investments/" srcset="https://www.readevergreen.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-21-at-14.19.47.png 600w, https://www.readevergreen.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-21-at-14.19.47.png 1000w, https://www.readevergreen.com/content/images/size/w1502/2020/06/Screen-Shot-2020-06-21-at-14.19.47.png 1502w"><figcaption>Hoban Family Office, Coast Equity Partner website</figcaption></figure><hr><p><strong>Finding an Angel Investor</strong></p><p>In some cases, the search for an angel investor can come to you. Angel's often have a good ear for investment opportunities. He or She listens for rumors that float into their network. Tell friend &amp; family, share on social networks.

Much to your surprise, if this news is captivating you will find yourself with opportunity knocking on your door.</p><p>Business Angels can often be found through the following:</p><ul><li>Networking Events</li><li>3rd party connections (friends and family +)</li><li>Local "Business Angel Groups"</li><li>Self Identifying Websites/LinkedIn</li></ul><hr><p><strong>Public Business Registry Information</strong></p><p>In the U.K., as well as many other countries there is a national business registry. Made to provide transparency to their economy on who owns what businesses. This is a fantastic starting point to continue doing further research.

Today in 2020, it is less so. Billionaires and UHNWI try to mask their investments and hide them from the public eye, or regulators for tax reasons. If you look at wealth management conferences and read through speaker or panelist profiles, you can sometimes see that an individual is the CIO for "ExampleCapital". Companies like these are commonly vehicles or investment offices for wealthy people. </p><hr><p>Enjoyed this article?

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, I was scheduled to take a trip from New York (JFK) to Los Angeles on JetBlue. Every year, my family goes on a one-week pilgrimage, where we put our work on hold and spend time visiting temples, praying, and spending time with family and friends. To my Jewish friends, I often explain this trip as vaguely similar to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabbath" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sabbath</a>, except we take one week of rest per year, rather than one day per week.</p>
<p>Our family is not Muslim, but by coincidence, this year, our trip happened to be during the last week of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramadan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ramadan</a>.</p>
<p>By further coincidence, this was <em>also</em> the same week that I was moving out of my employer-provided temporary housing (at NYU) and moving into my new apartment. The night before my trip, I enlisted the help of two friends and we took most of my belongings, in a couple of suitcases, to my new apartment. The apartment was almost completely unfurnished – I planned on getting new furniture upon my return – so I dropped my few bags (one containing an air mattress) in the corner. Even though I hadn’t decorated the apartment yet, in accordance with Hindu custom, I taped a single photograph to the wall in my bedroom — a long-haired saint with his hands outstretched in <em><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=pronam&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fR8WUre0GIG28wSH94DwCw&amp;ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&amp;biw=1046&amp;bih=733" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pronam</a></em> (a sign of reverence and respect).</p>
<p>The next morning, I packed the rest of my clothes into a suitcase and took a cab to the airport. I didn’t bother to eat breakfast, figuring I would grab some yogurt in the terminal while waiting to board.</p>
<p>I got in line for security at the airport and handed the agent my ID. Another agent came over and handed me a paper slip, which he said was being used to track the length of the security lines. He said, “just hand this to someone when your stuff goes through the x-ray machines, and we’ll know how long you were in line.’ I looked at the timestamp on the paper: 10:40.</p>
<p>When going through the security line, I opted out (as I always used to) of the millimeter wave detectors. I fly often enough, and have opted out often enough, that I was prepared for what comes next: a firm pat-down by a TSA employee wearing non-latex gloves, who uses the back of his hand when patting down the inside of the thighs.</p>
<p>After the pat-down, the TSA agent swabbed his hands with some cotton-like material and put the swab in the machine that supposedly checks for explosive residue. The machine beeped. “We’re going to need to pat you down again, this time in private,” the agent said.</p>
<p>Having been selected before for so-called “random” checks, I assumed that this was another such check.</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘in private’? Can’t we just do this out here?”</p>
<p>“No, this is a different kind of pat-down, and we can’t do that in public.” When I asked him why this pat-down was different, he wouldn’t tell me. When I asked him specifically why he couldn’t do it in public, he said “Because it would be obscene.”</p>
<p>Naturally, I balked at the thought of going somewhere behind closed doors where a person I just met was going to touch me in “obscene” ways. I didn’t know at the time (and the agent never bothered to tell me) that the TSA has a policy that requires two agents to be present during every private pat-down. I’m not sure if that would make me feel more or less comfortable.</p>
<p>Noticing my hesitation, the agent offered to have his supervisor explain the procedure in more detail. He brought over his supervisor, a rather harried man who, instead of explaining the pat-down to me, rather rudely explained to me that I could either submit immediately to a pat-down behind closed-doors, or he could call the police.</p>
<p>At this point, I didn’t mind having to leave the secure area and go back through security again (this time not opting out of the machines), but I didn’t particularly want to get the cops involved. I told him, “Okay, fine, I’ll leave”.</p>
<p>“You can’t leave here.”</p>
<p>“Are you detaining me, then?” I’ve been through enough “<a href="https://www.flexyourrights.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know your rights</a>” training to know how to handle police searches; however, TSA agents are not law enforcement officials. Technically, they don’t even have the right to detain you against your will.</p>
<p>“We’re not detaining you. You just can’t leave.” My jaw dropped.</p>
<p>“Either you’re detaining me, or I’m free to go. Which one is it?” I asked.</p>
<p>He glanced for a moment at my backpack, then snatched it out of the conveyor belt. “Okay,” he said. “You can leave, but I’m keeping your bag.”</p>
<p>I was speechless. My bag had both my work computer and my personal computer in it. The only way for me to get it back from him would be to snatch it back, at which point he could simply claim that I had assaulted him. I was trapped.</p>
<p>While we waited for the police to arrive, I took my phone and quickly tried to call my parents to let them know what was happening. Unfortunately, my mom’s voicemail was full, and my dad had never even set his up.</p>
<p>“Hey, what’s he doing?” One of the TSA agents had noticed I was touching my phone.<br>
“It’s probably fine; he’s leaving anyway,” another said.</p>
<p>The cops arrived a few minutes later, spoke with the TSA agents for a moment, and then came over and gave me one last chance to submit to the private examination. “Otherwise, we have to escort you out of the building.” I asked him if he could be present while the TSA agent was patting me down.</p>
<p>“No,” he explained, “because when we pat people down, it’s to lock them up.”</p>
<p>I only realized the significance of that explanation later. At this point, I didn’t particularly want to miss my flight. Foolishly, I said, “Fine, I’ll do it.”</p>
<p>The TSA agents and police escorted me to a holding room, where they patted me down again – this time using the front of their hands as they passed down the front of my pants. While they patted me down, they asked me some basic questions.</p>
<p>“What’s the purpose of your travel?”</p>
<p>“Personal,” I responded, (as opposed to business).</p>
<p>“Are you traveling with anybody?”</p>
<p>“My parents are on their way to LA right now; I’m meeting them there.”</p>
<p>“How long is your trip?”</p>
<p>“Ten days.”</p>
<p>“What will you be doing?”</p>
<p>Mentally, I sighed. There wasn’t any other way I could answer this next question.</p>
<p>“We’ll be visiting some temples.” He raised his eyebrow, and I explained that the next week was a religious holiday, and that I was traveling to LA to observe it with my family.</p>
<p>After patting me down, they swabbed not only their hands, but also my backpack, shoes, wallet, and belongings, and then walked out of the room to put it through the machine again. After more than five minutes, I started to wonder why they hadn’t said anything, so I asked the police officer who was guarding the door. He called over the TSA agent, who told me,</p>
<p>“You’re still setting off the alarm. We need to call the explosives specialist”.</p>
<p>I waited for about ten minutes before the specialist showed up. He walked in without a word, grabbed the bins with my possessions, and started to leave. Unlike the other agents I’d seen, he wasn’t wearing a uniform, so I was a bit taken aback.</p>
<p>“What’s happening?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m running it through the x-ray again,” he snapped. “Because I can. And I’m going to do it again, and again, until I decide I’m done”. He then asked the TSA agents whether they had patted me down. They said they had, and he just said, “Well, try again”, and left the room. Again I was told to stand with my legs apart and my hands extended horizontally while they patted me down all over before stepping outside.</p>
<p>The explosives specialist walked back into the room and asked me why my clothes were testing positive for explosives. I told him, quite truthfully, “I don’t know.” He asked me what I had done earlier in the day.</p>
<p>“Well, I had to pack my suitcase, and also clean my apartment.”</p>
<p>“And yesterday?”</p>
<p>“I moved my stuff from my old apartment to my new one”.</p>
<p>“What did you eat this morning?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” I said. Only later did I realize that this made it sound like I was fasting, when in reality, I just hadn’t had breakfast yet.</p>
<p>“Are you taking any medications?”</p>
<p>The other TSA agents stood and listened while the explosives specialist and asked every medication I had taken “recently”, both prescription and over-the-counter, and asked me to explain any medical conditions for which any prescription medicine had been prescribed. Even though I wasn’t carrying any medication on me, he still asked for my complete “recent” medical history.</p>
<p>“What have you touched that would cause you to test positive for certain explosives?”</p>
<p>“I can’t think of anything. What does it say is triggering the alarm?” I asked.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to tell you! It’s right here on my sheet, but I don’t have to tell you what it is!” he exclaimed, pointing at his clipboard.</p>
<p>I was at a loss for words. The first thing that came to my mind was, “Well, I haven’t touched any explosives, but if I don’t even know what chemical we’re talking about, I don’t know how to figure out why the tests are picking it up.”</p>
<p>He didn’t like this answer, so he told them to run my belongings through the x-ray machine and pat me down again, then left the room.</p>
<p>I glanced at my watch. Boarding would start in fifteen minutes, and I hadn’t even had anything to eat. A TSA officer in the room noticed me craning my neck to look at my watch on the table, and he said, “Don’t worry, they’ll hold the flight.”</p>
<p>As they patted me down for the fourth time, a female TSA agent asked me for my baggage claim ticket. I handed it to her, and she told me that a woman from JetBlue corporate security needed to ask me some questions as well. I was a bit surprised, but agreed. After the pat-down, the JetBlue representative walked in and cooly introduced herself by name.</p>
<p>She explained, “We have some questions for you to determine whether or not you’re permitted to fly today. Have you flown on JetBlue before?”</p>
<p>“Yes”</p>
<p>“How often?”</p>
<p>“Maybe about ten times,” I guessed.</p>
<p>“Ten what? Per month?”</p>
<p>“No, ten times total.”</p>
<p>She paused, then asked,</p>
<p>“Will you have any trouble following the instructions of the crew and flight attendants on board the flight?”</p>

The release of custom Apple chips, powered by ARM, comes after a long history of using Intel-based chips, for the greater part of the 21st century.</p><p id="0fc0">Modeled after Apple’s use of its own chips on the iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, the company is switching to its own chips to give the Mac more performance per watt and better GPU performance.</p><p id="ecaf">Though we won’t go in-depth into the specific implications for machine learning, there’s a lot to be excited about when it comes to the future of ML development on Mac. Inevitably, the enhanced GPU performance will be a boon to machine learning developers, with benefits ranging from faster model training to reduced reliance on transfer learning. It will be interesting to see how ML engineers capitalize on Apple Silicon over time.</p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="10c8">The Mac, often considered Apple’s flagship lineup, has seen a couple changes in the past. Let’s look at what those changes were and how they’ve contributed to the evolution of the Mac.</p><h2 id="114e">Motorola 68K to PowerPC</h2><p id="d699">One of the earliest transitions in chip architecture was the transition from Motorola 68K chips to IBM and Motorola PowerPC chips. This was an incredible transition, which significantly improved the Mac and played an important role in understanding future transitions.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png?q=20" width="780" height="439" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1560/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png" width="780" height="439" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*gf2Y6U112riltsrAmT6VaA.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>The original iMac with a PowerPC processor.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="ed43">PowerPC to Intel x86</h2><p id="6ac1">The most notable transition was the move from PowerPC chips to Intel processors, which have been used for almost half of the Mac’s history so far. With this transition, Apple announced a developer kit to help with the transition, similar to what they announced in the switch to Apple Silicon.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png?q=20" width="1200" height="675" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2400/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*YIIun0yR2job_s0MRzSINg.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>A recent, Intel-based MacBook Pro.</figcaption></figure></div></div></section><hr><section></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="4c63">Undoubtedly, a switch to ARM-based Macs has a huge advantage for the performance and usability of Macs. Let’s look at how Apple Silicon will improve the Mac’s experience.</p><h2 id="71ef">Performance per Watt</h2><p id="e98c">Apple Silicon promises a stark improvement in performance per watt, meaning that the Mac could potentially promise desktop-level performance with the power consumption of a notebook computer, as exemplified by Apple’s diagram:</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png?q=20" width="1720" height="953" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3440/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png" width="1720" height="953" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*485W2PItyV9fz4UiWem0eQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Performance per watt for Apple Silicon</figcaption></figure><h2 id="95f4">Native Apps</h2><p id="b37d">Apps that support Apple Silicon natively will perform best on the new ARM-based Macs. Out-of-the-box, Apple’s own apps, including pro apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro, will have native support for Apple Silicon. In addition, through their collaboration with Adobe, the Creative Cloud Suite will also have native support from the get-go. Eventually, Microsoft Office and other widely used programs will be able to take advantage of Apple Silicon’s performance.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png?q=20" width="1080" height="607" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2160/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png" width="1080" height="607" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*AkSiIGraS55x_sZV5vt6_A.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Photoshop running natively on an ARM-based Mac.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2e35">iOS Apps on Mac</h2><p id="3611">Another incredible benefit of using the ARM architecture across iOS, macOS, and watchOS is the ability to run iOS apps natively on Apple Silicon Macs. Without any additional work from the developer, most iOS apps can be installed from the Mac App Store.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*SdaPx8Kn2Nw08JFB6XbDvw.png?q=20" width="3359" height="1891" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6718/1*SdaPx8Kn2Nw08JFB6XbDvw.png" width="3359" height="1891" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*SdaPx8Kn2Nw08JFB6XbDvw.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*SdaPx8Kn2Nw08JFB6XbDvw.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*SdaPx8Kn2Nw08JFB6XbDvw.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*SdaPx8Kn2Nw08JFB6XbDvw.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Running Monument Valley and Fender Play, two popular iOS apps, on a Mac.</figcaption></figure><p id="4f66">To help developers transition their apps to support Apple Silicon, Apple has announced a whole host of tools to make native and simulated support for Apple Silicon as smooth as possible for users.</p><h2 id="0ebc">Universal 2</h2><p id="8277">As the name suggests, Universal 2 allows developers to quickly compile their apps for Apple Silicon while retaining support for Intel-based Macs. By using Universal 2 in Xcode, developers will be able to use the same binary for both Intel-based Macs, while providing a native experience for those who are using a Mac with Apple Silicon.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png?q=20" width="3360" height="2100" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6720/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png" width="3360" height="2100" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*4Krp5sFt3beXnXbpuenl9Q.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Universal 2 for the same binary for Intel and ARM-based Macs.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="38e9">Rosetta 2</h2><p id="49cb">An upgrade from their previous version of Rosetta (for the Intel transition), Rosetta 2 provides similar capabilities as its previous counterpart — allowing Intel-based apps to run on Apple Silicon Macs. So if app developers haven’t yet recompiled their apps with Universal 2, their users can still access legacy versions of the app through Rosetta 2.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*2qVtb8FXZoJARJJa-Pq0IQ.png?q=20" width="3360" height="2100" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6720/1*2qVtb8FXZoJARJJa-Pq0IQ.png" width="3360" height="2100" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*2qVtb8FXZoJARJJa-Pq0IQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*2qVtb8FXZoJARJJa-Pq0IQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*2qVtb8FXZoJARJJa-Pq0IQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*2qVtb8FXZoJARJJa-Pq0IQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Rosetta 2 for install-time translation for Intel-based apps.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="b5ed">Virtualization</h2><p id="d298">For developers who need to use Linux, Docker, or similar tools, Apple has also announced virtualization tools for ARM Macs. These tools are expected to provide a seamless transition to Apple Silicon for developers who need server-side development tools.</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*z8L5KciHtXn7DOG5_HO8Ag.png?q=20" width="3359" height="1884" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/6718/1*z8L5KciHtXn7DOG5_HO8Ag.png" width="3359" height="1884" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*z8L5KciHtXn7DOG5_HO8Ag.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*z8L5KciHtXn7DOG5_HO8Ag.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*z8L5KciHtXn7DOG5_HO8Ag.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*z8L5KciHtXn7DOG5_HO8Ag.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Running an Apache server on an ARM-based Mac.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="f765">Developer Transition Kit</h2><p id="81af">Similar to the Intel transition, developers will be able to purchase a Developer Transition Kit, which comprises a Mac Mini enclosure fitted with the A12Z SoC — used on the latest iPad lineup. The Mac Mini will have 16GB of memory and a 512GB SSD — plenty for development needs. Also, macOS Big Sur and Xcode 12 will come pre-installed on the machine, which will be available for $500 (half the price of the Intel transition kit).</p><figure><div><div><div><div><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png?q=20" width="1080" height="607" role="presentation"></p><p><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2160/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png" width="1080" height="607" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*hpX5lvJahDiZXZxjGDDLMQ.png 700w" sizes="700px" role="presentation"></p></div></div></div></div><figcaption>Apple’s Mac Mini Based Developer Transition Kit</figcaption></figure><p id="de05">While Apple isn’t completely transitioning to Apple Silicon just yet, the announcement of their ARM-based chip for Mac is a huge step in a two year process to change Mac for the better.</p><p id="04c2">Stay tuned for some great new tutorials on the latest frameworks this week, and get ahead of the crowd by taking use of them before they’re released to the public in the fall.</p><p id="3993">In case you missed it, here’s the Keynote in all its glory:</p><figure><div></div></figure><p id="6139">Be sure to <strong>smash that “clap” button</strong> as many times as you can, <strong>share this article</strong> on social media, and <strong>follow me on Twitter.</strong></p></div></div></section><hr><section><div><div><p id="d325"><em>Editor’s Note:</em><a href="http://heartbeat.fritz.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em> </em><strong><em>Heartbeat</em></strong></a><strong><em> </em></strong><em>is a contributor-driven online publication and community dedicated to exploring the emerging intersection of mobile app development and machine learning.

In this post, I’ll talk about the fact that, “Fashion has become more commercial than ever before and it is saturated with pre-existing designers and brands. The budget to manage a fashion business has increased as fashion markets have grown exponentially, and it is becoming more difficult for new brands and emerging designers to survive in the current fashion market. As a result, we are losing out on the opportunity to see up-and-coming, new brands and designers, and it also incurs a loss of diversity in fashion.”</p><p><strong>Solution: </strong>A business that empowers boutique designers with one-off, hand-made fashion designs that are made to order. In 2018, I first dabbled in this space by creating “<a href="https://www.michaelbervell.com/shop">Berv</a>” a fashion company that had a motto that “what you wear should be art.“ I created a few samples, posted them online, and from then on took in requests for custom crafted $50 t-shirts. I would receive orders, screen-print them myself, and send the shirt to purchasers along with a photo of the creation process. Clients found that the shirt had a more sentimental and personal feel to it than traditional “designer” clothing, which (even though it is expensive) does not have an artisan feeling to it.</p><p>The business would usher in a new wave of artisan, hand-crafted clothing: following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.nomadsclothing.com/artisan_clothing">Nomads Clothing</a> and <a href="https://gemmastreasure.com/">Gemma’s Treasure</a>. While platforms like <a href="https://www.etsy.com/c/handmade/clothing/womens-clothing?explicit=1">Etsy do have hand-crafted clothing</a>, currently, the only outlet that allows for communication and dialogue for hand-crafted clothing comes from communicating directly with a producer.  </p><p><strong>Monetization: </strong>Percentage of sales driven through the platform.</p><p><strong>Contributed by: </strong><a href="https://www.michaelbervell.com/">Michael Bervell</a> (Billion Dollar Startup Ideas)</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

            <!-- content --><p>After over two months of silence, Western Digital has a new update. The company is launching the WD Red Plus line. Indeed, I even got an e-mail alerting me to this update after it went live. The net impact is a positive step, but it is still not good enough to protect customers. The bottom line is this: we cannot recommend WD Red drives given the company’s direction. We are going into that below.<span id="more-44610"></span></p>
<h2>The Background of the WD Red DM-SMR Saga</h2>
<p>In April, several reports of drive vendors <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/surreptitiously-swapping-smr-into-hard-drives-must-end/">Surreptitiously Swapping SMR into Hard Drive Lines Must Stop</a>, giving credit here to Chris Mellor at&nbsp;<a href="https://blocksandfiles.com/2020/04/14/wd-red-nas-drives-shingled-magnetic-recording/">Blocks and Files</a> for leading an investigation, it was found that WD, Seagate, and Toshiba were all using drive managed SMR drives or DM-SMR/ DMSMR. The technology itself has its place, but the key is that drive vendors were doing this in lower-end and lower-cost segments. Those are precisely the users that may lack the knowledge, choice, and opportunity to make informed decisions on whether they want to use new DM-SMR or traditional CMR drives.</p>
<p>While all three vendors are using DM-SMR, Western Digital took it a step further, crossing a line Seagate said it was not crossing: using DM-SMR in their NAS drives. Specifically, a drive line we have long advocated for at STH, the WD Red line as we have used many drives over the years.</p>
<p>When we tested these drives in <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/wd-red-smr-vs-cmr-tested-avoid-red-smr/">WD Red SMR vs CMR Tested Avoid Red SMR</a> we found performance completely not fit for the purpose of being used in ZFS NAS arrays when we tested the solution using what is likely the most popular open-source NAS platform, FreeNAS (soon to be TrueNAS Core.)</p>
<figure id="attachment_43599" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-43599"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/wd-red-smr-vs-cmr-tested-avoid-red-smr/smr-raidz-rebuild-v2/" rel="attachment wp-att-43599"><img src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMR-RAIDZ-Rebuild-v2.png" alt="RAIDZ Rebuild Test" width="761" height="309" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMR-RAIDZ-Rebuild-v2.png 761w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMR-RAIDZ-Rebuild-v2-400x162.png 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/SMR-RAIDZ-Rebuild-v2-696x283.png 696w" sizes="(max-width: 761px) 100vw, 761px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-43599">RAIDZ Rebuild Test</figcaption></figure>
<p>To be fair, WD did not have an undisclosed swap of DM-SMR technology into the entirety of its new WD Red line. Instead, the company focused on the lower and lower-midrange of the market. In our third piece, we saw iXsystems, the company behind FreeNAS and TrueNAS abandon the new drives, as well as Synology. You can read more about that in: <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/wd-red-dm-smr-update-3-vendors-bail-and-wd-knew-of-zfs-issues/">WD Red DM-SMR Update 3 Vendors Bail and WD Knew of ZFS Issues</a>. In that piece, we also covered how WD had at least one current employee (via its HGST acquisition) that had even gone to a ZFS conference and discussed performance issues with DM-SMR and ZFS.</p>
<p>In that Update 3 piece, we also discussed the clear failure of WD and its partners’ test matrices for validating the new drives in NAS units. Part of the reason, we suggested, may be because WD did not clearly communicate this change while they were surreptitiously swapping SMR into hard drives. It may not just have been consumers.</p>
<p>Yesterday, I had a short bit in a piece that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aztTf2gI55k">LTT did on WD facing class-action lawsuits over this behavior</a>. Again, to reiterate, I think this is a functional silo issue at the company which allowed these drives to make it to market.</p>
<p>Today, WD has a response two months and a day after they last addressed the issue.</p>
<h2>WD Red Plus Launched</h2>
<p>Western Digital now has a new “WD Red Plus” line. Effectively, the company now has moved the DM-SMR to a traditional “WD Red” brand. The new “WD Red Plus” brand is the lower performance CMR line that incorporates the previous generation “EFRX” drives. Note: EFAX can mean either CMR (Red Plus higher capacity) or DM-SMR (2-6TB capacities).</p>

<p>Here is an excerpt from the press release on the new positioning.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Our current device-managed shingled magnetic recording (DMSMR) (2TB, 3TB, 4TB, and 6TB) WD Red series will be the choice for the majority of NAS owners whose demands are lighter SOHO workloads.</em></li>
<li><em>WD Red Plus is the new name for conventional magnetic recording (CMR)-based NAS drives in the WD Red family, including all capacities from 1TB to 14TB. These will be the choice for those whose applications require more write-intensive SMB workloads such as ZFS. WD Red Plus in 2TB, 3TB, 4TB and 6TB capacities will be available soon.</em></li>
<li><em>Our WD Red Pro (CMR 2TB to 14TB) series for the highest-intensity usage remains the same. (<strong>Source</strong>: <a href="https://blog.westerndigital.com/wd-red-nas-drives/">WD Blog</a> accessed 6:35PM Pacific 23 June 2020)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, we wanted to point out that this was not a normal 6AM Pacific embargo brief. That slot went to our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/ampere-altra-max-targets-a-128-core-arm-cpu-shipping-in-2021/">Ampere Altra Max</a> coverage today, but there were a few other tech embargos at that time. Instead, I received the notice after this was live at 5:35PM Pacific. In other words, well after the day’s news cycle.</p>
<p>With the new line WD has effectively setup a new structure.</p>
<ul>
<li>WD Red is now a DM-SMR line. In the future, WD may continue to release DM-SMR NAS drives.</li>
<li>WD Red Plus is now a CMR line as is WD Red Pro.</li>
</ul>
<p>The issue still remains that users who have purchased WD Red drives in the past, and are not up on technology news nor current on what DM-SMR means, will continue to buy the “classic” WD Red brand. That is a huge portion of the potential buying population buying through the inertia of past habits.</p>
<p>By moving the DM-SMR drives to WD Red and CMR to WD Red Plus, WD is trying to capture that reflexive sales business driven by years of built brand equity. If you have a two-year-old NAS with WD Red CMR drives, why would you buy a WD Red Plus drive? The old ones have worked fine. That is exactly the mentality that WD is trying to capitalize on.</p>
<p>Those who have EFRX 2-6TB WD Red drives that are currently labeled “WD Red” are likely to buy “WD Red” again yet those new WD Red drives may not be fit for their purpose. Keeping the WD Red brand for substantially different drives is not good for the casual consumer.</p>
<p>WD also said: “Third-party testing also validates the performance of WD Red DMSMR drives compared with other drives under general hard drive benchmarks used in an NAS environment.” <em>(<strong>Source</strong>: <a href="https://blog.westerndigital.com/wd-red-nas-drives/">WD Blog</a> accessed 6:35PM Pacific 23 June 2020)&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>WD did not cite the source of those benchmarks. The two big studies out there currently are our <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/wd-red-smr-vs-cmr-tested-avoid-red-smr/">WD Red SMR vs CMR Tested Avoid Red SMR</a> piece and Jim Salter’s Ars Technica <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/06/western-digitals-smr-disks-arent-great-but-theyre-not-garbage/">piece</a>. Since I am the editor for one of those two, I will simply say I would not say ours fully supports that statement. I would not say Jim’s piece fully supports that statement. I would also not say some of the end-user testing of NAS units with the DM-SMR drives supports that testing. We highlighted Rob Janssen’s&nbsp;<a href="http://blog.robiii.nl/2020/04/wd-red-nas-drives-use-smr-and-im-not.html">personal blog</a> (note currently HTTP) documenting his experiences with the WD Red DM-SMR drives in his Synology NAS. WD did not cite their sources, so we have no idea. It may be NAS vendor testing, but those same vendors, as well as WD’s testing, missed this in the first place.</p>
<p>Further, WD did not announce a streamlined program to help those who have WD Red DM-SMR drives, not fit for the purpose they were sold for, get on more appropriate hardware. We know there are STH readers impacted. The only advice we can give is to follow Rob’s path and try getting drives RMA’d. The after-sales support message was missing from today’s announcement.</p>
<p>On the positive side, WD is at least disclosing the use of DM-SMR technology. That is a great development. The company is also clearly specifying ZFS as not being suitable for WD Red drives. That is also a great development.</p>
<p>WD addressed the Synology NAS concerns and says it is working with vendors. Of note, we used Seagate IronWolf drives in our recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/synology-ds920-4-bay-1gbe-nas-review/">Synology DS920+ 4-Bay 1GbE NAS Review</a>. After the stories we heard following our series, we cannot recommend the WD Red line. Red Plus and Red Pro are CMR, so they seem to still be OK.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>WD is releasing this news late in the afternoon, hoping most will not see it. WD is now officially calling WD Red a DM-SMR line, at least for now. Breaking it out is completely the right way to address this going forward. WD had a great thought here, but poor execution. By re-naming the DM-SMR line to WD Red, WD is in effect trying to sell less tech-savvy users or those who live in areas without the same extensive electronics distribution networks and purchasing power inferior drives hoping they will not notice.</p>
<p>If WD’s intention was not to mislead the average shopper who does not understand technical details of DM-SMR, it would have renamed the drives to something like “WD Orange” or “WD Peppermint” to avoid the confusion. By not doing this, WD seems to be going down a specific path.</p>
<p>To our readers, since WD Red is now synonymous with DM-SMR, we no longer recommend these drives. Please pass the word on so that users who do not have the knowledge, opportunity, or means to protect themselves do not end up purchasing these inferior hard drives.&nbsp;In the context of current environments, WD is doing the exact opposite of what movements to help people in those disadvantaged situations are aiming to accomplish. If people are making truly informed decisions within the context of options, that is perfectly reasonable to choose WD Red. As a tech community, we need to protect those who cannot. Although we have used older WD Red CMR drives for years, we can no longer recommend them to the millions of visitors to STH every year. It is up to our readers to help those who we cannot reach.</p>

June 23, 2020 | https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/postgresql-query-jit/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://solovyov.net/blog/2020/postgresql-query-jit/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>We’re proud users of PostgreSQL. Proud in a sense we’re really glad that our main data store is such a stable, performant, introspective, and overall great DBMS. It’s been very reliable for us and in times of turbulence made it possible to understand what the issue is. Overall, I love it.</p>

<p>We were on 10.x since ages - upgraded a month after it came out. We did a regular old school upgrade using <code>pg_upgrade</code>. You see, one of PG traits is that on-disk data layout is different between major versions. That means that version 10 can’t work with data from version 9 (and vice versa) and you have to convert the data to run a new version. It’s a PITA but gives you time to test and see if everything is okay, etc.</p>

<p>But when 11th came out something stopped us from upgrading (I don’t remember what). Plus around that time we started using <a href="https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/resources/pglogical/">pglogical</a> for a purpose of having, for example, an analytical replica. Or a partial replica to speed up something. And our idea of the next major upgrade was to use logical replication to copy data from our main db to the new node with newer PostgreSQL. It’s one of the cool features of logical replication - you can replicate data between nodes with different major versions.</p>

<p>Then pg12 came out. It was a great (as always) release, with a lot of performance improvements (CTE is not an optimization fence anymore, woohoo!), plus JIT was improved and enabled by default, and some new exciting features (jsonpath anyone?). And we’re experienced users of logical replication now.</p>

<p>It is time to upgrade then, right? Not so fast, amigo. 2ndQuadrant, authors of pglogical, had some problems with rolling out new release for pg12. I don’t know details here, but after some time they figured stuff out and February saw release of pglogical 2.3.</p>

<p>Cool! So after weeks of preparation on one uneventful (so far) night of 16th of April, a designated person did a migration. Well, a migration was done by logical replication before, so he switched pgbouncer to the new main db.</p>

<p>As a logical (heh) consequence of that - we did not really test pg12 on production traffic. Is that because of blind faith? Or laziness? It’s a hard question.</p>

<p>For some time everything was normal. New PostgreSQL, running smoothly, yada-yada-yada. And then the traffic came. It wasn’t even some peak sale or anything. Our daily campaigns start at 6:00, so that’s the start of the day for the site. Right at 6:00 pg started to feel unwell.</p>

<p>At 6:40, when I was woken up, site barely moved. We tracked slowdown to a very popular query, which selected a user from db: it was executed on every request which required authentication.</p>

<p>And what was wrong? Query plan for this query was so wildly weird that we’ve tried to use our intuition first and just disabled non-critical parts which we knew were heavy. This improved our mean API timings from 10s to 5s. Which is still strictly in “site is unresponsive” category.</p>

<p>Okay, back to investigation. Explain for that query was the same as on pg10, but explain analyze said that 12.9s of 13s of execution (API timings are lower because of caches) are spent on joining <code>auth_user</code> and <code>user_userprofile</code>. We’re an ex-Django site and that means some peculiarities in database design. For example, having a table called <code>product_product</code>, or that stuff where <code>auth_user</code> is a table about users and <code>user_userprofile</code> is about users data. So the interesting part of the query plan looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>-&gt;  Nested Loop  (cost=0.86..12.89 rows=1 width=310) (actual time=13708.286..13708.290 rows=1 loops=1)
      -&gt;  Index Scan using auth_user_pkey on auth_user u  (cost=0.43..6.44 rows=1 width=97) (actual time=0.108..0.108 rows=1 loops=1)
            Index Cond: (id = 7002298)
      -&gt;  Index Scan using user_userprofile_user_id_key on user_userprofile p  (cost=0.43..6.44 rows=1 width=217) (actual time=0.087..0.088 rows=1 loops=1)
            Index Cond: (user_id = 7002298)
</code></pre>

<p>What is the magic here? How does <code>0.08 + 0.1</code> results in <code>13708</code>? Is this the real life or is this just fantasy? We’ve spent half an hour pondering on that question until <a href="https://vsevolod.net/">Vsevolod</a> woke up and told me there is a JIT report at the end of the query plan:</p>

<pre><code> Planning Time: 2.515 ms
 JIT:
   Functions: 138
   Options: Inlining true, Optimization true, Expressions true, Deforming true
   Timing: Generation 108.775 ms, Inlining 888.683 ms, Optimization 7700.314 ms, Emission 5091.838 ms, Total 13789.610 ms
 Execution Time: 13821.487 ms
</code></pre>

<p>I blame this on both being too sleepy (being woken up in the wrong sleep phase is a pain) and having absolutely zero experience with JIT. Somehow this <code>Optimizations</code> word has captured my attention and I’ve spent quite a bit of time reading up on new optimizations in PostgreSQL and how to disable them. No idea why <code>Emission</code> did not have my attention - I guess its time just didn’t come yet. :-)</p>

<p>JIT got disabled. API response timings dropped from 5s to whatever they are normally. Things went back to usual state.</p>

<h2>Reasons</h2>

<p>Discussion on <a href="https://lobste.rs/s/r6ydjp/postgresql_query_jit">lobste.rs</a> was coming to a conclusion that 14 seconds is too much for a JIT and maybe we triggered some bug in PostgreSQL. So I went up to reproduce this, but with more verbose query plan (literally <code>explain (analyze, verbose, buffers) ...</code>). And got this:</p>

<pre><code> Planning Time: 2.240 ms
 JIT:
   Functions: 101
   Options: Inlining false, Optimization false, Expressions true, Deforming true
   Timing: Generation 13.719 ms, Inlining 0.000 ms, Optimization 3.280 ms, Emission 83.755 ms, Total 100.753 ms
 Execution Time: 102.812 ms
</code></pre>

<p>My first reaction was of course “argh it fixed itself or what?!” But then it hit me: this is one of the most frequent queries in our database and JIT adding 100 ms of CPU time (because just in time compilation for sure is not some I/O wait) put such a massive load on our CPUs that eventually that 100 ms went up to being 14 seconds.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We should have tested more. Also, we need more monitoring to see that one query became too slow. I’ve been thinking that not skipping PG11 would’ve helped to test JIT and identify this issue early. OTOH it seems it wasn’t that straightforward to enable.</p>

<p>With all that said, I can’t shake off the feeling that JIT being enabled by default is a bit too early.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div id="content"><section id="tutorial"><div><p>How to find information leaks at scale with a few command line tools</p></div><p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/finding-secrets-in-travis-ci/image1.png"></p></section><section><div><p>At SecApps we pride ourselves on having one the most complete information security toolkit with fully-managed services and tools available directly from your very own browser. However, there are some tasks that can be better done with a bit of command-line magic.</p>
<p>In this tutorial we will explore two command-line tools available in our open-source PownJS security toolkit: travis and leaks. We will use the combination of both to quickly scan the target Travis CI logs and look for interesting information.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>Before we start, those of you who do not already have pown must install it with the node npm utility. If you don’t have Node.js, get it with your system package manager. Once node and npm are on your system (keep in mind you can simply use docker like this: docker run -it node /bin/bash) install pown with the following command: npm install -g pown.</p>
<p>If you happen to have pown already installed, ensure that you’ve got the latest version. This task is easily achieved by using the following command: pown update. Now we are ready to go.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-travis-ci">What is Travis CI</h2>
<p>Travis CI is a popular continuous integration platform for open source projects with direct integration to GitHub. Developers are using Travis for all kinds of common activities, from building personal blogs to compiling libraries and more. Some tasks may require special setup to work. For example, deploying a blog may require some credentials for a Github, AWS S3 or some other type of account. These credentials are securely stored either in Travis itself or in the build configuration files as encrypted strings so that nobody can see them but the build scripts.</p>
<p>Although these secret strings are encrypted, it does not mean they are secure. In fact, just like any other build process, things can get very wrong. A debug trace dump could reveal vital information that was not exposed otherwise in the build file. Some environment variables may contain hints and in some cases actual passwords to production systems. Error messages and some other verbose logging can reveal access tokens. In order to discover all of them we need to download all travis logs and scan them. This is what we are doing next.</p>
<h2 id="dumping-the-travis-ci-logs">Dumping The Travis CI Logs</h2>
<p>The Travis CI build logs are available publicly for all open source projects. This means that we can easily retrieve them with nothing but a browser. However, some projects may hold hundreds of logs and so manually exploring them is just painful exercise which must be automated. Luckily, the pown toolkit contains one command that helps us automate this particular task easily.</p>
<p>To dump the logs of any Travis repository simply type the following: pown travis dump $ORG. In this example $ORG is the variable which holds the organisation name such as razor, roblox, or any other organisation that is, or has been using Travis CI in the past.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/finding-secrets-in-travis-ci/image1.png" alt=""></p>
<p>This step can take some time depending on the amount of logs. The tool will recursively dig into each individual repository associated with the target organisation and download the logs and the configuration files associated with each build step.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/finding-secrets-in-travis-ci/image4.png" alt=""></p>
<p>You can see from the screenshot above that the logs can get pretty large. While 75 megabytes is not a lot of space, this is enough to fit about 120+ books as simple text files.</p>
<h2 id="scanning-for-secrets">Scanning For Secrets</h2>
<p>Now that we have all logs downloaded locally, it is time to find secrets. This step is also fairly trivial if you have the right tools and so it happens that this is the case with the pown toolkit.</p>
<p>Pown Leaks is a command-line tool and a database of patterns that help you identify secrets: github tokens, AWS credentials, passwords and much more. You can support the secrets database directly on our GitHub <a href="https://github.com/pownjs/pown-leaks">project</a>. Your changes will be incorporated into the next version of the pown toolkit.</p>
<p>Using the tool is straightforward: pown leaks. The location argument can be anything including a file, a directory or a URL. The last one is particularly interesting and we will explore in some other tutorial.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/finding-secrets-in-travis-ci/image2.png" alt=""></p>
<p>To start the hunt fire off the tool into the local directory where we dumped the Travis CI logs in the previous steps. Some particular flags you might want to use include --unique and --json. In this example we simply used the verbose flag which is suitable for demonstration purposes but with the additional flags we can really get interesting results quickly.</p>
<p><img src="https://secapps.com/tutorials/finding-secrets-in-travis-ci/image5.png" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>In this tutorial we have learned how to dump the travis logs and search for secrets in two very quick steps everyone can follow and execute. With a bit of luck we can even find some interesting secrets the project owners have mistakenly leaked and therefore could potentially open the gates to other mischievous activities. You better rotate these secrets as soon as possible and follow up with a full audit on all systems affected.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you are interested to discover and continuously track secrets and other security deficiencies in build logs, source repositories and library modules across your entire developer estate, you might be interested to check out <a href="https://secapps.com/market/devcore">SecApps Devcore</a>.</p>

<div>

<div>

<p>Modern web browsers have evolved to a point where a heavy-handed reset or a massive CSS normalization is no longer required.
In this chapter we will implement a fundamentally different type of reset by uncovering only the bare minimum ruleset that is necessary for consistency. According to the new <a href="https://bubblin.io/blog/the-new-landscape-of-the-web" target="_blank">landscape of the web</a>.
We will also talk about two beasts—an intrinsically responsive layout and block-scoped typography, later in this chapter. Both are critical to understanding web interfaces (UX/UI) of the future.</p>
</div>
</div>
<h2 id="baselining-css">Baselining CSS</h2>
<p>In the last chapter, we created a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bookiza/toucaan/master/examples/example0.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blank file</a> to test the responsiveness of an empty page. That worked perfectly and was easy enough to implement. We simply touched a new file on the disk and <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bookiza/toucaan/master/examples/example0.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">opened</a> it on a browser like Chrome, like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>$ </span>touch example0.html     // Create a new file but <span>do </span>not write anything on it.

<span>$ </span>chrome example0.html    // Open this 0 byte files on your favorite browser.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now let us take our work on the <a href="https://toucaan.com/" target="_blank">Toucaan CSS framework</a> forward from this point. Let’s <em>inspect</em> this 0-byte blank page on the console of the browser. Press <code>⌘+⌥+I</code> keys if you are on the Mac with Google Chrome:</p>

<div>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/blank-page.jpg" alt="Blank web page." width="100%"></p><p>Blank webpage on the browser window.</p>
</div>

<p>You will see that even though we loaded a blank file on to the browser, there still are a few <code>html</code> elements that are rendered on the DOM. Every web browser will render these elements, just to display the blank page correctly.</p>
<p>Browsers will “fix” the <code>html</code> on the page because it is in the nature of browsers to be forgiving and are smart enough to handle issues like missing or unmatched tags quietly.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>&lt;!-- Blank page as rendered on desktop Chrome, Firefox, Brave &amp; Safari. --&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;html&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt;</span>
<span>&lt;/html&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Notice that the browser also applies a default user-agent<sup>*</sup> stylesheet called <code>html.css</code> under the page. See the ‘Styles’ block (screenshot above) of your browser’s console. This html.css file is a default set of rules that each browser is shipped with upon install. Up until a few years ago it was this html.css file that used to contain several inconsistencies across vendors but that is no longer the case today.</p>
<p>We can assume that html.css—the unset cascade—itself is practically the consistent reset.css for our daily use.</p>
<p>A very interesting example of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://hankchizljaw.com/wrote/a-modern-css-reset/" target="_blank">reset</a> was shared by developer Andy Bell last week for a blog type of application. While their reset may be limited in scope it does help us establish the fact that there is very little arm-twisting required over a browser’s own set of rules to establish consistency. This is great news and one of the main reasons why we will try and keep Toucaan a loosely coupled CSS framework for 2020.</p>

<p>Getting back to the DOM, given that there are only three html elements required for a webpage to be valid, we will start with baselining Toucaan for only three baseline elements of html, namely:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>1. <span>&lt;html&gt;</span> tag or the **:root** element,
2. <span>&lt;body&gt;</span> tag, and the…
3. <span>&lt;head&gt;</span> tag.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The &lt;head&gt; element is always set to <code>display:none;</code>, so effectively there are only two html tags &lt;body&gt; and &lt;html&gt; for us to play with. Given below is how we will structure our baseline reset for Toucaan:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>
<span>&lt;style&gt;</span>
    <span>/* The following is pure css and not sass/scss. */</span>
    <span>@import</span> <span>url('toucaan/portrait/portrait.css')</span> <span>only</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>orientation</span><span>:</span> <span>portrait</span><span>);</span>

    <span>@import</span> <span>url('toucaan/landscape/landscape.css')</span> <span>only</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>orientation</span><span>:</span> <span>landscape</span><span>);</span>

    <span>@media</span> <span>only</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>orientation</span><span>:</span> <span>portrait</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>:root</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>/* Portrait variables go here.  */</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>@media</span> <span>only</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>orientation</span><span>:</span> <span>landscape</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>:root</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>/* Landscape variables go here. */</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>/* Bare minimum elements required for a valid webpage */</span>
    <span>html</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>

    <span>body</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>
<span>&lt;/style&gt;</span>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>That’s it!</p>
<p>This is what a modern baseline css would look like on Toucaan.</p>
<p>What it also means is that everything else, that goes into designing an application, the other <code>html</code> elements and their corresponding style, can now be covered using optional CSS helpers to support the entire spectrum of devices and browsers. I suspect that there wouldn’t be many rules to import even for the most sophisticated web applications out there but one can never be too sure. Let us see where we can go with Toucaan without making any assumptions.</p>
<p>Note that on the baseline above I have inlined the portrait ⇋ landscape switch along with baseline tag selectors for html and body elements each and put everything inside a <code>&lt;style&gt; … &lt;/style&gt;</code> tag. We do this to ensure that all the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://css-tricks.com/annotating-critical-css/" target="_blank">critical</a> above-the-fold <a rel="nofollow" href="https://css-tricks.com/authoring-critical-fold-css/" target="_blank">css</a> is available for the first contentful paint (FCP) as soon as possible and it helps to declare all global css variables from one place.</p>
<div>

<div>

<p>Some of you pointed me towards Steve Souder’s article <a href="http://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2009/04/09/dont-use-import/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">don’t use @import</a> from 2009 but I can confirm that this position is no longer valid. The fact that almost 50% of the web is on http/2 and that there is a possibility of hardcaching all CSS locally using a serviceworker, I think we are good to go with imports in 2020 and beyond.</p>
<p>Besides, our little CSS import switch will request only one external CSS file for a given ‘viewport state’, just like a &lt;link&gt; url does.</p>
<p>Feel free to dissect the position I have taken on using CSS @imports on Toucaan but for now I am gonna happily report that <strong>not using CSS imports</strong> to separate critical from non-critical CSS is an anti-pattern that should do be done away with. Toko, toko!</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>Great, so now we have a foundation for a new reset file on Toucaan. Let us add some meat to it next.</p>
<h2 id="layouts-with-css-grids">Layouts with CSS Grids.</h2>
<p>One of the things that I am (super!) chuffed about using for layouts on Toucaan is the CSS grids. Layouts on Toucaan are exclusively going to be based on CSS grids. Period.</p>
<p>To enable grids we simply apply the following rule on the <code>body</code> element of our inline-reset:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>    <span>body</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>grid</span><span>;</span> <span>/*</span> <span>Or</span> <span>place</span> <span>`</span><span>display</span><span>:</span><span>grid</span><span>`</span> <span>on</span> <span>the</span> <span>root</span> <span>element</span> <span>of</span> <span>your</span> <span>vue</span> <span>or</span> <span>react</span> <span>app</span><span>.</span>
    <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>That’s it. We are all set for <em>any</em> kind of responsive layout with Toucaan now.</p>
<p>Enabling a grid on the body ensures that every direct child on-page can now behave as part of a larger blueprint specified under a grid system. Not only that, but we can also specify different layouts for portrait and landscape switch and swap out the layout according to the new state of the viewport.Enabling a grid on the body ensures that every direct child on-page can now behave as part of a larger blueprint specified under a grid system. Not only that, but we can also specify different layouts for portrait and landscape switch and swap out the layout according to the new state of the viewport.</p>
<p>I don’t think there is any other way that I would do layouts in 2020.</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marvindanig/assets/master/css-grids.jpg" alt="Blank web page." width="100%"></p><p>Support from CSS grids is substantial in 2019.</p>
</div>

<p>As you can see, the support for CSS grids has <a rel="nofollow" href="https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-grid" target="_blank">grown</a> over the years and now nearly every major browser has implemented the newest specification. Here is what our inline-reset with CSS grids would look:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>
<span>&lt;style&gt;</span>
    <span>/* The following is pure css and not sass/scss. */</span>
    <span>@import</span> <span>url('toucaan/portrait/portrait.css')</span> <span>only</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>orientation</span><span>:</span> <span>portrait</span><span>);</span>

    <span>@import</span> <span>url('toucaan/landscape/landscape.css')</span> <span>only</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>orientation</span><span>:</span> <span>landscape</span><span>);</span>

    <span>@media</span> <span>only</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>orientation</span><span>:</span> <span>portrait</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>:root</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>/* Portrait variables go here.  */</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>@media</span> <span>only</span> <span>screen</span> <span>and</span> <span>(</span><span>orientation</span><span>:</span> <span>landscape</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>:root</span> <span>{</span>
            <span>/* Landscape variables go here. */</span>
        <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>

    <span>/* Bare minimum elements required for a valid webpage */</span>
    <span>html</span> <span>{</span> <span>}</span>

    <span>body</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>display</span><span>:</span> <span>grid</span><span>;</span> <span>/* Semantic layouts! */</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>&lt;/style&gt;</span>

</code></pre></div></div>
<p>We have a very simple baseline.css that is grounded in the realities of the web today. In the next chapter we will move the <code>display: grid</code> rule into its own separate class named <code>.layout-palette</code>, which will describe how the header, the footer and the main body on a webpage will be laid out in a given context.</p>
<p>CSS grids aren’t anything new, but they certainly are a standard tool that is available at our disposal. After having dabbled with CSS floats, flexbox and whatnot for years, I am convinced that CSS grids are the only logical way to do layouts. It is simple, semantic and much easier to reason about than anything else on market.</p>
<h4 id="why-no-css-float-or-no-flexbox-why-css-grids-only">Why no css float or no flexbox? Why css grids only.</h4>
<p>Thing is that if you want to do modern layouts in 2020 (and beyond) you shouldn’t be using flexbox or floats anymore. It is just plain wrong. This of course doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t use flexbox or floats on your CSS at all, but using those element level properties for sitewide layouts is an anti-pattern—it is like a hack that we have had to live with, due to absence of grids. I feel very strongly about this so let me explain this a little more:</p>
<p>The body element on an empty webpage is like a raw piece of land waiting to be cut-up into smaller rectangles to form the foundation of a house. Each of these tiny rectangles have a different meaning or a purpose, like a kitchen or a bedroom or a living space, but are also a part of a larger blueprint of a building that is yet to be built.</p>
<p>A set of rectangular jigsaw pieces on a website that sit next to each other in <em>harmony</em> with shared edges.</p>
<p>CSS grids are an ideal tool to break down this whole patch of land—the body—into smaller rectangles because it is a very top-down view of the land. Whereas with flexbox you are more at the element level. Flexing is like the kitchen saying ‘hey, I am a DIV and I am going to be stretching all the way leftwards to occupy whatever space is available’. Flexbox adds a certain behavior to the HTML element that needs to be counterbalanced by another element (often sibling) with a behavior in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>It is like two little men trying to flex their muscles against each other and in the process locking themselves in to form a layout. A sort of dynamic equilibrium instead of harmony. Not a very ideal situation because if the viewport were to go ultra-widescreen suddenly, the layout will fail.</p>

			If you're aware of how software is developed on Windows, chances are you're eventually going to run into COM. While Windows exposes some simple C APIs (and these APIs were much better than its contemporaries like Toolbox, X, or Intuition), pretty much anything more complex than USER32 is exposed through COM interfaces, from Internet Explorer to DirectX. COM is also used to <em>extend</em> applications too: Office, Visual Studio, even the Windows shell provide COM interfaces to applications to hook into. Microsoft loves using COM for everything in Windows, even if third-parties don't like it as much (Usually, out of portability/complexity reasons.). Using COM to its full extent can <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2009/09/23/the-duct-tape-programmer/">make your application 34% sparklier</a>, but it's a lot of work to properly use those interfaces (and there's a lot of them!).
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately not many were able to take advantage of COM, let alone in more obscure scenarios such as extending the shell. The people who could do so were quite rare, as Spolsky pointed out. Naturally, I was <a href="https://xkcd.com/356/">nerd sniped</a> by a friend to write a <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/shell/nse-works">shell namespace extension</a>, one of the more obscure (little documentation, few did it, few know they exist) categories of COM extension. A shell namespace extension adds a "namespace" (basically virtual folder) to the shell, which has further objects represented in it. Common use cases for them include MTP for phones, inline ZIP file viewing, etc.
		</p>
		<p>
			My extension was simple enough I thought I could implement it (and I did... with difficulty, as you'll see) myself. It would enumerate all the open Windows Explorer windows, and put links to them in a namespace. The point of this is that this was accessible from the stock system file dialogs, which is useful if you have a bunch of Explorer windows open, but want to save to one of them quickly. This was inspired by an OS/2 Workplace Shell feature (the one good feature of OS/2!). The challenge was going from a bare minimum knowledge of COM to knowing just enough to be <del>dangerous</del> able to make a shell namespace extension that works.

		<h2>A Brief Primer on COM</h2>
		<p>
			For something with a near-legendary reputation of complexity, it turns out COM is actually based on some very simple primitives. COM is based on interfaces (in the C++ manner) that implement vtables (a structure full of functions). These interfaces have a fixed shape, so they can be used from C. Every COM class implements the interface <code>IUnknown</code>, which implements three functions:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><code>AddRef</code>, which increments the reference count. Every COM object is reference counted, so you'll use this when you make a copy of a held-on reference.</li>
			<li><code>Release</code>, which decrements the reference count. The object frees itself when the count hits zero.</li>
			<li><code>QueryInterface</code>, which gives you the vtable of another interface if the object implements it (casting). The interfaces are identified by a GUID.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			This isn't so bad. Of course, objects can implement a <em>lot</em> of interfaces, and because interfaces have a fixed shape, to extend an interface later, you have to create another interface. Microsoft ends up numbering them, so you get into situations where you have an <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/shobjidl_core/nn-shobjidl_core-ishellfolder2"><code>IShellFolder2</code></a>. And as Microsoft implements more features that require more interfaces, a class can get unwieldy if you're not careful. And then you have to assume the interfaces are well documented! And for extensibility, debugging isn't (as far as I'm aware) very great beyond printf macros.
		</p>
		<p>
			COM classes are registered (that's what REGSVR32 is for), where they become known by other applications. A <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/midl/com-dcom-and-type-libraries">type library</a> provides metadata, and is usually generated by an IDL file.
		</p>
		<p>
			While you can use COM from C, it can get a bit unwieldy, because COM benefits from an environment of RAII and scoped destructors. ATL provides a template-based wrapper around COM for C++, and is what Microsoft recommends for COM development. Visual Studio greatly assists in terms of generating the boilerplate for categories of COM classes.
		</p>
		<h2>Do You Eat Your Burgers With or Without the Shell?</h2>
		<p>
			The beautiful part of Windows is how extensible it is. The ugly part of Windows is how no one can extend it properly. Trying to write a shell namespace extension from scratch is a Sisyphean endeavour. I don't think anyone's done it. Instead, you have to do things like your average Windows programmer in 2002 would have done - read someone much smarter than you's <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1649/The-Complete-Idiot-s-Guide-to-Writing-Namespace-Ex">article on CodeProject</a>, the site people copied and pasted from <em>before</em> Stack Overflow. His examples are helpful, but they have a critical flaw - they implement the list view on their own, instead of delegating out to the interface which handles using the stock one and its default behaviours for you. (For example, the example will crash on XP and newer because it doesn't handle the new ListView views.) Insightful, but back to the drawing board.
		</p>
		<p>
			Round two. The <a href="https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/7973/An-almost-complete-Namespace-Extension-Sample">example by Pascal Hurni</a> is while slightly rougher, closer to what we want. His example uses the system ShellView, which gives you default behaviours and the ability to use it from a stock file dialog, which is what we want. The example enumerates through the registry (specifically, favourites for the file manager <a href="https://www.gpsoft.com.au/">Directory Opus</a>) and represents real filesystem entities, which is close to what we want - just swap out the enumerator.
		</p>
		<p>
			I took some code I wrote for experimenting with actually listing Explorer windows. First I thought I'd have to enumerate all visible windows and filter on <code>CabinetWClass</code>, then figure out what messages to send to it in order to get useful information out, but it turns out an easier way was possible through COM. You create an instance of <code>IShellWindows</code>, then call <code>get_Count</code> and <code>Item</code>, which returns an <code>IDispatch</code> representing your window. <code>IDispatch</code> is essentially <code>IUnknown</code> with reflection, intended for situations like VBA where you want to enumerate methods and properties. We can cast it to an <code>IWebBrowser</code> (a remnant of when Internet Explorer and Windows Explorer were welded together), and get the location from there. Grafting it onto Pascal's example (and ripping out what code I didn't need for clarity), I had a working MVP (with bugs, of course)
		</p>

		<h2>PIDLy Details</h2>
		<p>
			I <del>cargo-culted (first step of learning)</del> learned some things about the shell, and there's still a lot more I don't know about. Tip of the iceberg as follows:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>A PIDL is basically an ID used by Explorer to represent items, since entities may not have real FS representation. A PIDL is basically a free-form struct that has what you want tagged with its size, and what your NSE will use to identify items. They can be absolute or relative (where it only matters to you), like a path.</li>
			<li>It likes to request wrapped PIDLs in the form of <code>IDataObject</code>, one of those can-contain-anything OLE structures usually used for the clipboard.</li>
			<li>Namespaces can be registered at a <em>junction point</em>, which makes it accessible from places other than making a shortcut to its CLSID (GUID). There's also some ceremony in registering the namespace at all; there's a registry resource script that gets called whenever the DLL is registered to make it easier. Some information on creating namespaces (but from a customizer's perspective, so pointing it at existing locations) and making it known in places is available <a href="http://virtualplastic.net/html/ui_shell.html">here</a>.</li>
			<li>Some software (cough, Office) requires an NSE represent a real location before it'll show it. The example works around this by using the temporary directory as a physical manifestation. This can result in weird behaviour, but it's the price to pay to have it work.</li>
			<li>Late in XP's lifecycle and especially Vista, Microsoft extended the column scheme to have property keys. These represent metadata more faithfully, can be extended, and is actively used for search. Namespace extensions can of course, implement these. However, it's not clear on what's the bare minimum you implement to get things like tile view subtitles working. You're almost led to believe you need an <code>IPropertyStore</code> and XML file representing custom metadata columns, but I was seemingly lucky enough I could just use built-in property keys and (I believe) the real filesystem entities have their metadata fill in. I just had to map the (most; I didn't notice anything bad from not mapping everything) column IDs I was using to the system included property keys and handle the property keys that resolve to other property keys for what to display on tiles and such.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			The real sad part is for things like this, because the documentation is so lacking/missing, is that you may run into issues where not even Stack Overflow can help you. Experimentation or blind trust in ancient Usenet posts may be required. Or maybe you can be lucky enough to know someone who was there, remembers, and still cares. Remember, not many at the time knew how to use these effectively, and the number of people who do dwindles, to a point of extinction, another point to the <a href="https://www.devever.net/~hl/windowsdefeat">cultural defeat of Windows</a>.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also found <a href="https://www.viksoe.dk/code/regfolder.htm">someone who implemented a wrapper class library and a bunch of samples around them</a>, which probably would be handy if I didn't discover it <em>after</em> actually managing to make it. It might have been useful, but it does a lot for you, so perhaps it was for the best to understand how the shell/COM works at a lower level.
		</p>
		<h2>IActuallyDidIt2</h2>
		<p>
			I managed to actually write the extension. It's available <a href="https://github.com/NattyNarwhal/OpenWindows">on GitHub</a>, and I hope it provides a clearer example of a shell namespace extension (since you're likely not going to find many, let alone many who know it) as well as be useful to Explorer freaks. I had also contacted Pascal about the licensing ambiguities (since people just did open source in Windows circles by the edge of their seats back then) - it's MIT licensed for sure. Now you know how the ISausage is made, and it is delicious - if only people could figure out the best way to eat it.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><div><div><h4>What's This?</h4><p>I studied English as an undergraduate, but since then I've taken an untraditional path into software engineering. Years later, I'm working as an Engineering Manager at Yelp. </p><p>I've heard everything from curiosity to outright scorn when people learn my background. </p><p>I'm writing for the curious, to share how I changed from one career to a very different one. I'm also writing for those who are considering a similar jump. Hopefully my story sheds some light on the road ahead.</p><h4>English Major</h4><p>I majored in English for the usual reasons. I like reading, writing, diagramming sentences, and picking apart complex narratives. I wanted to learn more about those things. And at eighteen years old, I was not particularly concerned about the future.</p><p>As graduation approached, I realized that in order to make money, I would need a job. So which job?</p><h4>Law</h4><p>Law seemed like a good fit. It's meaningful and interesting work. There is plenty of reading, writing, and picking apart complex narratives.</p><p>But becoming a lawyer means law school, which is expensive and itself requires the LSAT. And the LSAT takes months of study in order to do well. I needed time to scope out the industry before committing all that money. </p><p>So I became a paralegal. I worked at Cadwalader, Wickersham, and Taft (CWT), which is a very old, very large, and very traditional law firm. If you've heard of BigLaw, that's CWT.</p><p>I had a productive first year at CWT. I got the LSAT score I needed, I secured some strong recommendations, and I feel like I got an excellent window into the industry. </p><p>After all that, I was dismayed to admit: I didn't want to be a lawyer. While I liked many of the people I met at CWT, the lifestyle of the profession didn't appeal to me at all.</p><p>As someone who self-identifies as "quirky" at minimum, I felt like I would need to drastically alter my personality to suit the profession. Even more frightening: I thought I might be capable of doing that. What a terrible fate.</p><p>Back to square one. My paralegal job felt like a dead-end and law school felt like an expensive mistake. What to do?</p><h4>Learn Everything</h4><p>While continuing on as a paralegal, I tried to learn everything I could about other industries. Maybe one of them would stand out.</p><p>After a few months, my friend said to me: "You like linguistics, right? How about you try programming in Python. There are lots of cool linguistic applications for Python programming." </p><p>I'd never programmed before, but...sure. Why not? </p><p>So at 23-years-old, I wrote my first line of code. And let me tell you, when I saw "hello world" printed in the terminal, it was glorious. </p><p>Silly as it was, I was drunk with power. I could make the computer print out <em>anything</em>. In a strange way, I found programming similar to the creative / logical act of sentence diagramming, which I loved. So I was hooked. I started spending all of my free time programming. </p><h4>Learn Programming</h4><p>There were several initial hurdles to overcome. What curriculum would I follow? What language should I learn? Heck, what editor should I use to write code and where could I even execute it?</p><p>I imagine these things are obvious to someone who goes to school for Computer Science. But I was sitting at home with just the internet and a few spare hours. Fortunately, I had two great resources. </p><p>First, my programmer friends. I'm sure they got sick of my endless questions, but their help was invaluable. Working on your own, it's easy to get lost in StackOverflow posts and wind up dismayed. My friends kept me on track and cleared up a lot of confusing points. ("What's a constructor function?" "What's a list comprehension?") </p><p>Second, I found a fantastic e-book called <a href="https://inventwithpython.com/invent4thed/">Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python</a>. It's targeted at an audience...much younger than I was. As a result, the writing is exceptionally clear and simple. Perfect for an absolute beginner with limited guidance. </p><p>Armed with these tools, I wrote <em>lots</em> of sloppy, beginner-style programs. My crowning glory was a dinky chatbot that had hard-coded responses to common phrases. Success was just around the corner.</p><p>Except it wasn't.</p><p>I sent out a blizzard of internship applications, and every single one was rejected. It was a seemingly endless stream: rejection after rejection after rejection. I even got rejected from Yelp, where I currently work.</p><p>Around this time, a well-meaning acquaintance told me that I should give up trying to be a software engineer. It was too hard, there was too much math, and didn't I know? Software Engineers were <em>really</em> smart.  </p><p>Boy did that make me mad. I'm still mad, just thinking about it. </p><p>Any thoughts I had of giving up were promptly sidelined. I was <em>sure</em> I could break into the industry, given enough time. Maybe I needed more education.</p><h4>What Sort of Education?</h4><p>By whatever fortune, during that period I was blessed with clarity of vision. I was going to be a software engineer, full stop. I wanted to build the foundation for my life's professional work.</p><p>Around this time, programming bootcamps had become very popular. I spent a long time weighing them against a traditional graduate school.</p><p>It's easy to understand bootcamps' appeal. They teach you industry-relevant skills, they help you apply for jobs, and they promise to help you shift careers at supersonic speed: often in just a few months. </p><p>I thought for a long time about enrolling in a bootcamp. But, for whatever reason, it seemed risky. </p><p>Maybe it was the horror stories about poorly-run bootcamps. Maybe it was a personal bias towards traditional education. Maybe it was the impression I got online, that companies looked down on bootcamp graduates. Or a worry that I'd miss out on theoretical aspects of Computer Science. </p><p>Switching careers already felt risky, and I was desperate to reduce uncertainty. Bootcamps were out.</p><p>I've met many bootcamp graduates since then, most of them highly driven and intelligent. Some have found success, some not. </p><p>It's worth acknowledging that I enjoy several privileges which made it possible for me to quit my job and spend two years in grad school. I am very fortunate in that respect, and very grateful.</p><h4>Applying to Grad School</h4><p>Applying to grad school was pretty straightforward. The GRE felt like a piece of cake after the LSAT. I just needed to relearn high-school math (English major, remember?). </p><p>Few schools would accept me without a bachelor's in Computer Science. So that narrowed the field for me, in some ways a blessing. I applied to about five schools.</p><p>Of those, Brandeis was my top pick. There, I could take remedial undergraduate classes while I did my Master's. And they had a strong Computational Linguistics program to boot.</p><p>My background actually made parts of the application very easy. Writing a personal statement? No problem. Verbal portion of the GRE? Forget about it. </p><p>After submitting the applications, I took a mid-summer trip to Boracay, a remote island in the Philippines. I ducked in from the white-sand beach to check my email and found out that Brandeis had accepted me. Despite all the surf and sun, I could only dream of Boston in winter.</p><h4>First Year at Brandeis</h4><p>Brandeis was as great as Boston was cold.</p><p>I spent my time learning Computer Science, surrounded by intelligent people who had similar interests. It was like paradise.</p><p>Except for Discrete Math, that is. Everyone's got that one class where they struggle. But even tougher than the material was the imposter syndrome I felt as a result. It was my first semester and, heck, I was just an English major. If I was already struggling, maybe I didn't belong in a Computer Science program? Surely I'd be exposed as a fraud.</p><p>In the end, I managed to scrape out a hard-won B+. And boy was I grateful. I won't say it fully alleviated my imposter syndrome, but it was a good start.</p><p>There were high points too. Like the few Computational Linguistics classes I managed to sneak in. Boy were they fun. Finally I was back to diagramming sentences, but now the computer did it for me.</p><h4>Internship</h4><p>That summer, I was lucky to get an internship with Ginger.io, out in mythical San Francisco. I'd never been to SF, and didn't know much about Ginger.io. But on paper, it was perfect. </p><p>Ginger.io was a small-ish startup, with ~20 engineers. Their goal was to provide mental healthcare to people without the usual means of access—something I'm personally passionate about. </p><p>Their tech-stack was Python-based too. That meshed with the programming I'd done at Brandeis. Finally, <em>this time</em> success was just around the corner.</p><p>Except it wasn't.</p><p>The people at Ginger.io were patient and kind. But, to be frank, I was woefully underprepared. </p><p>I'd done very little collaborative programming. I was somewhat baffled by the command line, and <em>exceptionally</em> baffled by git. I'd never even dreamed of a codebase bigger than a few files. </p><p>It was one of the most difficult periods of my life. I spent much of the summer trying to learn all the things software engineers take for granted—automated testing, development environments, version control, architectural patterns, and so forth. I worked very slowly and I felt like I'd let the team down. It was doubly painful, since I cared deeply about the company's mission.</p><h4>Second Year at Brandeis</h4><p>As difficult as it was, that summer at Ginger.io was transformative for my education. I was determined to be better prepared for the next opportunity.</p><p>Suddenly, it was obvious which courses I should take. It was obvious which modules I needed to pay close attention to. I still managed to take a few Computational Linguistics courses, but I added other electives like Databases and Web Development. </p><p>As the year wound down, I felt vastly more prepared for professional software engineering than I had the previous summer. Letting the challenges of my internship guide my education was one of the most effective things I've done.</p><h4>Interviewing</h4><p>Many people have written about the software industry's interviewing practices. I won't dwell on that, except to say that it ain't no fun.</p><p>The process is long, emotionally fraught, and exhausting. As many as …</p></div></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
<p>June 20, 2020</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://blog.kdubovikov.ml/articles/hardware/build-yourself-a-weather-station">previous post</a>, we have covered the hardware setup for building a weather station. Starting from now, we will start coding. The first missing piece is the firmware for ESP32.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>This firmware should read the data from BME280 and publish it to the MQTT topic. For ESP32 we have two options: using the Arduino framework or ESP-IDF. While Arduino is extremely popular and easy to use, I have decided to go with ESP-IDF for the following reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Although lower level, it gives you more control over the chip</li>
  <li>It packs a lot of functionality and is <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html">well-documented</a>. Look the features <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/index.html">here</a></li>
  <li>It has a <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/master/examples">set of examples</a> that demonstrate how you can work with the framework</li>
  <li>It has a configurable build system that allows you to create independent components that can be used by other developers.</li>
  <li>It supports <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/jtag-debugging/debugging-examples.html?highlight=debug">debugging</a> and <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/unit-tests.html?highlight=test">unit-testing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Arduino hides a lot of complexity and requires less boilerplate code, but ESP-IDF is something that you will have more changes using in more serious projects so we will go with it to put ourselves in more realistic conditions.</p>



<p>You can find the complete code at <a href="https://github.com/kdubovikov/weather-station-esp">github repository</a>.</p>



<p>ESP-IDF is written in C. If you are not familiar with the language, just go through <a href="https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/c/">Learn C in Y minutes</a>, it will give you a good start.</p>

<p>After that, go through <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html">getting started</a> guide at ESP-IDF documentation. It will cover how to download the framework and set up an example project. The most difficult part would be connecting to your ESP32 dev board via USB port. If you are using a Macbook with USB-C ports you will need to use a USB-C to USB adapter and a micro USB cable. I had no success with any kind of hub, but a simple adapter cable worked just fine.</p>

<figure><figcaption></figcaption><img src="https://blog.kdubovikov.ml/assets/img/esp32-weather-station/post-2/usb-c.jpg"></figure>

<p>Be sure to install drivers, as advised on this <a href="https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/establish-serial-connection.html">documentation page</a>. For Macbook pro you will need <a href="https://www.silabs.com/products/development-tools/software/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers">CP210x drivers from Silicon Labs</a>.</p>

<p>The reason you need drivers is that your computer does not understand the language ESP32 speaks. ESP32 transfers data to the external world using a serial protocol <label for="1"></label><span>Serial protocol  means that data is transferred one bit at a time. The I2C protocol that we were discussing in the previous post is a serial protocol. On the opposite side are parallel protocols, which  use multiple wires to transmit several bits at once </span> named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RS-232">RS-232</a>. To bridge serial interface with the USB interface your devboard uses a special bridge chip that acts as a protocol converter. In the case of my board, it is the CP210x. The problem is that your computer does not know how to handle data from your devboard. It assumes that it receives data encoded by some of the standard data transfer protocols of the USB world. Thunderbolt, for example. And in reality, it receives data encoded by a bridge chip. To solve this linguistic inconvenience you install a special driver that decodes signals from the bridge chip and masquerades itself as a virtual COM <label for="2"></label><span>COM port is a computers serial inferface. Those ports were pretty common in desktop PCs but are long absent from modern laptops. Operating systems still have drivers for COM devices, so that’s a natural choice for emulating serial communication </span> device.</p>



<p>We will write a firmware that will follow <strong>the visious cycle of weather measurment</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Connect to a WiFi network</li>
  <li>Connect to MQTT server</li>
  <li>Read data from BME280 sensor</li>
  <li>Publish the newly read data to the MQTT topic</li>
  <li>Go in deep sleep and wake after several hours to repeat all steps starting from 1</li>
</ol>



<p>To continue, you may clone <a href="https://github.com/kdubovikov/weather-station-esp">this repository</a> and explore the code along with the post. The code is separated into 4 main modules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>weather_station.c</code> — the primary module that implements <strong>the</strong> <strong>vicious cycle of weather measurement</strong></li>
  <li><code>wifi.c</code> — everything related to WiFi connectivity</li>
  <li><code>sensor.c</code>— the code for reading data from BME280 using I2C protocol</li>
  <li><code>mqtt.c</code> — the code for connecting and publishing messages to MQTT server</li>
</ul>

<p>All modules are stored in the <a href="https://github.com/kdubovikov/weather-station-esp/tree/master/main">main</a> folder. We’ll also need to mention our modules in the <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> so that ESP-IDF’s build system would understand that we need all those source files to compile the project:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>idf_component_register(SRCS "weather_station.c" "wifi.c" "sensor.c" "mqtt.c"
                       INCLUDE_DIRS ".")
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, lets dive into each module and see how it works.</p>

<h2 id="connecting-to-wifi">Connecting to WiFi</h2>

<p>To build this module, I have borrowed heavily from the <a href="https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/release/v4.0/examples/wifi/getting_started/station">WiFi example</a> provided by the framework. In fact, the project was based on this template. The original example connects to the WiFi asynchronously, but a blocking call that waits until we got an IP address from the access point will be useful to us since we want to wait for a WiFi connection before going on and connecting to the MQTT server.</p>

<p>To create a blocking function we’ll use a handy <code>EventGroup</code> functionality from the FreeRTOS<label for="3"></label><span>Free Real Time Operating System contains lots of useful primitives for dealing with concurrency, multiprocessing and synchronization </span>. Events groups allow you to define an event which you can wait for in any other part of your code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Define an event</span>

<p><code>xEventGroupWaitBits</code> is what <code>wifi_connect_blocking</code> function uses to block and wait while the board will establish a wifi connection.</p>

<p>All WiFi-related code is located at the <code>wifi.c</code> file. The best function to start with is <code>wifi_connect_blocking</code></p>

<p>You can notice that we are registering WiFi event handlers that do the actual logic like this: <code>esp_event_handler_register(WIFI_EVENT, ESP_EVENT_ANY_ID, &amp;wifi_event_handler, connected_event_group)</code>. The first two parameters scope our handler to catch any WiFi-related events with <code>wifi_event_handler</code> referenced by the third parameter. <code>connected_event_group</code> will be passed as an argument to the handler. Now, let’s look at how the handler works:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>/**

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The main purpose of the handler is to wait for the board to get a successful connection and fire <code>WIFI_CONNECTED_BITS</code> event to the event group.</p>

<p>The next important part is to make readings from our BME280 sensor, so let’s explore how to do that.</p>

<h2 id="reading-data-from-the-sensor">Reading data from the sensor</h2>

<p>Thanks to the great <a href="https://github.com/UncleRus/esp-idf-lib">esp-idf-lib</a> component library there is only a single function related to the BME280. The library contains a ready to work component that interfaces with the sensor, so we don’t need to write low-level I2C communication code ourselves. The creators of the library took If you want to study implemented all required procedures from the datasheet, including a compensation algorithm so that we have a simple interface to work with. If you want to study how this works, then refer to the B<a href="https://github.com/UncleRus/esp-idf-lib/blob/master/components/bmp280/bmp280.c">MP280 …</a></p></article></div>

<p>Historically, gerontocracy has not gone well. The USSR in the early 1980s, China in the 1900s, Austria heading into WW1: if you look around you and the people in charge are all very old, expect turbulence.<br></p><p>The reasons from this range from the poetic to the dry and actuarial.</p><p><b>First, gerontocracy represents a failure of imagination.</b> Time horizons become compressed. It's rare for an 80 year old to start a brand new project. People at that age naturally want to <i>complete</i> some vision. Whatever dissonance they still feel in their own story, they want to see it resolve. They want closure. This is actually a beautiful impulse, but when too much power ends up in the hands of people who are heads-down finishing their final chapter, it sucks the air out of the room and leaves no space for new ideas.<br></p><div><p><b>Second, it represents a process failure.</b> Every society has a process for generational transfer, renewal, some kind of changing of the guard. When the seats of power are filled with people over 75, it's direct evidence that this process has stopped working.</p><p><b>Third, it predicts disruption.</b> Someone who's 40, elected to an 8-year term in office, has a 97% chance of being able to finish.[1] A 60-year-old has a 90% chance. Someone who's 80 today, a coin flip. And those numbers don't count all the other things that can go wrong, short of dying in office. Reagan had Alzheimer's towards the end of his presidency. When those things happen, real decision-making shifts from leaders to other, less publicly accountable people around them. The shift can be gradual and subtle. History shows it to be dangerous.</p></div><p><b>And ultimately, gerontocracy rusts the gears, and government kind of... seizes up.</b><br>

        <p>There’s a project I worked on some time ago that provided me one of the most pleasant experiences I had.
When I say pleasant, I mean it in the project management sense.</p>
<p>The work itself wasn’t that fancy:
I had to migrate a lot of machines to a new system.
Nothing cutting edge, no new products, just some migration to a much better system that
would allow us to control the machines smoothly.
The trick is that these machines were serving a really big number of customers,
and we couldn’t just stop them.
On top of that, the code running on the machines was in some cases over 10 years old,
and of course we didn’t have a single person with knowledge about the entire thing.</p>
<p>I don’t really want to talk about the technical side of the project because it’s boring:
you perform a few tests with machines not serving production traffic,
then you start to slowly roll out the migration to machines serving customers,
you’ll then learn of a few scenarios you missed because
the scale of the traffic you tested with wasn’t big enough
(a good problem to have?),
and then you figure out how to deal with that,
incorporate the learnings into the product code,
and resume the migration.</p>
<p>What I want to focus on, though, is my experience leading this migration,
and why I think this was a very pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Given the nature of the problem,
it was somewhat easy to convince management that
there really wasn’t a timeline we could realistically follow.
Machine migrations take time, you need to do it under heavy control to
avoid cases where too many machines are brought offline and you’re unable to serve your traffic.
Sometimes, you’ll also need to replace certain machines,
because they could have some underlying issues that you just can’t
manually investigate due to the scale (this was a migration of over 20,000 machines).
We also had 2 people dedicated on this,
and we knew we’d hit some roadblocks along the way,
but we didn’t really know which ones.
Nobody knew 100% of the code running on the machines,
as it was a really big codebase.</p>
<p>Even though management was ok without some kind of “hard” deadline,
we still aimed at moving things as fast as possible.
Some prep work would need to be done before the migration,
and since we’re talking about a Big N company here,
you can imagine all kinds of internal systems we had to mess around with to make this possible.</p>
<p>Here’s the really nice part:
I felt like the other person working on this project was completely in sync with me.
They didn’t know everything involved in the migration
(I handled a lot of human coordination transparently for them),
but they knew enough about the code running on the machines to
understand all the prep work we’d need.
They knew about some edge cases we’d need to cover.
When talking about the initial steps for this project,
things went so well and we finished discussing so quickly that I
even became worried they hadn’t understood some of the things we’d need to do.
I let them roll with it, though,
and when reviewing the code patches I was really surprised:
in the few minutes we talked about the prep stuff,
we’d synced about the approaches to take,
and then we just started doing it.
Contrast this to either of the following two (way more common) scenarios I encountered in the past:
someone needs a lot of help to understand parts of the code or the system,
and needs some mentoring to figure things out;
or someone holds some strong beliefs about the way things should be done,
and an unproductive discussion arises about how to do things,
when pretty much every alternative proposed is good enough and there is just no right answer.</p>
<p>When we found a roadblock, syncing up was also so easy and smooth,
because nobody held any strong opinions on which approach to take.
We knew which alternatives would solve the problem,
and we favored gettings things done rather than finding some mythical
perfect solution.
Reporting on the progress of the migration was also pretty smooth.
We kept a simple spreadsheet with a bunch of information of things that were already done,
and things that still needed to be done,
and both of us dedicated a few minutes every day to update things there.
If we were to track those using the company’s task management system,
it would’ve taken ages to update information the same way we did with the spreadsheet.
There were days we didn’t even talk at all,
because we were aware of what needed to be done,
and we knew what things were already done just by looking at a somewhat simple table.
No standups required.</p>
<p>Overall, working with this person felt like I was just working with an extension of myself.
I say this in the good sense.
Working with people all in the same mindset might skew projects towards some
below average solutions and not bring enough diversity to the table.
This wasn’t the case here.
We both thought about different approaches to solve the problems we faced,
but we also knew well how to evaluate them,
and knew when they were good enough and discussing more wouldn’t help much.</p>
<p>After we finished this project,
I realized that I had become addicted to the way this project was going.
It was just so pleasant that I didn’t want it to end.
To this day, I still regularly think about this project,
and wonder if I’ll ever be part of or help build a team full of people like this.
Is this how high performing teams work?
Is this how working at very productive companies feels like?
If it is, I want more of it.</p>

<p>I love to read about how great people accomplish great things. It’s similar to getting advice — I’m left with a high. I imagine that if I can follow the instructions, then I too will accomplish what they have. It’s a logical and tantalizing idea: follow the prescription, get the reward. In practice, it tends to fall short.</p>



<p>Kapil Gupta and Naval did a <a href="https://youtu.be/sBtuqpNZwio" data-rel="lightbox-video-0">great interview</a> where they touched on this pitfall. </p>



<p>The catch is, to achieve something truly remarkable, you have to do something new. It’s practically in the definition. Copying others can help you learn a domain. Imitation is good practice. But to do something new — to create art — you inevitably have to write your own script.</p>



<p>I expanded on these thoughts in a <a href="https://twitter.com/garybasin/status/1274859897826488322?s=19">Twitter thread here</a>, also touching on how prescriptions can act like false Gods.</p>

      <h2>A hypothesis by August Steimann, Würzburg </h2>
      <p>In 1939, Paul Kosok from the Long Island University (New York) examined the <a href="http://www.unmuseum.org/nazca.htm" target="_blank">huge soil drawings</a> after he flew over the high arid plateau of Peru. Most of the drawings, which only can  be seen from the air, were first discovered when aircraft started flying over the high desert in the 1920s. They are located between the towns of Nasca and Palpa, about 400 km south of Lima. Some are 10 km long lines, areas up to 1 km in size, and depictions of animals up to 300 meters in size. Their origin is dated between 500 BC and 1300 AD and most of them were classed as being from the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazca_culture" title="wikipedia" target="_blank">Nazca civilisation</a>. The symbols resulted by removing  the ferric oxide coloured stones, revealing the dusty yellow soil. </p>
      <p>There is no conclusive explanation for the drawings. At this moment <a href="http://www.dainst.org/index.php?id=593&amp;sessionLanguage=en" target="_blank">several research programs</a> are concerned with the soil drawings. Different hypotheses claim that the symbols have an astronomical or geological function or are places of worship,  or are said to be connected with visits of beings from outer space. </p>
      <p>A surprising hypothesis is the one of August Steimann. His hypothesis fits into the museum's understanding of aviation. Steimann visited Peru decades ago, when the soil drawings were little known. </p>
      <p>Our thanks to Mr. Steimann for his kind permission to publish the following text in our online archives. The author placed photos and drawings at the museum's disposal as well. </p>

      <p>In the area surrounding of the city of Nasca in Peru the surface of the high plateau desert like pampa was changed to show  huge depiction of figures. They are called "soil drawings" or "Geoglyphs". </p>
      <p>Most of them are straight lines, triangular or square spaces and depictions of figures. They can hardly be seen from the ground but very well by people who fly over them. The changes of the surface appear to be "Geoglyphs," clearly visible from the air.</p>
      <p><img src="http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/images/stei1_32.jpg" alt="Foto Steimann"></p>
      
      <p>Figures clearly visible from the air.</p>
      
      <p>There are neither written records nor oral legends testifying to the meaning of the soil drawings. The geoglyphs are obviously from a pre-Inca period. Considering the style of the figures they can be assigned to the Nazca civilisation. The ground was changed about 1,000 to 1,500 years ago. Because of the lack of records testifying to their meaning there are several hypotheses. In my opinion they are not true or the given explanations are of little importance. None of the hypotheses explains the different changes of the ground in their relation to each other as indications of a function. </p>
      <p>That is why I offer totally new hypothesis. </p>
      <p>- 1 -</p>
      <p> The people of the Nazca civilisation were able to fly kites that could take off and land while being tied to a rope. And they could even land without being tethered, similar to a hang glider. In spite of their Stone Age civilisation the Nasca had the technical prerequisites for the production of such kites through their manufacture of threads and fabric, known from many grave discoveries. The known two <a href="http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/esoest.htm">thousand years old history of manned kites</a> in Asia also supports this possibility. </p>
      <p>- 2 -</p>
      <p>        Depictions on pottery and textiles of the Nazca civilisation (including the Paracus findings) present in a conspicuous way gliding and falling figures. These depictions show that the people who made them were familiar with the concept of gliding and falling (even when they themselves did not belong to the "flying people").<br>
        A systematic evaluation of the depictions of findings from a "technical flight " point of view has not been done so far. Flying with kites was not assumed until now. </p>
      
      <p><img src="http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/images/stei1_40.jpg" alt="Foto Steimann"></p>
      
      <p>Depiction of a winged figure on textiles of the Nazca civilisation</p>
      <p>- 3 -</p>
      <p>        The changes of the ground are the remains of a system of paths and areas that had a function for the taking off and landing and for the orientation of flying people. Thanks to the special meteorological conditions the lines close to Nasca have been quite well preserved for more than a thousand years. That is how it is possible to reconstruct the method of flying. </p>
      <p><img src="http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/images/stei1_35.jpg" alt="Foto Steimann">        </p>
      
      <p>Geoglyphs in the Peruvian Pampas</p>
      <p>- 4 -</p>
      <p>        In order to be able to fly, a kite has to be lifted by a current of air. If the current is strong enough, it is possible to lift a heavy object, with a rope tied to a kite, when at a suitable diagonal. Flying a kite is a popular game for children. If the wind is too weak, the current can be supplemented by raising the kite and running very fast against the wind. </p>
      <p>- 5 -</p>
      <p>        The area close to Nasca was strewn with sharp-edged stones. In order to be able to run very fast against the wind, it was necessary to take away all the<a href="http://www.tboeckel.de/EFSF/efsf_ps/nazca/gesamt.htm" target="_blank"> inconvenient stones in line</a> with the direction of the prevailing wind. We construct runways for aircraft today for the same reason. </p>
      <p><img src="http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/images/stei1_13.jpg" alt="Foto Steimann"></p>
      
      <p>Close up of the soil drawings</p>
      
      
      <p>In that way paths were built for the unhindered lifting up of the kites. Because of the several prevailing directions of the wind the "lines" were laid out in different directions. The troublesome stones were thrown aside.</p>
      <p>- 6 -</p>
      <p>Larger kites, especially kites that would lift loads, needed long, straight paths for groups of fast running people who pulled the kite rope. There are single and parallel double paths (see picture) close to Nasca. So two parallel groups of fast runners could help the kite take-off by pulling it up. </p>
      <p><img src="http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/images/stei2_41.gif" alt="Skizze Steimann"></p>
      <p>- 7 -</p>
      <p> The strong solar radiation in the Nasca area creates vertical thermals,  wind currents with a strong lifting effect. But these have their strongest effect above the weaker, horizontal ground winds. Kites that are taken above these ground winds can be lifted higher by the thermal currents than by the fast running helpers on the ground. </p>
      <p>- 8 -</p>
      <p> Even humans can be loaded and lifted up if the kite has a suitable size. In the 19th century, such manned kites were used by the military in Europe. During the first phase convicted prisoners could have been lifted up. As soon as some of them reached the ground alive after riding in the kite, some volunteers would have tried to fly the kites. Apart from the practical usage it is conceivable that the technique was used for ceremonial and religious rituals or for demonstration of power. </p>
      <p>- 9 -</p>
      <p> <img src="http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/images/stei2_09.jpg" alt="Foto Steimann">A landing of the tethered kite can be implemented by pulling in the rope. In the area of the weaker ground winds it is dangerous for the people or a load to be attached to the kite, because it is possible that unexpected movements of the flying machine can lead to damage. This can be prevented by people who assemble for the landing. But for this purpose they needed more space than the width of the paths. At Nasca the ends of many paths were cleared of the stones and widened into larger areas, a reason explaining why the paths end in triangles or trapeziums.</p>
      
      <p>- 10 -</p>
      <p> In addition to the triangular and trapezium widening of the paths, there are huge square areas close to Nasca. The huge areas are suitable for practising taking off and landing of kites in different wind directions. They allow greater movements in several directions. So the cleared areas might have served among other purposes as "practise areas."</p>
      <p>- 11 -</p>
      <p> People who learn how to fly a tethered kite and become familiar with the unusual state of flight - compelled or voluntary - will learn through experience that their body movements will affect the flight. <br>
        The modern hang glider is steered by changing the position of the centre of gravity through a stiff trapezium like steering system used by the person hanging below the glider. In the course of the flights with tethered kites during the Nazca period, people hanging below the kite  could have developed the skill to change the attitude of the airfoil in the wind. This turns a kite into a hang glider that only has to be freed from the ropes in order to become a controlled, free flying kite. The development of the hang glider forty years ago occurred exactly this way. <br>
        Strong slope (ridge) and thermal updrafts are able to reduce or even to overcome the rate of descent, so that the kite is able to rise. The strong solar radiation in the desert at Nasca produces very strong thermal updrafts. The <a href="http://www.lilienthal-museum.de/olma/esoest.htm#first">turning of a tethered kite into a free flying</a>, steerable hang glider could have been possible with the technical skills of the Nazca civilisation. </p>
      <p>- 12 -</p>
      <p> During a free flight in strong updrafts, winds can carry the aircraft far  from the paths and landing helpers. That is why landmarks are necessary in order to find quickly the way back to the accompanying ground group. Such orientation above the gray brown desert with no natural landmarks is hardly possible. But the needed landmarks can be easily made by the same method that was used for the building of the paths - by taking away the top soil and stones. Because the landmarks need to be clearly distinguishable from the straight paths and areas and need to be easily seen, depictions of figures are obvious choices. <br>
        Close to Nasca depictions of animals, plants, helixes and other symbols were …</p></section></article></div>

				<div>
					<div>
<p><span>When I was 10 years old and first introduced to the miracle of the World Wide Web, chat rooms were by far my favorite thing. Talking to random people from all over the world about anything you want — what more could a bored kid ask for?</span></p>

<p><span>I’d spend hours in these chat rooms, asking my new friends how old they were, what they had for breakfast, and how much pocket money their parents gave them. I shared this experience with a friend who didn’t own a computer and had never used the internet.</span></p>

<p><span>He asked if he could have a go. “Sure!” I said, excited for him to experience the wonder of the internet. Without hesitation, he began typing the worst insults and swear words he could think of. Horrified I had awoken a dark and malevolent force, and fearing he had forever ruined my friendship with strawberry88, I shut down my computer and didn’t invite him to play on the internet again.</span></p>

<p><span>To this day, I remain baffled by this behavior. When faced with the endless possibility of the internet, my childhood friend’s first impulse was to verbally abuse strangers. This innocent 10-year-old had become a troll.</span></p>

<h4 id="02ff"><span>Wretched impulses</span></h4>

<p><span>John Oliver once described the internet as a “dark carnival of humanity’s most wretched impulses.” Was it these wretched impulses that had consumed my childhood friend?</span></p>

<p><span>The act of trolling is best described from where its name&nbsp;<a href="https://www.etymonline.com/word/troll" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">may have come from</a>&nbsp;— the form of fishing where a lure is dangled off a moving boat.</span></p>

<figure><span><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/3200/0*f3HYZpvSGgrg1vHC" alt=""></span></figure>

<p><span>The troll casts his bait (the offensive comment) into the water of the internet. An unsuspecting fish (the targeted user) sees the bait and feels compelled to go for it (the defensive comment). Soon they are hooked and reeled in without mercy. But unlike trolling for fish, which delivers a clear and edible reward, the troll’s reward isn’t entirely clear.</span></p>

<p><span>Trolling is a hard concept to define because there are various methods of trolling and differing degrees of depravity. Some are abhorrent, like “suicide baiting,” where trolls encourage vulnerable users to kill themselves, or “RIP trolls” who vandalize Facebook memorial sites of the recently deceased. But others, like “griefers” who play online games in a manner that purposely disrupts other players, are more of a nuisance.</span></p>

<p><span>Who are these trolls, and what drives them?</span></p>

<h4 id="4d5f"><span>The dark tetrad</span></h4>

<p><span>Psychologists have found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886914000324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a link between trollish behavior</a>&nbsp;and a set of personality traits called “the dark tetrad.”</span></p>

<figure><span><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2974/0*sAMy6kU4hSsBKYQy" alt=""></span></figure>

<p><span>The dark tetrad comprises:</span></p>

<ul>
<li><span>Sadism — deriving pleasure from another’s pain</span></li>
<li><span>Psychopathy — impairment of empathy and remorse</span></li>
<li><span>Machiavellianism — manipulative and emotionally “cold” behavior</span></li>
<li><span>Narcissism — self-involvement and a need for admiration</span></li>
</ul>

<p><span><a href="https://www.academia.edu/41115419/Loneliness_moderates_the_relationship_between_Dark_Tetrad_personality_traits_and_internet_trolling" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a recent study</a>, trolls were positively correlated with three of the four dark tetrad traits, with narcissism being the odd one out. They found trolls were manipulative, lacked empathy, and enjoyed hurting others. Men exhibited these traits more commonly than women and were more likely to troll. Loneliness was also a significant predictor of trolling when in the presence of Machiavellianism or psychopathy.</span></p>

<p><span>Most studies on trolls use internet surveys to collect data, which is questionable: Can we really trust trolls to complete surveys accurately? This method may also not account for those who don’t consider their behavior to be trollish or those unaware of their trollish behavior.</span></p>

<p><span>In the book&nbsp;<a href="https://www.hardiegrant.com/au/publishing/bookfinder/book/troll-hunting-by-ginger-gorman/9781743794357" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Troll Hunting</em></a>, journalist Ginger Gorman spends years building relationships with the worst trolls she can find in an attempt to understand what drives them. To her surprise, trolls were not uneducated lost souls who lacked social skills and lived in their mother’s basement. These trolls had partners, children, and full-time jobs. They showed leadership skills as commanders of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2019/jan/28/it-was-like-being-skinned-alive-ginger-gorman-goes-hunting-for-trolls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">large trolling syndicates</a>. They were socially intelligent and able to pinpoint users’ weaknesses with vicious precision. But what was driving them?</span></p>

<p><span>Many saw trolling as a hobby — something that entertained or amused. Some were ideologically driven, attacking anybody opposing their belief system. But both types of troll tended to engage users that threatened their beliefs or sense of self.</span></p>

<p><span>Some of the trolls exhibited dark tetrad traits. In these trolls, she saw a common pattern — excessive internet use with little to no parental supervision between the ages of 11 and 16. But some trolls didn’t fit the dark tetrad personality type. These trolls were pleasant, friendly, and compassionate when she engaged them directly. How could these trolls behave so antisocially online yet appear to function as typical members of society offline?</span></p>

<h4 id="7160"><span>Empathy deficit</span></h4>

<p><span>The human brain was primarily designed for face-to-face interaction. It hasn’t had time to adapt to communication over the internet.</span></p>

<p><span>Nonverbal communication — facial expressions, gestures, and voice qualities — provides the precise social context of an interaction. While the claim that 93% of communication being nonverbal is&nbsp;<a href="https://cornerstone.lib.mnsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=ctamj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inaccurate</a>, it is a crucial part of how we communicate. Words alone can only go so far. Even if we used the full&nbsp;<a href="https://englishlive.ef.com/blog/language-lab/many-words-english-language/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">170,000 words</a>&nbsp;currently in use in the English language, we still couldn’t convey what an expressive face or a suggestive voice could.</span></p>

<p><span>Most internet discussions only allow words. Well, words and emojis and GIFs and stickers and all the other substitutes created to replace nonverbal cues.</span></p>

<p><span>If you say something mean to my face and make me cry, you will probably start to feel uncomfortable. Unless you’re especially mean or psychopathic, my distress will trigger an empathic response and lead you to have mercy. If you tweet something mean and make me cry, no amount of emojis can convey what the sight of a grown man weeping can. If there is no social cue to elicit an empathic response, you might continue your tirade of meanness.</span></p>

<p><span>The absence of nonverbal feedback leads to an “empathy deficit,” and this is what sociopaths suffer from.</span></p>

<h4 id="53a2"><span>Toxic disinhibition</span></h4>

<p><span>When you combine an empathy deficit with the anonymity of online interactions, you get “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_disinhibition_effect" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">toxic disinhibition</a>,” which is more than just the phenomenon of being rude to bar staff after that fifth shot of tequila.</span></p>

<p><span>Anonymity can lead to “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deindividuation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deindividuation</a>” — a temporary loss of one’s identity leading to behavior incongruent with one’s character. It explains why groups of civilized people can engage in riots. It also explains trolling. If a lack of nonverbal cues is what makes us detached from the other person’s suffering, deindividuation is what makes us detached from the awareness of our misconduct.</span></p>

<p><span>True anonymity offers protection from real-world social repercussions, and this has profound effects on human behavior. The image-based bulletin board 4chan, where registration isn’t possible and users remain anonymous, has been&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/4chan-raids-how-one-dark-corner-of-the-internet-is-spreading-its-shadows-68394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">infamous as a troll incubator</a>&nbsp;for this reason. When there are no real-world consequences to your actions, it liberates you from a lifetime of societally inhibited behaviors. Society discourages antisocial behavior and encourages prosocial behavior, so it is antisocial behavior that seeks liberation.</span></p>

<p><span>We are a delicate balance between prosocial humans and antisocial primates. When society cannot enforce prosocial human behavior, the antisocial primate may come back into power. And thus the troll is created.</span></p>

<h4 id="f597"><span>Troll begets troll</span></h4>

<p><span>Researchers at Stanford and Cornell universities performed a large-scale data analysis on&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5791909/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 16 million comments</a>&nbsp;from December 2012 to August 2013 on CNN.com and found 1 in 4 posts flagged as abusive were from users with no prior record of trollish behavior. This suggests trolling isn’t always a full-time occupation and that one may indulge sporadically.</span></p>

<p><span>The researchers could predict the likelihood of trolling based on the nature of other comments in the discussion and the user’s mood. If earlier comments were negative, the propensity to troll was greater. Like a bad mood, trolling is contagious. All it takes is another user’s trollish comment and a bad mood to create an environment in which our inner troll can blossom.</span></p>

<h4 id="b294"><span>The inner troll</span></h4>

<p><span>It is easier to view trolls as bad apples than see them as something inside all of us, waiting for the right environment to let loose. But when we condemn trolls as inherently malicious individuals, we limit our understanding of what may drive these behaviors.</span></p>

<p><span>While RIP trolls or suicide baiters are likely to be dark tetrad personality types who use the internet as an outlet to indulge their darkest impulses, lesser trolls may be part-time participants who will engage with the right combination of a bad day and a noxious environment. We have only begun to scratch the surface in our understanding of trolls, but the evidence we have suggests we may all be vulnerable.</span></p>

<p><span>Is anyone exempt from toxic disinhibition? Few respond to a tweet that offends them with “Excuse me, I really don’t want to be rude, but if I may could I please respectfully disagree with your opinion for these reasons …” While an offhand remark may appear harmless, the less empathic our online interactions collectively become, the greater risk we all stand of becoming trolls. The gentle ripples of impolite tweets may become crashing toxic waves of disinhibited hatred.</span></p>

<p><span>Trolling isn’t black and white, it is somewhere in the grey between prosocial human and antisocial primate. Ultimately, our propensity for antisocial behavior in the physical world is likely to predict similar online behavior.</span></p>

<h4 id="9272"><span>How can we manage our inner trolls?</span></h4>

<p><span>The more accountable we are for our behavior, the less potential we have of becoming trolls. Employing&nbsp;<a href="https://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/41373/1/paper0224.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less anonymity may help</a>, but this raises privacy concerns for many. Anonymity can also be a good thing. Benign disinhibition — the friendly sibling of toxic disinhibition — is where users freely discuss their deepest insecurities and concerns with other users. This can be very therapeutic and shouldn’t be discouraged. But by using anonymity only where it is necessary, we reduce the likelihood of toxic disinhibition.</span></p>

<p><span>Empathy doesn’t come …</span></p></div></div></div></div>

<p><strong>I.</strong></p>
<p><span>Elon Musk has asserted, accurately in my opinion, that unless humanity becomes a two planet species that we are eventually doomed (absent some greater power out there which saves us, which could </span><a href="https://wearenotsaved.com/2016/08/27/fermis-paradox-as-a-proof-of-the-existence-of-god/"><span>include either God or aliens</span></a><span>). And he has built an entire company, SpaceX, around making sure that this happens (the two planet part, not the doomed part). As I mentioned, I think this is an accurate view of how things will </span><em><span>eventually</span></em><span> work out, but it’s also </span><a href="https://wearenotsaved.com/2017/01/14/how-to-save-humanity/"><span>incredibly costly and difficult</span></a><span>. Is it possible that in the short term we can achieve most of the benefits of a Mars colony with significantly less money and effort? Might this be yet another 80/20 situation, where 80% of the benefits can be achieved for only 20% of the resources?</span></p>
<p><span>In order to answer that question, it would help to get deeper into Musk’s thinking and reasoning behind his push for a self-sustaining outpost on Mars. To quote from the man himself:</span></p>
<p><em><span>I think there are really two fundamental paths. History is going to bifurcate along two directions. One path is we stay on Earth forever, and then there will be some eventual extinction event — I don’t have an immediate doomsday prophecy … just that there will be some doomsday event. The alternative is to become a space-faring civilization and a multiplanet species.</span></em></p>
<p><span>While I agree with Musk that having a colony on Mars will prevent some doomsday scenarios, I’m not sure I agree with his implied assertion that it will prevent all of them, that if we choose the alternative of being a space-faring civilization, that it forever closes off the other alternative of doomsday events. To see why that might be, we need to get into a discussion of what potential doomsdays await us, or to use the more common term, what existential risks, or x-risks are we likely to face?</span></p>
<p><span>If you read my round up of the </span><a href="https://wearenotsaved.com/2020/06/05/books-i-finished-in-may/"><span>books I finished in May</span></a><span>, one of my reviews covered </span><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Precipice-Existential-Risk-Future-Humanity/dp/0316484911"><span>Toby Ord’s book, The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity</span></a><span> which was entirely dedicated to a discussion of this very subject. For those who don’t remember, Ord produced a chart showing what he thought the relative odds were for various potential x-risks. Which I’ll once again include.</span></p>

<p><span>Reviewing this list, which x-risks are entirely avoided by having a self-sustaining colony on Mars? The one it most clearly prevents is the asteroid/comet impact, and indeed that’s the one everyone thinks of. I assume it would also be perfect for protecting humanity from a supervolcanic eruption and a naturally arising pandemic. I’m less clear on how well it would do at protecting humanity from a stellar explosion, but I’m happy to toss that in as well. But you can instantly see the problem with this list, particularly if you read my book review. These are all naturally arising risks, and as a category they’re all far less likely (at least according to Ord) to be the cause of our extinction. What we really need to be hedging against is the category of anthropogenic risks. And it’s not at all clear that a Mars colony is the cheapest or even the best way to do that.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>The risks we’re trying to prevent are often grouped into the general category of “having all of our eggs in one basket”. But just as we don’t want all of our eggs in the “basket” of Earth, I don’t think we want all of our risk mitigation to end up in the “basket” of a Mars colony. To relate it to my </span><a href="https://wearenotsaved.com/2020/06/13/dont-make-the-second-mistake/"><span>last post</span></a><span>, this is very similar to my caution against a situation where we all make the same mistake. Only this time rather than a bunch of independent actors all deciding to independently take the same ultimately catastrophic action, here the consensus happens a little more formally, with massive time and effort put into one great effort. One of the reasons this effort seems safe is that it’s designed to reduce risk, but that doesn’t really matter, it could still be a mistake. A potential mistake which is aggravated by focusing on only one subset of potential x-risks, naturally occurring ones, and this one method for dealing with them, a Mars Colony. In other words in attempting to avoid making a mistake we risk making a potentially different mistake. The mistake of having too narrow a focus. Surviving the next few hundred years is a hugely complicated problem (one I hope to bring greater attention to by </span><a href="https://wearenotsaved.com/2019/12/14/i-finally-figure-out-what-i-want-to-be-when-i-grow-up-an-eschatologist/"><span>expanding the definition and discipline of eschatology</span></a><span>). And the mistakes we could make are legion. But, in my opinion, focusing on a Mars Colony, as the best and first step in preventing those mistakes </span><em><span>turns out to be a mistake itself</span></em><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong>II.</strong></p>
<p><span>At this point it’s only natural to ask what I would recommend instead. And as a matter of fact I do have a proposal:</span></p>
<p><span>Imagine that instead of going to Mars that we built a couple of large underground bunkers, something similar to NORAD. In fact we might even be able to repurpose, or piggyback on NORAD for one of them. Ideally the other one would be built at roughly the opposite spot on the globe from the first. So maybe something in Australia. Now imagine that you paid a bunch of people to live there for two years. You would of course supply them with everything they needed, entertainment, food, power, etc. In fact as far as food and power you’d want to have as robust a supply of those on hand as you could manage. But as part of it they would be </span><em><span>completely cut off from everything</span></em><span> for those two years, no internet connection, no traffic in our out, no inbound communication of any sort. You would of course have plenty of ways to guarantee the necessities like air, food and water. Basically you make this place as self-contained and robust as possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I say “a bunch of people”, you’d want as many as you could afford, but in essence you want to have enough people in either bunker that </span><em><span>by themselves</span></em><span> they could regenerate humanity if, after some unthinkable tragedy, they were all that remained. The minimum number I’ve seen is 160, with 500 seeming closer to ideal. Also if you wanted to get fancy/clever you could have 80% of the population be female, with lots of frozen sperm. Also it should go without saying that these people should be of prime child bearing age, with a fertility test before they went in.</span></p>
<p><span>Every year you’d alternate which of the bunkers was emptied and refilled with new people. This ensures that neither bunker is empty at the same time and that the period where even one bunker was empty would only be a week or so.</span></p>
<p><span>Beyond all of the foregoing, I’m sure there are many other things one could think of to increase the robustness of these bunkers, but I think you get the idea. So now let’s turn to Ord’s list of x-risks and compare my bunker idea to Musks’ Mars plan.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>All natural risks: Mars is definitely superior, but two things to note, first, even if you combine all possible natural risks together, they only have a 1 in 10,000 chance, according to Ord, of causing human extinction in the next century. I agree that you shouldn’t build a bunker just to protect against natural x-risks, but it also seems like a weak reason to go to Mars as well. Second, don’t underestimate the value the bunker provides even if Ord is wrong and the next giant catastrophe we have to worry about is natural. There are a whole host of disasters one could imagine where having the bunker system I described would be a huge advantage. But, even if it’s not, we’re mostly worried about anthropogenic risks, and it’s when we turn to considering them that the bunker system starts to look like the superior option.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Taking each anthropogenic risk in turn:</span></p>
<p><span>Nuclear war- Bunkers as a protection against nuclear weapons is an idea almost as old as the weapons themselves. Having more of them, and making sure they’re constantly occupied, could only increase their protective value. Also Ord only gives nuclear war a 1 in 1000 chance of being the cause of our extinction, mostly because it would be so hard to </span><strong>completely</strong><span> wipe humanity out. The bunker system would make that even harder. A Mars colony doesn’t seem necessarily any better as a protection against this risk, for one thing how does it end up escaping this hypothetical war? And if it doesn’t, it would seem to be very vulnerable to attack. At least as vulnerable as a hardened bunker and perhaps far more so given the precariousness of any Martian existence.</span></p>
<p><span>Climate Change- I don’t deny the reality of climate change, but I have a hard time picturing how it wipes out every last human. Most people when pressed on this issue say that the disruption it causes leads to Nuclear War, which just takes us back to the last item.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Environmental Damage- Similar to climate change, also if we’re too dumb to prevent these sorts of slow moving extinction events on Earth, what makes you think we’ll do any better on Mars?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Engineered Pandemics- The danger of the engineered pandemic is the malevolent actor behind it, preventing this x-risk means keeping this malevolent actor from infecting everyone, in such a way that we all die. Here the advantage Mars has is its great distance from Earth, meaning you’d have to figure out a way to have a simultaneous outbreak on both planets. The advantage the bunker has is that it’s whole function is to avoid x-risks. Meaning anything that might protect from this sort of threat is not only allowed but expected. The kind of equipment necessary to synthesis a disease? Not allowed in the …</span></p></div></div>

<h3>UI to compose complex sorts</h3>
<p>Previously one has to use <em>order by</em> clause to sort issues, builds and pull requests. Now this task is easier via a smart sort widget. Just select fields to order, and OneDev will compose the query automatically </p>

<h3>Publish and render markdown in build</h3>
<p>Besides ordinary artifacts and html reports, one can also publish markdown in a build process and get it rendered in a separate build tab to make important information explicit</p>

<h3>Rule to transit inactive issues to specified state</h3>
<p>Sometimes it is desirable to transit inactive issues to a certain state, for instance to mark it idle and notify relevant participants, and finally close it if no one cares about it. Now this is possible via a custom state transition rule</p>

					<h3>June 23, 2020</h3>
					<p>At WWDC this year, Apple announced their switch to “<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2020/06/apple-announces-mac-transition-to-apple-silicon/">Apple silicon</a>” for Mac hardware. This had been heavily rumoured for years, and there was a lot of discussion about it. Some worried that Apple would use the transition as an excuse to lock down app delivery further — perhaps only allowing apps to be installed from the Mac App Store.</p>

<p>This didn’t happen. You can still choose to <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT202491">install apps from identified developers</a>, or <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mh40616/mac">install an unsigned app</a> if you trust it. But something else happened instead: Apple announced that iOS apps are coming directly to the Mac. Specifically, Macs that use their new chips and run the upcoming version of macOS, <a href="https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur-preview/">Big Sur</a>.</p>

<p>I’m worried about this. Here’s my thinking.</p>

<p>There are an order of magnitude more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/1/29/18202736/apple-devices-ios-earnings-q1-2019">iOS devices</a> than <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/30/there-are-now-100-million-macs-in-use/">macOS devices</a> in use. I couldn’t find hard numbers, but I’d bet there are similarly way more iOS developers than macOS developers. This makes sense, as iOS is the newer and more exciting platform. Apple focused a lot of attention on iOS since introducing the iPhone, and the Mac became a bit more of a workhorse over time. People still develop apps for macOS, but there have been fewer over time. Also, many new Mac apps are developed with cross-platform tools like Electron.</p>

<p>That Electron piece is interesting. Slack is the poster-child for Electron on desktops, <a href="https://twitter.com/slackhq/status/931599784137363459">but their iOS app is native</a>. Personally, I think the Slack experience on iOS is nicer. With iOS apps coming to Big Sur, it’s not crazy to imagine Slack eventually shipping their iOS app on the Mac instead of the Electron version. Other developers with both macOS and iOS software would be in a similar position.</p>

<p>The thing about those iOS apps is that they have to come from the App Store, even on the Mac. Of course, developers can always choose to use the iOS version as a starting point and build a custom <a href="https://swiftwithmajid.com/2019/10/23/reusing-swiftui-views-across-apple-platforms/">SwiftUI</a>/<a href="https://developer.apple.com/mac-catalyst/">Mac Catalyst</a> version specifically for macOS – but going the easier route will be pretty tempting. Writing something once and publishing for multiple platforms saves on developer time, which is why Slack uses Electron for their desktop apps. It makes sense to put more resources into the version with the bigger audience as well, which probably why I prefer Slack on my iPad.</p>

<p>The worst part is that Apple seems to be doing this themselves. Just before WWDC this year, <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/06/15/apple-developer-app-for-mac/">Apple released a Mac version of their Developer app</a>. It’s a Mac Catalyst port of the iPad version, and <a href="https://pilky.me/apples-developer-app/">it really doesn’t feel at home on macOS</a>. Is it better than nothing? Sure. It just <a href="https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/06/17/developer-app-for-mac">doesn’t fill me with hope</a> for the quality of Mac apps going forward.</p>

<p>Before WWDC, I wasn’t worried about the ARM transition meaning the Mac would go App Store only. Sure, Apple would love for more apps to be in the App Store for security (and monetary) reasons, but the platform needs apps that the App Store can’t support. The whole “iOS apps on the Mac” wasn’t something I saw coming, though. Apple won’t enforce this change, but I worry that developing a “good enough” iOS app for the Mac might become the future of the platform.</p>

June 23, 2020 | https://theconsultingcto.com/posts/bastions-on-demand/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://theconsultingcto.com/posts/bastions-on-demand/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <p>Any time you have a VPC, you’ll likely need some way to gain access to the resources within the VPC from your local box. Typically, the way to do that is to run a bastion (or jumpbox) which you and your team can SSH into. The downside is that you are exposing an entry point into your network that is accessible by multiple people and running 24x7. And depending on how you manage permissions, you may not be able to restrict access to the box via IAM. Obviously, this is not ideal.</p>
<p>Luckily, we have <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/">Fargate</a>.</p>
<p>With Fargate, we no longer need to maintain permanent bastion instances—we can create bastions when needed and tear them down when no longer in use. We can lock down bastion instances to an individual user both in terms of SSH keys and IP address. And we can restrict access via IAM to both the API used to manage bastions and to which SSH keys are used to log into an instance.</p>
<p>All in all, we save on infrastructure spend while reducing our attack surface.</p>
<p>Throughout this guide, I’ll be referencing the code from my <a href="https://github.com/jdhollis/bastions-on-demand/"><code>bastions-on-demand</code></a> repo. If you want to skip the explanation, just clone it and follow the directions in the <a href="https://github.com/jdhollis/bastions-on-demand/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a> to get started.</p>
<p>If you run into any trouble, <a href="https://github.com/jdhollis/bastions-on-demand/issues/new/choose">create an issue</a>, and I’ll respond as best I can.</p>
<p>Otherwise, buckle up. This is going to be a bit in-depth.</p>
<h2 id="architecture">Architecture</h2>
<p>There are two key components to bastions on demand—<a href="https://github.com/jdhollis/bastions-on-demand/tree/master/bastion">the infrastructure for managing the bastion image</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jdhollis/bastions-on-demand/tree/master/service">the bastion service itself</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="#container-infrastructure">container infrastructure</a> consists of an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecr/">ECR</a> repository, a Docker container, an IAM role for fetching a user’s public keys, and scripts for building and pushing images. Typically, I share this infrastructure across multiple services because the requirements don’t vary much. But if a team wants complete service isolation or needs to customize their bastion image, it’s trivial to make that work.</p>
<p>The <a href="#bastion-service">bastion service</a> consists of an <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ecs/">ECS</a> task, a task role that enables access to any required resources, an API to create and destroy bastion instances, and a set of scripts to make it easy for team members to do just that. The bastion service module should be included in any service that needs bastions—keep it in the service’s repository for ease of access and deploy it alongside the parent service.</p>
<p>Naturally, all of this infrastructure is managed with <a href="https://www.terraform.io/">Terraform</a>.</p>
<p>I owe a debt of gratitude to the following authors as they provided valuable examples that helped me develop this approach:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://ig.nore.me/2018/07/serverless-bastions-on-demand/">Serverless Bastions on Demand</a> &amp; <a href="https://github.com/ArjenSchwarz/workshop-fargate-bastion">ArjenSchwarz/workshop-fargate-bastion</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/alex0ptr/fargate-bastion">alex0ptr/fargate-bastion</a></li>
<li><a href="https://cloudonaut.io/manage-aws-ec2-ssh-access-with-iam/">Manage AWS EC2 SSH access with IAM</a></li>
</ul>
<p>While I recommend using multiple AWS accounts for security and isolation, in this guide, I’m going to use a single account so that we can focus on the essentials. If there’s interest, I will address how to modify this approach for use with multiple accounts in a separate guide. Everything in this guide assumes you’re using the <code>default</code> profile, but you can override via the <code>AWS_PROFILE</code> environment variable.</p>
<p>I’m also deliberately not using <a href="https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote.html">Terraform remote state</a> in this guide to make it easier for you to try out my code. If you’re going to use this in a live account, you absolutely should use remote state—insert your own backend configuration where appropriate. And if you don’t have a remote backend, have a look at my <a href="https://github.com/jdhollis/remote-state">remote-state</a> repo for an example of how to set one up on S3 with DynamoDB and KMS.</p>
<p>Now, let’s get started.</p>
<h2 id="initial-setup">Initial Setup</h2>
<p>If you haven’t already, create a role for API Gateway logging:</p>
<section>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>data</span> <span>"aws_iam_policy_document" "assume_role"</span> {
  <span>statement</span> {
    actions <span>=</span> [<span>"sts:AssumeRole"</span>]

    <span>principals</span> {
      identifiers <span>=</span> [<span>"apigateway.amazonaws.com"</span>]
      type        <span>=</span> <span>"Service"</span>
    }
  }
}

<span>data</span> <span>"aws_iam_policy_document" "logger"</span> {
  <span>statement</span> {
    actions <span>=</span> [
      <span>"logs:CreateLogGroup"</span>,
      <span>"logs:CreateLogStream"</span>,
      <span>"logs:DescribeLogGroups"</span>,
      <span>"logs:DescribeLogStreams"</span>,
      <span>"logs:FilterLogEvents"</span>,
      <span>"logs:GetLogEvents"</span>,
      <span>"logs:PutLogEvents"</span>,
    ]

    resources <span>=</span> [<span>"*"</span>]
  }
}

<span>resource</span> <span>"aws_iam_role" "logger"</span> {
  name               <span>=</span> <span>"api-gateway-cloudwatch-logger"</span>
  assume_role_policy <span>=</span> <span>data</span>.<span>aws_iam_policy_document</span>.<span>assume_role</span>.<span>json</span>
}

<span>resource</span> <span>"aws_iam_role_policy" "logger"</span> {
  name   <span>=</span> <span>"api-gateway-cloudwatch-logger"</span>
  policy <span>=</span> <span>data</span>.<span>aws_iam_policy_document</span>.<span>logger</span>.<span>json</span>
  role   <span>=</span> <span>aws_iam_role</span>.<span>logger</span>.<span>name</span>
}

<span>resource</span> <span>"aws_api_gateway_account" "global"</span> {
  cloudwatch_role_arn <span>=</span> <span>aws_iam_role</span>.<span>logger</span>.<span>arn</span>
}
</code></pre></div>  
</section>
<p>Logging API Gateway access is a good idea in general. Unfortunately, this is a global account setting, so use with caution. API Gateway has a lot of stateful corners. I typically manage this logger in a separate repository since it’s shared across all services running in an account.</p>
<h2 id="container-infrastructure">Container Infrastructure</h2>
<p>Creating the ECR repository is straightforward:</p>
<section>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>resource</span> <span>"aws_ecr_repository" "bastion"</span> {
  name <span>=</span> <span>"bastion"</span>
}
</code></pre></div>  
</section>
<p>Next we need to create a role that can fetch a user’s public keys.</p>
<section>
<div><pre><code data-lang="hcl"><span>data</span> <span>"aws_caller_identity" "env"</span> {}<span>
</span><span>
</span><span># …
</span><span></span>
<span>data</span> <span>"aws_iam_policy_document" "assume_role"</span> {
  <span>statement</span> {
    actions <span>=</span> [<span>"sts:AssumeRole"</span>]

    <span>principals</span> {
      identifiers <span>=</span> [<span>"arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.env.account_id}:root"</span>]
      type        <span>=</span> <span>"AWS"</span>
    }
  }
}

<span>data</span> <span>"aws_iam_policy_document" "public_key_fetcher"</span> {
  <span>statement</span> {
    actions <span>=</span> [
      <span>"iam:GetSSHPublicKey"</span>,
      <span>"iam:ListSSHPublicKeys"</span>,
    ]

    resources <span>=</span> [<span>"arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.env.account_id}:user/*"</span>]
  }
}

<span>resource</span> <span>"aws_iam_role" "public_key_fetcher"</span> {
  name               <span>=</span> <span>"public-key-fetcher"</span>
  assume_role_policy <span>=</span> <span>data</span>.<span>aws_iam_policy_document</span>.<span>assume_role</span>.<span>json</span>
}

<span>resource</span> <span>"aws_iam_role_policy" "public_key_fetcher"</span> {
  name   <span>=</span> <span>"public-key-fetcher"</span>
  policy <span>=</span> <span>data</span>.<span>aws_iam_policy_document</span>.<span>public_key_fetcher</span>.<span>json</span>
  role   <span>=</span> <span>aws_iam_role</span>.<span>public_key_fetcher</span>.<span>id</span>
}
</code></pre></div>  
</section>
<p>This role will be used by the bastion instance to fetch a user’s keys when the user attempts to SSH into the instance, as we’ll see below.</p>
<h3 id="dockerfile">Dockerfile</h3>
<p>Creating the container image is fairly straightforward. We start with <a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine Linux</a> because it’s small and security-oriented and add the scripts we’ll need to start <code>sshd</code> and handle login.</p>
<section>
<div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span>FROM</span><span> alpine:3.11</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>WORKDIR</span><span> /root</span><span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>ADD</span> fetch_authorized_keys.sh /usr/local/bin/fetch_authorized_keys.sh<span>
</span><span></span><span>ADD</span> entrypoint.sh /usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh<span>
</span></code></pre></div>  
</section>
<p>Next, we install dependencies including the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cli/">AWS CLI</a>. If you typically need any other packages for your bastion, add ‘em to the list. (It still bugs me that AWS doesn’t provide checksums for its CLI bundle. Oh well.)</p>
<section>
<div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span>RUN</span> <span>echo</span> <span>"Installing dependencies..."</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  apk --no-cache <span>\
</span><span></span>    add <span>\
</span><span></span>      bash <span>\
</span><span></span>      curl <span>\
</span><span></span>      openssh <span>\
</span><span></span>      python <span>\
</span><span></span>      tini <span>\
</span><span></span>  <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  <span>echo</span> <span>"Installing AWS CLI..."</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/aws-cli/awscli-bundle.zip <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  unzip awscli-bundle.zip <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  rm awscli-bundle.zip <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  ./awscli-bundle/install -i /usr/local/aws -b /usr/local/bin/aws <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  rm -R awscli-bundle <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  /usr/local/bin/aws --version<span>
</span></code></pre></div>  
</section>
<p>Now we need a user to log in as.</p>
<p>You could use <code>root</code>. I have in the past with small teams that needed the additional flexibility. But if you’re providing an image to teams that are independent of whoever handles security, you don’t necessarily want people making changes to the bastion that could open up holes in your network.</p>
<p>Instead, we create a user named <code>ops</code> and unlock the account for login.</p>
<section>
<div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span>RUN</span> <span>echo</span> <span>"Creating user \"ops\"..."</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  adduser ops --disabled-password<span>
</span><span>
</span><span></span><span>RUN</span> <span>echo</span> <span>"Unlocking \"ops\"..."</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  sed -i <span>"s/ops:!:/ops:*:/g"</span> /etc/shadow<span>
</span></code></pre></div>  
</section>
<p>With that out of the way, we now configure <code>sshd</code>.</p>
<section>
<div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span>RUN</span> <span>echo</span> <span>"Configuring sshd..."</span> <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  sed -i <span>"s:#AuthorizedKeysCommand none:AuthorizedKeysCommand /usr/local/bin/fetch_authorized_keys.sh:g"</span> /etc/ssh/sshd_config <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  sed -i <span>"s:#AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody:AuthorizedKeysCommandUser nobody:g"</span> /etc/ssh/sshd_config <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  sed -i <span>"s:#GatewayPorts no:GatewayPorts yes:g"</span> /etc/ssh/sshd_config <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\
</span><span></span>  sed -i <span>"s:#PasswordAuthentication yes:PasswordAuthentication no:g"</span> /etc/ssh/sshd_config <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>\

</span><span></span>  sed -i <span>"s:AuthorizedKeysFile .ssh/authorized_keys:AuthorizedKeysFile none:g"</span> /etc/ssh/sshd_config<span>
</span></code></pre></div>  
</section>
<p>We’re configuring <code>sshd</code> to do a few different things.</p>
<p>We’re setting the <code>AuthorizedKeysCommand</code> to use <code>fetch_authorized_keys.sh</code>, and we’re disabling both password logins and the ability to use an <code>AuthorizedKeysFile</code> on the instance. The intention here is to make it possible to only use the logic in <code>fetch_authorized_keys.sh</code> to authenticate the user.</p>
<p>We’re also setting <code>sshd</code> up for proxying.</p>
<p>Finally, we configure the <code>ENTRYPOINT</code>:</p>
<section>
<div><pre><code data-lang="dockerfile"><span>ENTRYPOINT</span> [ <span>"/sbin/tini"</span>, <span>"--"</span> ]<span>
</span><span></span><span>CMD</span> [ <span>"/bin/sh"</span>, <span>"/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh"</span> ]<span>
</span></code></pre></div>  
</section>
<p>The only interesting thing here is we’re using <a href="https://github.com/krallin/tini"><code>tini</code></a>. If you’re interested in why, check out <a href="https://github.com/krallin/tini/issues/8">this GitHub issue</a>.</p>
<h3 id="entrypointsh">entrypoint.sh</h3>
<p>On container startup, the first thing we need to do is generate host keys.</p>
<section>
  
</section>
<p>Then we export the global environment which includes the AWS credentials injected into the container, the role for fetching SSH keys, and the user name of the person for whom this bastion instance is intended.</p>
<section>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sh"><span>echo</span> <span>"export AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI=</span><span>$AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI</span><span>"</span> &gt; /etc/profile.d/authorized_keys_configuration.sh

  <p>
   Identity professionals, including enterprise solution architects, data scientists working in marketing, privacy professionals, product managers, and strategists at data brokers, have an extraordinary opportunity to improve privacy plus compliance with data protection regulations and laws for consumer-facing applications. Several critical issues drive the need for improvement:
  </p>
  <ol>
   <li>
    <p>
     Unique identification of a
     <em>
      natural person,
     </em>
     such as a consumer, is easier than ever before. The smallest shred of digital exhaust, physical actions, or attributes can be collected, correlated via machine learning, and analyzed to identify a unique consumer or household with sufficient probability.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Consent is broken. The complexity of privacy notices, and the length of privacy policies that are rarely read, lead to a pattern of ineffectiveness, the illusion of choice, burden on the consumer, and the eventual agreement to broad terms which may not have limits or may be modified at any future date with only limited or obscure notice. As privacy and law expert, Daniel Solove has stated, “Giving individuals more tasks for managing their privacy will not provide effective privacy protection.”
     <a href="#fn2" id="fnref2">
      <sup>
       2
      </sup>
     </a>
     There is a growing realization that privacy laws should make stewardship of data the responsibility of the data controller and/or data processor, not the consumer.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Data privacy laws are years behind technology innovations, and the gap is expanding. Privacy laws cannot keep pace with technological advancements and are years behind in catching up to the 4,000 data brokers and analytics companies that collect personal data across all touchpoints, many of which are adding muscle with machine learning. Many marketing companies, plus some of the world’s largest organizations, are seeking alternatives to third-party cookies in order to be able to continue to identify consumers, all within the porous guidelines of current privacy law.
    </p>
   </li>
   <li>
    <p>
     Anonymity does not exist, and pseudonymization provides weak protection
    </p>
    <ol>
     <li>
      <p>
       For example, researchers have proved that based on geolocation alone, anonymity does not exist.
       <a href="#fn3" id="fnref3">
        <sup>

        </sup>
       </a>
      </p>
     </li>
     <li>
      <p>
       Similarly, researchers posit that it is becoming easier to re-identify a person:
      </p>
      <ol>
       <li>
        <p>
         Once released to the public, data cannot be taken back. As time passes, data analytic techniques improve, and additional datasets become public that can reveal information about the original data. It follows that released data will get increasingly vulnerable to re-identification—unless methods with provable privacy properties are used for the data release.

  <p>
   The scope of privacy for what the GDPR calls
   <em>
    natural persons
   </em>
   keeps expanding because the ability to uniquely identify a human being with the tiniest bit of digital exhaust or trace of online or offline behavior keeps expanding. Where a person ate lunch, the way they move their mouse to find the cursor, what they said to a service representative over the phone in light of the warning, “this call may be recorded for quality purposes,” what they bought online, their device and all its related attributes, or where they bought gas may be sufficient to uniquely identify a natural person. Long gone are the days when name, address, social security number, and date of birth were the only identifiers. Now, we need to protect massive collections of personal and related data in order to provide privacy for consumers.

   is to present a global perspective. However, the initial release of this section is more focused on the GDPR, CCPA, and NY SHIELD Act with a light coverage of China and the rest of the world.

   Chapter 4 of this IDPro Body of Knowledge,

   In this section, we consider personal data obtained, stored or tracked through a variety of mechanisms including cookies, electronic communications (Internet, email, messaging, apps), Wi-Fi, telephone, and Internet-of-Things (IoT).

<p>A multi-billion dollar company. A winning presidential
campaign. A happy marriage. What do these three things have in common? The
foundation of success in each is effective communication. </p>



<p>Effective communication has the power to amass riches and
make history. With it, governments have been transformed, along with the lives
of billions of people. With it, enterprises like Amazon, Apple, and Alibaba
rise from obscurity. </p>



<p>It’s no wonder that all successful businesses need strong
communication infrastructures in order to grow and prosper. But that’s not what
this article is about. The topic of communication is so vast that you can get a
Ph.D. in it. This article would have to be a book, maybe three, to properly
cover the topic. </p>



<p>What this article focuses on is a single concept that, if
grasped, can give your organization a big push in the right direction towards
effective communication in a digital work environment. The concept is this:</p>

<h2>River? Dam?</h2>

<p>A while ago, we published an article that dives into
synchronous and asynchronous communication. Synchronous communication is communication
that happens in real time. It’s a company meeting on Zoom or an active chat
room. Asynchronous communication is communication that happens… not in real
time. It’s that email you send to a client which you know you won’t get a
response to until weeks later, or notes on that Zoom company meeting posted to
an online bulletin. Both are important because different types of information
do best in different formats. </p>



<p>Synchronous communication is fast, immediate, brief. Information
flows like a river — as it does in a chat. This format is best for times of uncertainty
and/or urgency. It’s good for exploring ideas together, having discussions to
make decisions, and addressing crisis situations. </p>



<p>Asynchronous communication is slower, usually more
considered and voluminous. Information gathers like a dam — as it does in a
Wiki. This format is best for adding context to real time communication after
it has happened, putting together detailed information, and explaining complex
concepts.</p>



<p>When used properly, synchronous and asynchronous
communication together form effective communication.</p>



<h2>Increasing Effective Communication in Your Organization</h2>



<div><figure><img src="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/undraw_online_collaboration_7pfp.png" alt="" width="364" height="291" srcset="https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/undraw_online_collaboration_7pfp.png 1000w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/undraw_online_collaboration_7pfp-300x240.png 300w, https://www.airsend.io/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/undraw_online_collaboration_7pfp-768x615.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 364px) 100vw, 364px"><figcaption>Source: unDraw</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>When synchronous and asynchronous communication are used
appropriately in an organization, communication is at its best and collaboration
is smooth and easy. In a digital work environment, some of the most common modes
of communication are chat and Wiki. As mentioned before, chat facilitates
synchronous communication and a Wiki facilitates asynchronous communication. </p>



<p>Increasing effective communication in your organization is
as simple as having both chat and a Wiki available to everyone and then making
it clear which medium to use for each type of interaction. In other words, the
roadmap to achieving effective communication in a digital work environment is:</p>



<ol><li><strong>Provide
the right tools</strong> – Have chat and a Wiki available to all team members and
get everyone accustomed to using them. </li><li><strong>Ensure the tools are used correctly</strong> – Do
this by training management on the concept of synchronous and asynchronous
communication (or “<em>Chat is like a river;
Wiki is like a dam.”) </em>and have them lead by example so the rest of your organization
follows.</li></ol>



<h2>Chat and Wiki in AirSend</h2>



<p>In AirSend, each channel has both a chat section and a Wiki
section. The chat is great for quickly discussing new developments, exchanging links
to articles or tidbits of information, and scheduling calls for further
discussion. The Wiki is great for storing, sharing, and collaborating on more detailed,
complex items.</p>



<p>Having the chat and Wiki together in one place makes communication
much smoother and more efficient than the previous model of emailing back and
forth with document links or attachments. </p>

<h2>Finding Balance </h2>



<p>Effective communication is powerful, and one of the key factors of communicating effectively in a digital environment is finding the balance between synchronous and asynchronous communication. When used together correctly, chat and Wiki can streamline the communication process for clutter-free collaboration, resulting in increased productivity. </p>



<p>Just remember: <em>Chat is like a river; Wiki is like a dam.</em></p>
