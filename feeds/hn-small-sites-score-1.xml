 <li><strong>Information of over 100 million debit and credit card users has been leaked online from payments processor <keyword keytype="person" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Juspay" actualkeyword="Juspay">Juspay</keyword>.</strong></li>
 <li><strong>The leak includes the user’s names, contact information and information related to their debit and credit cards.</strong></li>
 <li><strong>Juspay processes payments for companies like Amazon, Swiggy, MakeMyTrip and several other companies.</strong></li>
 <li><strong>Cybersecurity researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia who first spotted the breach has said that it could become a lot more serious if hackers figure out the encryption algorithm.</strong></li>
</ul><p>In what could be a major data breach, information of over 100 million debit and credit card users from payments processor Juspay has leaked on the dark web. Juspay processes payments for companies like Amazon, Swiggy, MakeMyTrip among others.
</p><p>
The leaked data is in the form of a data dump and has been leaked through a compromised server of Juspay. Juspay has 
<a target="_blank" href="https://juspayproducts.medium.com/your-security-is-our-first-concern-8d98c96e5f17" rel="nofollow">confirmed</a> the data leak in its official blog post, outlining the details of the breach.
</p><p>
    “It pains us to inform you that a data breach did happen on 18th August 2020. Non-sensitive masked card information, mobile numbers and email ids of a subset of our users were compromised,” the company said.
</p><p>Cybersecurity researcher Rajshekhar Rajaharia discovered the data breach. He found that the data dump was available for sale on the dark web.
</p><p>
    Speaking to Business Insider, Rajaharia noted that this data breach could be a lot more serious if the hackers figure out the encryption algorithm used to hash card numbers.
</p><p>

<strong>Here’s what was leaked in the <keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Juspay-Data-Breach" actualkeyword="Juspay data breach">Juspay data breach</keyword><br></strong>
<br>As per Juspay, the leaked information includes non-sensitive masked card information, mobile numbers and email IDs of a subset of users. The company has said that the leaked information does not include full card numbers, order information, card PIN or password.
</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><figure><div></div></figure><hr>
<p>The data on the dark web includes information such as the bank that has issued the card, card expiry date, the last four digits of the card, masked card number, card type and the user’s name, among other details.
</p><p>

<strong>Should you be worried?<br></strong>
<br>    Rajaharia pointed out that there could be a major risk to users if the algorithm used to hash card numbers is leaked or if the hackers figure it out on their own.
</p><p>A hash is a unique and fixed-length string that is mapped to a set of data. In this case, Juspay has hashed the 16-digit debit and credit card numbers in order to process transactions.
</p><p>
    If hackers can figure out the algorithm used to generate these hashes, they could use brute force and find out what the original card numbers are.
</p><p>
Juspay has masked only six digits out of sixteen-digit card numbers. Rajaharia says that while this is good, the safety of users rests primarily on the hashing algorithm.
</p>
<p><strong>Scammers could also exploit this data leak<br></strong>
<br>In addition to the risks mentioned above, Rajaharia also pointed out that scammers could exploit this data leak to dupe cardholders. Since the leak includes mobile numbers, they could call unsuspecting cardholders and trick them into revealing the full card numbers, PIN, CVV as well as one-time passwords.
</p><p>
Rajaharia also pointed out that since these users are paying customers, they are a lot more valuable than non-paying customers. This makes the </p><keyword keytype="UnKnown" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Juspay-data-leak" keynameseo="juspay-data-leak" actualkeyword="juspay data leak">Juspay data leak</keyword><p> a lot more lucrative for hackers and scammers.
</p><p>    
According to him, the seller he is in touch with has demanded $8,000 in Bitcoin to purchase the data.

<p>I decided that I was spending too much time writing instructions in random Google docs, vi’ed files, and GitHub repos. I wanted to have a single location that I could use as a way to publicly document all the things that I tinker with:</p>



<ul><li>Kubernetes</li><li>Docker (who doesn’t?)</li><li>Splunk</li><li>Raspberry Pi</li><li>Random tech integrations (this list could go on forever)</li></ul>



<p>With all of that, I felt that it was time to put it all into a blog. As I travel through life building these random things, I intend to document them here and link to any files, repos, or websites that I have created myself or used along the way.</p>



<p>Enjoy!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>How often do you check your phone? Every 30 minutes? Every 5 minutes? Every 30 seconds?</p><p>Smartphones can be incredibly addictive. Tap, tap, tap and you’re playing a game, tap tap and you’re replying to a friend.&nbsp;<em>Ping!</em>&nbsp;and woooooh, someone liked your photo!</p><p>And so it goes, minutes pass. Then hours. And then you look up, and you still haven’t studied for the exam or worked on that proposal. Time has passed and you have nothing to show for it.</p><p>We know this problem well. We’ve faced it and overcome it. Here are some practical suggestions that helped us cut down from an average of hours on the phone to about 30 minutes.</p><p>Let’s start with the most obvious.</p><h2>Step #1: Turn notifications off</h2><p>Notifications are fun. Did someone message me? How many people liked my post? Who mentioned me?...</p><p>Social media and other apps that rely on notifications want to draw us in. They feed on our insecurity and want us to return to their product and tap away. That’s the purpose of notifications.</p><p><strong>Turn them off.</strong></p><p>We used to have them on too. Those likes sure felt nice. Seeing them come in, one by one. But you know what didn’t feel nice? Lack of focus. Inability to work. Feeling bad at the end of the day, knowing you didn’t do your best.</p><p><strong>We recommend that you turn off all notifications with the possible exception of direct messages from friends (if you don’t get too many of those).</strong></p><h2>Step #2: Delete unnecessary apps</h2><p>You probably don’t need Twitter, Facebook, Reddit or YouTube on your phone. Seriously.</p><p>They make it too easy to waste your own time.</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/remove_apps.png" alt="Remove unnecessary apps" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>I (co-founder Vita) used to have all of those apps on my phone. Every time I was bored, I reached for my phone and tap, Twitter, scroll and scroll and scroll…</p><p>It’s too easy. Too easy to waste hours every day, tens of hours every week, hundreds of hours every month. For what? Internet points?</p><p>Those hours could be better spent writing your thesis, working on your presentation, or building your business. Since I deleted the most distracting apps from my phone, I’ve used my time better and have been much happier with myself.</p><p>You can always check Twitter or Facebook on your computer, where you can better control the environment - use a site-blocker like ours to limit how much time you can waste.</p><p>With the possible exception of Instagram and Snapchat, you can get everything you need from the website version of the product, if you need to.</p><p>Remove games from your phone too. They eat up time faster than a sped-up Pacman and only leave you with guilt at the end of the day. They’re too much fun. You might install them thinking “I’ll play for 5-15 minutes at the end of the day,” but before you know it, you’re playing an addictive game at 10AM instead of doing what you need to do.</p><p><strong>Remove the most time-sucking apps from your phone.</strong></p><h2>Step #3: Make your phone less visually appealing</h2><p>We’re visual creatures. If you reach for your phone, unlock it, and see a familiar icon with a red dot in the corner, you’re going to tap it. It’s one of the easiest and worst habits to get into.</p><p>So, here are 3 tips to make your phone screen less enticing.</p><ul><li><p><strong>No non-productive apps on your first screen.</strong><br>Put every app that has the potential to distract you on your second screen. No social media, no video apps, no messaging apps. If you have them on the first screen you see, you will tap them and destroy your productivity.</p></li><li><p><strong>Group distracting apps in folders.</strong><br>You can also make distracting apps less appealing by putting them into folders. E.g. Messenger, Slack, and email into&nbsp;<em>Communication.</em></p></li><li><p><strong>Grayscale your phone.</strong><br>Ever notice that games are super colorful and bright? It’s that way for a simple reason - we biologically wired to like bright and rich colors. It’s fun to look at and fun to interact with colorful and animated screens.</p><p>So, make it less fun by turning everything gray.&nbsp;For iPhones go to&nbsp;<em>Settings &gt; General &gt; Accessibility &gt; Display Accommodations &gt; Color Filters</em>&nbsp;and then tap on Grayscale.</p><p>For Android phones, google “How to enable grayscale mode on android” - the process is more complicated.</p></li></ul><p><strong>Make your phone less visually appealing and you’ll be less tempted to use it too often.</strong></p><p>That’s it for once-and-done steps, now time for habits.</p><h2>Habit #1: Use the Rule of 3 senses - keep your phone out of sight, out of reach, and out of hearing</h2><h3>Sight: Keep your phone out of sight</h3><p>Imagine your desk looks like this:</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/table_phone.png" alt="Phone on the table is a distraction" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>Normal, no?</p><p>There’s a catch. Our brain sees this:</p><p><img src="https://www.deprocrastination.co/assets/illustrations/table_phone_brain_bg.png" alt="Our brain is wired to notice a phone on your desk" referrerpolicy="no-referrer"></p><p>If you have your phone in your field of vision, it’s a constant reminder that you could be doing something fun (dopamine!) instead of doing something that feels like work (but is productive).</p><p><strong>When you want to work, hide your phone from sight.</strong></p><h3>Touch: Have your phone out of reach</h3><p>Even if you don’t see your phone, if you have it within easy reach, it’s easy to succumb. All you need to do is extend your hand and an hour is gone and you still haven’t done anything productive.</p><p>Put your phone out of your reach. Ideally, have it in a different room entirely.</p><p>If you’re not home or at work, you can put it in your backpack or purse and put it out of easy reach.</p><p>You can assign your phone a dedicated spot. A spot in your bookshelf, a cupboard, or a drawer. Anywhere far away from where you want to work is good.</p><p><strong>Have your phone out of reach.</strong></p><h3>Hearing: Put your phone on silent (Do Not Disturb on)</h3><p>A funny video, a question about your weekend, a photo from a trip… they aren’t that urgent. You’re much better off not seeing those notifications and definitely not hearing a loud&nbsp;<em>ping!</em>&nbsp;when you’re just starting to get focused.</p><p>You can check all the notifications and replies once you got a solid piece of your work done or wrote a page of a paper you have due.</p><p>You don’t need to see every like or post as they happen. That might make engineers at Twitter or Facebook happy, but definitely not you in the long-term.</p><p>You can check everything when you take a 5 min break&nbsp;<em>after</em>&nbsp;doing something productive.</p><p><strong>When you want to focus and be productive, put your phone out of sight, out of reach, and out of hearing (on silent).</strong></p><h2>Habit #2: No phone first thing in the morning</h2><p>If you use your phone as your alarm clock, you might want to consider buying an analog one.</p><p>Why?</p><p>Here’s frequent scenario for many:</p><p><em>Dingdingdingding!!!!</em><br><em>rolls over, grabs phone and presses Stop</em><br><em>Oh, look at these messages. And an email from a co-worker. And someone mentioned me in their Insta story….</em><br><em>an hour passes</em></p><p>This is hardly a good, positive, or active way to start the day.</p><p>Almost any kind of morning routine is better than getting snared in a time-sucking black hole of checking&nbsp;<em>everything</em>.</p><p><strong>Solution: buy an analog alarm clock.</strong></p><p>They don’t have notifications. You can then leave your phone in a different room.</p><p><strong>Alternative solution: put your phone in airplane mode when sleeping.</strong></p><p>This way, you wake up without a full screen of things to respond to.</p><h2>Habit #3: Embrace boredom (instead of checking the phone)</h2><p><em>Waiting in a line? Check phone.</em></p><p><em>Friend went to the bathroom? Check phone.</em></p><p><em>Want to focus? Check phone.</em></p><p>Wait, scratch the last one!</p><p>Every time you check your phone, you reinforce the habit. Since it’s often within reach, in your pocket or on the table, it’s easy to do again and again, looking for a bit of something&nbsp;<em>new.</em></p><p>This habit can quickly get out of control. You start opening the same apps, over and over again, even though there’s nothing new there. It becomes a behavior tic to escape any kind of boredom.</p><p>But boredom isn’t bad. In fact, it can be helpful. When you’re bored, your mind starts to wonder. Vast networks of neurons activate in your brain and that often leads to interesting insights and ideas. Those ideas can lead you to naturally make progress with whatever you were procrastinating on.</p><p>Many people become de facto zombies, only looking for&nbsp;<em>NEW!!!</em>&nbsp;instead of&nbsp;<em>brainzzz</em>.</p><p><strong>Embrace boredom. Let your mind wander.</strong></p><h2>Pick a step or a habit to apply to your life</h2><p><strong>3 steps to being less distracted by your phone:</strong></p><ul><li>Turn off notifications</li><li>Delete unnecessary apps (and games)</li><li>Make your phone less appealing</li><ul><li>Remove distracting apps from your first screen</li><li>Put distracting apps into folders</li><li>Grayscale your phone</li></ul></ul><p><strong>3 habits to become more focused:</strong></p><ul><li>Use the&nbsp;<strong>Rule of 3 Senses</strong>:&nbsp;keep your phone out of sight, out of reach, and out of hearing</li><li>Use an analog alarm clock or put your phone into airplane mode.</li><li>Embrace boredom.</li></ul><p>If you do these things, you will start spending less and less time on your phone and become more and more productive.&nbsp;<em>If</em>&nbsp;you do them.</p><p><strong>Take action today. Pick 1 app to remove from your phone, turn off notifications for Instagram or Twitter, or buy an analog alarm clock. Reclaim your attention.</strong></p></article></div>]]>

Before Facebook became the social media behemoth that it is today, <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2006/08/08/bebo-passes-myspace-in-the-uk/">Bebo was the darling of the day</a>.  AIM, ICQ, MSN Messenger, and Yahoo Messenger were the <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/stats/article.php/1366931">darlings a decade or more before</a>. </p><p>Technology media love to document technology wars, but often assume incumbent technologies aren't invited to the battle. They're assumed dead before shots are even fired.</p><p>Second, technology wars are a battle to become "The New Standard." I'm not sure I agree with him, but Peter Thiel has written books and articles declaring "<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/peter-thiel-competition-is-for-losers-1410535536">competition is for losers</a>." Yet, if your aim is to build a monopoly, you self-exclude yourself from interacting, integrating, or collaborating with others that want the same monopoly power as you. <a href="https://news.microsoft.com/1999/08/09/microsoft-continues-to-work-toward-consumer-interoperability-despite-aol-allegations-about-msn-messenger/">AIM and MSN Messenger had a strange history here</a>.</p><p>Which takes us to my third theory, and to the topic of this post. SMS, Email, and other Standards-Based technologies like them rarely expire because nobody "owns" them. </p><p>The first proposal which initiated the development of SMS was made by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMS#Early_development">contribution of Germany and France in the GSM group meeting</a> in February 1985 in Oslo. GSM - Global System for Mobile Communications - was itself formed in 1983 to develop a European standard for digital cellular voice telecommunications. By 1987, 15 representatives from 13 European countries had <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM#Initial_development">signed a memorandum of understanding to support it</a>. An invention borne of collaboration, not competition.</p><p>Similarly, there is no single inventor, or single owner, of the Internet Protocol suite that enables us to send, retrieve, or store email messages. POP, SMTP, and IMAP are core to, and interoperable with, every noteworthy computer operating system in existence today. It's not a Zero-sum game. There is no monopoly to play for. There can be no "winner" in a war against email, SMS, or the open web. There's nothing to fight over.</p><p>New technology products will come and go, each vying to become "The New Standard" of something. But if that something is a protocol, not a product, creators of these products should consider how they might augment - not replace - existing standards. </p></div></div>]]>

<p><span>J</span>un Heo’s grandfather was a one-time bodyguard to North Korea’s founding leader, Kim Il Sung. Heo, who grew up in a middle-class family in the coastal province of Kyongsong, hoped to follow in his footsteps, but when his mother tried to defect to the south in 2004, the family fell out of favor. Four years later, he made the journey by himself, smuggled across the Tumen River into neighboring China, and eventually reached his extended family in Shanghai. It was there he used a computer for the first time.</p>



<p>“It was hard for me to get the hang of at first,” Heo says. However, he soon found himself homesick, using Baidu, the Chinese search engine, to look up images of his hometown. When, in 2011, he moved to Seoul to study, like many defectors, he found himself ostracized. His countryside twang gave away his origins to his classmates, and he soon realized that few people in the south knew what life was really like for refugees from the north. After a few lessons from his South Korean girlfriend, who taught him how to use a camera and upload his first videos, he created his first channel, JunStories.</p>



<p>“When I uploaded my first video, I thought you’d only be able to see it in South Korea,” he says. “I didn’t realize I’d be talking to the whole world.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today, Heo has more than 20,000 subscribers on his YouTube channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/HumansofNorthKorea/featured" data-type="URL">Humans of North Korea</a>. He is one of a growing number of defectors from the north who have turned to vlogging as a way to assimilate into South Korean society. There are now dozens of North Korean YouTubers, whose videos cover North Korean cuisine, dating, and even <em>mukbang</em>, or the art of vlogging while eating.</p>



<p>The response they have received — at times supportive, at others aggressive or patronizing — has highlighted the difficulties of straddling two antagonistic identities, never fully able to inhabit either. Vlogging only goes so far toward resolving their homesickness and sense of otherness in their adopted country. But in sharing their experiences, they hope that they can change southerners’ perceptions of their relatives above the Military Demarcation Line.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“When I first arrived, people used to wear colored glasses. They were prejudiced because they’d never met a North Korean,” Kim Hyeok, a defector who left the north in 2011, told <em>Rest of World</em>. “But I think these YouTubers are helping change this.”</p>

<hr>



<p><strong>There are only</strong> around 30,000 North Korean defectors in South Korea, but the community plays an outsize role in its host country’s identity. At the height of the Cold War, North Korean soldiers and elites who had defected were paraded around Seoul in events, some attended by millions of people, where they testified to the brutal conditions of the north and the superiority of the south.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the late ’90s, public spectacle had given way to reality television. Defecting soldiers were replaced by refugees fleeing famine and economic devastation. Later, on well-known conservative TV channels, popular shows such as “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pGAkgie9u9I">Now on My Way to Meet You</a>” and “<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2016/01/31/464798910/south-koreas-newest-tv-stars-are-north-korean-defectors">Moranbong Club</a>” featured defectors, usually young, poor, and female, telling the stories of their harrowing escapes.</p>



<p>These caricatures of North Korea and its citizens continue to shape the popular view of defectors in the south. “For many South Koreans, the primary way we meet defectors is through the media,” says Sung Kyung Kim, an associate professor of sociology at the University of North Korean Studies. “We are still living under Cold War ideology.”</p>



<p>It is this skewed perception that Heo is trying to change through his YouTube channel, which has evolved from a personal vlog to a series of vignettes of the lives of defectors modeled on Heo’s favorite Facebook page, the long-running portrait series Humans of New York. The defection videos on Humans of North Korea are different from those on mainstream TV. “They edit 99% of their story and show the 1% that makes people angry about North Korea,” he says. Heo prefers to tell a more nuanced narrative.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cghxV9HXUZc?feature=oembed" title="🇰🇷S. Koreans React to Meeting A North Korean for the First Time | Social Experiment" width="640" height="360" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p><figcaption>In a video that has received over 2.8 million views, Heo tells people he is North Korean to see how they react.</figcaption></figure>



<p>His success on YouTube has granted him opportunities out of reach for many North and South Koreans alike. Before the pandemic, he was invited to events sponsored by Google and the consumer electronics company LG. He was even offered opportunities to collaborate with one of South Korea’s premier talent agencies, though he eventually turned that down. Sponsors of his channel have financed trips to other countries, including Germany and France.</p>



<p>However, not all North Korean YouTubers have met with the same welcome online. Sunny Kim started her YouTube channel in 2016 with similar intentions to Heo’s, having experienced nearly a decade of bullying after her defection from the north.</p>



<p>“In middle school, they would tease me and say, ‘Are you a sleeper agent trying to kill the South Korean president?’” she recalls. Her channel amassed 70,000 subscribers in a year, but the real-life harassment followed her onto the platform, where trolls hurled the same slurs at her she had heard as a child in the schoolyard. By the end of the following year, Sunny had shut down her channel. Though she recently resumed vlogging, she no longer talks about North Korea. “Now I just want to document my youth,” she says.</p>

<p>YouTubing has also attracted unwanted attention for Heo. Last fall, late in the evening, he received a call from detectives in Seoul’s police department. They told him that a team from the email provider Naver had alerted them to a cyberattack by hackers that targeted prominent defectors. Heo’s account was among those that had been compromised. The police later identified the hackers as North Korean. After the police walked him through the steps necessary to secure his account, he decided to delete it entirely, losing about six years’ worth of emails.</p>



<p>Even supportive reactions to vloggers’ videos can underline their otherness and highlight how far there is to go for North Koreans to truly integrate.</p>



<p>“He looks just like someone who was born here, amazing!” one commenter wrote on Heo’s page. “I cannot tell whether you’re from the north or south,” another wrote. Heo has mixed feelings about comments like these. “In a way, it’s a compliment,” he says. “But being North Korean is not a curse.”</p>



<p>Heo says he has a responsibility to overcome the perception that it is. He has not shaken off his homesickness, and online, he still finds himself drawn to take trips back to the north. “I miss my hometown,” he says. “I use Google Earth to see if it’s changed, but it hasn’t changed. Not in 10 years.”&nbsp;He hopes that one day he will be able to go back for real, and that his YouTube channel could be a small part of that process — a mini-reunification between South and North Koreans. “I don’t think my channel will destroy these barriers completely, but I want to try,” he says. “Every morning, I wake up and think, Maybe this afternoon we’ll be united<em>.</em> My family still lives there. I miss them.”</p>

<p>Photo taken on July 17, 2020 shows an office of online marketplace Pinduoduo in east China's Shanghai. Photo: Xinhua</p><p>A 22-year-old employee who worked at Chinese e-commerce platform Pinduoduo died suddenly after finishing work late at night and fainting on the way home. The news has caused a strong response on the internet. The exact cause of her sudden death requires authoritative medical conclusions, but public resistance and condemnation of excessive overtime has become the mainstream attitude on the internet.</p><p>Hopefully, all companies and institutions will attach great importance to this attitude of the public, take necessary measures to protect the employees' legitimate rights and interests and do not regard employees' excessive overtime as the basis of the companies' achievement. The Labour Law should also be more strictly enforced.</p><p>The excessive overtime of internet company employees is well known. Two years ago, there was a condemnation of the "996" culture - working from 9:00 am to 9:00 pm six days a week - but the problem has not really been alleviated because of the fierce competition among internet companies. People's competition in jobs is also fierce. The two kinds of competition have seriously squeezed the room for workers to defend their rights of not working overtime. Many public discussions have shifted to the so-called principle of fairness that employees who work overtime must be properly paid.</p><p>Objectively speaking, frequent overtime is not just a matter for internet companies. There are many other such industries in China. It is also very common for policemen to work overtime, as well as some other civil servants. They usually have no overtime pay, or only a very small amount of overtime pay. Some local and department leaders take this for granted and some managers even proudly tell others how their departments work seven days a week or work from day to night.&nbsp;</p><p>In Chinese society, there is a traditional value that regards working overtime as an honor. Many descriptions of good people will include the content of how he or she works overtime for a long time, or works late at night. From government departments to enterprises, leaders and managers often appreciate employees who take the initiative to work overtime. Such value is deeply rooted in Chinese society.</p><p>When China was backward and shaking off poverty was the No.1 task, the abovementioned values were naturally formed. But when a huge middle class has been formed in urban China, the choice is subtly changing. People are putting more emphasis on their right to time off. There is heavy criticism online against the "996" working model, which is a clear sign of such a change.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, people have diversified pursuits. There are still people willing to improve their lives by working exhaustively. But such a working style as a collective value has been shaken. More and more young people wish to strike a balance between working hard and playing hard. They want to keep moving ahead, but also take it easy.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a broad trend. The more China grows further, achieving higher GDP per capita, such a value choice will attract more people. In addition, international society is scrutinizing China on labor protection, which is a term often mentioned when China conducts deep economic cooperation with foreign countries. Chinese society needs to adjust the concept of working overtime.</p><p>China's economic and social development cannot rely too much on people's long-time work as a driving force. We should improve labor efficiency and reduce formalism and useless work. People hope for more rest hours, and from this we need to find positive elements that promote development. We should try our best to unify development and the protection of people's rights.</p><p>Chinese people who often travel abroad will find that in a developed society, it is very difficult to hire drivers and translators who are willing to work overtime, not even if they're paid more. This cannot be simply regarded as "lazy."</p><p>Our economic and social development needs to be explored toward the gradually reduced cost of all citizens. Of course, this cannot be achieved overnight. After all, China is still not a rich country, and the low-income group is still large. Overtime work in some positions is inevitable. The spirit of enduring hardship cannot be absent in our society. In particular, we must not give up the encouragement of dedication. In some key sectors, it is very important to let such spirit continue to flourish. We need to constantly adjust to the progress of society and achieve a new balance.</p><p>Chinese society needs to rethink the internet sentiment opposing the "996" work model and the strong reaction to the Pinduoduo employee's sudden death. We should let such thinking rationally penetrate into the rhythm of social progress.</p><p><em>The author is a commentator with the Global Times. opinion@globaltimes.com.cn</em></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content" data-v-313f4ce2=""><div data-v-313f4ce2=""> <div data-v-313f4ce2=""><div data-v-313f4ce2=""><p>The internet is a wild place.</p>
<p>Last April, amid the COVID-19 induced panic, Fox News interviewed a doctor about the US government’s response to the epidemic.</p>
<p>But his responses to the questions in the interview didn't go as well as the network was hoping.</p>
<p>Shortly after, the interview went viral. More than 10 million views on Twitter for the 90 second clip.</p>
<p>Before the interview, the doctor, <a href="https://twitter.com/RishiDesaiMD">Rishi Desai</a>, didn't have much of a social media presence. So he created a new account on Twitter.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.postmake.io/resources/blog/consistently-lucky/rishi_desai.png" alt="Rishi Desai"></p><p>I still remember watching in disbelief as the account gained over 30 thousand followers in under 24 hours.</p>
<p>No connections, no brand, no tweets, no marketing. Just a viral 90-second video.</p>
<br>

<h3>Dumb Luck</h3>

<p>Of course, "followers" is only a vanity metric. An Instagram model with over 2 million followers <a href="https://www.insider.com/instagrammer-arii-2-million-followers-cannot-sell-36-t-shirts-2019-5">couldn't sell 36 shirts</a> when she launched her brand. A big audience doesn't mean much if they're not engaged. <a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/">1000 true fans</a> and all that.</p>
<p>But it's mind-boggling how much a viral piece of content can change things.</p>
<p>Case in point: <a href="https://twitter.com/alexwestco">Alex</a> recently got his first $50/mo customer. Excited, he shared the news in a tweet.</p>
<br>
<blockquote data-dnt="true" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Got my first $50/mo customer! 🎉</p>— Alex West 🚀 (@alexwestco) <a href="https://twitter.com/alexwestco/status/1252656159636545538?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2020</a></blockquote>  
<p>The next day, he woke up to hundreds of likes, 1000 new followers, and 10k visitors to his website.</p>
<p>This tweet was an <a href="https://www.alexwest.co/posts/129">inflection point</a> for his business. It put him on the radar, and his business has been on an upward trajectory since.</p>
<p>Why did this particular tweet go viral? There doesn't seem to be any apparent reason. In Alex's words, "luck smiled at me and things went crazy."</p>
<p>This sort of thing happens all the time. A travel blogger's viral Twitter thread that gets her 13k followers. A designer managing to <a href="https://tr.af/6">make six figures</a> in 6 days after a screenshot of his phone goes viral. A <a href="https://www.nateliason.com/blog/roam">blog post</a> that turns into a <a href="https://www.effortlessoutput.com/">side-business</a>.</p>
<p>But here's the thing: as lucky as these might seem, this luck didn't come out of thin air.</p>
<p>Alex has been tweeting consistently every day before his viral tweet. Traf has been making and selling designs online for years. Nat has hundreds of articles on his website.</p>
<p>As a wise man once said, "the harder I work, the luckier I get".</p>
<p>Think of it this way: On average, a piece of content does okay relative to your audience. Some might do bad, some might do a little better. And some can go viral.</p>

<p><img src="https://images.postmake.io/resources/blog/consistently-lucky/not_so_viral_chart.png" alt="Not so viral"></p><p>How do you increase the number of viral content? Simple: you increase the total number of content!</p>

<p><img src="https://images.postmake.io/resources/blog/consistently-lucky/viral_chart.png" alt="Viral"></p><p>Shortly after starting his new project, Harry David saw <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/product/marketing-examples/4700-new-followers-overnight--LyJM6b62tFbqwiW9nLW">a huge uptick</a> in his audience size when Steve Schoger retweeted one of his Twitter threads. But this wasn't Harry's first post – he has been pushing great content for months before that. It was only a matter of time before one of them went viral.</p>
<p>Take consistent action. If you want a viral blog, don't write one post; write 10. If you want to make a sale, don't reach out to 10 prospects; reach out to 100. </p>
<p>Consistency compounds. Wildly so on the internet. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-w-id="45d72c63-4641-3f9f-f271-8df897413c12"><p>Today the consumer market is moving towards Omni-channel experience, and the developer and UX designers need to focus more on web and mobile-friendly user experience than ever before. The developer and designer work more closely to provide a better user experience for the website or app they develop. Technical errors on the software are the critical reason for the app deletion.&nbsp;</p><p>Over 90% of the downloaded apps are erased after one use due to poor user experience. Similarly, according to expert's studies, 80% of users never return to a low user experience website. This is why UX design is a crucial factor in software or application development. The user expects extraordinary experience on apps, websites they use every day. They never provide 2nd change on the software. In this article, let's look in detail at why developers want to learn UI/UX design.</p><p>‍</p><p>The 15 reasons I've highlighted here for you:</p><p>‍</p><ol role="list"><li>Interface vs. Experience</li><li>How User Experience Shapes Software Development</li><li>Excellent Ux Design Encourages to Develop of a More User-Centric Product</li><li>Make the Product More Popular With Ux Design.&nbsp;</li><li>Reduce Flaws and Development Cost</li><li>Ux Plays a Vital Role in Software Architecture</li><li>Limited Resource</li><li>Designing in the Browser</li><li>Front End Development &amp; Ux Design</li><li>&nbsp;Ux Can Make You a Better Developer</li><li>Gets Higher Return on Investment (ROI)</li><li>&nbsp;Learn Skills That Complement Your Existing Talents</li><li>Gain Skills That Can’t Be Automated</li><li>Execute Your Code Towards the User Experience</li><li>User Empathy Will Help You Stand Out in the Business Market</li></ol><h2>1. Interface vs. Experience</h2><p>Before we get down to detail, let's understand the difference between the User Interface (UI) and User Experience (UX).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>User Interface is anything that the user interacts with the website or app. In another term, UI is the point where the user interacts with the digital product or service. They come in three categories Graphical user interfaces( GUIs), Voice-controlled interface (VUIs), and Gesture-based interfaces.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Graphical user interfaces:</strong> Users interact with electronic devices through graphic icons. The best example is the computer's desktop.</p><p><strong>Voice-controlled interface: </strong>Users interact with the application through their voices. E.g., Siri, Alexa, etc.</p><p><strong>Gesture-based interface: </strong>Users engage with 3D design spaces through real movements, e.g., Virtual reality (VR) games.</p><p>In contrast, User Experience is the complete look and feel of the website or application. UX is the final impression of the user about the product or service.</p><h2>2. How User Experience Shapes Software Development</h2><p>UX and UI design are essential for any application development. Five significant reasons show you need to focus more on the design during product development. Research says that the product's experience influences 97% of customer decisions.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>1. Usability</strong></p><p>When software or application works great but is not user-friendly, people will not prefer to use it. The software has to attract and retain the user. User interface and experience are upfront on the development.</p><p><strong>2. Lower development costs</strong></p><p>Identifying the roadblocks and issues in the client experience before development with save you time on modifying code.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3</strong>. <strong>Faster development time</strong></p><p>Great UX and UI configuration save time in the development cycle.</p><p><strong>4. Increase revenue</strong></p><p>People prefer to download or ready to pay for the application that suits their needs and easy to use. If you develop a product with useful UI and UX will increase the app's purchase or downloading.</p><p><strong>5. Better Client retention</strong></p><p>User-friendly apps will keep people returning. The application will become an integral part of their everyday life. If developing a poor UX will leave a lasting impression. The developer has to identify the design problems before deployment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Excellent Ux Design Encourages to Develop of a More User-Centric Product</h2><p>UX design offers insights about what your users want from the product that you are developing. It is the core point for product design. User research and usability testing at each step of the development prove how the user-friendly product evolved.</p><div><p>Before product development, conduct user research and speak with the end-users and understand their needs. The study will help to develop the best user experience application or software.</p><p>In the end the builders (in this case developers) need to have an understanding of the outcome of what they’re building.</p></div><h2>4. Make the Product More Popular With Ux Design.&nbsp;</h2><p>According to statistics, nearly 67% of consumers are more likely to purchase the product if they are happy with their user experience.</p><p>Creating a straightforward user journey or planning the best end-user experience makes client retention and retains the existing customers. This boost in product purchase.</p><p><a href="https://bugreporting.co/">BugReporting</a> is a user feedback tool for websites and apps. It allows users to record full-length video feedback. The application also captures the data to replicate any errors that users face. A BugReporting software is an automatic tool that helps developers and designers view the exact bugs that are user-facing on the UI/UX.</p><h2>5. Reduce Flaws and Development Cost</h2><p>When you combine user's demands in your application's development process, it will considerably decrease UX problems in the later stage of the product journey.</p><p>A basic understanding of UX design will help understand which will not work for the user before product development. Mockups and prototypes will reduce user-related bugs' chances, and it will minimize the development cycle time. The developers can make a clear decision on software development with prototyping.</p><h2>6. Ux Plays a Vital Role in Software Architecture</h2><p>High performance and software stability can only be achieved by the developers. These two are the unsung heroes of user experience design.</p><p>For example, Website visitors will leave the page if they face low page loading. Unnecessary redirects, server delays, heavy images, heavy CSS, HTML, JavaScript files, fancy animated effects or page widgets, etc., may cause inadequate loading speed. The developer needs to fix these defects to improve the user experience. Suppose there is a lag in site loading due to server delay. In that case, the coder needs to find suitable hosting for their website. In this way, the developer will enhance the user experience, product accessibility, and usability.</p><h2>7. Limited Resource</h2><p>In many startups or small businesses, there won't be any dedicated resource for design. Developers out there want to tackle projects entirely on their own, who can't afford to hire a designer (or require to spend the money elsewhere). They will be able to learn to design for their products until they identify the valuable resource.</p><p>Another main reason developers need to learn design is to work more effectively with designers. If the developer understands the basic design, it will help create stunning UI and create a better user experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Learning about design improves the relationship between designer and developer. The developer can easily understand the user interface correction that is provided by the designer. Learning makes the developer view the design on the designer's view for the application development.&nbsp;</p><h2>8. Designing in the Browser</h2><p>Many designers hesitate to perform designing on the browser because they need to know the necessary CSS and HTML programming or codes to create on the browser. That is the specific reason behind why it's an excellent fit for engineers getting into designing.</p><p>There are many tools and browser plugins available today, which assist you in designing the browser. Which makes the developer and designer's life easy. Here are some useful tools for coder and UI/UX designers includes Sketch, Axure, InVision Studio, Craft, Proto.io, Adobe XD, Webflow, Figma, and more&nbsp;</p><h2>9. Front End Development &amp; Ux Design</h2><p>Not all designers need to know to write coding in contrast to the front-end developer, which doesn't mean it is necessary to know UX. But both the UX design and Front end development work more excellently together. If a front-end developer has both, the knowledge will help in creating significant and usable applications. Learning will bridge the gap between the designer and developer and can complete the quality-assured application.</p><h2>10.&nbsp;Ux Can Make You a Better Developer</h2><p>The demand for programming engineers is developing by 22% consistently until 2029. Among all the developers with a special in user experiences are ahead of the job compilation. Users are the priority of any app or web app development, so many recruits look for candidates who have sound knowledge of software development, and UX design is considered more. As a developer, expand your career horizons by continuous learning. A basic understanding of UX design will increase the chance of landing your dream job.</p><h2>11. Gets Higher Return on Investment (ROI)</h2><p>UX impacts client satisfaction; as a result, it will generate higher ROI for the longer term. It is essential to develop the best user experience at the first interaction with your product.&nbsp;</p><p>Best UX design will engage your user with your application and create customer loyalty for your brands. People will also recommend the product if they are satisfied. It will increase your inbound leads and revenue. If the coder doesn't understand, UX's fundamentals will create a negative impact on UI. Research says that companies that spend on UX design can increase a minimum of 30% sales.</p><h2>12.&nbsp;Learn Skills That Complement Your Existing Talents</h2><p>By learning new skills like UX, you will come out of your comfort zone. Many platforms provide free and paid online courses about user experience design. Here are some of the websites with lessons that help you to upgrade your expertise in designing.</p><p><strong>Coursera: </strong><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/user-experience-design">Introduction to User Experience Design </a>&amp; <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/ux-design-fundamentals">UX Design Fundamentals</a></p><p><strong>Learnux.io: </strong><a href="https://learnux.io/course/usability">Course on Usability</a></p><p><strong>UX Design Institute:</strong> <a href="https://www.uxdesigninstitute.com/courses/ux-design?utm_source=uxstudio&amp;utm_medium=blog&amp;utm_campaign=top_10_courses">Professional Diploma in UX Design</a></p><p>You can find many similar online courses to grow your expertise in UI and UX design.&nbsp;</p><p>‍</p><h2>13.

</a>

by <a href="https://lukesmith.xyz/index.html">Luke Smith</a>

<p>
<i>A parable on the Logical Postivist "interpretation" of scientific models.
<!-- Granted, I use the term "logical positivist" in a somewhat expanded but specific sense, -->
<!-- loosely the idea that "science is good models" or what was called in the past "instrumentalism." -->
</i>
</p>

<h2>The Parable</h2>

<p>
Suppose an alien race comes to Earth and wants to observe our games.
They are very interested in chess, despite the fact that they have eyes with properties that make it impossible to make out what actually happens on a chess board.
(The whites and blacks and squares all blur together.)
</p>

<p>
They can still learn about chess experimentally, they know they can sit two players (a so-called "white" and "black" player) down to play it, and they can tell behaviorally who at the end wins.
</p>

<p>
After extensive experimentation, they realize this: 50% of the time, the white player wins and 50% of the time, the black player wins (we'll ignore draws and any first-move advantage for the example).
</p>

<h3>The "best" model</h3>

<p>
A logical positivist alien thus creates the ultimate, long-term model of chess as an iterated game:
Chess amounts to just a drawn-out coin flip.
Half of the time white wins, half of the time black wins, just as if they were tossing a quarter.
</p>

<p>
The aliens then decide to model chess as a coin flip, as a 50-50 game with no underlying principles.
While this statistical technique might not be useful for predicting a single game, over the long run and over iterated games, <em>it is the most efficient and parsimonious possible model</em>.
</p>

<h3>"Inferior" models</h3>

<p>
Suppose, however that a "crank" scientist of the alien race posits that "God doesn't play dice" and that chess is a more complicated game, despite the fact that the aliens cannot observe it.
Suppose even he asks around and determines from humans that there are actually pieces on the board with functions, and he even devises a machine that allows his alien eyes to see the first move of the game of chess.
</p>

<p>
Seeing this move allows him to create a new theory and model of the game,
one that takes into account the first move made and he tries to generate a new set of probabilities of victory based on that move.
The model he makes, is of course highly arbitrary, stipulated and <em>ad hoc</em>.
In fact,
this model is inferior on many inevitable accounts.
For example:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>It is less predictive over iterated games than the coin flip model.</li>
    <li>It is not as parsimonious/minimal as the coin flip model.</li>
    <li>It adds new variables to the theory (pieces) that are suspect.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Which model is "right?"</h2>

<h3>Which model is closer to truth?</h3>

<p>
Since we, unlike the aliens, are not prevented by defect from observing chess, we know that the second, "inferior" theory of chess is truer.
Its theoretical categories, if apparently arbitrary in the eyes of the aliens, are getting at the actual underlying mechanics of chess.
Even if the model is less effective, it is certainly <em>righter</em>.
</p>

<h3>Which will cause fruitful scientific inquiry?</h3>

<p>
The coin flip model is a scientific dead-end.
Firstly, the coin flip model is constructed statistically, which presents the underlying mechanism to be randomness, and thus unworth of inquiry.
This isn't statistics hoisted above random variation we know to exist, instead, it's utterly blind statistics that covers over whatever principles underlie it.
</p>

<p>
Secondly and more importantly, in order to actually improve that model, it has to <em>lose</em> empirical solvency:
embracing the abstractions of pieces means introducing mess and
deviating in some way from the empircal generalization that half of all chess games are won by white and half by black.
</p>

<h3>This is not an abnormal circumstance.</h3>

<p>
The parable here, really an <em>example</em> is not abnormal.
In most affairs in science, whether that be physics or neuroscience or economics or chemistry, we are exactly like the partially-blind aliens.
</p>

<h3>"But science isn't about truth!"</h3>

<p>
Yeah, it is dude.
</p>

<p>
Even if you are pretending that science is about "models" or fitting equations and the like, again, the well-fit model is impossible to perfect, while the flawed, yet more true to reality model does have a potential over the long-term to be a superior one.
After exhaustive inquiry, an alien race might not only discover the pieces and the full set of rules behind chess, they might be able to predict what moves are good or bad and predict individual chess games.
Even on the standards of mere instrumentalism, the mindless positivistic theory is still actually inferior.
</p>

<h2>Local maxima</h2>

<img src="https://lukesmith.xyz/articles/pix/maximum.gif" alt="Local maximum">

<h3>The plot</h3>

<p>
One of the ways I visualize science and models is that each model is really like an n-dimensional optimization plot.
"Truth," or if you deny truth as metaphysics, "accuracy in data" or "well-fit equations" are upwards and the goal of science is to get further that way.
</p>

<p>
At the point you're at, you can tell which direction you can go to move upward, or, which little changes you can make to improve your model.
That is what incremental science is, after all: don't change assumptions and just fine-tune your equations.
The endless fine-tuning is sometimes thought of as "progress."
Of course I don't think that this is <em>bad</em>, but it is a very minor and scientifically less important part of science as a whole.
</p>

<p>
The reality of incremental science is that once you're at a local maximum, once you've fine-tuned your equations about as perfectly as possible,
it's over.
Everything next to you <em>looks</em> like a disimprovement.
It <em>looks</em> just like those inferior theories of alien chess that posit the existence of pieces.
From that, you might erroneously conclude that you have found the <em>global</em> maximum, which
due to the nature of the complexity of the universe and the multiplicity of
possible answers and theories, you flatly haven't.
</p>

<p>
Logical positivism is kind of theoretical lobotomy that implicitly tells scientists that they should never, ever, ever change foundational assumptions:
tweaking equations like an oblivious autist is Science®️ and everything else is "philosophy" or "metaphysics" or "pseudoscience."
This amounts to keeping each scientific field on whatever local maximum is closest, utterly unable to extricate themselves from it even when they see on the horizon abberant data.
<strong>If you want to understand the stagnation of science or any other specific field, this is where it comes from.</strong>
</p>

<h3>Purposefully "bad" science</h3>

<p>
In <i><a href="https://traffic.libsyn.com/secure/notrelated/S02E01_-_Against_Method_and_For_Pseudoscience.ogg">Against Method</a></i>, Paul Feyerabend, in what an unreflective mind might misinterpret as a "troll," says that it is important for science that people have biases, financial interests, interfering religious and political doctrines and the like in science.
Looking at the plot, you might now see why.
When we are stuck on a local maximum, every new data keeps our already-optimized model where it is no matter how low that maximum actually is.
What you need to shake it up is an external shock that totally moves our theoretical position somewhere new on the plot where we can try to optimize at another point, and then compare.
</p>

<h3>Basic assumptions</h3>

<p>
A prudent person should be able to question, "Am I even on the right track or am I playing with some model that has a fundamental flaw?"
I can guarantee you, optimizing for data and fitting math and equations is easy.
<strong>All theoretical programs are wrong because they make incorrect core assumptions.</strong>
This is very hard for the ego of scientists because it means:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Possibly illiterate dilettantes on the internet might see and bring to attention legitimate theoretical flaws.</li>
    <li>All the years you spend in graduate school counting angels on pinheads in your respective theoretical framework is mostly a waste of time.</li>
    <li>The borders of science are borders more of a sociological club than being the border of raw rigor.</li>
    <li>Most of the scientific work is not meaningful outside of the theoretical framework that gave rise to it.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>I guess this is the first blog post of the new year, even though I’m not someone who is keen on celebrating a new year, I sincerely hope every one would have a very bright 2021.</em></p>
<p>Most of you are enjoying unlimited internet at your homes, but sadly <a href="https://ruky.me/2020/12/28/sri-lanka-need-unlimited-internet-connections/">I’m coming from a part of the world that charges according to the data I use. </a></p>
<p>I basically pay for my data and I have monthly cap, and if I exceed that data limit I will have to buy an expensive data add-on. So data is something precious to me.</p>
<p>In the month of December, may be due to a technical error by the ISP my data add-on finished and I made a tweet criticizing them.</p>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Scammed again by <a href="https://twitter.com/SriLankaTelecom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@SriLankaTelecom</a> you should be ashamed of your practices </p><p>Bought a zoom package and data add-on today because I need zoom to work</p><p>But then suddenly by noon the internet got slower.

<p>The ISP was kind enough to reach out to me and I received an email detailing the data use of my internet connection.</p>
<p>It is a table with the websites/protocols I used, the data transmitted to that website/protocol in bytes.</p>
<p>One thing that immediately caught my eye was what’s at number 2, it was <strong>Pinterest</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>There has been 17 connections to Pinterest and Pinterest has sent me more than 1.2GB of data.</strong></p>
<p>Even the 2000+ requests to Facebook has only downloaded roughly 300MB of data.</p>
<p>Why Pinterest is sending so much data in just 17 requests? What do they contain?</p>
<p>Maybe they are preloading or caching images for better user experience. But still 1.28GB of images is likely to have more than 1000 images.</p>
<p>Another explanation can that the ISP is trying to give me an explanation why my data vanished. But both explanations doesn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>Since data is valuable to me I will try to block requests to Pinterest, and see if that will make a difference to my data usage.</p>
<p>I’ll request another report at the end of the month to see my data usage for the month of January to compare before and after blocking Pinterest.</p>
<p>Has anyone had a similar experience in Pinterest or is it just me?</p>

		<p>Splitting headache at 10am. Not a fine way to start the day.</p>
<p>For the last 10+ years, I’ve consumed 2-5 cups of coffee every day. I was hooked to coffee is an understatement. It had gotten so bad that if I didn’t get coffee by 9am, I’d get a debilitating migraine for the rest of the day. I also had restless sleep, bordering on insomnia, where I wouldn’t sleep at all for a couple nights a month.</p>
<div>

</div>
<p>In February 2020, I got the worst flu in years (don’t think it was COVID). The first three days were extra painful with withdrawal headaches.
I decided a change was in order. My last coffee was January 31st, 2020.
The rest of the process was not predetermined. I tried to follow my body needs and didn’t push to quit with a definite date in mind.</p>
<p>After I recovered from the flu, I switched to black tea for the next several months.
I felt physically sluggish and mentally slower.</p>
<p>Black tea was followed by green tea for about two months. My sleep dramatically improved, however still felt lethargic. After green tea, I still didn’t feel ready to stop all together.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.wints.org/img/articles/2021.01.04/tea.jpg" alt="Jasmine Pearl Tea"></p><figcaption>Savior, kinda</figcaption>
</div>
<p>Enter <u><a href="https://amzn.to/3pwj3Cc">jasmine pearl tea</a></u>. It’s rolled up into a ball and each ball has 1-3 tea leaves. I started using three tea balls for my morning tea. Over the course of three months, I’m down to <i>one tea ball every other day</i>. It’s been a useful tool for measuring caffeine intake. Final quitting day is February 1st, 2021.</p>
<p>The few things I’ve learned along the way:</p>
<h5 id="a-dont-plan-for-every-eventuality">A. Don’t plan for every eventuality</h5>
<p>It was tempting to outline every possible aspect of this challenge – what to drink, when to drink it, how often, when to decrease dosage, what to do in case of a backslide etc. I consciously avoided this for two reasons. One, making a full blown plan feels so satisfying that the actual challenge doesn’t feel compelling anymore, leading me to underperform or give up. And two, I might give up if I backslide so badly that my plan doesn’t account for it. That’s pretty demoralizing.</p>
<h5 id="b-celebrate-positive-consequences">B. Celebrate positive consequences</h5>
<p>I still have headaches if I miss my “caffeine window”. But they are far less painful and much more manageable. That’s a win! I sleep so much better now too.</p>
<h5 id="c-take-your-time">C. Take your time</h5>
<p>It took 10 years to get to this level of caffeine dependence. Spending one year to unwind this addiction is relatively fast! I felt a lot slower mentally in the first 6 months and still do as I continue to reduce my caffeine. I expect that once I no longer depend on caffeine, my body will pick up the slack.</p>
<p>All in all, This has been another step in discipline and a healthier me.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div content-type="article"><p>While the machine learning ecosystem’s transition to realtime inference, and the challenges therein, are very popular topics for engineers working on ML infrastructure (myself included), there is still plenty to be improved regarding batch inference.</p><p>In particular, we routinely see teams implementing batch pipelines running up against the same problems:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Batch inference jobs are too fragile. </strong>The larger your dataset, the more likely that at least one input is misconfigured or otherwise will cause issues with inference. If your entire batch job fails because one inference failed, that’s going to be a pain in your side.</li><li><strong>Building a batch pipeline requires too much configuration. </strong>Large datasets have to be stored somewhere. Batch jobs have to be scheduled. Whatever tools/platforms you use for these tasks, they need to interface with your predictor. Making all of the different pieces fit together often requires a large amount of boilerplate and tweaking.</li><li><strong>Debugging batch pipelines can be a headache.</strong> When you’re dealing with huge batches of predictions, explainability can be a challenge.</li></ol><p>Over the last few releases of Cortex, we’ve implemented a handful of new features specifically focused on fixing these problems in batch inference.</p><h3>1. Handling failure gracefully with retries and “best attempt” predictions</h3><p>As said before, it’s not uncommon for batch pipelines to be configured in such a way that a batch job is considered “failed” if a single inference fails. These pipelines also commonly lack any sophisticated logic for retrying inference. </p><p>In a research setting, we may only be interested in serving inference when we cover 100% of the dataset, but in production, this often not the case.</p><p>For example, imagine a fashion ecommerce company had a batch pipeline for serving product recommendations to users (recommendation engines are a fairly common use case for batch inference). The pipeline might look like this:</p><ul role="list"><li>Inference is run on their full dataset of users and products via a batch job.</li><li>These recommendations are then cached and referenced by the application while users browse.</li><li>Every two days, the new browsing data generated by users is used to retrain the recommendation engine, and the batch pipeline is run again.</li></ul><p>If out of 1 million users, the batch job encounters issues in generating recommendations for five, the company doesn’t want to throw out the entire job. They want to retry running inference on those five users a reasonable number of times, and then serve whatever predictions they could generate.</p><p>We’ve implemented both this idea of configurable retry behavior and serving “best attempt” predictions in the latest version of Cortex.</p><p>Now, in your API spec, you can set a "timeout"&nbsp;and a "max_recieve_count" field, which will put limits on the length of a batch job and the number of times a batch can be processed before terminating, respectively. Until either of those limits is reached, Cortex will automatically retry any failed prediction.</p><figure id="w-node-e31034f0707f-258b12d0"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6030edfd63364a668b1265/5ff3e165dcde97456f3fecc0_carbon%20(46).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In addition, once inference has been completed for the entire dataset, Cortex will return as many successful batches as possible. The batches that ultimately failed are then stored somewhere else for convenient debugging, which I’ll talk more about in a second.</p><h3>2. Improving reproducibility with dead letter queues and log aggregation</h3><p>In the above YAML, you might have noticed references to a dead letter queue. As of 0.25, you can now specify a queue to send failed batches to, without failing the entire job.</p><p>Besides making batch inferences more resilient, as discussed above, the dead letter queue significantly improves debugging and reproducibility.</p><p>The debugging benefit is pretty straightforward. The dead letter queue gives you a neat list of failed batches, making it easy to identify patterns and spot problems. This also plays into the reproducibility benefit.</p><p>For context, Cortex deployments are reproducible by default. On deploy, all model serving code, configuration, and metadata is packaged and assigned a unique id, creating a de facto versioning scheme. Given any prediction, you can reproduce the deployment responsible for it.</p><p>In the dead letter queue, because batches’ metadata is preserved, you can debug failed batches and draw a straight line between them, the job they belonged to, the endpoint that processed the job, and the deployment responsible. This gives you a straightforward path to reproducing a failed batch.</p><p><em>Note: To version your data and/or training pipelines, checkout open source tools like </em><a href="https://metaflow.org/" target="_blank"><em>Metaflow</em></a><em> or </em><a href="https://dvc.org/" target="_blank"><em>DVC</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>In addition to the dead letter queue, Cortex also provides a centralized interface for accessing logs and metrics that aggregates the logs and metrics from the distributed inference jobs. These logs can be streamed directly, or exported to a third party platform:</p><figure id="w-node-c37760251e2d-258b12d0"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6030edfd63364a668b1265/5ff3dd03068e8245bcadf074_carbon%20(45).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In conjunction, these features mean that batch APIs are both monitorable and reproducible.</p><h3>3. Building simple, flexible interfaces for data ingestion</h3><p>To run inference on a large dataset, we need to make it accessible to our predictor, and this can be surprisingly difficult. Oftentimes, we see teams writing a lot of boilerplate and/or hacking things to get their data out of S3 and generate predictions.</p><p>To make this easier, we implemented a few different ways for ingesting data in a batch API.</p><p>The first and most broadly applicable method is to simply pass your data directly into your predictor:</p><figure id="w-node-8af94e0de4e1-258b12d0"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6030edfd63364a668b1265/5ff3e175c9234a72a8e7ba01_carbon%20(47).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The “item_list” object contains a list of all the data Cortex needs to process, and “batch_size” tells Cortex how many items to process per batch.</p><p>This method is usable for the widest variety of situations, but also requires the most manual configuration. But, if you use S3 to store your dataset, Cortex can actually automate quite a bit of the ingestion process for you.</p><p>For example, you can simply pass Cortex an S3 url, and Cortex will automatically import your dataset. If you have extraneous files in your S3 bucket, you can also be specific about what files Cortex should ignore or include:</p><figure id="w-node-028f52c9ff4f-258b12d0"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6030edfd63364a668b1265/5ff3e2a3b01c72314ff2f273_carbon%20(49).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In addition to this, Cortex has an interface for when your input dataset is a newline delimited JSON file in an S3 directory (or a list of them). You can pass Cortex a link to your JSON file(s), and it will break the data apart into batches. This is particularly useful when one or more S3 files contains a large number of samples and must be broken down into batches:</p><figure id="w-node-963ac2258efb-258b12d0"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f6030edfd63364a668b1265/5ff3e2db707834c075b856b9_carbon%20(50).png" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>As you can see, this approach also offers “includes” and “excludes” fields for you to use in filtering your dataset. </p><p>This is just the beginning. We’re currently developing more interfaces for ingesting datasets for batch prediction, including for Google Storage now that <a href="https://www.cortex.dev/post/announcing-multi-cloud-support">Cortex supports GCP</a>.</p><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p>As you have probably already noticed because you decided to visit this page, requests can take forever to run, so here’s a nice blog written while I was an intern at NLMatics to show you how to use <code>asyncio</code> to speed them up.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-asyncio">What is <code>asyncio</code>?</h2>
<p>It is a Python library that uses the <code>async/await</code> syntax to make code run asynchronously.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-it-mean-to-run-asynchronously">What does it mean to run asynchronously?</h2>
<h3 id="synchronous-normal-vs-asynchronous-using-asyncio">Synchronous (normal) vs. Asynchronous (using <code>asyncio</code>)</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Synchronous:</strong> you must wait for the completion of the first task before starting another task.</li>
  <li><strong>Asynchronous:</strong> you can start another task before the completion of the first task.</li>
</ul>

<p><img src="http://nlmatics.github.io/site_files/connie_post_images/synchronous.png" alt="">
<img src="http://nlmatics.github.io/site_files/connie_post_images/asynchronous.png" alt=""></p>

<p>For more information on the distinction between concurrency, parallelism, threads, sync, and async, check out this <a href="https://medium.com/swift-india/concurrency-parallelism-threads-processes-async-and-sync-related-39fd951bc61d">Medium article</a>.</p>

<h2 id="simple-analogies">Simple analogies</h2>
<h3 id="brick-and-mortar">Brick and Mortar</h3>

<p><img src="http://nlmatics.github.io/site_files/connie_post_images/brick-and-mortar.jpg" width="500" height="334"></p>

<p>Simon and Ash are building 5 walls of brick.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Simon builds one wall and waits for it to set before starting to build the next wall (synchronous).</li>
  <li>Ash, on the other hand, starts building the next wall before the first one sets (asynchronous).  <br>&lt;/br&gt;
Ash starts the next task whereas Simon <strong>waits</strong>, so Ash (asynchronous) will finish faster.
The lack of <strong><em>waiting</em></strong> is the key to why asynchronous programming provides a performance boost.</li>
</ul>

<p>A good coding use case would be when you have a lot of time-consuming requests lined up with the outputs independent of each other. request1 takes a while to finish running, so instead of waiting, you start request2, which doesn’t affect the output of request1.</p>

<h3 id="laundry">Laundry</h3>

<p><img src="http://nlmatics.github.io/site_files/connie_post_images/laundry.jpg" width="500"></p>

<p>Be wary that an asynchronous approach does not provide any performance boost when all the tasks are <strong>dependent</strong> on each other. For example, if you are washing and drying clothes, you must wait for the clothes to finish washing first before drying them no matter what, because drying clothes is dependent on the output of the washing. There is no use in using an asynchronous approach, because the pipeline is just the same as a synchronous approach.</p>

<p>The coding equivalent of this laundry example is when the output of request1 is used as the input in the request2.</p>

</ul>

<p>But with that, let’s jump straight into the code.</p>

<p>Follow along with the Python file and Jupyter Notebook in this <a href="https://github.com/nlmatics/asyncio-for-requests">github repo</a> that I developed for this post!</p>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<h3 id="preliminary">Preliminary</h3>

<p>Get imports and generate the list of urls to get requests from. Here, I use <a href="https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/">this placeholder url</a>. Don’t forget to do <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> in the terminal for all the modules that you don’t have. Normal <code>requests</code> cannot be awaited, so you will need to <code>import requests_async</code> to run the asynchronous code.</p>

<pre><code>import requests, requests_async, asyncio, time

itr = 200
tag = 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/'
urls = []
for i in range(1, itr):
    urls.append(tag + str(i))
</code></pre>

<h3 id="synchronous">Synchronous</h3>

<p>This is what some typical Python code for requests would look like.</p>
<pre><code>def synchronous(urls):
    for url in urls:
        r = requests.get(url)
        print(r.json())
</code></pre>

<h3 id="asynchronous">Asynchronous</h3>

<h4 id="incorrect-alteration">Incorrect Alteration</h4>
<p>The following is an understandable but bad alteration to the synchronous code. The runtime for this is the same as the runtime for the synchronous method, because you have not created a list of tasks that the program knows it needs to execute together, thus you essentially still have synchronous code.</p>
<pre><code>async def asynchronous_fail(urls):
    for url in urls:
        r = await requests_async.get(url)
        print(r.json())
</code></pre>

<h4 id="correct-alteration">Correct Alteration</h4>
<p>Create a list of tasks, and run all of them together using <code>asyncio.gather()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>async def asynchronous(urls):
    tasks = []
    for url in urls:
        task = asyncio.create_task(requests_async.get(url))
        tasks.append(task)
    responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    for response in responses:
        print(response.json())
</code></pre>

<h2 id="running-the-code">Running the Code</h2>

<h3 id="python">Python</h3>
<p>Simply add these three lines to the bottom of your Python file and run it.</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>starttime</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>
<span>asyncio</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>(</span><span>asynchronous</span><span>(</span><span>urls</span><span>))</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>starttime</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>If you try to run this same code in Jupyter Notebook, you will get this error:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>RuntimeError: asyncio.run<span>()</span> cannot be called from a running event loop
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This happens because Jupyter is already running an event loop. More info <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55409641/asyncio-run-cannot-be-called-from-a-running-event-loop">here</a>. You need to use the following:</p>

<h3 id="jupyter-notebook">Jupyter Notebook</h3>
<div><div><pre><code><span>starttime</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span>
<span>await</span> <span>asynchronous</span><span>(</span><span>urls</span><span>)</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>time</span><span>.</span><span>time</span><span>()</span> <span>-</span> <span>starttime</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="ordering">Ordering</h2>

<p>Asynchronous running can cause your responses to be out of order. If this is an issue, create your own responses list and fill it up, rather than receiving the output from <code>asyncio.gather()</code>.</p>
<pre><code>async def asynchronous_ordered(urls):
    responses = [None] * len(urls) # create own responses list
    tasks = []
    for i in range(len(urls)):
        url = urls[i]
        task = asyncio.create_task(fetch(url, responses, i))
        tasks.append(task)
    await asyncio.gather(*tasks) # responses is not set to equal this
    for response in responses:
        print(response.json())

async def fetch(url, responses, i):
    response = await requests.get(url)
    responses[i] = response # fill up responses list
</code></pre>

<h2 id="batching">Batching</h2>

<p>Sometimes running too many requests concurrently can cause timeout errors in your resource. This is when you need to create tasks in batches and gather them separately to avoid the issue. Find the <code>batch_size</code> that best fits your code by experimenting with a smaller portion of requests. Requests that take longer to process (long server delay) are more likely to cause errors than others. In my own experience with NLMatic’s engine, MongoDB had timeout errors whenever I ran batches of size greater than 10.</p>

<img src="http://nlmatics.github.io/site_files/connie_post_images/chart.png" width="500"></p>

<p><code>synchronous</code> and <code>asynchronous_fail</code> have similar runtimes because the <code>asynchronous_fail</code> method was not implemented correctly and is in reality synchronous code.
<code>asynchronous</code>, <code>asynchronous_ordered</code>, and <code>asynchronous_ordered_batched</code> have noticeably better runtimes in comparison to <code>synchronous</code> - up to 4 times as fast.</p>

<p>In general, <code>asynchronous_ordered_batched</code> gives fast and stable code, so use that if you are going for consistency. However, the runtimes of <code>asynchronous</code> and <code>asynchronous_ordered</code> can sometimes be better than <code>asynchronous_ordered_batched</code>, depending on your database and servers. So, I recommend using <code>asynchronous</code> first and then adding extra things (order and batch) as necessary.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>As you have seen, <code>asyncio</code> is a helpful tool that can greatly boost your runtime if you are running a lot of independent API requests. It’s also very easy to implement when compared to threading, so definitely try it out. Of course, make sure that your requests are independent.</p>

<p>Now I must conclude by saying that using asyncio improperly implemented can cause many bugs, so sometimes it is not worth the hassle. If you really must, use my guide and use it  s p a r i n g l y.</p>

<p>And that’s a wrap!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>The principle of maximum entropy states that the probability distribution which best represents the current state of knowledge is the one with largest entropy, in the context of precisely stated prior data (such as a proposition that expresses testable information). These prior data serves as the constrains to the probability distribution.</p>



<p>Given the second law of thermodynamics (principle of increase of entropy), isolated systems spontaneously evolve towards thermodynamic equilibrium, the state with maximum entropy, maximum entropy distributions become the most natural distributions under certain constrains. In this blog post, I would like to discuss entropy maximization and a couple of maximum entropy distributions.</p>

<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>

<h4 id="gaussian-integral">Gaussian Integral</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>I will skip the proof here, since the proof from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_integral">Wikipedia</a> is not that difficult to understand.</p>

<h4 id="useful-integrals">Useful Integrals</h4><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} d(-x^2) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty}\\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 e^{-x^2} dx &amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x d (e^{-x^2}) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( x e^{-x^2} \big\rvert_{-\infty}^{\infty} - \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx \Big) \\
&amp;= -\frac{1}{2} \Big( 0 - \sqrt{\pi} \Big) \\
&amp;= \frac{\sqrt{\pi}}{2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Notice that here we used integral by parts.</p>

<h3 id="entropy-maximization">Entropy Maximization</h3>

<h4 id="discrete-probability-distribution">Discrete Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Suppose $P$ is a discrete probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We further have some constrains on $P$:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$</li>
  <li>$\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>The first two constrains are trivial given $P$ is a probability distribution. The third constrain is optional and it indicates a constrain on the entire system. Notice that there could be more than one constrain if $m &gt; 1$.</p>



<p>We would like to maximize the entropy.</p><p>

\[\max_{P} H(P) = \max_{P} \Big( - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) \Big)\]

</p><p>Letâ€™s try to solve this optimization problem. We would use Lagrange multiplier for the constrains.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) + \lambda_0 \Big(\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \sum_{x \in X}^{} \Big(P(x) r_i(x) - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\sum_{x \in X}^{} P(x) &amp;= \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)}\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="continuous-probability-distribution">Continuous Probability Distribution</h4>

<p>Similarly, suppose $P$ is a continuous probability distribution. The entropy is defined as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
H(P) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>With the following constrains</p>

<ul>
  <li>$P(x) \geq 0$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$</li>
  <li>$\int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x) dx = \alpha_i$ for $1 \leq i \leq m$</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, to maximize the entropy, we maximize the Lagrangian for the continuous case.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x) dx + \lambda_0 \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We take the derivative of $L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m)$ with respect to $P(x)$ and the derivative should be $0$. We will also use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calculus_of_variations">calculus of variations</a> to compute the derivative, which is slightly more complicated. Without going into all the details, we have the following derivatives.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} L(P, \lambda_0, \lambda_1, \cdots, \lambda_m) &amp;= - \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \int_{X}^{} P(x) \log P(x)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \int_{X}^{} \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \big( P(x) \log P(x) \big)  dx + \lambda_0 \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big(\int_{X}^{} P(x)  dx - 1 \Big) + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i \frac{\partial}{\partial P(x)} \Big( \int_{X}^{} P(x) r_i(x)  dx - \alpha_i \Big) \\
&amp;= - \log P(x) - 1 + \lambda_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x) \\
&amp;= 0 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{e^{1 - \lambda_0}} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because $\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx = 1$,</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{X}^{} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{X}^{} e^{\big(\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)\big) + \lambda_0 - 1 } dx \\
&amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1} \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx \\
&amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Therefore,</p><p>

\[e^{1 - \lambda_0} = \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx\]

</p><p>With this, we could rewrite $P(x)$ as</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h3 id="maximum-entropy-distribution-examples">Maximum Entropy Distribution Examples</h3>

<h4 id="roll-dice">Roll Dice</h4>

<p>A conventional dice has 6 faces. $X = \{ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 \}$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So, the maximum entropy probability distribution of getting each face of the dice is</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \sum_{x \in X}^{} e^{0} } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ 6 } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="uniform-distribution">Uniform Distribution</h4>

<p>The only constrain we put on a distribution is $X = [a, b]$. Because we donâ€™t have additional constrains, therefore</p><p>

\[\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_m = 0\]

</p><p>So the maximum entropy probability distribution is actually uniform distribution.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= \frac{ e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} }{ \int_{X}^{} e^{\sum_{i=1}^{m} \lambda_i r_i(x)} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ e^{0} }{ \int_{a}^{b} e^{0} dx } \\
&amp;= \frac{ 1 }{ b - a } \\
\end{align}\]

</p><h4 id="gaussian-distribution">Gaussian Distribution</h4>

<p>We could also derive Gaussian Distribution using entropy maximization. The constrains for the maximum entropy distribution are</p>

<ul>
  <li>$X = (-\infty, \infty)$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{E}[X] = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x P(x) dx = \mu$</li>
  <li>$\mathbb{V}[X] = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mathbb{E}[X]^2 = \mathbb{E}[X^2] - \mu^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^2 P(x) dx - \mu^2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul>

<p>which translates to</p>

<ul>
  <li>$m = 2$</li>
  <li>$r_1(x) = x$, $\alpha_1 = \mu$</li>
  <li>$r_2(x) = x^2$, $\alpha_2 = \sigma^2$</li>
</ul><p>

\[\begin{align}
P(x) &amp;= e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Because</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= 1 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{\lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2} dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \big( \lambda_0 - 1 + \lambda_1 x + \lambda_2 x^2 \big) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \Big[ \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2^2} \Big] \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2} \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( \lambda_2 \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>Here we assume $\lambda_2 &lt; 0$, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( -(-\lambda_2) \big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) dx  \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }} \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)^2 \bigg) d \Big( \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big) \Big)  \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>To make it more clear, we set</p><p>

\[y = \sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }\big(x + \frac{\lambda_1}{2\lambda_2}\big)\]

</p><p>So using Gaussian integral, we further have</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} P(x) dx &amp;= \frac{1}{\sqrt{ -\lambda_2 }} \exp \bigg( - \frac{\lambda_1^2 - 4 \lambda_0 \lambda_2 + 4 \lambda_2}{4\lambda_2}  \bigg) \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \exp \bigg( - …</p></div></div>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A few years ago, while using the Line app, I noticed a feature called "People nearby." The feature lets you connect with other Line users within the same area. The feature would give you the exact distance from you to the other users. If someone spoofs their latitude, longitude, they can triangulate a user and find their location. I reported an issue in the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://line.me/en/" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Line app</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and They paid me $1000 for it. They fixed it by adding a random number to the user's destination. You can find my name&nbsp;</span><a href="https://bugbounty.linecorp.com/en/halloffame/2017/" target="_blank"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">here</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">.&nbsp;</span></p><p>A few days ago, I installed Telegram, and I noticed that they have the same feature. I tried to see if I can unmask other users' locations, and I found they have the same issue I discovered in the Line app a few years ago. I reported the problem to Telegram security, and they said it's not an issue.&nbsp;<strong>If you enable the feature of making yourself visible on the map, you're publishing your home address online. </strong><span>Lot of users don't know this when they enable that feature. This is what they said when I emailed them:</span>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>From:<span>	</span>security@telegram.org</p><p>To: me</p><p>Hello,</p><p>Thanks for reaching us out.

They’re structured as <strong>event-driven systems. </strong>That basically mean they react to “events” that can occur at any time.  That’s physical event sources like button presses, battery alerts, and sensors inputs, but also to incoming Bluetooth communications from an App. In our experience, even top-tier chip vendors like Nordic Semiconductors provide subpar guidance on how to best orchestrate this system of events and reactions. An unsuspecting developer may feel they’re using a lean approach, linking event sources in code to their corresponding reactions in a piecemeal fashion. The complexity of this patch network soon grows exponentially and starts feeling like a firmware savant is required just to make sense of it all.   As the project grows, the <strong>event-reaction mappings grow in quantity </strong>and<strong> </strong>likely require being dynamically re-mapped in different modes of operation. If left untreated, the affliction can get the best of you, spreading faster than you add features.

Rather than reacting to events all over your different interrupt execution contexts, an event queue allows you to consolidate those portions of your code into one place. It’s your conduit for “deferring” the handling of events from many contexts (like interrupts) into one main context. It additionally solves the issue of thread/interrupt safety, by avoiding concurrent access of shared resources across different contexts..  For example, you don’t want a SPI peripheral used in two contexts that can interrupt one another. Instead, both contexts can queue events for the main function to perform the SPI operations sequentially. </p></li><li><p>Use a <strong>hierarchical state machine (HSM)</strong>, and a framework to implement one. An HSM is the  knockout punch for our spaghetti foe. It provides an intuitive and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deterministic_finite_automaton">deterministic</a> scheme to define how events should be handled throughout various modes of operation. HSMs are “hierarchical” in the sense that each state can be configured to inherit behaviors from a “superstate”, a more general state that encapsulates it and potentially other states. The hierarchical aspect of HSMs make them far more practical for real-world firmware applications than a textbook flat state machine. A “battery charging” and “charging complete” state could both inherit and share a bulk of their code from an “charger attached” state. </p></li></ol></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1579801278944_14942"><div><h2><strong>Immunization Step 1 of 2: <br>Take a queue from your vendor</strong></h2><p><strong>An event queue is the essence of event-driven architecture</strong>.

    <p><strong>Monday, January  4, 2021</strong></p>

    <p>If you're building an application that needs to scale—and we all tell ourselves that we are—then at some point you have to figure out if it <em>does</em> or not. This is where load testing comes in: if you want to see whether or not your application can handle scale, just <em>generate</em> scale and see if it can handle it! It sounds straightforward enough.</p>
<p>Then you try to actually generate load. This is straightforward if your application is dead simple, because you can use something like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_JMeter">Apache JMeter</a> to generate repeated requests. If you can do this, I envy you: every system I've worked on is more complicated and requires a more intricate testing plan.</p>
<p>Your application gets slightly more complicated, so you then turn to tools like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gatling_(software)">Gatling</a>. These let you simulate virtual users going through scenarios, which is a lot more helpful than just <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_(software)">besieging</a>&nbsp;one or a handful of URLs. Even this isn't sufficient if you're writing an application that uses both WebSockets <em>and</em> HTTP calls, over a long-lived session, and requires certain actions repeated on a timer. Unless I severely missed something in the documentation, I cannot see a way to, say, setup a heartbeat that runs ever 30 seconds, do certain actions upon response to a WebSocket message, and also do some other HTTP actions, all with the same HTTP session. I haven't found a way to do that in <em>any</em> load testing tool (which is why I wrote my own at work, which I hope to open source if I can make the time to clean it up and separate out proprietary bits).</p>
<p>But let's suppose you <em>do</em> have a tool that works, out of the box, like Gatling or Locust, and it fits your needs. Great! Now let's write that test. In my experience, this is the hardest bit yet, because you have to first figure out what realistic load looks like — welcome to a day or three of dredging through logs and taking notes while you peer at the network tools in your browser as you click around in your web application. And then after you know what realistic load looks like, you get to write what boils down to a subset of your application to pretend to be a user, hit the API, and do the things your user would do.</p>
<p>And we're not done yet! This is fine, we have our load test written and it's realistic. But this is a moving target, because updates keep going out. So now you have the maintenance problem, too: as your application changes, how do you keep your load test up to date? There isn't great tooling to do this, there is little out there to help you. You have to make this part of your process and hope you don't miss things. This is not a satisfying answer, and that's why this is also one of the hardest parts of load testing an application.</p>
<p>We'll just skip the whole "running it" part, because honestly, if you've gotten this far through a load test, then running it shouldn't be the hardest part.</p>

<p>So basically, here's where we are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most load testing tools support simplistic workloads, and even the complex ones don't let you do everything that's realistically needed to simulate <em>real</em> usage of a web application.</li>
<li>Writing the test with a simulation of real usage is the hardest part, even if the tools do support what you need.</li>
<li>Maintaining the test is the second hardest part, and the tooling here does not help you in the slightest.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let's look at these in detail and see how much complexity we can pare away.</p>
<h2 id="simulating-users-do-we-have-to">Simulating users. Do we have to?</h2>
<p>I'm a "yes" here, although it might depend on your application. And for these purposes, we're talking about the user <em>of a service</em>; if you have a monolith, this is your users as a whole, but if you have microservices the "user" might be another one of your services! For the applications I've worked on, I have had minor success with targeted tests of specific endpoints. But these end up requiring such complicated setup that you aren't better off than you were with the load test itself! And while it may yield some results and improvements, it doesn't get to everything (you may have endpoints that interact) and you don't get a realistic workload.</p>
<p>"When do you <em>not</em> need to simulate users?" is probably a better question. Seems to me like this is when you <em>know</em> that your endpoints are all independent in performance, you don't have any stateful requests, and the ordering of requests does not impact performance. These are big things to assume and it's hard to have confidence in them without testing their independence, at which point, we're back to writing that whole dang test.</p>
<p>The best you can do here is probably at the API and system design time, not at your test time. If you design a simpler API, you're going to have far less surface area to test. If you design a system with more certainly independent pieces (distinct databases per service, for example) then it's easier to test them in isolation than in a monolith. Doing this also lets you use a tool that is simpler, so you get two wins!</p>
<h2 id="writing-the-tests-is-hard-so-is-maintenance">Writing the tests is <em>hard.</em> So is maintenance.</h2>
<p>Creating a load test is hard because you have to do a few things: you have to understand what the flow through <em>usage</em> of your API is, and you have to write a simulation of that usage. Understanding that flow means understanding other systems than the one under test and since your system is presumably not the focus of their documentation, there is not going to be a super clear diagram of when and how it's called; this often looks like sifting logs until you figure out what the representative usage is. And then writing that simulation is certainly not trivial, because you need to manage the state for a large number of actors representing users of your API!</p>
<p>Oh, and you get to write integration tests for this now, too.</p>
<p>There's some research out there on how to make some of these tasks easier. You can figure out what you need for the initial test, and detect regressions (missing new workloads) from automated analysis of the logs, for example. But as far as I can tell, there is no software on GitHub, let alone a product I can buy, that's going to do that for me. So it doesn't seem like it has much of any traction in industry. It would be a big project to implement it on your own, which might be why it has languished (or is done at big companies, and is not spoken of).</p>

<p>There's a lot of complexity in load tests, and there is not a lot of tooling to help you with it. So maybe the answer is: write fewer of these types of tests, and don't expect them to give you all the answers to how your system performs.</p>
<p>You have a few options for getting a great picture of how your system performs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good old analysis.</strong> Sit down with a notebook, a pen, an understanding of your systems as a whole, and an afternoon to spare, and you can figure out with some napkin math what the general parameters and bounds of scaling on your system are. When you find the bottleneck, or you have some unknowns (how many transactions per second <em>can</em> our database support? how many do we generate?) then you can go test those specifically!</li>
<li><strong>Feature rollouts.</strong> If you can roll out features slowly across your users, then you don't necessarily have to do any load testing at all! You can measure performance experimentally and see if it's good enough. Good? Roll forward. Bad? Roll back.</li>
<li><strong>Traffic replay.</strong> This doesn't help at all with new features (see feature rollouts ten words ago for that) but it does help with understanding your system breaking points for existing features without as much development. You can take the traffic you saw before and replay it (multiple times over, even, by combining multiple different periods' traffic) and see how the system performs! (Side note: I would <em>love</em> tooling to help with this, and with amplifying traffic when doing this, so if anyone has a recommendation... hit me up.)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you have some silver bullet I've missed, or a fantastic research paper in this area you'd recommend reading, or a story of terrible times with scaling that you want to share with me, please email them to <a href="mailto:me@ntietz.com">me@ntietz.com</a>.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>For the past while, I’ve had the goal of learning a functional programming language in the back of my mind but never acted on it for various reasons. However, during a recent weekend afternoon of winter COVID-lockdown web browsing, I stumbled across the terrific <a href="https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/" target="_blank">F# for fun and profit</a> which piqued my interest and convinced me to take the plunge and learn FP in 2021. I believe that learning different programming paradigms helps you become stronger in all languages, and with C# incorporating more and more features from F# (records among other things for example) learning functional programming would be a benefit in a few different ways.</p>

<p>In addition, as I’ve been spending quite a bit of time working with C# and .NET 5 recently, F# felt like a natural fit due to the interoperability with the rest of the .NET ecosystem. In addition, F# has support for OO and so you can use a hybrid model in situations where pure FP may not be possible.</p>

<h2 id="initial-thoughts">Initial Thoughts</h2>

<p>As a small learning project, I created a simple program which asks the user for a username and password and prints a message if the user enters the correct combination (if they get the combination wrong the function is called recursively and asks them for their credentials again). Figuring out the implementation details proved to be a bit more challenging than if I were to code the solution in C# as you don’t want to use statements such as if and while in functional programming which would normally be my go-tos in a case like this. After much trial and error, I found my solution to be quite elegant:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>open</span> <span>System</span>

<span>type</span> <span>LoginModel</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>;</span> <span>Password</span><span>:</span> <span>string</span><span>}</span>

<span>// By making Admins a Set.OfList we can use .Contains later.</span>
<span>let</span> <span>Admins</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"MJ"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"M"</span><span>};</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"Joe"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"C"</span><span>}]</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>.</span><span>ofList</span>

<span>[&lt;</span><span>EntryPoint</span><span>&gt;]</span>
<span>let</span> <span>main</span> <span>args</span> <span>=</span>

    <span>// The LoginRoutine() is a recursive function we call until the user enters the correct credentials.</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rec</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span> <span>=</span> 
        <span>printfn</span> <span>"Welcome to VMS Version V!"</span>
        <span>printf</span> <span>"Enter your username to continue: "</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>usernameAttempt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>ReadLine</span><span>()</span>
        <span>printf</span> <span>"Enter your password to continue: "</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>passwordAttempt</span> <span>=</span> <span>Console</span><span>.</span><span>ReadLine</span><span>()</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>loginCredentials</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>usernameAttempt</span><span>;</span> <span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>passwordAttempt</span><span>}</span>
        <span>match</span> <span>Admins</span><span>.</span><span>Contains</span> <span>loginCredentials</span> <span>with</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>true</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>printfn</span> <span>"You are logged in"</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>false</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span>
    
    <span>let</span> <span>login</span> <span>=</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span>

    <span>0</span> <span>// Terminate program</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In comparison to C#, we see several big differences in the code. Aside from the lack of brackets and semicolons, the program uses a match expression rather than an if statement to evaluate the user’s credentials. Pattern matches are powerful expressions and from what I’ve seen can allow for complex branching.</p>

<p>Also note the creation of the Admins list:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>let</span> <span>Admins</span> <span>=</span> <span>[{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"MJ"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"M"</span><span>};</span> <span>{</span><span>Username</span><span>=</span><span>"Joe"</span><span>;</span><span>Password</span><span>=</span><span>"C"</span><span>}]</span> <span>|&gt;</span> <span>Set</span><span>.</span><span>ofList</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>During the binding, we never specifed the actual type! F#’s powerful type inference means that I can skip a lot of boilerplate that I would normally use in C# while still having all the benefits of a strongly typed language.</p>

<p>We also make use of the pipe forward operator |&gt; in order to take the admins list and turn it into a set. Converting the list to a set allows us to use .Contains on our admins list in the match expression later on in the code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>        <span>match</span> <span>Admins</span><span>.</span><span>Contains</span> <span>loginCredentials</span> <span>with</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>true</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>printfn</span> <span>"You are logged in"</span>
        <span>|</span> <span>false</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>LoginRoutine</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Since the LoginRountine function has been marked with the rec (recursive) keyword, it will continue to call itself until the match returns true. This eliminates the need for using a while loop while keeping our method immutable.</p>

<p>In addition, its important to note that F# executes code from the top down which I find makes following program flow much easier. Despite this, I did run into a few compiler errors until I got the hang of the execution flow and making sure to put functions in the proper order.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>
<p>So far, my biggest issue hasn’t been with the language itself, but rather the lack of learning resources compared with other, more popular languages. <a href="https://www.manning.com/books/get-programming-with-f-sharp" target="_blank">Get Programming with F#</a> has been a terrific book for learning, but the paradigm shift that functional programming requires can be quite significant and I find myself constantly Googling certain issues and being able to count the number of (usually not very related) Stack Exchange topics on one hand. I did however find a great small but active <a href="https://discord.gg/vs4U6HQhAG" target="_blank">F# Discord community</a> which has been great at answering smaller one-off questions that I’ve had regarding the language.</p>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>

<p>My next steps are to think about a project that I’d like to undertake in F# to help me continue my learning. I find I tend to learn best when I have a project and write a build log documenting the process, and I’m hoping that I’ll be able to combine an F# project with my <a href="https://markjames.dev/2020-12-09-back-to-school/" target="_blank">cloud computing program</a> that I’ll be attending at the end of January. I also plan to write a few more articles exploring the language a bit more in-depth in the coming months, so stay tuned!</p>

<p>Well, if you want the  technical description it’s a set of interactive computer models that simulate  the way fungi grow in three-dimensional space. We call it the Neighbour-Sensing  mathematical model of hyphal growth, and the mathematics and computer programs  were worked out by Audrius Meškauskas.</p>
<p>  The less technical description is that it’s a fun way to  watch <strong>virtual fungi</strong> ‘growing’ on your device’s screen (and then ‘clean it off’  at the click of a button). The apps that make up the modelling program allow  you to change the characteristics of the growing fungus.</p>
<p>Things like the amount  of branching, angle of branching and whether hyphal threads stay together or  grow apart (among several other features) can all be changed to establish their  effect on the way the <strong>simulated hyphae</strong> grow. <strong>The ultimate, controllable,  and most realistic cyberfungus on your own computer</strong>.</p>
<p>  We have used the Neighbour-Sensing mathematical model of  hyphal growth to study fungal networks. Our three-dimensional simulation of  growing fungi is an experimental tool. It is not a game or a painting program.</p>
<p>Rather, it provides the user with a way of experimenting with features that may  regulate hyphal growth patterns to arrive at suggestions that could be tested  with live fungi.</p>
<p>  If you stick with these pages, we’ll give you a complete  outline of the science and mathematics that underpin the Neighbour-Sensing  model of hyphal growth, but if you want to go straight to our research papers  you can start in the information box at the bottom of this page.</p>

The delivery driver who brought his groceries from Vons mentioned that drivers across the state are getting fired by Vons, Pavilions, and other California stores owned by Albertsons Companies in late February. Stores will instead turn to a third-party delivery service using independent contractors.</p><p id="d033">â€œI was disturbed and disappointed that Vons would eliminate these jobs. I felt like they were the only remaining company that treated delivery drivers ethically but no longer,â€� said Dylan.</p><p id="1f42">After publication, an Albertsons representative sent the following statement: â€œWe will transition that portion of our eCommerce operations to third-party logistics providers.â€� She added â€œWhile we know that this move will help us create a more efficient operation, it wasnâ€™t a decision we made lightly or without a great deal of consideration.â€�</p><p id="10d5">Drivers under the Albertsons Companies umbrella are employees, while Ralphs delivery is operated by Instacart and Target uses Shipt, a similar app. At Bay Area stores, drivers are unionized, and will not be affected by the layoffs. For southern California shoppers, this move leaves them without a grocery delivery option that treats drivers as employees.</p><p id="baaa">Unions are vowing to fight the change, says Jim Araby, Director of Strategic Campaigns at UCFW5. â€œThe only drivers that kept their jobs were the unionized drivers in the Bay Area. All the other drivers in California were laid off because they were non-union. We represent those drivers and they will keep their job.â€�</p><p id="4b12">These layoffs are unsurprising after the passage of Proposition 22, which gutted worker protections while making it easier for companies to shift financial burdens onto newly-designated â€œindependent contractors.â€� In a <a rel="noopener" href="https://knock-la.com/the-case-for-voting-no-on-ca-prop-22-a64d25b2828d">piece for KNOCK</a> last year, Keith F. Eberl predicted this exact outcome in the opening paragraph:</p><blockquote><p id="95b6">â€œContrary to the companiesâ€™ deceptive ad campaign and intimidating messages to their workers, Prop 22 does not preserve driver flexibility or save drivers from politicians. What Prop 22 does do is change current law so the companies can shift their costs to the driver and diminish or remove driversâ€™ rights, protections, and benefits. Prop 22 will also block driversâ€™ ability to organize so they canâ€™t collectively bargain a contract. In addition, this proposition will block local governments from writing or enforcing protections for drivers.â€�</p></blockquote><p id="a03f">The only surprise is the speed at which Albertsons reversed course on its commitments to workers. This move comes after nearly a year of celebrating grocery store workers for feeding communities. <a href="https://www.vons.com/steps-we-are-taking-at-your-grocery-store.html" rel="noopener">Earlier this year</a>, Albertsons Companies President &amp; CEO Vivek Sankaran said the company was â€œtaking care of our team.â€� Albertsons Companies â€œare workingâ€¦ to ensure that every member of our team who faces a crisis can have peace of mind that we will help them get through it.â€�</p><p id="c5d5">Albertsons was happy to reap public goodwill during the pandemic. But once Prop 22 gave the company the option of replacing workers with lower-paid contractors, they jumped at the opportunity. Employees received notice during the holidays that their employment would end one month into the new year.</p><p id="66cc">Early in the pandemic, union members demanded hazard pay, additional medical leave, and employee protections during the pandemic. In March, Safeway and Northern California grocery workers <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/business/article/Coronavirus-Safeway-reaches-new-agreement-for-15150811.php" rel="noopener">reached an agreement</a> providing these additional benefits.</p><p id="452b">Labor and management were able to cooperate in April, requesting that grocery workers be designated as first responders. In an April j<a href="https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/helping-you-through-covid-19/albertsons-companies-ucfw-launch-joint-effort.html" rel="noopener">oint statement</a>, Sankaran and United Food and Commercial Workers International Union (UFCW) President Marc Perrone wrote:</p><blockquote><p id="c86a">â€œThis joint action is an example of how all Americans must work together to protect everyone working on the frontlines. This includesâ€¦ associates at our nationâ€™s grocery stores who are providing communities with the essential food and supplies needed to weather this public health crisis.â€�</p></blockquote><p id="0a33">Negotiations in October <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/10/08/grocery-warehouse-workers-truck-drivers-give-notice-of-potential-strike/" rel="noopener">turned contentious</a>, as members of the Teamsters issued a notice of potential strike due to rising healthcare costs. Lou Villavazo, who chairs the bargaining effort, told the <a href="https://www.ocregister.com/2020/10/08/grocery-warehouse-workers-truck-drivers-give-notice-of-potential-strike/" rel="noopener">Orange County Register</a> that â€œemployers have been bargaining in bad faith. Weâ€™ve had over 18 bargaining sessions with them and we provided our economic proposal â€¦ but no response.â€�</p><p id="e2db">Organized labor made the difference for drivers in the Bay Area, who will remain as employees for now. But without the power of a union, southern California drivers lack an organizational structure through which to fight back.</p><p id="b343">Many, myself included, turned to Vons and Albertsons stores for their groceries, knowing that drivers were employed with benefits. Unionized drivers offered a clear alternative to the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-24/no-holiday-cheer-for-gig-workers-hunting-your-last-minute-gifts" rel="noopener">hellscape of gig-economy apps</a> like Instacart.</p><p id="a579">In a <a href="https://www.albertsonscompanies.com/newsroom/appreciation-pay-for-front-line-associates.html" rel="noopener">March 2020 statement</a>, Sankaran said â€œthese times are unprecedented in the grocery industryâ€¦ [a] simple â€˜thank youâ€™ doesnâ€™t seem like quite enough.â€� He was right. Delivery drivers deserve healthcare, job protections, and fair wages. Workers won those fights this year because they fought as a union. With DoorDash taking over in February, that united front will be gone.</p><p id="26c2">You can contact Albertsons Companies and let them know what you think of this move:</p><p id="2910">Vons Retail Store/Corporate Phone Number: 877â€“723â€“3929</p><p id="2f7e">Albertsons Retail Store/Corporate Phone Number: 877â€“723â€“3929</p><p id="2b59"><em>EDITORâ€™S NOTE: After publication, Albertsonâ€™s responded to KNOCKâ€™s request for comment. This piece has since been edited to clarify that union drivers will not be laid off and that workers facing layoffs in Southern California are non-union, as well as to include statements from both Albertsons and UCFW5. The scheduled date of the layoffs was also corrected.</em></p></div></div></section></div>]]>

It's a total wipeout after two years of building a business that's also my full-time focus and my family's sole source of income. I'm heartbroken and confused.</p><h2><strong>The Cruelest Year</strong></h2><p>2020 has been awful, and despite this new challenge that I face, I still count myself blessed. A friend of mine has lived in a veritable shoebox for a decade, pumping every hour and cent he had into building two of the most beloved bars in New York City. He filed for bankruptcy last month. Another friend attended a family reunion in February; it was the last time that she'd see several of her relatives (who died from COVID-19 in the weeks that followed).</p><p>Again, no matter what happens to this site, I really do feel fortunate and blessed.</p><h2><strong>The Risk of Relying on Big Tech</strong></h2><p>As much as I've tried to diversify <em>Good, Cheap and Fast</em>'<em>s</em> revenue and traffic, I haven’t escaped the gravitational pull of Amazon and Google. This poses major risks and I advise caution to anyone considering a similar business model.</p><p>In April of this year, Amazon <a href="https://searchengineland.com/amazon-affiliate-commission-rates-cut-332966">reduced the affiliate commissions</a> that it pays to online publishers. My revenue fell by 41% as a result. It was a crushing blow that I attempted to mitigate by joining other affiliate programs, but they didn't pan out. The median conversion rate of the 70 other websites that I linked to was a meager 0.8%, which is approximately 1/10 of the conversion rate on Amazon.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607784280213_34634"><div>

I don't collect any personally identifiable information. I don't allow guest posts or third-party content. I'm completely transparent about how this website makes money as well as the methods and limitations of my product selection methodology. Every affiliate link on this site is properly disclosed and wrapped in a "rel sponsored" tag. I take the time to read scientific and medical research as it relates to the topics that I cover, and when I find a product that is potentially harmful (like weighted eye masks), I share my findings with every major publisher who has written positive things about that product. I use my expertise to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johndefeo_if-you-support-a-charity-via-amazonsmile-activity-6737737229449379840-vc6I/">support charity</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/johndefeo_to-my-friends-in-journalism-be-cautious-activity-6733095426775404544-FbxR/">to teach colleagues about scams</a>.

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607784280213_69057"><div><p>But, as much as I'd like this website to be a destination, it will never be one.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Good, Cheap and Fast</em> was profiled by big name websites like <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/90274504/hate-browsing-amazon-this-is-the-ultimate-no-frills-shopping-site">Fast Company</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/kottke/status/1067547920617086976">Kottke</a>. These media mentions drove hundreds of thousands of visits. Nevertheless, if someone who was referred to this website two years ago is looking for a cheap portable generator today, he or she is much more likely to Google "cheap portable generator" than to come to my homepage.</p><p>It's understandable. Alas, without search visibility, this site in invisible.</p><h2><strong>Can a Domain Be Cursed?</strong></h2><p>I did my due diligence before I registered goodcheapandfast.com. It had no backlink history and it had only existed previously as a parked domain in 2013. There are no obvious skeletons in this domain's closet, yet strange things have been afoot, almost since day one.</p><p>For example, Bing didn't even index this website's homepage a month after <em>Good, Cheap and Fast</em> was linked to from websites like Esquire and Slate. I contacted bingwb@microsoft.com with my concerns and received this response:</p><blockquote><p>Good day and thank you for your patience while we investigated the issue.</p><p>Firstly, I am happy to provide you information that our product review group succeeded in removing the block of the site. After submitting your site to be reviewed the team has decided to lift the  block. Please allow up to 2-3 weeks for your site to be crawled indexed and serving again.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I am unable to provide you the specifics of the block as our product review team does not share details of the block.</p></blockquote><p>The mystery didn't end there. Two years later, this website has received fewer than 100 total referrals from Bing. That's not normal and neither is this: Since 2019, pages on this website started dropping in-and-out of Google's results. An article that ranked #1 would disappear entirely, then reappear, then disappear, then reappear. These were like mini strokes. Sometimes the traffic bounced back in full; other times it gradually faded away.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1607704925648_28921"><div>

    <div><p>A conversational technique I learned recently (not that I think about all the things I say with such intention) is to tell people something they don't already know. <br></p><p>We're much hungrier for new information (even mistruths) than we are for truths that we already understand. Take for example the fake news headlines that seem to circulate on social media; we'll often choose to read and share something we suspect is probably only partly true over something that we think is true but widely known.<br></p><p>I suppose telling your audience something new is just one tenet of good storytelling, which all humans are drawn to. The experience we have of reading an immersive novel or a fascinating biography for the first time we can never have again, even if we experience if differently on reads two and three.<br></p><p>When talking about oneself, it's also more <i>impressive</i> to tell others something new. For example, friends and family will be far more interested and impressed when you tell them about the skydive you <i>did</i>, rather than the one you're <i>thinking</i> about doing.</p></div>

            I am no stranger to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomscrolling">Doom Scrolling</a>. 
            I am guilty of scrolling through r/coronavirus (I don't even want to link it) on Reddit. 
            This was a great source of stress for me: I was counting every number, looking at infection 
            rates across populations, observing hospital capacities, and to put it candidly, watching 
            people die. I decided to cut back on coronavirus news, and found that my days were generally 
            happier. At a certain point, though, I cut the news out all together. Why?
        </p>
        <h2>I Already Know What I Need To Do</h2>
        <p>
            I have come to realize that no coronavirus news will (or should) change my behavior. 
            I should wear my mask and I should socially distance. What else do I need to know?
            If you've felt the stress of reading about coronavirus news, I personally recommend 
            you try cutting it out. Seriously, you're not going to miss much.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  
  <div>
    



<article>
  <p>
    Sometimes, when we make seamless patterns out of several objects,
    we need to deal with the situations where the objects are on the borders.
    Usually we create copies of the objects and place them
    at proper positions to make the tiling work with no seams.
  </p>
  <!--more-->

  

  <p>
    In CSS, there's a possible way to do it without creating
    copies manually or doing any calculations to the positions,
    by utilizing the CSS <code>background</code> property.
  </p>

  <p>
    Background in CSS is repeatable by default,
    if we create objects using <code>background</code> or <code>background-image</code>,
    they can be tiled automatically regardless of their positions.
  </p>

   <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>30%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>

  <span>/* default */</span>
  <span>background-size</span><span>:</span> <span>100%</span> <span>100%</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-repeat</span><span>:</span> <span>repeat</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
    
    
  </div>

  <h2>Pattern fragment</h2>

  <p>
    We start with specifying the size of the fragment which is being used for tiling,
    This is an essential step since it determines the repeatable space of the pattern.
  </p>

<div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
    
  </div>

  <p>
    Create a circle object using <code>radial-gradient</code> in the background.
  </p>

 <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>30%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
    
    
  </div>

  <p>
    The circle is being tiled properly even though you can't see the edges.
    Move it to somewhere else using <code>background-position</code>.
    No need to worry about getting over the edges,
    the browser has taken care of it for us.
  </p>


 <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>30%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
  <span>background-position</span><span>:</span> <span>-110px</span> <span>-20px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>
    
    
  </div>

  <p>
    We can add more objects by adding more background images.
  </p>


<div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>element</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>width</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>height</span><span>:</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>30%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>20%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155a6</span> <span>10%</span><span>,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
  <span>background-position</span><span>:</span>
    <span>-110px</span> <span>-20px</span><span>,</span>
    <span>-20px</span> <span>-75px</span><span>,</span>
    <span>20px</span> <span>40px</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

    
    
  </div>


<p>
  This element can be used to make a seamless
  pattern by tiling.

  The only problem is that the element itself cannot be tiled as easily as background images.
  We need to create many identical elements and place them in the grid.

  Although taking a screenshot of the element and saving it in PNG format is a quick solution.
</p>

<h2>Using css-doodle</h2>

<p>
  One of the exciting features <a href="https://css-doodle.com/">css-doodle</a> provides is the ability to generate background
  image from another css-doodle element with the <code>@doodle</code> function.
  If we create the pattern fragment in css-doodle, it can be used for background image.
  Which means the pattern fragment can be tiled.
</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>/* container size */</span>
<span>@grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>100%</span> <span>180px</span><span>;</span>

<span>/* pattern dimension */</span>
<span>background-size</span><span>:</span> <span>180</span><span>px</span> <span>180</span><span>px</span><span>;</span>

<span>/* pattern fragment */</span>
<span>background-image</span><span>:</span> <span>@doodle</span><span>(</span>
  <span>@</span><span>grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>100%</span><span>;</span>
  <span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155</span><span>a6</span> <span>30</span><span>%,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155</span><span>a6</span> <span>20</span><span>%,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>),</span>
    <span>radial-gradient</span><span>(</span><span>#6155</span><span>a6</span> <span>5</span><span>%,</span> <span>transparent</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>

          radial-gradient(#6155a6 30%, transparent 0),
          radial-gradient(#6155a6 20%, transparent 0),
          radial-gradient(#6155a6 5%, transparent 0);
        background-position:
          -110px -20px,
          -20px -75px,
          20px 40px;
      );
    </css-doodle>
  </p>

  <p>
    Using gradients to create shapes is rather limited.
    Fortunately, the <code>@doodle</code> function can be nested.
    For example, we can replace one of the circle objects created from <code>radial-gradient</code> with
    another css-doodle element, inside which is a heart shape with rotation by <code>30</code> degree.

  <h2>Do it again</h2>

  <p>
    I know it's a bit confusing at first. So let's take another example from this <a href="https://codepen.io/yuanchuan/pen/xxEXwZw">demo</a> on CodePen,
    and recreate the <i>pattern #11</i> step by step.
  </p>

  <p>
    We still start from the pattern fragment,
    add its background color, setup its width and height both to <code>200px</code>.
    Note again that putting the objects inside background image is an important step. So here's the skeleton.
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>@grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>200px</span><span>;</span>

<span>background-color</span><span>:</span> <span>#005874</span><span>;</span>
<span>background-image</span><span>:</span>
  <span>/* objects */</span><span>;</span>
<span>background-position</span><span>:</span>
  <span>/* positions */</span><span>;</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 200px;
      background: #005874;
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <h3>Add objects</h3>

  <p>
    We're going to create a new shape for the elements in this pattern.
    The <code>@shape()</code> function returns a generated string of <code>polygon()</code> used by <code>clip-path</code>.
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>clip-path</span><span>:</span> <span>@shape</span><span>(</span>
  <span>split</span><span>:</span> <span>50</span><span>;</span>
  <span>scale</span><span>:</span> <span>.</span><span>3</span><span>;</span>
  <span>x</span><span>:</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>cos</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
  <span>y</span><span>:</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>2</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>+</span> <span>sin</span><span>(</span><span>t</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>2</span><span>;</span>
<span>);</span></code></pre></figure>
    <css-doodle>
      @grid: 1 / 200px 150px;
      :after {
        content: '';
        @size: 100px;
        background: #ffbe00;
        margin-left: -20px;
        clip-path: @shape(
          split: 50;
          scale: .3;
          x: cos(t) + cos(2t) * 2;
          y: sin(2t) + sin(t) * 2;
        );
      }
    </css-doodle>
  </div>

  <p>
    Place the shape to the <code>background-image</code> with <code>@doodle</code> function.
    It's the first object we added to the pattern.
  </p>

  <div>
<figure><pre><code data-lang="css"><span>@grid</span><span>:</span> <span>1</span> <span>/</span> <span>200px</span><span>;</span>

        );
        background-position: 0 0;
      </css-doodle>
    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    Once we have a good understanding of how this works, add more objects and place each of them with <code>background-position</code>.
    Setting random background colors and transfomations will make them look better.

<h2>How to use it in production</h2>

<p>
  I'd suggest to to create pattern fragments with design tools like PS and AI,
  but it's still interesting to create something directly from the code.
  So here are two ways to apply it to your websites:

</header>
<p>
This post will help you decide between a <b>Radio&nbsp;Button&nbsp;Group</b>
or a <b>Dropdown</b> when drafting user interfaces.
</p>
<p>
In summary, prefer <b>Radio&nbsp;Buttons</b>:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
it can save clicks,
</li>
<li>
showing all the options mitigates wrong assumptions.
</li>
</ul>
<section>
<h2>When dropdowns are OK?</h2>
<p>
…when its hidden options are guessable. To elaborate,
let's analyze the "General" settings of macOS®.
</p>
<p><img width="530" src="https://blog.uidrafter.com/media/9m0UTaXljoO06kewv6P29KHt9Cc.png" alt="macOS General Settings Panel">
</p>
<h3>Appearance <span>radio</span></h3>
<p><img width="320" src="https://blog.uidrafter.com/media/rXqO8B6t7aS2ZfPkN5x4DoaAy0o.png" alt="macOS General Settings Panel - Appearance radio buttons">
</p>
<p>
This element has an "Auto" option. Although it makes sense,
it's not guessable. Therefore, a radio is better suited
regardless of being more versatile in graphic terms.
</p>
<h3>Highlight color <span>dropdown</span></h3>
<p><img width="320" src="https://blog.uidrafter.com/media/UXaSeZTPLLORQzndHBRoCR-Wgjk.png" alt="macOS General Settings Panel - Highlight Color dropdown">
</p>
<p>
This and the previous element are for selecting a color. Probably, this
one isn't a radio to avoid confusing it as a continuation. A clue for
that, it has named colors, which are for adding importance. For instance,
for cases where it's difficult to reverse, like a <i>phone's color</i>.
</p>
<p>
By the way, in UI Drafter, having radio color pickers in different
shapes helps. Initially, all of them were rectangles and users
tried to change the Card color using the Entry color picker.
</p>
<p><img width="530" src="https://blog.uidrafter.com/media/BJd87vVUmAn_PNHPeKAHNTqCcLU.png" alt="UI Drafter Color Picker Shapes">
</p>
<h3>Recent items <span>dropdown</span></h3>
<p><img width="360" src="https://blog.uidrafter.com/media/NDRKSnDF5iWo8N3IuTZby4W1c4Y.png" alt="macOS General Settings Panel - Recent items dropdown">
</p>
<p>
As this is a numeric list, a discrete numeric slider would work too.
But it works as a dropdown because the hidden options are guessable.
</p>
<p>
This dropdown has a secondary label: <i>Documents, Apps, and Servers</i>.
If you want to avoid cases like that, split them. For example, one
for <b>Recent documents</b> and another for <b>Recent apps</b>.
</p>
<p>
Also, you may think it should be labeled <b>Maximum number of recent
items</b>. But the goal is to label things unambiguously enough.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Dropdown without default</h2>
<p><i>
This tip is for data entry flows. For example, creating an item or
ordering a product. It doesn't apply to a settings panel like above.
</i></p>
<p>
<span>A dropdown without preselection is safer.</span>
A default option with a vague label might confuse users into thinking that
that's what they have in mind. Also, it has more chance of not being read.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, a default selection can be safe if the user expects
the option, which implies that the hidden ones aren't needed to
disambiguate the default one. For example, the <i>size of a shirt</i>.
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Drafting Selectors</h2>
<p>
In UI Drafter, creating Radio Buttons or Dropdowns start in the same way,
in both cases use the <i>Selector</i> template, as explained in this <a rel="noopener" href="https://docs.uidrafter.com/selectors">video tutorial.</a>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The strangest hobby I’ve ever had is collecting credit cards. This was back about six years ago, when I loved “gaming” the system. How would I maximize my cashback, points and benefits without paying a single cent? </p>



<p>I mastered the credit card market and all its technicalities: the best cards for discounts and premium airport lounges, hacks to avoid paying fees, and I even paid off my <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/how-i-paid-off-my-58k-education-loan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">student loan</a> using credit cards.</p>



<p>Additionally, the coolest thing about <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/optimize-your-credit-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credit cards</a> like Visa Infinites and World Mastercards is they portray status — you’ve gotta reach a certain level of income to have ’em.</p>



<p>It was an insecure guy’s wet dream, and I was hooked.</p>



<p>While I started aiming for money and status, thankfully those haven’t been the only things I’ve been maximizing for. (I can imagine that would make me pretty obnoxious.) Instead, I figured out pretty early money isn’t a good measure for a great life. Money is more like a pre-requisite: necessary, but once you have <a href="https://www.sloww.co/how-much-money-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enough</a> — more isn’t gonna make a big difference.</p>



<p>So I started maximizing for other things. In fact, if there’s one big theme that connects everything in my blog, it’s this: getting the most out of life — whether it’s in the areas of money, career or relationships.</p>



<div><p>Thus far, it’s served me well. But in recent times, I’ve started to wonder if maximizing is really that great. For someone who’s spent years trying to extract maximum value from their life, is there a better way?</p></div>



<h2>Maximizers vs Satisficers</h2>



<p>In his popular book “<a href="https://www.bookdepository.com/Paradox-Choice-Barry-Schwartz/9780062449924?ref=grid-view&amp;qid=1601188274112&amp;sr=1-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Paradox of Choice</a>,” the psychologist Dr. Barry Schwartz broadly describes two kinds of people: maximizers (like me) and satisficers.</p>



<p>The stereotypical maximizer is someone who spends tons of time evaluating options before they make a <em>best</em> decision: like your geeky friend who draws up cost-benefit <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/downside-everything/" target="_blank">analysis</a> spreadsheets for months before buying a new phone (which annoyingly tends to be the phone you recommended him in the first place).</p>



<p>Satisficers on the other hand, tend to settle for the first thing that meets their requirements: like your elderly aunt who’s thrilled with her 2019 Xiaomi.</p>



<p>I imagine most people who’re good at personal finance or pros in fields like accounting and law are maximizers. There are proven benefits to maximizing: maximizers make better decisions. They also make more money.</p>



<p>But guess who’s happier?</p>



<p>Right, research shows satisficers tend to be <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/intl/blog/science-choice/201506/satisficing-vs-maximizing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">happier</a>.</p>



<p>This isn’t to say one is better than the other. Don’t worry whether you’re a maximizer or a satisficer — I don’t think people can easily switch. Just understand there’s things to learn from the other side.</p>



<div><p>As for the maximizer in me, I’ve grown to become more easily satisfied. This is what I’ve learned along the way.</p></div>



<h2>Struggling Between Growth and Satisfaction</h2>



<p>Something I’ve written about extensively is how I’ve always felt I was an <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/journey-finding-satisfaction-life/" target="_blank">underdog</a>. Like I constantly needed to prove my worth. When I was a teenager, I was obsessed with becoming an all-rounder. </p>



<p>I was pretty good at exams, but wanted to prove I could do other stuff. Hence trying to be good at sports and being popular with the girls. No, I didn’t want to be a geek. I wanted to be a jock; but a smart one. I wanted to be amazing in every area. To win. And thus, my lifelong obsession with self-improvement.</p>



<p>I don’t know if feeling <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/how-overcome-jealousy-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">insecure</a> pushed me towards becoming a maximizer. Or if maximizers tend to feel insecure (are they secretly compensating for something?). What I do know is there’s a spectrum between satisfaction and growth. And there’s an art to balancing both.</p>



<p>I say art because you don’t wanna fall into any of the extremes. Constantly keeping score and trying to win is exhausting because even if you’re #1, you lose sometimes. Besides, everyone eventually gets old. On the other hand you don’t want to be easily satisfied with everything — that just ensures you get complacent; eventually extinct. </p>



<p>Surely there’s a sweet spot. </p>



<div><p>I like to call that sweet spot “good enough.”</p></div>



<h2>What If 90% Is All You Need?</h2>



<p>We’ve been very philosophical so far, so it’s time for examples. I was reminded of what’s “good enough” in personal finance, by Morgan Housel on Twitter recently:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>– Live below your means. </p><p>– Invest, diversified, with a 10+ year horizon. </p><p>– Expect and accept volatility. </p><p>That's 90% of finance. </p><p>90%.</p></div>— Morgan Housel (@morganhousel) <a href="https://twitter.com/morganhousel/status/1285324455699337217?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Sure, personal finance is a lot more complex than three sentences. But if a young person today ignored everything else and just followed that advice for the rest of their life, would they do okay? </p>



<p>I think so. I think the 90% is good enough for most people. Heck, the 90% will probably make you do <em>better</em> than most people.</p>



<div><p>What are some other examples of the “Good Enough” principle?</p></div>



<h3>“Good Enough” Examples</h3>



<ul><li><strong>Health:</strong> Eat a balanced diet to keep your weight in the healthy range. Exercise 3x a week. Get &gt;7 hours of sleep every night.</li><li><strong>Investing:</strong> Buy low-cost, passive index funds or ETFs. <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/how-invest-own-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Invest</a> for retirement, decades away. Don’t interrupt the compounding effect of your retirement fund (e.g. EPF) by making early withdrawals.</li><li><strong>Career:</strong> Work with good people who you respect. Never stop learning, whether it’s technical or soft skills. Be reliable and over-communicate, so your bosses and colleagues understand your work.</li><li><strong>Relationships:</strong> Treat people with respect and empathy. Set healthy boundaries, especially with negative people. When you have issues, discuss them honestly.</li><li><strong>Writing:</strong> Use the simplest words you can without losing your message. Make your point quickly and get out of the way. Edit ruthlessly — good <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/lessons-5-years-writing-how-start-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writing</a> is a bad first draft polished many times.</li></ul>



<p>BTW this isn’t about life hacks. Fuck hacks. This is about fundamentals. Hacks are short-term easy things, whereas fundamentals are the (usually) harder, boring principles which will bring you long-term success.</p>



<p>How much pain would we save if we could just lean back, accept good enough for most things, and trust everything will work out in the long term?</p>



<p>I say good enough for most things. Because then, you’ll still have the time and energy to focus on a <em>few</em> things that <em>really</em> matter. In a funny way, the concept of good enough can fit in with maximalization. I like to call it Aaron’s Law of Life Optimization:</p>



<blockquote><div><p>Focus your life on just a few critical things. For everything else, just get to good enough.</p></div></blockquote>



<h2>Applying “Good Enough” to My Own Life</h2>



<p>What is it that you really want in life?</p>



<p>When I was in my twenties, I wanted to have everything: money, power, career and fame. But today, my life is very different from the dream state I once imagined.</p>



<p>It’s practical. I work hard at my day job as a salaried employee, not a rich Internet solopreneur with 100,000 USD passive income. I occasionally have heated discussions with my wife over trivial matters, instead of baller living with four girlfriends who call me Master. In my middle-class condo parking lot, I have an old <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/cheap-second-hand-car/" target="_blank">second-hand MyVi</a> instead of the Ferrari I once dreamed about. </p>



<p>Maybe the insecure younger me would have looked at my life today and laughed: “Is this all there is to life? When did you give up on your dreams to conquer the world and settle?”</p>



<p>And the older, wiser me would reply: “One day you’ll realize there are just a few <a href="https://www.mr-stingy.com/only-4-things-care-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">important things</a> in life, and everything else is secondary. As long as you have those covered, nothing else really matters.”</p>



<p>It would be tough for the younger me to understand. But I hope he would listen and think about it seriously. And no matter how many months or years it’d take him to explore and eventually realize these truths, I hope he’d come back to me someday and say: </p>



<div><p>“Actually, that sounds okay. It sounds good enough.”</p></div>

    <p>I made my own Raspberry Pi-powered AI to accompany me on piano.</p>
    <p>I was inspired by <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/07/24/538677517/fascinating-algorithm-dan-tepfers-player-piano-is-his-composing-partner">Dan Tepfer’s piano worlds</a> to explore my own universe of augmented piano playing. Could I write a program that learns <em>in realtime</em> to improvise with my style in the music breaks between my own playing? 🤖🎹</p>
<p>This is pretty much a play-by-play on making <em>PianoAI</em> in 8 days. If you just want to try out <em>PianoAI</em>, <a href="https://github.com/schollz/PIanoAI">go to the Github for instructions and downloading</a>. Otherwise, stay here to read about my many programming follies.</p>

<p>After watching <a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/07/24/538677517/fascinating-algorithm-dan-tepfers-player-piano-is-his-composing-partner">Dan Tepfers’s video on NPR</a>, I did some freeze frames of his computer and found out he uses the <a href="https://processing.org/tutorials/">Processing software</a> to connect up to his (very fancy) MIDI keyboard. I pretty easily managed to get together <a href="https://gist.github.com/schollz/f8ec8687e7de784aee6831fb2ca24078">something very similar</a> with my own (not fancy) MIDI keyboard.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.npr.org/2017/07/24/538677517/fascinating-algorithm-dan-tepfers-player-piano-is-his-composing-partner"><img src="https://rpiai.com/img/freeze-frame-1.PNG" alt="Freeze frame of Dan Tepfer showing his software for making automated music"></a></p>
<p>As explained in the video, Dan’s augmented piano playing basically allows you to mirror or echo certain notes in specified patterns. A lot of his patterns seem to be song dependent. After thinking, I decided I was interested in something a little different. I wanted to a piano accompaniment that learns <em>in realtime</em> to emulate my style and improvise in the spaces between my own playing, on any song.</p>
<p>I’m not the first to make a Piano AI. Google made the <a href="https://github.com/googlecreativelab/aiexperiments-ai-duet">A.I. Duet</a> which is a great program. But I wanted to see if I could make an A.I. specifically tuned to my own style.</p>

<p>My equipment is nothing special. I bought it used from some guy who decided he had to give up trying to learn how to play piano 😢. Pretty much any MIDI keyboard and MIDI adapter will do.</p>
<p>I generally need to do everything at least twice in order to get it right. Also I need to draw everything out clearly in order to actually understand what I’m doing. My process for writing programs then is basically as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Draw it out on paper.</li>
<li>Program it in Python.</li>
<li>Start over.</li>
<li>Draw it out on paper, <em>again</em>.</li>
<li>Program it in Go.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="https://rpiai.com/img/1504528218929-27b7f7a4-1482-479b-a884-fc21d6c38301.jpg" alt="First two pages of 12 for figuring out what I’m doing"></p>
<p>Each time I draw out my idea on paper, it takes about three pieces of paper before my idea actually starts to take form and possibly work.</p>
<h2 id="programming-a-piano-ai-in-python">Programming a Piano AI in Python</h2>
<p>Once I had an idea of what I was doing, I implemented everything in <a href="https://github.com/schollz/pyplayerpiano">a set of Python scripts</a>. These scripts are built on <a href="https://www.pygame.org/wiki/about">pygame</a> which has great support for MIDI. The idea is fairly simple - there are two threads: a metronome and a listener. The listener just records notes played by the host. The metronome ticks along and plays any notes in the queue, or asks the AI to send some new notes if none are in the queue.</p>
<p>I made it somewhat pluggable, as you can do variations on the AI so it can be easily outfitted with different piano augmentations. There is an algorithm for simply echoing, one for playing notes within the chord structure (after it determines the chords), and one for generating piano runs from a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain">Markov chain</a>. Here’s a movie of me playing with the latter version of this algorithm (when my right hand moves <em>away</em> from the keyboard, the AI begins to play until I play again):</p>

<figcaption>My first piano-playing AI</figcaption>
<p>There were a couple of things I didn’t like about this. First, its not very good. At best, the piano AI accompaniment sounds like a small child trying hard to emulate my own playing (I think there are a couple of reasons for this - basically not taking into account velocity data and transition times). Secondly, these python scripts did not work on a Raspberry Pi (the video was shot with me using Windows)! I don’t know why. I had trouble on Python3.4, so I upgraded to 3.6. With Python3.6, I still had weird problems. <code>pygame.fastevent.post</code> worked but <code>pygame.fastevent.get</code> did not. I threw up my hands at this and found an alternative.</p>
<p>The alternative is to write this in Go. <a href="https://benchmarksgame.alioth.debian.org/u64q/compare.php?lang=go&amp;lang2=python3">Go is notably faster than Python</a> - which is quite useful since this is a low-latency application. My ears discern discrepancies of &gt; 20 milliseconds, so I want to keep processing times down to a minimum. I found <a href="https://github.com/rakyll/portmidi">a Go midi library</a> so porting was very viable.</p>
<h2 id="programming-a-piano-ai-in-go">Programming a Piano AI in Go</h2>
<p><img src="https://rpiai.com/img/gopher-1.svg" alt="Playing piano with Go"></p>
<p>I decided to simplify a little bit, and instead of making many modules with different algorithms, I would focus on the one I’m most interested: <em>a program that learns in realtime to improvise in the spaces between my own playing.</em> I took out some more sheets of paper and began.</p>
<h3 id="day-1">Day 1</h3>
<p>Most of the code is about the same with my previous Python scripts. When writing in Go, I found that spawning threads is so much easier than in Python. Threads are all over this program. There are threads for listening to midi, threads for playing notes, threads for keeping track of notes. I was tempted to use the brand new <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/sync/#Map">Go 1.9 sync.Map</a> in my threads, but realized I could leverage maps of maps which is beyond the <code>sync.Map</code> complexity. Still, I just made a map of maps that is very similar to another sync map store that I wrote (<a href="https://github.com/schollz/jsonstore">schollz/jsonstore</a>).</p>
<p>I attempted to make everything classy (pun-intended) so I implemented components (midi, music, ai) as their own objects with their own functions. So far, the midi listening works great, and seems to responds very fast. I also implemented play back functions and they work too - this is pretty easy.</p>
<h3 id="day-2">Day 2</h3>
<p>Started by refactoring all the code into folders because I’d like to reserve the <code>New</code> function for each of the objects. The objects have solidified - there is a AI for learning / generating licks, a Music object for the piano note models, a Piano object for communicating with midi, and a Player object for pulling everything together.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time with pen and paper figuring out how the AI should work. I realized that there is more than one way to make a Markov chain out of Piano notes. Piano notes have four basic properties: <em>pitch</em>, <em>velocity</em>, <em>duration</em>, and <em>lag</em> (time to next note). The basic Markov chain for piano notes would be four different Markov chains, one for each of the properties. It would be illustrated as such:</p>
<p><img alt="Basic Markov chain properties" src="https://rpiai.com/img/download.png" width="200px;">
</p>
<p>Here the next pitch for the next note (P2) is determined from the pitch of the previous note (P1). Similar for Velocity (V1/V2), Duration (D1/D2) and Lag (L1/L2). The actual Markov chain simply enumerates the relative frequencies of occurrence of the value of each property and uses a random selector to pick one.</p>
<p>However, the piano properties are not necessarily independent: sometimes there is a relationship between the pitch and velocity, or the velocity and the duration of a note. To account for this I’ve allowed for different couplings. You can couple properties to the current or the last value of any other property. Currently I’m only allowing two couplings, because that’s complicated enough. But in theory, you could couple the value of the next pitch to the previous pitch and velocity and duration and lag!</p>
<p>Once I had everything figured out, theoretically, I began to implement the AI. The AI is simply a Markov chain, so it determines a table of relative frequencies of note properties and has a function for computing them from the cumulative probabilities and a random number. At the end of the night, it works! Well, kinda but not really. Here’s a silly video of me playing a lick to it and getting some AI piano runs:</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kv-tnh8ulFQ?rel=0?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
<figcaption>Example of the basic Markov chain for accompaniment</figcaption>
<p>Seems like there is more improvement to be made tomorrow!</p>
<h3 id="day-3">Day 3</h3>
<p>There is no improvement to be made that I can find.</p>
<p>But maybe the coupling I tried yesterday is not very good. The coupling I’m most interested can be visualized as:</p>
<p><img alt="Basic Markov chain properties, with coupling" src="https://rpiai.com/img/download--2-.png" width="100px;">
</p>
<p>In this coupling, the previous pitch determines the next pitch. The next velocity is determined by the previous velocity <em>and</em> the current pitch. The current pitch also determines the duration. And the current duration determines the current lag. This needs to be evaluated in the correct order (pitch, duration, velocity, lag) and that’s left up to to user cause I don’t want to program in tree traversals.</p>
<p>Well, I tried this and it sounds pretty bad. I’m massively disappointed in the results. I think I need to try a different machine learning. I’m going to make my repo public now, maybe someone will find it and take over for me because I’m not sure I will continue on it.</p>
<h3 id="day-4">Day 4</h3>
<p>I’ve been thinking, and I’m going to try a neural net. (commit <a href="https://github.com/schollz/PIanoAI/tree/b5931ff6467569b706946e7a932ab596f0af2a93">b5931ff6</a>).</p>
<p>I just tried a neural net. It went badly, to say the least. I tried several variations too. I tried feeding in the notes as pairs, either each property individually or all the properties as a vector. This didn’t sound good - the timings were way off and the notes were all over the place.</p>
<p>I also tried a neural net where I send the layout of the whole keyboard (commit <a href="https://github.com/schollz/PIanoAI/tree/20948dfbb974793b2bdfe977e684e68fa9d33449">20948dfb</a>) and then the keyboard layout that it should transition into. It sounds complicated because I think it is and it didn’t seem to work either.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I noticed with the neural net is that it is hard to get some randomness. I tried introducing a random column as a random vector but it just creates too many spurious notes. Once the AI piano lick begins, it seems to just get stuck in a local minimum and doesn’t explore much anymore. I think in order to make the neural net work, I’d have to do what Google does and try to Deep learn what “melody” is and what a “chord” is and what a “piano” is. Ugh.</p>
<h3 id="day-5">Day 5</h3>
<p>I give up.</p>
<p>I did give up. But then, I couldn’t help but rethink the entire project while running in the forest.</p>
<p><img src="https://rpiai.com/img/forest-1.jpg" alt="Sometimes you just have to look at some trees."></p>
<p>What is an AI really? Is it just supposed to play with my level of intelligence? What is my level of intelligence when I play? When I think about my own intelligence, I realize: <em>I’m not very intelligent</em>!</p>
<p>Yes, I’m a simple piano player. I just play notes in scales that belong to the chords. I have some little riffs that I mix in when I feel like it. Actually, the more I think about it I realize that my piano improvisation is like linking up little riffs that I reuse or copy or splice over and over. So the Piano AI should do just that!</p>
<p><img src="https://rpiai.com/img/test.jpg" alt="Another, smaller, piece of paper for thinking."></p>
<p>I wrote down the idea on the requisite piece of paper and went home to program it. Basically this version of the AI was a Markovian scheme again but greater than first order (i.e. …</p></div></div>

<blockquote><p>You know how to explain things to an audience whose background is like your own. But how do you get the message across when the subject matter is bound to go over the listeners’ heads? Analogies. Lots of analogies.</p></blockquote>
<p>If you are in a technical field such as software development, the scenario is inevitable. At some point, you need to explain an aspect of your work to someone who has no clue what you’re talking about.</p>
<p>Maybe you have to explain to the CFO why your project needs more funding to take advantage of a breakthrough, what was behind a big software failure, or why your development team needs an expensive tool. You may be asked to explain to a non-technical customer how your software works. Or perhaps the CEO asks you to give a “lunch and learn” to bring the manufacturing department up to date on an upcoming industry technology that may impact the company (5G networking, artificial intelligence, quantum computing).</p>
<p>Regardless of the reason, you have to explain very technical details to someone who doesn’t understand the subject – but it’s crucial that they pay attention. So now what?</p>
<p>This article offers tips about how to reach an audience – whether it’s a solo CEO or a board room full of corporate execs – who might space out before you reach the third slide. Yet, you need people to stay awake until the end, and to respond, “Yes, that’s a good idea! Let’s do that!”</p>
<p>I assume that you know <a href="https://hbr.org/2020/01/what-it-takes-to-give-a-great-presentation">the basics of organizing and delivering a presentation</a>, such as limiting the number of PowerPoint slides, or practicing your delivery to stay within the time allotted. You’re already an expert at the topic at hand, or you wouldn’t be in the position to do the presentation. Plus, I assume, you are comfortable with people who share at least some domain knowledge with you, such as other software developers or scientists. You just don’t know how to reach <em>these </em>people.</p>
<h3>How technical do you need to be? Are you sure about that?</h3>
<p>Start by contemplating what the audience <em>does</em> know; how much they need to understand to meet your objective (say, to allocate the budget you’re requesting); and what level of information you need to impart in order to achieve that goal.</p>
<p>You may not need to be as technical as you think you do. If your goal is to acquire funding, the audience may be far more interested in business benefits (“We’ll save a pile of money!”) than in the techie details that excite you (“a million CPU cycles per second!”). Make sure that you’re really serving your audience, not your own enthusiasm for the topic.</p>
<p>“Executives don’t really care about the bits and bytes. They want to know why they should care,” says Alissa Knight, previously a security analyst specializing in financial sector security. Knight used to fly around the world, explaining to chief security officers how she and her team could penetrate a bank’s security. “What they like to see is the impact to the business.”</p>
<p>“Pay attention to the difference between benefits and features,” agrees Harwell Thrasher, author of <a href="https://amzn.to/2RmuooW">Boiling the IT Frog</a>. “Tech people fall in love with features but the actual benefits of the technology are what’s important.”</p>
<p>“Avoid getting too much into the <em>how</em>,” Knight adds. “Leave the <em>how</em> out. They care about the <em>what</em>.”</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the audience doesn’t have to become an expert on the topic. They don’t need to know everything you know; they hired <em>you </em>for that knowledge. Instead, the listeners want to understand the caveats and limitations of the things you’re talking about, the contexts under which it works, where it’s an awkward fit, and what to expect based on interactions with other systems.</p>
<p>That said, sometimes you need to get downright geeky. You can stress the high-level benefits of a medical breakthrough (such as “fewer people will die”), but if your research team found <a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2020-01/qmuo-rin010920.php">a new route for tackling drug resistance in skin cancer cells</a>, at some point you have to describe what a cytoskeleton is.</p>
<h3>You can’t have too many analogies or examples</h3>
<p>“I’ve been asked to present to the board of directors for some very large companies,” says Knight. Yet the C-level executives who listened to her presentations don’t know what a buffer overflow is.</p>
<p>The solution? Use analogies. Tell stories. Explain the concept using items familiar to the audience. Use diagrams.</p>
<p>Let’s say that your technical explanation relies on computer networks, data transfer rates, and cables. Comparing network traffic to literal road traffic can help them visualize differences in speeds and advancements in technology.</p>
<p>“My favorite analogy is that a network is very porous,” Knight says, “It’s like a river, I explain, and there are all sorts of inlets to a river.” Then the audience can relate the analogy to something they know. “That’s how a network is and how an adversary gets in,” Knight would tell her non-technical audience.</p>
<h3>Omit needless buzzwords</h3>
<p>Minimize the jargon. Too many techies assume that everyone speaks the same language that they do, but their language is as specialized and esoteric as is a doctor’s or accountant’s. If you explain what a <em>whatzit</em> and <em>gizmo</em> are, and what they do, and why they need to be connected up, most people can follow along.</p>
<p>Of course, sometimes you’re presenting to a person where some level of technology knowledge is assumed. You can use some jargon, but use less than what you assume the audience knows. Pay close attention to the audience’s response; you don’t want to appear condescending.</p>
<p>When you decide to include technical terms, explain what each term means the first time you use it. If it’s usually spoken as an acronym, introduce both the term and its shortcut (“To communicate with the other system, we use an application programmer interface – it’s called an API”) so that the listeners don’t get lost trying to keep track.</p>
<blockquote><p>Are you talking about software quality topics? It might be a good idea to come up to speed on the technical terms. Start with a review of <a href="https://www.functionize.com/blog/a-glossary-of-testing-terms/">our QA glossary</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>Instead, show relationships. Show charts and graphs, particularly when they demonstrate relationships between concepts.</p>
<p>Fred Bartlett, a senior analyst at Penguin Random House, makes sure that his graphs look familiar to the people viewing them – which for his organization means a trend line. “We use different colors, and plot on different axes,” he explains. “You have to show what will come out most clearly to someone looking at it for the first time.”</p>
<h3>Did they understand you?</h3>
<p>Find out if you’re reaching them. Don’t just talk. Ask questions, to find out if you already lost them in the dust… and to give yourself an opportunity to retrieve them from the dust.</p>
<p>When you plan your presentation, include time for questions. If what you’re asking for is important and new, there are sure to be questions. Depending on the subject, it may be wise to solicit questions after each section, rather than wait until the end of the presentation.</p>
<p>Recognize that the audience may be embarrassed about its ignorance, particularly if they are accomplished people who don’t want to look dumb in front of professional colleagues. “Pass out note cards that people can write questions on,” advises telco and antitrust attorney Paul Overbite. Even if they’re embarrassed, he says, “They’ll write down their questions as an anonymous note.”</p>
<h3>Don’t forget the takeaway</h3>
<p>There’s a reason you’re making this presentation. Make sure it’s clear to the audience what that reason is, and explicitly state the one thing you want them to understand by the end.</p>
<p>Be clear about what you want. Even if you don’t succeed in enlightening the audience about the technology, you might convey your dedication and passion enough to sell them on giving you your heart’s desire. The listener may not end up understanding network topology, but she may conclude that <em>you</em> know – and that your opinion can be trusted.</p>
<p>What facts do you need to tell the story that’s contained in your presentation? If this is a request for additional funding, then you need to describe what you’re accomplished, what you need to do next, how much it will cost to do that, and a timeline.</p>
<p>For example, when Bartlett needed to upgrade some business systems, he ignored any presentation of the underlying algorithm. “We just focused on the solution. We showed a graph, and then another graph on what would happen if we implemented to the solution. Then we had to discuss what it would take and how many people it would take. Because we had the graphs, it was easy to get past it.”</p>
<p>However hard you work to make the technical information easy to digest, acknowledge that the audience might need to study it later, on their own, in order to grasp the message. Handouts and follow-up email messages can help, particularly if they stress the takeaway.</p>
<p>“I email the link of the things I’ve talked about,” says Rob Pegoraro, a business writer for USA Today and Fast Company who does frequent presentations. “I use the main points on a slide and then do handouts.” Give the audience an opportunity to look up the information afterwards, so give them links. “Emailing the presentation is also good,” he adds.</p>
<p>So really, a winning presentation has two goals. The first is to keep your audience engaged enough to listen. The second goal is to provide them the information they need, in a way that makes sense to them, so that they can make the decision you hope they will make. It’s not rocket science, but it does require knowing to whom you’re presenting, and knowing their viewpoint well enough to explain your point in a way they understand.</p>

<p><em>Rapid climbs to stardom are normally reserved for pop stars and, on rare occasions, for politicians. But it is virtually unheard of for scientists. On Nov. 9, 2020, though, Özlem Türeci and Uğur Şahin were catapulted onto the world stage essentially overnight. That's the day, BioNTech, the medical research company the couple founded, reported the first global breakthrough in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic: The company's vaccine candidate BNT162b2, developed in Mainz, Germany, demonstrated more than 90 percent efficacy in clinical studies. Almost every test subject who received the vaccine was protected from contracting COVID-19.</em></p>


<p><em>It was a sensation. And a glimmer of hope. In 2021, fully 1.3 billion doses of the vaccine are to be administered worldwide, making an end to the pandemic more than just a distant hope. Şahin and Türeci have been the focus of global attention since then, with press outlets around the world showing a soft spot for the German couple with Turkish roots. She, a chief physician; he, the CEO of BioNTech – married for the last 18 years. Thus far, Şahin has taken the lead in conducting interviews, but this is the first, extensive joint interview given by the couple. It was conducted via Zoom from their Mainz apartment. The two seemed so relaxed that it was easy to forget all that was going on around them.</em></p>

<div>
<p><em>The BioNTech couple has been well known in the medical community for some time, particularly among cancer experts. They are both oncologists specialized in immunotherapy. Şahin, 55, was awarded the German Cancer Prize in 2019. Türeci, 53, is head of the research cluster of the German Ministry of Education, Science and Culture.</em></p><p><em>BioNTech is the second company the couple has founded, but they primarily see themselves as scientific researchers. They view entrepreneurship as a means to an end: Because "science doesn't always reach the hospital bed," as Türeci says – because research doesn't always produce concrete treatments, or does so only slowly. As such, the record speed with which their company developed the COVID-19 vaccine is a message: Look how fast we can move if we all join forces.</em></p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Ms. Türeci, Mr. Şahin, as we speak, millions of doses of the vaccine you developed are being shipped on planes and trucks to hospitals and vaccination centers around the world. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden was inoculated live on television with the BioNTech vaccine. Your research is currently the greatest hope for billions of people. Have you been able to find a minute to reflect on all of that?</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> If you are speaking literally about a single minute, then yes. The entire year was more or less unrelenting. But every now and then, we have had brief moments to reflect and absorb events, such as when colleagues sent us photos from the first vaccinations. To see people finally benefitting from our work is really moving.</p>
</div>

<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The vaccine achieved an efficacy of 95 percent in the clinical study. Most experts would have been happy with a result exceeding 70 percent. Were you confident from the beginning that your vaccine would be so potent?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> We were confident that the immunological reaction would be close to perfect. We started with 20 vaccine candidates, which we tested until only the best remained. It helped that we have over two decades of experience in immune engineering, triggering immune responses in the body. But we didn't know if the virus was at all susceptible to a vaccine.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> We could have found ourselves in a situation in which no vaccine could help?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> Yes, there are other viruses in this class against which it has not been possible to develop a vaccine. But we are able to produce an immune response to this coronavirus. That isn't just shown by the 95 percent efficacy, but also by the breadth and strength of the antibody and T-cell response. This multifaceted nature of the immunological response is vital when the virus mutates further. Think of it like this: The triggered immune response recognizes the so-called virus antigens at many different locations. Through a mutation, the virus can make some of these locations unrecognizable, but it can't change itself so fundamentally that it becomes invisible to the immune system.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> That means that you aren't worried about the much more contagious variant discovered in England?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> Not when it comes to the efficacy of the vaccine. Even if there are several mutations, the actual structure of the virus antigen is changed by less than 1 percent. We are performing tests to determine if our vaccine can also neutralize theses variations and will soon know more. What concerns me is that the mutation apparently arose in a patient with a suppressed immune system. The virus had complete freedom and months of time to optimize. That could mean that there will always be biotopes within which the virus can improve itself. We have to consider this problem in the medium term.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Would you be able to rapidly adapt your vaccine if the virus undergoes a significant mutation?</p>
</div>

<section data-area="contentbox">

</section>
<div>
<p><strong>Türeci:</strong> From a purely technological perspective, yes. We could simply replace the genetic information for the current virus antigen with the new, mutated version. Doing so would go quite quickly, it would take perhaps six weeks. The question is what the regulatory authorities would say. Would they accept that we fundamentally proved the efficacy and safety of our vaccine initially such that we could then use it against additional virus mutations?</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> And what if they don't?</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> Then we would have to undertake a new clinical study with tens of thousands of test subjects. But the authorities have significant experience with such adjustments, such as with the seasonal flu vaccine, for example, which is produced each year to neutralize new virus variations.</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> We have begun discussing the issue with the authorities.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Your study with 44,000 test subjects showed that the vaccine can prevent the development of COVID-19. But when will we know if it also prevents the transmission of the virus? That would stem the pandemic much more rapidly.</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> We will have relevant data by around the end of January – indirect data, at least. What we are able to investigate pretty well is the prevention of asymptomatic infections.</p>
</div>
<section>

</section>
<div>
<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> In other words, whether people are infectious even if they have no symptoms.</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> We can determine that indirectly via antibody tests. The data we have gathered thus far is encouraging, indicating that the vaccine can be effective here too.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Just as effective as it is against the outbreak of the illness?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> We'll see if it is 50, 60 or 70 percent. But you shouldn't forget that simply preventing an outbreak of the illness has an effect on the further development of the pandemic, because people who develop symptoms through an outbreak of the illness are contagious for longer.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> It also hasn't yet been determined for how long immunity lasts, whether after an infection or after receiving the vaccine. In a worst-case scenario, will we have to get vaccinated three times a year?</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> First of all, we expect the immunity from the vaccine to last at least as long as natural immunity triggered by an infection. And we know that we increase the body's immune response with the second dose. That means that an even greater effect could be achieved with a third injection, perhaps one year later. Ultimately, this is all hardcore science. The data will show us what must be done.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> Thus far, the vaccine has to be kept at a temperature of minus 70 degrees Celsius during storage and transportation. It became apparent from the very beginning of the vaccination campaign that this can create problems. Will it be possible to adjust the serum in the near future such that it can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures?</p><p><strong>Türeci:</strong> The situation will remain unchanged for the next three months, but then we will likely be able to improve the specifications for transportation and storage. Our refined vaccine generation, which will be stable at much higher temperatures, could be available by late summer.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The best vaccine isn't particularly helpful if it isn't available in sufficient quantities. How many doses will you be able to deliver to Europe in the first half of the year?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> The precise numbers aren't intended for publication. We ask for your understanding.</p>

<p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The U.S. appears to be much better supplied. According to President-elect Joe Biden, up to 100 million Americans are to be vaccinated by April.</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> The Americans didn't just buy our vaccine, but also those from other companies, like Moderna.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> The U.S. reserved 600 million doses from BioNTech way back in July. The EU only placed its order in November – and only for 300 million doses. You apparently offered more. Why didn't Brussels accept your offer?</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> Unfortunately, I am unable to give you any details from the contracts. But the process in Europe certainly didn't proceed as quickly and straightforwardly as with other countries. In part because the European Union isn't directly authorized, and member states also have a say. That can result in a loss of time in a negotiation situation where a strong message is needed.</p><p><strong>DER SPIEGEL:</strong> At the same time, Brussels made large purchases from other producers who are behind on development. The French company Sanofi, for example, whose vaccine will only be ready at the end of 2021 at the earliest.</p><p><strong>Şahin:</strong> There was an assumption that many other companies would produce vaccines.

          <p><strong>TL;DR</strong>: this is a rant.</p>
<p>I’ve been using Ruby since 2013 and for most of my study and career, Ruby was
may main, go-to programming language for almost everything.</p>
<p>Ruby’s syntax decisions make so much sense than most other languages. Although,
it’s often argued against making programming languages like natural languages,
Ruby programs flow like natural English.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>..</span><span>10</span><span>)</span><span>.</span><span>each</span> <span>do</span> <span>|</span><span>number</span><span>|</span>
  <span>print</span> <span>number</span> <span>*</span> <span>number</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Ruby is also very well suited to be a tool for teaching programming as well as
a very good pseudo-code language. I know Python has the lead in that role,
however; I do not think Python syntax would make much sense to beginners; it
would just raise so many unnecessary questions. Ruby on the other hand, does
not have that problem. It has other kinds of problems.</p>
<p>Although I have wanted to write about this for sometime, the main motivation
behind writing this post, finally, is the latest Ruby 3.0 release which was on
the 25th December, 2020. This release is considered the most important release
of Ruby so far and it’s been looked forward to for a long time. However, to me,
it is the most disappointing.</p>
<p>Well, my biggest pet peeve with Ruby is that it is bloated and is getting even
more bloated with every release by the addition of useless functions and
operators to match Rails' ActiveSupport utilities ¯\_( ͠° ͟ʖ ͠°)_/¯.</p>
<p>The straw that broke the camel’s back was when types were introduced in the 3.0
release. This feature is the one I personally was most looking forward to.
Adding static type analysis to the language is a great step to help find and
mitigate type related errors in Ruby programs.</p>
<p>However, unlike <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php" target="blank">PHP</a> and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html" target="blank">Python</a>
(Ruby’s most famous contenders) where types are built into the language
directly via type annotations, types in Ruby were added in the form of a new
language called <code>RBS</code>, meaning; one would have to maintain separate <code>.rbs</code>
files for type definitions. And now instead of writing the structure of a
program once, it has to be written twice!</p>
<p>Here’s a small example of how it looks like:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span># messenger.rb</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Messenger</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>(</span><span>medium</span><span>)</span>
    <span>@medium</span> <span>=</span> <span>medium</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>deliver</span><span>(</span><span>msg</span><span>)</span>
    <span>"You have a new message: "</span> <span>+</span> <span>msg</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>

<span># messenger.rbs</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Messenger</span>
  <span>@medium</span><span>:</span> <span>Symbol</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>initialize</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>Symbol</span> <span>medium</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>void</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>deliver</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>String</span> <span>msg</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>String</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Maintaining the same structure twice is not an easy task in large software
specially that static analysis is not enforced nor required by the language;
thus, making writing types an annoying afterthought. The issue is, I don’t see
why this is the chosen solution except that maybe to avoid rewriting Rails and
instead, add new files for type definitions.</p>
<p><a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25535455" target="blank">Some
have already voiced their opinions on this matter</a>, however; I find it weird
that the Ruby community is not talking about this.</p>
<p>I know that no language is perfect and that each language has its use cases,
however; I see that Ruby is tiptoeing around Rails; thus, it is cornered in the
Rails web development area.</p>
<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: here are parts of a comment I made replying to the backward
compatibility point and other points made:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>I see the backward compatibility point of view and it’s valid and actually an
easy solution now. But my concern is maintaining software on the long run and
having to keep track of two points of truth.
</p><p>

And the talk about using IDEs
doesn’t make sense to me. I don’t need to use a specific tool to use the
language.
</p><p>

I write C more than Ruby nowadays and I use header files but in this case, this
is the best we’ve got, otherwise let’s use Go or Rust or whatever newer xD.
</p><p>

My point in the end is that Ruby deserves better tooling and more sane
choices.</p></div>
</blockquote>
<p>I want to end this with a quote by /u/mashatg on Reddit:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It is not only about this particular decision but disconcerted development
and language’s direction in general. Incapability to learn from past mistakes
and get inspired from more successful.
</p><p>

It is so sad to watch how an original and elegant design with lot of
progressive ideas got butchered and ended up in current diffuse mess. It does
not look like an attitude to fight back declining relevance. It looks like
towel thrown into a ring and waiting referee to notice.</p></div>

<p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>In a cruel twist, 2020 left parting gifts: at least two new, seemingly more dangerous variants of Covid-19. B.1.1.7 was <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>first identified</span></a> in the UK in September and has recently accounted for more than half of new cases in the country. B.1.351 is the variant behind a <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/coronavirus-variant-in-south-africa-sparks-fear-of-faster-spread-possible-reinfection-11609358056"><span>new surge</span></a> in cases in South Africa. Both show signs of being significantly more transmissible than non-variant Covid-19, and B.1.1.7 has already been identified in <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/02/new-covid-strain-b-117-explained/4112125001/"><span>dozens of countries</span></a> around the world, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgz4z7/what-is-new-covid-strain-colorado-california"><span>including the U.S.</span></a> While scientists are relatively certain neither is more deadly, higher transmissibility could spell big trouble.</p>

<p>This week, The Factual looked at 24 articles from 21 sources to clarify just how potentially dangerous these new Covid variants are.</p>

<h4><strong>What We Think We Know</strong></h4>
<p>The importance of clarity and consistency in messaging was made clear early on in the pandemic, and many articles about these new variants seem to be forthright about the details of these new strains without engaging in fear-mongering or clickbait headlines. Here’s what we know reasonably well.</p>
<p><strong>Transmissibility: </strong>Both strains seem to demonstrate a greater level of transmissibility, meaning they spread easier from person to person. While the science is still being checked and triple-checked, the B.1.1.7 variant seems to be as much as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/23/health/coronavirus-uk-variant.html"><span>70% more transmissible</span></a> than the non-variant Covid-19. Less is known about B.1.351, but it seems<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/suzannerowankelleher/2020/12/24/heres-where-3-new-strains-of-covid-19-have-traveled-so-far/?sh=368ac3f75139"><span> at least as dangerous</span></a> as B.1.1.7.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p>This increased transmissibility is a result of the routine genetic mutation that viruses (and, indeed, all lifeforms) undergo during replication or reproduction. For both strains, mutations to the spike protein — the protein that allows the virus to attach to uninfected cells — seem to make the virus <a href="https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/coronavirus/a-new-strain-of-coronavirus-what-you-should-know"><span>better at infecting</span></a> human cells. Additionally, early evidence also seems to suggest that the new variants result in <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-strains-what-scientists-know-about-coronavirus-variants-11609466017"><span>higher viral loads</span></a>, meaning infected individuals are carrying more of the virus.&nbsp;</p></div>
<p><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/2C1MEGbbaNTm4tK1WK-uCnlCoE_IX2YId2Q_nDJPQBbdxLEkB9rIPuhZ9tkpb1SZuaJOfGTm7QT9NMtXULNV_9CNP53ghCgjWZyCOFzyH7ZXwcKqRhLjcmY0x4vtKqnfD3mI8sd9" width="624" height="560"></p>

<p><strong>Deadliness: </strong>A clear further risk with new mutations of a virus is that they could become more deadly for those who are infected. Thankfully, for these new Covid-19 variants the increase in transmissibility <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/need-to-know-coronavirus-variant"><span>does not appear</span></a> to be accompanied by an <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/14/how-a-new-covid-strain-may-have-spread-virus-in-south-of-england"><span>increase in the severity</span></a> of the disease.</p>
<p>However, the virus itself doesn’t need to cause more severe effects to still result in an <a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/need-to-know-coronavirus-variant"><span>increase in deaths</span></a>. For example, if the virus is much more transmissible, that can result in an exponential rise in cases and an inability to provide life-saving care to the cases that are severe. With hospitals around the U.S. already reaching maximum capacity, and non-Covid patients being <a href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2020-12-29/l-a-county-hospitals-at-the-breaking-point-turn-away-ambulances"><span>turned away</span></a>, an exponential increase in cases could very well lead to more Covid-related and non-Covid-related deaths.</p>
<p><strong>Mitigation: </strong>Scientists are very clear that the nature of the threat from the virus <a href="https://www.the-scientist.com/news-opinion/first-us-case-of-uk-sars-cov-2-variant-detected-68312"><span>has not fundamentally changed</span></a> in terms of how the virus spreads and what we can do to stop its spread. The virus is still a respiratory illness that spreads through the air and close contact with other people. This means that the mitigation strategies already in place still apply and, if anything, are more important than ever.</p>
<p>Countries are responding by enacting more stringent applications of measures that were largely already in place. In London and the southeastern UK, where B.1.1.7 really came to the fore, a <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>stringent lockdown</span></a> has been enacted to halt the spread of the virus, reversing a decision to loosen restrictions for the holidays. South Africa has enacted <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/africa/south-africa-coronavirus-surge/2020/12/28/b4c8e17a-492c-11eb-97b6-4eb9f72ff46b_story.html"><span>strong measures</span></a> as well, including banning public gatherings and the sale of alcohol and making mask wearing in public mandatory. Abroad, many countries have halted flights from the UK and South Africa, reflecting that the danger for contagion is just too great.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Testing: </strong>A plausible risk is that the virus might mutate in such a way that leads positive cases to avoid identification, thereby necessitating new tests. Luckily, the mutations that the virus underwent <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>did not interfere</span></a> with our ability to identify positive cases with current testing technology. Though, for example, the virus did modify the spike protein that current tests look for—also known as the S gene—tests <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/30/22206522/coronavirus-test-variant-contagious-uk-gene"><span>look for a number of signals</span></a>, not just one. Scientists are now working to estimate the prevalence of B.1.1.7&nbsp; based on the number of positive tests without the S gene, cases known as S-gene dropouts.&nbsp;</p>
<div><p><strong>Vaccines: </strong>Perhaps the biggest question on everyone’s minds is whether the stream of newly-approved vaccines will retain effecitveness against these new variants. While testing is still underway, there is <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/02/new-covid-strain-b-117-explained/4112125001/"><span>no evidence</span></a> to suggest that the vaccines will see any significant change in efficacy. Mutations are typically subtle and are unlikely to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-covid-19-strains-what-scientists-know-about-coronavirus-variants-11609466017"><span>drastically alter</span></a> the biology of the virus in a short period of time, and the vaccines are designed to attack the virus from <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/14/how-a-new-covid-strain-may-have-spread-virus-in-south-of-england"><span>several angles</span></a>, meaning that the “broad immune response…that targets several areas of the spike protein” will continue to work.&nbsp;</p></div>
<h4>The Big "Ifs"</h4>
<p>Much of what we know about the variants, beyond the likely increase in transmissibility, is none too alarming on the surface. However, there are some factors that we aren’t totally sure of just yet that could create big problems.</p>
<p><strong>Spread:</strong> These new variants show yet another way pandemic response has fallen short. Understanding the genetic variations in the virus requires routine genetic sequencing to identify new strains, but very few countries have been investing the resources to do so. While the UK invested early on to sequence cases to track the genetic variations, a CDC strain surveillance team in the U.S. was set up <a href="https://www.statnews.com/2020/12/31/with-limited-surveillance-of-covid-19-variant-its-deja-vu-all-over-again/"><span>only in November</span></a>, and the CDC had only sequenced 51,000 samples by the end of 2020, out of nearly 20 million cases. This not only means that we have no idea how widespread the B.1.1.7 variant is in the U.S., it means that we may have our own distinct variants <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160743/us-already-covid-variant-wouldnt-know?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=EB_TNR&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1608662430"><span>without even knowing</span></a>.</p>
<p>From the paltry amount of genetic sequencing that we do undertake in the U.S., we know for sure that B.1.1.7 is in California, Florida, and Colorado, but the circumstances of those cases is worrying. All three instances involve <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/health/2021/01/02/new-covid-strain-b-117-explained/4112125001/"><span>no significant travel history</span></a>, meaning that the variant is already in the U.S. and spreading via community transmission. The optimistic interpretation of this is that there may be a few, isolated pockets of this variant in the U.S. The pessimistic view, however, is that the U.S. is on the cusp, and well past the point of return, of a fast-moving outbreak that will dwarf what we’ve seen so far, absent strong response measures. The UK saw the B.1.1.7 variant appear in September but account for more than <a href="https://www.popsci.com/story/health/new-covid-strain-in-us/"><span>60% of cases</span></a> in London just months later, accompanied by the worst outbreak yet. The same could be underway in the U.S.</p>
<p><strong>Susceptibility: </strong>One of the reprieves of Covid-19 has been that children are relatively less susceptible to infection. This has enabled some schooling to proceed under modified protocols, even while workplaces have been shut and public gatherings disbanded. However, the emergence of the new variants has corresponded with increases in rates of infection and severe cases among <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4944"><span>children and young adults</span></a>. While some of this can likely be explained by schools remaining open and young people being likely to disregard social distancing guidance, for example, this doesn’t seem to be the whole story. Scientific testing continues, but many worry that the B.1.1.7 variant can actually <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/coronavirus-mutant-children-infection-neil-ferguson-b1777211.html"><span>more easily infect</span></a> young people than non-variant Covid-19, which may mean some previously effective Covid mitigation strategies will need to be <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/12/30/new-covid-strain-schools/"><span>reconsidered</span></a>.</p>
<p><strong>Exponential Risk:</strong> Some have pointed out that a significantly more transmissible virus is actually much <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/12/virus-mutation-catastrophe/617531/?utm_term=2020-12-31T18%3A13%3A39&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_source=facebook"><span>more worrisome</span></a> than a virus that just leads to more severe cases. In the latter instance, the virus still only affects the same number of people, though it kills more of them, but with the former, many, many times more people <a href="https://reason.com/2020/12/28/the-more-transmissible-u-k-covid-19-variant-could-make-the-pandemic-a-lot-worse/"><span>may become infected</span></a>—and potentially die.</p>
<p>“Kucharski compares a 50 percent increase in virus lethality to a 50 percent increase in virus transmissibility. Take a virus reproduction rate of about 1.1 and an infection fatality risk of 0.8 percent and imagine 10,000 active infections—a plausible scenario for many European cities, as Kucharski notes. As things stand, with those numbers, we’d expect 129 deaths in a month. If the fatality rate increased by 50 percent, that would lead to 193 deaths. In contrast, a 50 percent increase in transmissibility would lead to a whopping 978 deaths in just one month—assuming, in both scenarios, a six-day infection-generation time.” - Zeynep Tufekci, <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2020/12/virus-mutation-catastrophe/617531/?utm_term=2020-12-31T18%3A13%3A39&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_content=edit-promo&amp;utm_campaign=the-atlantic&amp;utm_source=facebook"><span>The Atlantic</span></a></p>
<p>But the risks don’t end there. The problem with an exponential increase in the number of cases, and indeed with the idea of letting the virus run its course through a population in the hopes of achieving herd immunity, is that this creates that many new opportunities for the virus to mutate further. This could lead to further changes in transmissibility, new variants that allow for reinfection, a more deadly combination of both transmissibility and severity, or even variants that, at some point, entirely undermine our vaccine efforts.</p>
<div><p>Any such change could have big positive or negative ramifications for the trajectory of the virus. Epidemics like H1N1 and various strains of Ebola proved to be too deadly to be truly disastrous on a global scale: they tended to kill their carriers at a rate that limits the ability of the virus to spread to new hosts. But those viruses may have been just a mutation away from a much more dangerous, if less lethal, form. Covid-19 may also be just a few mutations away from such a seismic shift, for better or for worse. <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160743/us-already-covid-variant-wouldnt-know?utm_medium=Social&amp;utm_campaign=EB_TNR&amp;utm_source=Twitter#Echobox=1608662430"><span>Such mutations</span></a> are a “once-in-a-million event,” but “but one-in-a-million events may become a lot more common when you have a million new cases every four days, as the U.S. now does.”</p></div>

                <div>
                    <p>At the end of October I quit my job as a director of software engineering. Many (most?) people view this as insane given the amount of money I was making. I'm not going to give a precise figure here, but if you're really curious you can check out software director salaries on <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/">levels.fyi</a>. I was making enough that in another 5-10 years I could very comfortably retire with a reasonably high standard of living.</p><h3 id="working-on-my-own-terms">Working on my own terms</h3><p>So why did I leave this behind? The concept is simple – I want to see how it feels to work on my own terms. I know how that sounds. If you've hung out for any period of time in tech-oriented communities like Hacker News it's likely that you've seen at least a few posts about people losing motivation at their high-paying tech jobs and wanting to strike out on their own. I always felt a little cognitive dissonance over those posts. On the one hand I completely identified with the desire to firmly seize control of my time and spend it on things that I wanted to do, but I also had this voice in the back of my head that said, "What a ridiculous first-world problem. Sure, other people set their priorities, but they have a pretty high degree of freedom compared to other roles and industries, so they should be thankful for what they've got. Why risk it?"</p><p>Everyone's situation is unique, but I think in my case the downside is limited. At the risk of sounding overconfident, I am very good at my job, and if things go south I believe I can join a large software organization again. The upside is that I can work on lots of different projects, spend more time with my family, and build things that I want to build.</p><h3 id="kids">Kids</h3><p>A huge reason for leaving was that my second child was recently born, and my company had no official paternity leave (if a company is small enough they're not bound by FMLA). With the pandemic raging and my toddler cooped up in the house, I wanted to spend more time with my toddler so my wife could focus on our new son.</p><p>This has been going fantastically so far. We're spending time outside, getting exercise, playing games, and making progress on simple academics. If my wife had to take care of a two year old and a newborn by herself with no support during the workday it would have been a nightmare.</p><p>It can be occasionally tedious (two year olds aren't the most sophisticated conversationalists), and we are all looking forward to the day where my daughter can engage more fully with other kids, go back to the rec center and library, travel with us, etc, but for now our schedule works. I'm very much enjoying our time together.</p><h3 id="financial-stability">Financial stability</h3><p>I don't have the funds to retire – this post would read very differently if I did. I have enough savings to feel secure, but it will be necessary for me to take on contract projects to support my family.</p><p>I may write another post on the financial details of working freelance down the road, but if you're interested in the types of expenses I took into account when quitting Daniel Vassallo has a fantastic post on it: <a href="https://danielvassallo.com/from-employee-to-bootstrapper/">https://danielvassallo.com/from-employee-to-bootstrapper/</a></p><p>I'm currently paying for COBRA health insurance through my old employer, and in general it was important to me that all my insurance coverages continue uninterrupted. I think that the most important points that Daniel emphasizes are ways to avoid financial ruin when you no longer have many of the safety nets that come with large tech employers.</p><h3 id="what-s-next">What's next?</h3><p>I've already started contracting! I have a fairly broad network of friends that I've developed over the last decade in tech, and for now I'm happy sharing my expertise with them and helping to build new products.</p><h3 id="this-blog">This blog</h3><p>I've always enjoyed writing about things I'm interested in and helping others level up their skills. This blog, cloudconsultant.dev, will be focused on news about the major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, and GCP), along with comparisons between the platforms and tips and tricks I've learned while building enterprise software in the cloud. I'm hoping you'll find it easy to read and educational. My secondary objective is to build a conduit to meet potential clients who need help with their cloud projects.</p><p>Please feel free to reach out if you have cloud questions! I'll be looking for interesting cloud topics to post about every week. I plan on making conversational-style posts that will help you keep up to date in a less painful way than just reading Amazon/Microsoft/Google press releases.</p><p>My next post will be a recap of the major cloud feature releases of 2020 – if that sounds interesting, sign up for my mailing list below!</p><p>Until next time,</p><p>Joe</p>

<div><p><em><em>Ever since I learned that unionizing was an option for workers like me, I knew I wanted to be a union worker. It seemed so obvious to me—why do we demand democracy from our government, then cede our individual power in our workplaces? And the longer I’ve been at Google, the more pressing the need feels. We’ve seen retaliation against workers speaking up against sexual assault, accessibility, and diversity. The voices I came to Google to be surrounded by are slowly but surely being silenced. I believe that The Alphabet Workers Union is our chance to reclaim that power and make Alphabet a company we can be proud of once again.</em></em></p><p>– Raksha Muthukumar, Google Software Engineer &amp; union member&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Google workers have organized for <a href="https://qz.com/458615/theres-reportedly-a-big-secret-spreadsheet-where-google-employees-share-their-salaries/">pay equity</a>, opposed <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/30/technology/google-project-maven-pentagon.html">unethical uses of machine learning</a>, protested <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/01/technology/google-walkout-sexual-harassment.html">sexual assault</a>, and more. Our small team at Collective Action in Tech has been <a href="https://data.collectiveaction.tech/?query=google">archiving these organizing events</a> for years. Now the workers of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, are building worker power through a <em>non-contract union</em> they’ve named The Alphabet Workers Union.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time Google workers are unionizing. In 2017, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/after-five-years-of-fighting-google-and-facebook-secur-1828304237">Security guards at Google</a> and Facebook had their union recognized and fought through a long contract negotiation. In 2019, <a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2019/12/31/21043467/google-union-cafeteria-workers-unionized-alphabet-silicon-valley-mountainview">Google cafeteria staff</a> employed by vendor Bon Appetit won their union election. In September 2019 a group of 80 contract office workers in<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2019/08/30/google-contract-workers-vote-form-union-amid-employee-discord-over-treatment/"> Pittsburgh voted to join the United Steelworkers</a>, forming Google’s very first office worker union. But shortly after these workers won their union, the company that contracted these workers to Google outsourced their roles to Poland, decimating the union’s bargaining unit in retaliation for unionizing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Since then, Google has ramped up its anti-union strategy. In November 2020, Google illegally fired four workers for organizing. In an attempt to further chill worker organizing, the company has <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/19/google-employees-protested-security-team-interrogation-memo-says.html">shut down key channels</a> for challenging leadership, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-10-23/google-accused-of-creating-spy-tool-to-squelch-worker-dissent">tracked expressions of dissent</a>, and hired an <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/20/technology/Google-union-consultant.html">anti-union firm</a>. To combat management’s increasingly aggressive anti-organizing tactics, workers at Google are now fortifying their collective action efforts with a structure that enables them to strengthen and maintain the power they’ve been building for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today organizers announced they are launching The Alphabet Workers Union, a union for all employees and contractors at Alphabet and all of its vendor companies in partnership with the Communications Workers of America Union (CWA). In this piece, we explain the non-contract structure of The Alphabet Workers Union and how it works, with some help from fellow organizers.</p>



<h2>1. <strong>What is a non-contract union?</strong></h2>



<p>Instead of going to the NLRB and winning recognition through an election, Google workers are taking immediate advantage of the power of a union.&nbsp; All unions start out as non-contract unions. A union, in its broadest sense, is formed when two or more workers collectively act to improve working conditions. For example, if you’re talking to a coworker about pay inequity and you both decide to do something about it, you’ve just formed a union (just not a very strong one…yet). This kind of union—where workers are acting as one to improve the workplace but have not yet pursued a formal contract negotiation with the employer—is what’s known as a non-contract union, an open union, a minority union, or a solidarity union.</p>



<div><p><em>Semantics are really important in union organizing. The problem with a non-majority union is that it might grow to include the majority and still have this structure. Solidarity unionism is also a strange term because it implies that other union structures don’t have solidarity. That term is also ahistorical because it positions this type of union as an alternative to the norm when, in reality, NLRB-sanctioned unions are a blip in the long arc of union organizing history. It wasn’t until 1935 that we even had a framework for a contract union sanctioned by the NLRB. Prior to 1935, all unions organized just like this one. Non-contract union works well but I would simply describe The Alphabet Workers Union as a union, because that’s what they are. </em></p><p>– Emma Kinema, Campaign Lead at CODE-CWA</p></div>



<p>Workers can choose to go through those legal processes (such as through recognition from the NLRB in the US) down the road if they want, but even without formal recognition from an outside entity, there is no legal roadblock holding back a group of workers from being a powerful collective that functions as a union. Non-contract unions embody the idea that worker power does not come from legal processes, but rather through building power through solidarity.</p>



<div><p><em>Our union is not defined by our company, nor is it defined by the US government and labor law. We the workers define our own union, as workers have been doing for hundreds of years, long before the National Labor Relations Act established a government sanctioned union recognition process in 1935. We define our union because it’s ours. </em></p><p>– Emma Kinema, Campaign Lead at CODE-CWA</p></div>



<h2>2. <strong>Why build a non-contract union?</strong></h2>



<p>Every worker deserves a union. In tech, we’ve seen activism lead to change but often at a significant cost to activists and organizers. Instead of acting individually, or on independent issue-based campaigns, it’s time to make each other stronger and come together as a collective. For US workers, forming a non-contract union is the original way to unionize. Our laboring forebears used this strategy before gaining enough power to pressure the government to create worker protections through labor law.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p><em>Google was supposed to be the gold standard in tech, but even with the relatively high FTE salaries and office perks, there’s no substitute for democracy and dignity on the job. I think it’s amazing this is happening in our industry.</em></p><p>– Ben Gwin, HCL Union Organizer&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2>3. <strong>Who can join a non-contract union?</strong></h2>



<p>That’s up to the workers of the union. The Alphabet Workers Union will be the first union open to all employees and contractors at any Alphabet company. A collective that unites workers across teams, roles, and locations is known as a <em>wall to wall</em> union. The structure of a non-contract union allows workers to organize a collective that makes sense to <em>them</em> and is not constrained by the rules of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA). Google organizers have invited a wide range of workers to join the union, including some workers who would not normally be eligible to join under NLRA guidelines. This includes contractors, non-office workers, and lower-level managers.</p>



<p>For years, companies have creatively diminished worker power by decreasing unions’ headcount through increasing reliance on contract workers and by creating a sprawling layer of middle management. With a non-contract union, the workers of Google are in control of the union composition and can invite anyone they feel is aligned in a <em>community of interest</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The safest way to organize across roles within the structure of a union that is not sanctioned by the NRLB is to keep the participation of individuals in subgroups like managers and contractors secret until there is a critical mass of this subgroup. This makes it harder for the company to retaliate against workers who are not protected under the NLRA and would have no legal recourse if fired for union activity.</p>



<div><p><em>As long as the union is worker-led, it will empower a lot of people and help grow the labor movement in tech. Our situation in Pittsburgh is not the norm (unionized full time employees through third party vendor HCL). A lot of TVCs (temporary, vendors or contractors) don’t have the opportunity we had because of their employment status. Joining a minority union alongside FTEs (full time employees) is a solid alternative to build worker power. Just from a numbers standpoint, the wall to wall union helps. It also makes sure that voices from different offices are heard and that more perspectives are included in organizing discussions. They hold an incredible amount of leverage with their ability to withhold labor. The tiered system is in place to prevent this very thing from happening, which makes this even sweeter</em>. </p><p>– Ben Gwin, HCL Union Organizer&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div>



<h2>4. <strong>Who’s in charge of a non-contract union?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Just like a union that goes through the NLRB recognition process, Alphabet’s union is worker-led. The collective has elected a council of workers, hired organizing staff, and is formally supported by the CWA. Workers have created structure and process to bring democracy to the workplace. In other words, The Alphabet Workers Union is run democratically by workers themselves.</p>



<div><p><em>We’ve learned a lot from the experience of CODE CWA staff who’ve helped us set up structures to ensure that every union member is empowered to speak up. We’ve elected an interim executive team for now, and are in the process of establishing teams in chapter (location) offices, we’re staffing committees that focus on diversity &amp; equity, we’re ensuring that new members know that they’re heard. In fact I think we’ve specifically kept a few things fluid before going public because we expect an influx of membership, and we want to make sure we’re not set in stone before more people weigh in!</em></p><p>– Raksha Muthukumar, Google Software Engineer &amp; Union Member</p></div>



<h2>5. <strong>Do members of a non-contract union pay dues?&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>That’s up to the union. Traditionally, dues fuel the support system for a union. They typically go into a pool for legal support, strike funds, and paying the salaries of other kinds of hired union support. The Alphabet Workers Union set their own dues with guidance from CWA. The dues are a percentage of a worker’s individual total compensation. But this is only one model for collecting union dues. Tech workers who are building a union can decide how they want dues to work and come up with creative systems. For example, your …</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two years ago, I did something that I’d never done in my career before- I left a job
(at <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>) only a few months after starting it. In this post, I want to explain
what happened and what I learned from the experience.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2>

<h4 id="the-job-switch">The job switch</h4>

<p>Back in the spring of 2019, I decided to leave <a href="https://www.stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I’d
been a software engineer for about a year and a half. The full details are best left
to a separate post, but at a high level I just wasn’t very happy with my personal situation; the
work I was doing in compute infrastructure had the unfortunate combination of being both
overly stressful and underappreciated. At the same time, I felt like my career prospects
were limited because the upper rungs of Stripe’s engineering individual contributor (IC) ladder put
a lot of emphasis on cross-team coordination and other, managerial-like activities that I didn’t
enjoy and felt I wasn’t very good at.</p>

<p>Given how hot the job market was at the time and the number of other, seemingly more interesting
opportunities available, I figured that I had nothing to lose by interviewing elsewhere.</p>

<p>After a few weekends of furiously-paced <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/master-coding-interviews">Leetcoding</a>, I was ready.
Unlike my previous job searches, there wasn’t any particular company that I was aspiring
to get into; instead, I just went through my <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/six-years-of-emails">backlog of recruiting emails</a>
and wrote back to a bunch that looked interesting. Among the messages I responded to was one
about <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>, an autonomous vehicle startup that was attempting to do driverless
grocery delivery.</p>

<p>Over the following weeks, I went through the full recruitment slog, starting with lots of
recruiter phone calls, then following up with technical phone screens for a subset of
those, then doing onsite interviews for a subset of those. In the end, I got offers from seven
places, including Nuro.</p>

<p>During the process, I didn’t fall in love with any of the options. But, there
was something that made me feel more optimistic about Nuro than the other choices. Being a
hardware-oriented, robotics company, it was just really different from all of my previous employers,
and, after years of feeling stuck in my career, maybe different was good.</p>

<p>The company was super secretive about its technology; I wasn’t allowed to tour the office, for
instance, because they had hardware prototypes lying around that only employees were allowed to
see. I also wasn’t invited to ride along in their test cars, which would have been both fun and
informative. The external signs were good, though- they had raised a billion dollars from Softbank
and others, and the employee reviews on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/">Glassdoor</a> were gushing.</p>

<p>Aside from being in a somewhat different space than my previous employers, another potential
downside was the commute. Stripe and my three jobs before that were all within a 15 minute walk
of my apartment in San Francisco. Nuro’s office was 40 miles away in Mountain View, which was
more than an hour each way by train. But, I had done longer commutes earlier in my career and figured
that I could handle it.</p>

<p>In the end, I went with my impulses and signed the offer. I had my last day at Stripe, took a short
vacation, and then showed up at the Nuro office, brimming with optimism, for my first day two weeks
later.</p>

<h4 id="realizing-my-mistake">Realizing my mistake</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, that optimism lasted for a grand total of 2 days. By Wednesday of my first week,
as I was riding the train home, I realized that I had made a mistake. My colleagues were
friendly and smart, and the company was doing interesting things, but the job just felt like a
lifestyle downgrade to me.</p>

<p>At Stripe and each of my jobs before that, I had had a short commute to a beautiful office, and
got to experience the instant gratification associated with developing purely software-based
products. Now, I was stuck taking a crowded train to a dark office littered with hardware parts,
working on a product that would take many years to reach mass-market adoption due to pesky little
things like manufacturing and road safety.</p>

<p>I had left Stripe seeking an upgrade, but instead I got a downgrade. And, while minor improvements
were possible, it seemed unlikely that things would completely change for the better in the near
term.</p>

<h4 id="getting-back-on-track">Getting back on track</h4>

<p>At this point, I had three choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Quit immediately</li>
  <li>Start exploring new opportunities but don’t quit until something better is lined up</li>
  <li>Stick it out for at least a year</li>
</ol>

<p>My first instinct was to take option 1 and just go back to Stripe. When I reached out to my HR
contact, though, I found out that I’d have to go through team matching again and also get a new
offer; even though I’d left on good terms less than a month before, I couldn’t just revert back to
my previous position and pay. This was disappointing, but after giving it a little more thought,
I figured it was for the best because I had left Stripe for specific reasons; going back
to my old job wouldn’t fix those or make me feel better about them.</p>

<p>Another variant of option 1 would be to quit and take one of the other offers I had gotten
during my search. But, I had already rejected those for what I thought were good reasons,
so this didn’t feel like the best way out.</p>

<p>Option 3 was the one that would look the least bad from a resume perspective, and this seems to be
what a lot of people in tech do when they don’t like a job. But, life is short, I was really feeling
unhappy with the choice I had made, and I figured it wasn’t really fair to my colleagues at Nuro to
stick in a job that my heart wasn’t in.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I decided that option 2 was the best fit for me. I continued at Nuro and did my best
to get up-to-speed and to contribute to my team’s work, but at the same time jumped right back
into the job market. In addition to keeping things open with Stripe, I
<a href="https://yolken.net/blog/triplebyte-review">tried Triplebyte</a>, responded to more recruiter emails, and also
reached out to some former colleagues about the companies they were now at.</p>

<p>I then went through the whole recruitment process with a new set of companies. This time,
though, I was a lot pickier about where I interviewed (nothing in hardware or with long commutes!);
after a few weeks, I had four new choices including an updated offer from Stripe. After
a good amount of due diligence, significantly more than I had done in my previous search, I
decided to go to <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>.</p>

<p>When I put in my notice at Nuro, people were surprised that I was leaving so soon, but ultimately
were understanding. I left, took a short vacation, and then started at Segment. Thankfully,
the new job was a much better fit for me, and I’m much happier now!</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>

<h4 id="do-your-due-diligence">Do your due diligence</h4>

<p>Switching jobs is a big deal, and it shouldn’t be done impulsively. Ideally, your due
diligence before signing a new offer should include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Meeting with the team you’ll be working with in a low-stress, non-interview setting</li>
  <li>Touring the office and understanding what your specific workspace will be like</li>
  <li>Trying out the commute for a few days (if it’s significantly different than your current one)</li>
  <li>Trying out any new languages/technologies that you’ll be using on the job</li>
  <li>Getting hands-on demos of the company’s products (if they’re not freely accessible to consumers
  already)</li>
  <li>Seeing a summary of the company’s income and expenses over time (if not public)</li>
</ol>

<p>Learning about these things doesn’t guarantee that you’ll be happy in your new job, but it
at least reduces the risk of any unexpected surprises after you start.</p>

<h4 id="its-ok-to-quit-after-a-few-weeks-just-dont-make-it-a-pattern">It’s ok to quit after a few weeks (just don’t make it a pattern)</h4>

<p>When I started my second job search, I was worried that the short
tenure in the job I was trying to leave would be a turn-off to perspective employers. In reality,
however, it wasn’t a big deal- people asked about it, but seemed satisfied with my 20 second
summary and then moved on to other things.</p>

<p>The sense I get is that you’re allowed to quit a new job once in your career without any
repercussions. If you do it multiple times, however, then recruiters and hiring managers might
have second thoughts about interviewing you without strong internal references or some other signal
that you’ll be a good employee.</p>

<h4 id="switch-teams-before-quitting">Switch teams before quitting</h4>

<p>As I noted in a <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/leaving-a-job">previous post</a>, switching teams is a lot easier than
switching jobs. I didn’t do this before I left Stripe because there weren’t any other teams that I
was super enthusiastic about at the time. But, in retrospect, I probably should have given this a
try before quitting.</p>

<p>Even if the new team hadn’t been a perfect fit, it would have at least bought some time and given
me some additional experience that could help in future work. This is what I did at Google
and Airbnb, and in both cases the “second team” was what really opened up new opportunities for me.</p>

  <article>

	</header>

		<p>
		My stack requires no maintenance, has perfect Lighthouse scores, will never have any security vulnerability, is based on open standards, is portable, has an instant dev loop, has no build step and… will outlive any other stack.
		</p>
		<p>
		It’s not LAMP, Wordpress, Rails, MEAN, Jamstack... I don’t do CSR (Client-side rendering), SSR (Server Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation)...
		</p>
		<p>
		My stack is <b>HTML+CSS</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		And because my sources are in git, pushed to GitHub, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is my host.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, I’m being a bit provocative here. I should rather say that, for some specific use cases, I concluded that to get top performances and to guatantee long term support, HTML+CSS was the best choice, instead on relying on technologies currently more popular. Because I’m done rewriting my site every couple of years.
		</p>

		<h3>Why HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		It all started with <a href="https://labs.steren.fr/">a blog</a>, that I was hosting on Wordpress.com (which is "Wordpress-as-a-Service", because the last thing I want to do is administer a Wordpress installation on my own server). I <strong>paid</strong> Wordpress.com to do one job: host my blog. And one day I looked at its sources and Lighthouse scores:
		</p>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-sources.png" alt="Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, showing a lot of inlined unreadable scripts">
			<figcaption>Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, what is all this?</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse scores of my Wordpress.com blog, showing 19/100 for Performance">
			<figcaption>Lighthouse score of my blog hosted on Wordpress.com</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
		What have we done?
		</p>
		<p>
		Sure, these are the problems of one specific blogging platform. I’m pretty sure others are better, at least in terms of performance. But isn’t there something fundamentally wrong if displaying a short text with images takes seconds, loads countless render-blocking scripts, and has unreadable sources?
		</p>
		<p>
		My requirements were:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>performance</li>
			<li>simplicity</li>
			<li>long long term support</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		It was time to say goodbye to Wordpress. I didn’t need 99% of its features anyway. Other blogging platforms didn’t meet expectations either (I seriously have no idea why so many people publish on Medium… behind a login wall). I looked at static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty, but all of these require tooling installed, have a build step and will ultimately need some updates or be abandonned by their maintainer. What if we also get rid of these?
		</p>
		<p>
		The best tool is no tool, the best build step is no build step, the best update is no update. HTML gives us all that, and more.
		</p>

		</figure>

		<h3>What is the HTML+CSS stack good for?</h3>
		<p>
		Let’s first differentiate between what I call a web <em>page</em> and a web <em>app</em>: The goal of a web <em>page</em> is to serve content, on the other hand, the goal of a web <em>app</em> is to enable the user to perform interactive tasks. Of course, there are in-betweens, often in the form of content that might need customization depending on the logged in user and content that might allow some interactions.
		</p>
		<p>
		HTML+CSS fits the web <em>page</em> use case. Wow, what a revelation! It might seem obvious, but it seems we’ve all forgotten this these days. HTML+CSS does not fit the web <em>app </em>use case, or any in between.
		</p>
		<p>
		We said a web <em>page</em> serves content, but let’s dive into more concrete use cases:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Product / Company / Business landing page and marketing sites</li>
			<li>Personal portfolio / bio</li>
			<li>Blog</li>
			<li>Documentation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How to develop for HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		Authoring a pure HTML+CSS site can be done in any text editor, in any environment (any desktop OS, any smartphone, or even directly using GitHub’s single file editor) and previewed by simply opening the file in any browser.
		</p>
		<p>
		Keep the HTML of every page minimal and semantic. First, because there is no need for countless of &lt;div&gt;, but then because it makes sources more readable and easier to edit. See for example the <a href="https://github.com/steren/blog/blob/master/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/index.html">HTML sources of this page</a>: a total of 150 lines, 100 lines are for the content, the rest is metadata and page structure, nothing extra. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For consistency, all pages that need to share the same style can point to the same CSS file. This avoids  duplication when it comes to styling (but note that loading this file creates an extra HTTP request, which could be avoided if style was inlined).
		</p>
		<p>
		When not cluttered with unnecessary scripts, divs or classes, I have no issue writing HTML directly. Yes, the paragraph tags are a bit annoying and distracting, but proper indentation and syntax highlighting mitigate this.
		<br>
		Sometimes, for drafting long blog articles, I’m working in Google Docs, and when I’m happy, export the content to clean HTML using an add-on. Google Docs is awesome for collaboration, with powerful suggestions and commenting system. That’s ideal for the “draft” phase. 
		<br>
		Because all content is in git, final review and approval can be done via GitHub pull requests.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I publish a new page, I need to link to it manually from the index page. I’m OK with that. It’s done in one line. It also allows me to have more control over when I want the page to be “published”.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't need to pay for custom themes, I have complete freedom in the style and layout of my site.
		I can embed anything I want without being restricted by the choice of the hosting platform: SVG images, 3D models, interactive JS experiences. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Creating a new page requires to clone an existing one.
		So... if I don’t use any templating system, how do I update my header, footer or nav? Well, simply by using the ”Replace in files” feature of any good text editor. They don’t need frequent updates anyway. The benefits of using a templating system is not worth the cost of introducing the tooling it requires.
		</p>
		
		<h3>In conclusion</h3>
		<p>
		You don’t need  Wordpress, or Hugo to put a blog online, or Angular, React or Next.js to put a web page online. Raw HTML and CSS do the job.
		</p>
		<p>
		That being said, you’ll need to pick up some tooling or framework if you want to build a web app or add more interactivity or customization to your web pages. And for that, I’m very glad to see that frameworks now seem to be prioritizing performance, notably by prioritizing serving the content first and leveraging caching whenever possible. The era of “download 5MB of JS first and then download content from athe REST API” seems to be over for content web pages. (I personally think it’s still OK to do so for web apps, as the user’s intent and expectations are different).
		</p>
		<p>
		Is the “HTML+CSS only” approach a bit extreme? A bit, it’s basically saying “all software is terrible, how can I minimize my dependencies on software”. Web standards are a model of backward compatibility. I’m pretty confident that my web pages written in raw HTML+CSS will have no issue being accessed and authored 10 years from now, without me having to do anything.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article">


<h2 id="why%20would%20you%20want%20to%20do%20this?">why would you want to do this?</h2>

<ul>
<li>The Go ecosystem is much richer than Lua and other embeddable languages</li>
<li>More people are familiar with Go than with Lua</li>
<li>Less effort is required than integrating with a different language</li>
<li><code>&lt;everything go is good at&gt;</code></li>
</ul>

<p>We're going to be using <a href="https://github.com/traefik/yaegi">yaegi</a>, an embedded Go interpreter for this experiment.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>All the code is <a href="https://github.com/skuzzymiglet/go-in-go">here</a></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="layout">layout</h2>

<p>Our trivial demo program will call scripts that change one <code>int</code>, and the change will be reflected in the runner's state. There are many possibilities but I'm keeping it simple here.</p>

<p>Since yaegi scripts can't change the runner's state directly, the scripts will change the integer by calling wrapper functions. Also, to affect the runner's state, the function will have to run inside the runner. Therefore, the script must return a <code>func()</code> (or <code>func() error</code> if you want to handle with errors) that we can execute.</p>

<h2 id="scripts">scripts</h2>

<p>Our script will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>package main

import (
    "fmt"
    "lib"
    "math/rand"
)

func Func() func() {
    return func() {
        fmt.Println(lib.GetX()) // Print the integer
        lib.SetX(rand.Int()) // Set it to something random
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>Notice the <code>lib</code> import here. This is a package we add to the interpreters set of symbols. It will contain wrapper functions around our integer. </p>

<p>The returned <code>func()</code> runs in the runner.</p>

<p>We'll store this script in <code>scripts/one.go</code></p>

<h2 id="runner">runner</h2>

<p>Our runner will look like this:</p>

<pre><code>// imports omitted for brevity

func main() {
    x := 0 // the all-important integer

    // all Go files under scripts
    files, err := filepath.Glob("scripts/*.go")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }

    for _, filename := range files {
        // Clean interepreter for each script
        i := interp.New(interp.Options{})
        // standard library
        i.Use(stdlib.Symbols)
        // wrapper functions for the integer
        // You could put these somewhere more convenient but they're short enough to fit here
        i.Use(interp.Exports(map[string]map[string]reflect.Value{
            "lib": map[string]reflect.Value{
                "IncX": reflect.ValueOf(func() { x++ }), 
                "DecX": reflect.ValueOf(func() { x-- }),
                "SetX": reflect.ValueOf(func(n int) { x = n }),
                "GetX": reflect.ValueOf(func() int { return x }),
            },
        }))
        // run the script
        _, err := i.EvalPath(filename)
        if err != nil {
            log.Fatalf("error running %s: %s", filename, err)
        }
        // Extract main.Func(), check its type
        symbols := i.Symbols("")
        main, ok := symbols["main"]
        if !ok {
            panic("main not found")
        }
        runFuncValue, ok := main["Func"]
        if !ok {
            log.Fatalf("%s: Func not found", filename)
        }
        runFunc, ok := runFuncValue.Interface().(func() func())
        if !ok {
            log.Fatalf("%s: Run is not of type func() func()", filename)
        }

        // run the function it returns
        runFunc()()
        log.Printf("x is now %d", x)
    }
}
</code></pre>

<pre><code>2021/01/04 18:20:26 running scripts/one.go
0
2021/01/04 18:20:26 x is now 5577006791947779410
</code></pre>

<p>We can see <code>one.go</code> printing <code>0</code> (the zero value for our integer) and after setting it to a random number, the change is reflected.</p>

<p>This has some potential - you could build an HTTP server with script-configurable routes, a text editor automated in Go, or even a window manager with layouts and a bar configured in Go without re-compiling.</p>

<h2 id="should%20you%20do%20this?">should you do this?</h2>

<p>Probably not.</p>

<p>yaegi has <a href="https://github.com/traefik/yaegi/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug">quite</a> <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/traefik/yaegi/interp#pkg-note-bug">a few</a> bugs, and hasn't reached a stable version yet. Go modules are unsupported. </p>

<p>Packages must be wrapped to be used - I haven't investigated this yet. To use non-standard-library packages, they must be in the GOPATH/GOROOT (<code>go get</code> needs to be run) and symbols need to be extracted (every external package used by scripts would have to be configured in the runner)</p>

<p>The library isn't particularly friendly. <a href="https://github.com/traefik/yaegi/blob/master/interp/interp.go#L409">Extracting symbols</a> doesn't error when the package isn't found.</p>

<p>Completions won't be available for the <code>lib</code> package, and there will be a big error as you write your scripts because <code>lib</code> isn't a real package. Scripts will have to be 1 file (perhaps the interpreter could be improved to accomodate this)</p>

<p>Therefore, you should probably stick with compiling modules into the binary (<a href="https://caddyserver.com/docs/extending-caddy">like Caddy</a>), <a href="https://godoc.org/github.com/yuin/gopher-lua">Lua</a> or <a href="https://github.com/robertkrimen/otto">JavaScript</a>. Or shell integration. Or filesystems. Or HTTP.</p>

<p>Thanks for reading</p>

She used a randomly selected 5% sample from each dataset to train comparison models. </p><p>She also used that 5% dataset as the seed for GPT-3-generated synthetic training data. She generated ten sets of synthetic data per original dataset to test the effects of model size and the number of examples given. She then trained three machine learning models on each set of synthetic data.</p><p>Because she had faced such a predicament in the past, she wanted to know:</p><blockquote><p>What if an engineer only has access to a small amount of labeled data? </p><p>For example, what if they want to create a text message spam filter but cannot access a large number of text messages due to cost constraints or privacy concerns? </p><p>Is it better to train on the tiny, real-world dataset you have or is it better to use that tiny dataset to generate larger amounts of synthetic training data with GPT-3?</p></blockquote><p>On the whole, the study found that machine learning models trained on GPT-3 synthetic data tend to perform better than models trained on small amounts of real-world data, with over half (54.44%) of all models trained on GPT-3 data (N=90) reporting higher accuracies than their 5% counterparts while reaching at least the 0.01 level of significance.&nbsp;</p><h2>Significance of Model Accuracies (N=90)</h2></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609703268740_9043"><div><p>However, there were notable differences in model performance based on dataset and model type. For example, the IMDB and SMS models only produced accuracy scores that were higher than their real-world data counterparts while the Enron email results were mixed. Regarding model type, all 30 logistic regression models produced higher accuracy scores, three of 30 random forest models produced lower accuracies, and five of 30 passive-aggressive classifier models produced lower accuracies.&nbsp;</p><p>Though more research is needed to codify best practices and to ascertain under which exact circumstances GPT-3 is most useful when generating synthetic training data, this study offers an interesting glimpse into the future. </p><blockquote><p>It would be absolutely groundbreaking if one could create vast amounts of effective training data simply by giving an API a natural-language prompt and a few examples of the task.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>For example, the SMS models portion of the experiment began with a 5% dataset of only 161 non-spam messages and 26 spam messages (186 text messages total). Even in the most pessimistic case (the passive-aggressive classifier), models trained on GPT-3-generated synthetic data still showed modest gains in accuracy. More importantly, every model trained on GPT-3 data created via at least two examples had recall gains between 17 and 22 points, all at the 0.001 level of significance.</p><h2>SMS Passive-Aggressive Classifier Spam Recall</h2></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609703268740_13568"><div><p>Data such as personal text messages are not always easy to come by. Besides the obvious privacy concerns, it can be expensive and/or time-consuming to procure. Yet algorithms that can filter out spam or at least alert people to potentially dangerous spam text messages provide value to consumers.&nbsp;</p><p>The main takeaway from this study is that we may well live in a world someday where instead of needing thousands or tens of thousands of examples of such pieces of data, one may only need a couple of hundred pieces of data to train an effective model.&nbsp;</p><p>A machine learning engineer might be able to quickly and easily create useful algorithms they never dreamed possible without violating people’s privacy or paying out the nose for additional data. </p><p>Such a future would be exciting indeed.</p><p>If you’re interested in experimenting with synthetic textual data for your machine learning projects, please contact Katie Evanko-Douglas at katie@ameliormate.com.</p></div></div></div>]]>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) is having a major outage today. Widely utilized services like Amazon API Gateway, Lambda, DynamoDB, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, CloudFormation, Autoscaling, Athena and others were affected.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Our beloved products from Adobe, Roku, Spotify, and Flickr went down together with AWS. Our hearts go out to these companies and their users.</p>
<p>"So many services being impacted simultaneously may be indicative of a large software rollout, or potentially localized underlying hardware or network issues,” said Leon Kuperman, CTO and Co-Founder at CAST AI. “If it’s a software issue, it’s unusual that AWS would have chosen US-East as a canary region. US-East (Virginia) represents the largest AWS region and largest customer footprint, which would put it near last, if not last on the rollout schedule."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Public-clouds are a godsend for tech companies. Migration to cloud allows startups and enterprises to skip over unnecessary investments in on-premise data centers and focus on what matters the most: develop products that people love, scale fast, and always be accessible.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, public cloud providers like AWS, Azure or Google Cloud Platform are eager to lock in companies to use their services exclusively. When you rely on one vendor, you go down when that vendor fails.</p>
<p>Today, AWS showed the true cost of putting all your eggs in one basket. It amplified the need for companies to have a multi-cloud disaster recovery and fail-over strategy. This strategy would still allow for a possibility of some cloud providers to go down, but it would also ensure that a cloud going down would not mean downtime for your users.</p>
<p>“A cloud failure should not become a disaster. Never again.” said Laurent Gil, CPO and Co-Founder at CAST AI. “You can rest easy knowing that your infrastructure is never down.”</p>
<div><p>Imagine that you show up to your office one day and your office building is gone. That’s what happens when cloud providers like AWS go down. All you are left with is the question “Why?“. With CAST AI you don’t need to wonder. By running your application on multi cloud, CAST AI automatically shifts your resources to Azure or Google Cloud when AWS has troubles.</p><p>Explore <a href="https://cast.ai/" rel="noopener">CAST AI here.</a></p></div></span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="1"><span>Need to know</span></h2><div><p>I envy voracious book readers. They seem worldly and wise. Also, whatever is happening in their lives, theyâ€™re never completely on their own â€“ they always have their books. My mother is one of these life-long devourers of literature, for whom books are a constant companion. She recalls contracting tuberculosis as an eight-year-old girl, before there was a vaccine, and being sent to spend six months at a convalescent home in Margate, more than 100 miles from her family. â€˜Books saved me from what would have been unbearable, allowing me to escape from that bed to have adventures in other places and other lives,â€™ she says.</p>
<p>Avid readers often look back on their book-reading with fondness. â€˜My first memories of reading are of my late mum taking me to our local library, and both of us taking out as many books as we could carry,â€™ says Clare Reynolds, author of the Years of Reading Selfishly <a href="https://yearsofreadingselfishly.blog/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">blog</a>. â€˜We didnâ€™t have a car so had to make sure we could manage them all on the bus.â€™</p>
<p>Reynoldsâ€™s passion for reading continued through adolescence and led her to study English literature at the University of Leeds, but then the demands of work and family caught up with her, and for years she found herself in what she calls the â€˜reading wildernessâ€™. Anecdotally, many of us recognise this overwhelming sense of competing demands on our time. We hanker for the space to read more. We buy the books, they pile up, but we never get round to reading them â€“ the Japanese even have a term for it, <em>tsundoku</em>.</p>
<p>Data back this up: a US <a href="https://blog.scribd.com/home/the-benefits-of-reading" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">survey</a> found that more than one-third of adults report a desire to read more books, with book reading second only to exercise as the most wished-for activity. Similarly, in France, 65 per cent of people aged 15 years and over <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/416780/wish-to-read-more-books-france/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">said</a> they wished they read more books, rising to 77 per cent among those already reading at average levels.</p>
<p>If youâ€™re one of these people, opening a book might have become something to do when you havenâ€™t got anything else going on, which is almost never. Itâ€™s as if you decided at some point, likely without conscious thought, that even though you love books, book reading is effectively the least important thing in your life â€“ youâ€™ll squeeze it in, if you can. And if you are clinging to the remnants of a book reading habit, Iâ€™ll bet you save it for the end of the day, or perhaps only for when youâ€™re on holiday.</p>
<p>To read more books, you need to make it a higher priority, which means changing your daily habits and routines to accommodate more reading. People who are â€˜super readersâ€™ by virtue of their profession â€“ such as literary editors, agents and book award judges â€“ show us just how much reading is possible if you are willing and able to give it a high enough priority. Consider Ed Needham, former editor at magazines such as <em>FHM</em> and <em>Rolling Stone</em>, who in 2018 launched his own magazine, <em>Strong Words</em>, which features more than 100 book reviews every month. Needham reads or listens to every one of the reviewed books. â€˜I just have to find the time, thereâ€™s no way around it,â€™ he says. â€˜I produce an issue of <em>Strong Words</em> every six weeks, and we worked out that for five of those six weeks I read the equivalent of <em>War and Peace</em> every week.â€™</p>
<p>When reading books is your livelihood or essential to fulfil your responsibilities, then it becomes the priority around which the rest of life must bend. You donâ€™t need to go as far as Needham, of course, but to read more books you do need to take a hard look at whether, given the value you place on books, you are providing the activity with the attention and time it deserves in your life.</p>
<p>â€˜Sometimes, you just need the slightest encouragement to displace something that isnâ€™t earning its keep in your routine,â€™ says Needham. â€˜I remember [the US filmmaker and writer] John Waters saying he found it really easy to read every night because he never watched television. That made me realise it is really easy to stop watching television, because I get more from books than I do from the vast majority of television programmes.â€™</p>
<p>When there are so many options competing for our time, itâ€™s worth reminding yourself of the unique rewards of book reading. I read the newspaper every morning and my day job involves reading countless essays and articles, but when I manage to find the time to immerse myself in a quality nonfiction book, itâ€™s a wholly different experience â€“ you can almost feel the presence of the author alongside you on a personal intellectual journey. By the end, youâ€™re somehow changed, you see the world differently. And although TV and video games of course offer escapism, thereâ€™s nothing quite like devouring the pages of a beautiful novel, sitting quietly in one place while letting words transport you to another. Screens show you whatâ€™s happening; novels, by contrast, construct those fictions within your mind, allowing you to become anyone, and go anywhere.</p></div></div></section><section><div><h2 data-guide-section-number="2"><span>What to do</span></h2><div><p>It will take significant effort for you to read more books, at least at first. To succeed long-term, you need to develop new reading habits, so that reading is something you do without resorting to conscious effort and willpower. But before getting into details of how to do this, there are some preliminary steps to ease the way.</p>
<p>The first is to reflect on <em>why</em> you want to read more books. Benjamin Gardner is a social psychologist at Kingâ€™s College, London and an expert on the psychology of habits. His theory of habit formation begins with the need for sufficient motivation. â€˜Think about why is it exactly you want to do it? What would the benefits be? Answering these kinds of questions can make you more motivated,â€™ he says.</p>
<p>Thereâ€™s little doubt that you will benefit from reading more books. People who read literary fiction in particular tend to be better at reading othersâ€™ <a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233378" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">emotions</a> and have greater <a href="https://psycnet.apa.org/fulltext/2020-15352-001.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">moral sensitivity</a>, possibly due to their <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-21762-4_13" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">simulation</a> of the lives of complex characters; and reading nonfiction will increase your knowledge and broaden your mind. In fact, reading books is considered a cognitive â€˜<a href="https://www.oatext.com/Cognitive-reserve-the-evolution-of-the-conceptual-framework.php#gsc.tab=0" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener">reserve building</a>â€™ activity that could help to protect you from Alzheimerâ€™s and related illnesses. However, also relevant here is the distinction between intrinsic motivation, which means you find reward in doing something for its own sake, and extrinsic motivation, which is when youâ€™re motivated by the promise of some kind of external pay-off. Note that, especially when starting out, you are more likely to prevail if you choose books to read that are inherently enjoyable for you, be that because you find them entertaining, calming, moving or intellectually stimulating and fascinating. This might require some trial and error until you find a genre and/or author that matches your tastes and priorities.</p>
<p>James Clear, the author of <a href="https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/111/1112146/atomic-habits/9781847941831.html" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener"><em>Atomic Habits</em></a> (2018), agrees. He recalls the approach of the Indian-American entrepreneur and investor Naval Ravikant:</p>
<blockquote>[Ravikant] says something along the lines of â€˜Read whatever the hell you want to read in the beginningâ€™ because the real thing that youâ€™re focused on is building the habit of reading, not necessarily the knowledge. Like if you just want to read romance novels. Awesome. Read that. If you just want to read fantasy, read that. Read whatever helps you fall in love with the act of being a reader or the habit of reading. And once you fall in love with the habit, then itâ€™s easy â€¦ Now youâ€™ve got a lot of options because itâ€™s part of your life.</blockquote>
<p>A related point is giving yourself permission to quit books that youâ€™re not enjoying. â€˜I had spent so many years picking up books that people had told me I â€œshouldâ€� read,â€™ says Reynolds. â€˜I diligently ploughed my way through literature prize longlists and shortlists. I would try to push on until the end of every one, even when I really didnâ€™t enjoy them. Then one day, I just put a book down I didnâ€™t love, and picked up another one which I did. It was then the idea for my Reading Selfishly blog and ethos was born.â€™</p>
<p>â€˜A lot of people feel locked in from the start,â€™ adds Clear. â€˜But the little phrase I try to keep in mind is <em>start more books, quit most of them, read the great ones twice</em>. I think that a lot of readers would be well-served if they did that.â€™</p>
<p>A next preliminary step is to look at your surroundings. How easy is it for you to grab a book â€“ paper or digital â€“ and start reading? â€˜The more frictionless [a habit] is, the easier it is to pick it up,â€™ says Clear. He recommends making changes to your digital and physical environments so that reading is easy and effortless â€“ including making reading apps especially prominent on your phone, and placing books in the physical places that you most often frequent. â€˜Being around books makes it very easy to pick them up and check them out. If you want something to be a big part of your life, make it a big part of your environment.â€™ Of course, if you are prone to <em>tsundoku</em>, this is a lifestyle tip that you have already mastered â€“ just try to remember to actually pick up those books.</p>
<p>A final preliminary step is to consider your goals. Clear recommends having modest goals for your new reading habit initially. If you try to achieve too much, too quickly, youâ€™re more likely to fail. â€˜I would say giving yourself the permission to just read one page per day or something like that,â€™ he says. Clear calls this â€˜the two-minute ruleâ€™. By getting into the routine of just â€˜showing upâ€™, even for just 120 seconds, the new activity is more likely to become an entrenched part of your daily routine. â€˜There is a deep truth about habits in general that people overlook,â€™ Clear says, â€˜which is a habit must be established before it can be improved<em>.</em>â€™</p>
<p>Now, having laid the foundations for your new reading habit, then according to Gardnerâ€™s model, the next stage involves creating new â€˜action associationsâ€™, which in the context of …</p></div></div></section></div></div>

Building a back-end app that manages teraflops of operations is an impressive engineering feat. But the feedback cycle when developing a desktop app is much shorter. That makes it, at least for me, much more motivating. This is even truer for side-projects. In this focus, I’d like to assert the state of JVM desktop frameworks.</p> <p>This first post is an introduction, framing the general background, and browsing through the frameworks I’ve encountered.</p> <div> <h2 id="background">Background</h2> <div> <p>Let’s face reality: in the fight of web apps vs. desktop apps, the former ones have won. It’s just less expensive to deploy them. That’s the reason people started to push for them, though the HTML-JavaScript-CSS combo offered a poorer alternative at the time.</p> <p>Web apps are now ubiquitous: in the past, I’ve even developed web apps for less than 5 users. Whether it was worth it or not, I leave it up to you.</p> <p>The victory of web apps pushed desktop apps toward obsolescence. Most of those that escape this fate leverage the <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Electron framework</a> <em>e.g.</em> Slack, VS Code, Postman, etc. JavaScript and Electron have several benefits:</p> <ol><li><span>A lot of developers know JavaScript. A JS-based framework makes smart use of this available workforce.</span></li><li><span>JavaScript doesn’t require any platform. Such applications are self-contained.</span></li><li><span>Electron is available as Open Source, under the MIT License, and managed by the OpenJS Foundation.</span></li></ol> <p>On the flip side, Electron is notoriously infamous for being resource-hungry.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="awt-and-swing">AWT and Swing</h2> <div> <p>The Abstract Windowing Toolkit was the graphics framework originally included in the JDK. <abbr title="Abstract Windowing Toolkit">AWT</abbr> relies on native resources of the operating system: AWT components are <em>heavy-weight</em>. Java 1.2 introduced Swing, an alternative to AWT, which offered <em>lightweight</em> components.</p> <p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/state-jvm-desktop-frameworks/swing.jpg" alt="200" width="221" height="Duke Swing"></span></p> <p>I started learning Java two decades ago and tried to learn Swing as well. But at the time, I didn’t work on any desktop app projects during my job. I also didn’t have time for any personal side-project. Yet, my interest was there.</p> <p>Swing offers a way to customize the Look-And-Feel of an app. There a default <abbr title="Look-And-Feel">LAF</abbr>, but an Operating System LAF is also available. Because Swing draws components by itself, even with the latter, components always look a bit different from the OS native ones. IntelliJ IDEA is a famous example of a successful Java application.</p> <p>Over the years, I kept trying Swing, but also other available options.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="swt">SWT</h2> <div> <p>The first such option was actually a hack of the popular Eclipse <abbr title="Integrated Development Environment">IDE</abbr>. Eclipse used neither AWT nor Swing. Developers had designed their graphical framework, the Standard Widget Toolkit. <abbr title="Standard Widget Toolkit">SWT</abbr> relied on native libraries.</p> <p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/state-jvm-desktop-frameworks/eclipse_builton.svg" alt="Eclipse logo" width="500"></span></p> <p>Cunning developers utilized the fact that Eclipse was Open Source to build their applications on top of it. After a while, the Eclipse project recognized it formally. They worked to improve the API, the documentation, the libraries and called it the Rich Client Platform.</p> <p>Over the years, I played a couple of times with SWT. I liked the way it used the native OS components a lot. That gave a real native feeling. One didn’t know a Java application was underneath.</p> <p>Eclipse also released a higher-level abstraction on top of SWT called JFace. Don’t confuse it with <abbr title="Java Server Faces">JSF</abbr>, it’s not related at all.</p> <p>The biggest issue with SWT was that the API was unstable. It had started as an internal framework, and it showed. Upgrading to a new minor version broke my code.</p> <p>Another issue that affected me less comes from the dependency on OS components. Java is designed to be cross-platform: hence, each Java runtime comes with its component bindings for the OS it’s installed on. SWT also has bindings for each OS, but on the JAR level. Hence, applications need to bundle a specific JAR for each OS it needs to be deployed to.</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="flex">Flex</h2> <div> <p>One must remember the context 15 years ago. HTML 5 was still a W3C draft. Browsers were different in their display of HTML. Sometimes, they also had different interpretations of JavaScript. Creating a true cross-browser application was a large time investment.</p> <p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/state-jvm-desktop-frameworks/adobe-flex-logo.svg" alt="Adobe Flex logo" width="280" height="280"></span></p> <p>In 2004, Macromedia released Flex, a framework able to create Flash applications from:</p> <ol><li><span>GUI definitions defined in XML, using a specific FXML schema</span></li><li><span>Behavior coded in ActionScript</span></li></ol> <p>The sole requirement was for the browser to have the Flash plugin. 90% of the browsers had it installed at that time!</p> <p>The widgets offered a much better experience than their HTML equivalents. For example, filtering in a combo-box had been available on every heavy client framework for ages. Filtering was not impossible, but a mess with the HTML and JavaScript. Flex was able to make it easy again.</p> <p>It also allowed developers to implement applications that looked acceptable even with poor front-end skills. Plus, the look-and-feel was consistent across all browsers. To me, this was more than an alternative to the crummy JavaScript spaghetti code: I believed Flex was <strong>the</strong> way to build applications.</p> <p>Then came the <em>iPhone</em>. It drastically changed the way people used the Web, from desktops to mobiles. Now, the problem was that Flash used a lot of energy (and to be honest, this was also a big security risk). Steve Jobs banned Flash from iPhones to save on energy. With the rise of mobiles, this made Flash less and less attractive for developers to use.</p> <p>In the end, Adobe, which had bought Macromedia in 2006, <a href="https://flex.apache.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave the technology</a> to the Apache foundation. I’m afraid this was the last step before the end: the latest release is from 2017, and the <a href="https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/flex-sdk/repo?p=flex-sdk.git;a=heads" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest commit</a> in the Git repository is 9 months old.</p> <p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/state-jvm-desktop-frameworks/apache-flex-logo.png" alt="Apache Flex logo" width="350" height="161"></span></p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="other-attempts">Other attempts</h2> <div> <p>The death of Flash, and the rise of HTML 5 and JavaScript, didn’t happen instantly. For a long time, there was no clear winner. During that period, choosing one over the other was the nightmare of architects.</p> <p>The <a href="https://www.openlaszlo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OpenLaszlo</a> Open Source framework tried to solve this cleverly. It provided a neutral model to develop applications. At build-time, one could choose Flex or HTML+JavaScript as the target.</p> <p>The end of Flash made OpenLaszlo irrelevant.</p> <p>I’m aware of two other initiatives:</p> <ul><li><span>Mozilla proposed XUL, a way to define graphical components</span></li><li><span>Microsoft came up with Silverlight, a Flex competitor</span></li></ul> <p>Both are now obsolete.</p> <p><span><img src="https://blog.frankel.ch/assets/resources/state-jvm-desktop-frameworks/javafx-logo.jpg" alt="JavaFX logo" width="350" height="146"></span></p> <p>JavaFX also deserves a mention. The 1.0 version was released in 2008, around the time Flex was already well established. This was not even comparable. Interestingly enough, Oracle continued the development effort: after the acquisition of Sun in 2010, it released 2.0 in 2011.</p> <p>My understanding is that JavaFX is not part of the JDK as of now. The Gluon company seems to be leading its development effort. It makes JavaFX available as a standard library JAR, published on Maven Central (and as a regular download).</p> </div> </div> <div> <h2 id="deploying-java-desktop-apps">Deploying Java desktop apps</h2> <div> <p>As I already mentioned, the Web previously provided a poor User Experience compared to thick clients. Yet, it won the battle. I believe the reason is two-fold:</p> <ol><li><span>Thick clients are either dedicated to a specific OS, or require a platform <em>e.g.</em> a <abbr title="JRE">Java Runtime Environment</abbr>.</span></li><li><span>Deployment of an app on a single server (or even a cluster of them) is easier and less time-expensive than on each user computer</span></li></ol> <p>For <em>internal</em> users, neither argument holds. Computers inside a company are centrally managed (or should be) by a sysadmin team. Thus, one can install any software remotely via the network. Enterprises have been using such dedicated software for ages.</p> <p>In the Java world, a couple of solutions were specifically designed for that.</p> <p>Java Web Start was the solution offered by Sun, as part of the Java platform. With <abbr title="Java Web Start">JWS</abbr>, one creates an external deployment descriptor using the JNLP format. The descriptor defines: the class to launch, optional dependencies, JVM arguments, etc.</p> <p>The descriptor file is then made publicly accessible, for example, hosted on a web server. JWS can parse it, download the required dependencies, and launch the JVM accordingly.</p> <p>JARs can be automatically updated via JWS. JWS can download only the difference between the installed JAR and the to-be-downloaded JAR. Even better, if the patch has a bigger size than the JAR, it downloads the latter.</p> <p>If the application uses a shared database, evolving the schema can be an issue. For example, how to synchronize updates between the different clients and the database? The development team can design the application, so it cannot run unless it’s above a specific version.</p> <p>Oracle deprecated JWS in Java 9 and removed it from Java 11 distributions.

                    <h2>CATL takes the lead in 2019, BYD makes first appearance among top five</h2>
<p>In 2019, over 14,400 tonnes of cobalt were deployed globally in batteries of newly sold passenger battery electric vehicles (“BEVs”), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (“PHEVs”) and hybrid electric vehicles (“HEVs”), an increase of 34% over the year prior, according to data from Adamas Intelligence’s <a href="https://www.adamasintel.com/subscription/ev-battery-battery-metals-tracker/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EV Battery Capacity and Battery Metals Tracker</a> (subscribe or schedule a live demonstration).</p>
<p>CATL took the lead in 2019 with a 21% global market share by cobalt deployed, followed closely by last year’s leaders LG Chem and Panasonic with 20% and 17%, respectively. Rounding off the top five were BYD and Samsung SDI with market shares of 11% and 9%, respectively.</p>
<p>Overall, the aforementioned five cell suppliers were collectively responsible for 78% of all cobalt deployed globally in passenger vehicle batteries in 2019, up from 69% occupied by the top five in 2018.</p>

<p>I’ve spent years obsessed with the wrong thing. I’ve let myself down repeatedly trying to build projects, being obsessed with the idea of a product and building something of my own, but instead just wasting time on stuff that doesn’t matter.</p>

<h2 id="the-fun-bit">The Fun Bit</h2>

<p>The excitement of first imagining the problem you are solving, fantasizing about the product solving X and Y, building a real company, being free. You write down what you are going to fix, and how you are going to do it.</p>

<p>You figure out the target market, basic features required for an MVP. Soon you’re on to brand names, logos, colour palettes.</p>

<p>You tell your partner. Friends. You’re sure this is it this time. You can realize all you’ve worked for, and deliver real value to end users.</p>

<h2 id="reality-hits">Reality Hits</h2>

<p>Next you’re imagining what the tech stack looks like. You’ve recently worked with, or read about, Kubernetes, React, Redux, Containers, Serverless. Must add these in, you know, because we’re not going to scale without any of these things. I don’t enjoy front-end development, anyway, so this means I can outsource the work, too! Full stack Javascript is a must in 2021.</p>

<p>Now you’re spending all your time researching technology, how do I know how to correctly deploy my containerized app and be sure it auto scales? I have no idea how to do this, so I better learn. Two weeks later, you know a little more about Kubernetes and Horizontal Pod Autoscalers after watching 10 hours of DevOps conference videos. Code written? Zero.</p>

<p>You’re frozen. Instead of building a product you’re building anxiety. Anxiety over delivering this idea correctly in the new technologies you’ve chosen. Anxiety over understanding how it will all play out. You can’t work on features, because you must get the foundations right first.</p>

<h2 id="fin">Fin</h2>

<p>You’re defeated. The passion you had for this idea is gone. You spent what little you had left learning how to maintain a Redux store with Typescript. Generics were the last straw.</p>

<p>Two weeks later, someone delivered your idea. In Rails. On Heroku. No SPA. Done.</p>

<p>Then your next idea comes along. Repeat.</p>

<p data-pos="4">Jack Ma, the 56-year-old billionaire founder of Alibaba and Ant Group, <a target="_blank" href="https://au.finance.yahoo.com/news/jack-ma-missing-232138645.html" rel="nofollow">hasn't been seen publicly in more than two months</a>, Jessica Yun reported for Yahoo Finance on Sunday.</p>
<p data-pos="6">Ma has been in the spotlight recently as China has cracked down on his business empire. In late December, Chinese regulators <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-antitrust-jack-ma-ant-group-beijing-regulators-2020-12" rel="nofollow">launched an antitrust investigation into Alibaba</a>, the country's biggest e-commerce company, sometimes referred to as "the Amazon of China." And in November, China introduced regulations that halted what would have been <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-offered-parts-ant-group-to-china-2020-12" rel="nofollow">a massive initial public offering for Ant Group</a>, Ma's fintech company.</p><p>
The new rules came weeks after Ma <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/jack-ma-financial-regulations-ant-group-alibaba-2020-10" rel="nofollow">criticized China's financial regulatory system</a> at a conference in Shanghai. Ma reportedly dismissed the global financial regulations used by China as "an old people's club" and said that "we can't use yesterday's methods to regulate the future."</p><p>
Blair Silverberg, the CEO of the debt-financing startup Capital, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/what-happened-ant-group-ipo-jack-ma-alipay-2020-11" rel="nofollow">told Business Insider's Katie Canales in November</a> that the regulations were introduced "so the government can assert its supremacy over </p><keyword keytype="person" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="Jack-Ma" actualkeyword="Jack Ma">Jack Ma</keyword><p>."
</p><p data-pos="12">In November, Ma was replaced as a judge on the African talent show he founded, "Africa's Business Heroes," <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ft.com/content/a91dfeae-da1e-4348-8212-bbfbe94d93bd" rel="nofollow">the Financial Times reported</a>. The talent show did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment, but an Alibaba representative said Ma could no longer be on the judging panel for the show's finale, which was filmed in November but has not yet been released," due to a scheduling conflict."</p><p>
"We do not have anything to add beyond that," the representative said in response to questions about Ma's whereabouts.</p><p><span>Advertisement</span></p><figure><div></div></figure><hr>
<p data-pos="16">Ma <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-jack-ma-stepping-down-successor-may-face-challenges-2019-9" rel="nofollow">stepped down as Alibaba's chairman</a> in 2019.</p>

Until recently, Ma was <a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/alibaba-antitrust-jack-ma-ant-group-beijing-regulators-2020-12" rel="nofollow">China's richest man</a>, with a fortune of more than $60 billion. But Ma's net worth has <a target="_blank" href="https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/jack-ma-net-worth-rich-list-falls-china-alibaba-ant-2020-12-1029925654" rel="nofollow">taken a $12 billion hit</a> over the past two months as China has tightened the rules for the fintech industry. Ma is now worth $50.6 billion, making him the fourth-richest person in China, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/billionaires/?sref=BLKWHazc" rel="nofollow">according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index</a>.
As speculation about Ma's whereabouts spread, a prediction about Ma from another billionaire Chinese businessman recirculated on social media.</p>
<p data-pos="24">In <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cwXifDaCjE&amp;t=702s%3Futm_source%3DOrganic&amp;utm_medium=Twitter&amp;utm_campaign=43718_YTEDGE_KA_SMT_RV_W1_TSNAP_RV_W1_TSNAP" rel="nofollow">a video interview in August 2019</a>, Guo Wengui, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/10/magazine/the-mystery-of-the-exiled-billionaire-whistleblower.html" rel="nofollow">who fled China as a fugitive in 2014</a> and has described himself as a whistleblower exposing corruption in the country, said Ma would likely end up in jail or dead in the next year because China wanted to "take back" Ma's lucrative Ant Group.</p>
<p data-pos="26">Last week, the Chinese government ordered Ant Group, which owns Alipay, China's largest digital-payment platform, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/dec/28/china-orders-alibaba-founder-jack-ma-break-up-fintech-ant" rel="nofollow">to scale back its operations</a> after expressing concerns that its corporate governance was "not sound."</p><p>
A representative for Ant Group did not immediately respond to Business Insider's request for comment for this story.</p>

            <section>
                <div>
                    <p>Recently I've been working on Bevy, a self hosted alternative to Popcorn Time that doubles as an alternative to Sonarr/Radarr (torrent grabbing). I recently added a new system for searching for and grabbing releases which I thought was a huge improvement over existing systems. </p><figure><a href="https://github.com/diericx/bevy"><div><p>diericx/bevy</p><p>Self hosted popcorn time alternative software for grabbing, streaming and seeding torrents - diericx/bevy</p><p><img src="https://github.githubassets.com/favicons/favicon.svg"><span>GitHub</span></p></div><p><img src="https://avatars2.githubusercontent.com/u/17539534?s=400&amp;v=4"></p></a></figure><p>I've been using the Ombi+Sonarr+Radarr+Plex stack on my media server for a while and I've been left a bit dissatisfied (with everything except Plex, which is awesome). I hate that I have to have a completely different service setup for letting other people request media (Ombi). </p><p>I can solve these all in time, but here's my main gripe: <strong>I have great internet, but I am still bothered by having to go request a movie, wait 5-20 minutes for a torrent to download before I can start streaming it and then have to go to another platform to stream it. </strong></p><p>Popcorn Time (PT) solves this streaming-while-downloading problem, but I don't like the leech-only ethos behind the app (PT leeches from public trackers and drops the file as soon as it can). This prohibits us from being able to use private trackers with PT which require seeding for x amount of time or a specific ratio. </p><p>I want the ability to download torrents from private trackers and let them seed until a specific condition is met, thus allowing the use of private trackers. This is also a more sustainable way to use torrents!</p><p>This stream-while-downloading problem isn't huge, but it totally bothers me and is something that I can solve <em>right now</em>.</p><p>Bevy aims to solve all these problems by providing a highly customizable grabbing system, streaming-will-downloading and live transcoding (which means watching and chrome casting from the app works!). Currently it seeds forever (or until manually removed), but I will be adding automated removal soon.</p><h2 id="my-gripes-with-the-grabbing-system-in-sonarr-and-radarr">My gripes with the grabbing system in Sonarr and Radarr</h2><p>This post is focusing on the torrent grabbing system for Bevy, so I'd like to detail my gripes with the way Sonarr and Radarr handle this (my inspiration).</p><p>Sonarr and Radarr are <em>ok </em>for listening to RSS feeds and grabbing things as they come out, but I find them very opaque and annoying for grabbing old content. I'm often left with missing content and have to manually grab the movies and shows because they were right oustide of some setting (like file size). </p><p>They both work by first having the user set up patterns for detecting a quality from a torrent name which are connected to file size limits. When a list of torrents are found, they are sorted into qualities via name, anything outside the size limits is removed, then sorted by quality. It then goes down and attempts to add them based on these scores.</p><p>I'm not entirely sure how this scoring works, and I'm never confident I really know what it will do when it begins searching for a release. <strong>I don't feel like I have a lot of control over this process</strong>. This often leads me to scrolling through debug logs trying to understand what it's doing so I can update my settings accordingly... very annoying.</p><p>In Bevy, each release has a few attributes (more can be added easily if requested) that can be used in an expression to calculate a score: <strong>seeder count</strong>, <strong>size </strong>and <strong>quality</strong>.</p><p><em>Note: You specify qualities in a config and each one has a regex pattern that it tries to match with torrent names. In these equations you are getting the index of that matching quality, higher the value the higher the quality.</em></p><p>To utilize these, you set up qualities which work very similar to the method I described above for Sonarr and Radarr. Each quality has a pattern that it matches on the torrent name, some hard limits, and more importantly <strong>scoring expressions</strong>.</p><p>Here's an example config.</p><figure><pre><code>[torrent_fetcher]
quality_score_expr = "quality * 0.35"

	[[torrent_fetcher.qualities]]
	regex = "720"
	seeder_score_expr = "1 / (1 + e**(-0.2*seeders+5))"
	size_score_expr = "1 / ( 10**(-16) * (sizeMB-15000)**4 + 1)"</code></pre><figcaption>config.toml</figcaption></figure><p>Here we've setup a quality scoring expression for the fetcher to score each quality, and the quality has a <code>regex</code> field specifying the pattern to match, and a <code>seeder_score_expr</code> and <code>size_score_expr</code> for scoring seeder counts and size. </p><p>Each quality specifies it's own expressions for seeder count and score so you can, for example, optimize more tightly for higher seeders on larger files or optimize for larger files for higher qualities.</p><p>You have complete freedom when working on these expressions. You can decide your range for each one which gives you ultimate freedom on deciding how you want to prioritize torrents. Below are my example expressions visualized. They are by no means perfect, but they get the job done. </p><figure><img src="https://zacholland.net/content/images/2021/01/desmos-graph-1--1.png"></figure><p><strong>I try to keep each expression's output in the range of [0,1] so a perfect torrent will have a score of 3</strong>. Looking at them from left to right, the ideal torrents for me are 15GB files (15000 MB), generally as many seeders as possible but around 20 is fine (benefit of anything higher decreases exponentially), and higher qualities get a point each.</p><p>Here's what this looks like in the Bevy dashboard. Note that I only have one quality here (720) so there is no relevant quality score.</p><figure><img src="https://zacholland.net/content/images/2021/01/BevyManSearch2.PNG"></figure><p>These are sorted by Total Score, and as you can see the top result here is a torrent that is 8GB, has 30 seeders and is 720p. Nice! It could be better, but I've only added one tracker for testing and these functions aren't exactly refined yet.</p><p>All in all, I think this is a much better system than we had before! It's much easier to debug and there is so much more control... but there is also a lot of room for improvement.</p><p>I'll be actively working on this project, so message me or open an issue on Github if you have any suggestions! </p>

        </div>
      </header>

      <div>
        
        
<p>When we configure our programs, we usually have three ways to do it: config files, cli flags and environment variables. While all of these three options are a solid way to go, with CI/CD environments you are usually instructed to use environment variables, e.g. envvars.</p>
<p>If we look at the golang’s os package <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/os">documentation</a>, we can see that it offers multiple ways to read envvars:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Environ</code> which gives you raw list of strings in form of “key=value” which you can parse your self</li>
<li><code>Getenv</code> which gives you the envvar value if it exists, or an empty string</li>
<li><code>LookupEnv</code> which is similar to <code>Getenv</code>, but also returns you a boolean telling you if the variable exists or not</li>
</ul>
<p>With these, reading the environment variables is easy. Without any further planning, we can write some code like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> main() {
	connstr := fmt.Sprintf(<span>"user='%s' password='%s' dbname='%s' host='%s' port='%s'"</span>,
		os.Getenv(<span>"DBUSER"</span>),
		os.Getenv(<span>"DBPASS"</span>),
		os.Getenv(<span>"DBNAME"</span>),
		os.Getenv(<span>"DBHOST"</span>),
		os.Getenv(<span>"DBPORT"</span>),
	)

	fmt.Printf(<span>"%q\n"</span>, connstr)
}
</code></pre></div><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ DBUSER=foo DBPASS=bar DBNAME=mydb DBHOST=localhost DBPORT=5432 go run main.go
<span>"user='foo' password='bar' dbname='mydb' host='localhost' port='5432'"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>All good so far, right? Well, if you remember to set all the variables all the time, then yes. What happens if we run the program without setting any variables?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash">$ go run main.go
<span>"user='' password='' dbname='' host='' port=''"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Eh, doesn’t look so promising, does it? And what happens when your environment variable count keeps growing?
Its likely that you need options for connecting to a database, some caching system, some external APIs and maybe even feature flags. Littering those all over the place without having any up-to-date list can be PITA to maintain. Especially if we check add checks for the default values everywhere too.</p>

<p>We have couple of problems that we need to solve:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to keep track of the environment variables that our program needs?</li>
<li>How the set (and keep track of) the default values of those variables?</li>
</ul>
<p>That pretty much sums up to a key-value list. We can easily use go’s map type:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>var</span> defaultEnvv = <span>map</span>[<span>string</span>]<span>string</span>{
	<span>"DBHOST"</span>: <span>"localhost"</span>,
	<span>"DBPORT"</span>: <span>"5432"</span>,
	<span>"DBUSER"</span>: <span>"foo"</span>,
	<span>"DBPASS"</span>: <span>"bar"</span>,
	<span>"DBNAME"</span>: <span>"mydb"</span>,
}
</code></pre></div><p>Here our environment variables are the keys on the map, and the values are their defaults. For reading the values from the environment, we can do something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>func</span> ReadEnv(defaults <span>map</span>[<span>string</span>]<span>string</span>) <span>map</span>[<span>string</span>]<span>string</span> {
	envv := make(<span>map</span>[<span>string</span>]<span>string</span>)

	<span>for</span> k, v := <span>range</span> defaults {
		envv[k] = v

		<span>if</span> l, ok := os.LookupEnv(k); ok {
			envv[k] = l
		}
	}

	<span>return</span> envv
}
</code></pre></div><p>Pretty simple, right? If the then adjust our earlier code to use this new <code>ReadEnv</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>func</span> main() {
	envv := ReadEnv(defaultEnvv)
	connstr := fmt.Sprintf(<span>"user='%s' password='%s' dbname='%s' host='%s' port='%s'"</span>,
		envv[<span>"DBUSER"</span>],
		envv[<span>"DBPASS"</span>],
		envv[<span>"DBNAME"</span>],
		envv[<span>"DBHOST"</span>],
		envv[<span>"DBPORT"</span>],
	)

	fmt.Printf(<span>"%q\n"</span>, connstr)
}
</code></pre></div><p>We can run the program with default values, or set then manually:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span># No values</span>
$ go run main.go
<span>"user='foo' password='bar' dbname='mydb' host='localhost' port='5432'"</span>
<span># With values</span>
$ DBUSER=my-production-user DBPASSWORD=<span>"VERYSECRET"</span> go run main.go
<span>"user='my-production-user' password='bar' dbname='mydb' host='localhost' port='5432'"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Cool, we solved those two problems! If you looks closely, you’ll notice that we’re still littering our environment variable usage as strings all over the place. But in my projects this has been enough. This is mainly because of these two things:</p>
<ul>
<li>All our environment variable access is in the <code>main.go</code> file</li>
<li>That same file has list of the environment variables available for the whole program on top of the <code>main.go</code> file (if we stick with the <code>ReadEnv</code> function)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is the code snippet for reading envvars that I currently carry with me to my projects:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>type</span> Envv <span>map</span>[<span>string</span>]<span>string</span>

<span>func</span> ReadEnv(defaults Envv) Envv {
	envv := make(<span>map</span>[<span>string</span>]<span>string</span>)

	<span>for</span> k, v := <span>range</span> defaults {
		envv[k] = v

		<span>if</span> l, ok := os.LookupEnv(k); ok {
			envv[k] = l
		}
	}

	<span>return</span> envv
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>At some point I would like to play with this idea a bit more, and do something like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="golang"><span>type</span> Enviroment <span>struct</span> {
	DBHost <span>string</span> <span>`env:"DBHOST,localhost"`</span>
	DBPort <span>string</span> <span>`env:"DBPORT,5432"`</span>
	...

	CookieSecret <span>string</span> <span>`env:"COOKIE_SECRET,,required"`</span>
}
</code></pre></div><p>Where the idea is to list the environment variables as struct fields, so the compiler watches after us if we mistype something or remove some field. And if you look closely, the <code>CookieSecret</code> field doesn’t have default value and is marked as <code>required</code>. Our <code>ReadEnv</code> function would then return an error if <code>COOKIE_SECRET</code> isn’t set.</p>
<p>There probably is a library that handles all of this and much more out-of-the-box, but my 8 lines long function has served me well so far.</p>

      </div>

<p>So you work with an idiot. I know you do, because everyone does. There’s always an idiot. You probably have one in mind right now.</p>



<p>Most people react by <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bozo_bit#Dismissing_a_person_as_not_worth_listening_to">flipping the bozo bit</a></em> on the idiot. They’ll mentally set the “this person is an idiot” switch to <strong>ON</strong>, and fall into permanent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_hominem">ad hominem</a> mode.</p>



<p>From then on, they’ll disregard <a href="https://critter.blog/2018/04/11/idiotic-feelings-per-day-ifps/">anything the idiot says or does</a>. They’ll assume the idiot has nothing of value to contribute, and that paying attention to the idiot will be a waste of everyone’s time. So they’ll do the bare minimum of indulging the idiot required to not look like a jerk, and nothing more.</p>



<p>That’s one option. In the words of Seth Godin, that’s the <a href="https://seths.blog/2011/05/hard-work-vs-long-work/"><em>long work</em></a> option. You’re never finished. You just keep grinding away at it forever and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/19/do-you-feel-like-youve-grown-more-in-the-last-few-years-than-you-will-in-the-next-few-years/">nothing ever improves</a>.</p>



<p>And remember,<a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/02/we-become-what-we-are-told-we-are/"> we become what we are told we are</a>. Treat someone like an idiot and they’ll give an Oscar-worthy performance of that role.</p>



<p>The other option is to practice some <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/26/extreme-ownership-book-notes/">extreme ownership</a>. Say it with me: “<em>this, like everything, is my fault</em>.” That’s the <em><a href="https://seths.blog/2011/05/hard-work-vs-long-work/">hard work</a></em> option. It’s the scary one, but it <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/06/all-self-help-boils-down-to-choose-long-term-over-short-term/">may fix the problem</a> once and for all.</p>



<p>So, extreme ownership: how is this <em>your</em> fault? What are <em>you</em> doing wrong that’s making them into the idiot? What aren’t you giving them that they need to succeed? What are their <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/22/blind-spots-and-bright-spots/">strengths</a>, and why aren’t you using them? And if you can’t find their strengths, you aren’t looking hard enough. </p>



<p>Is the problem that they’re dumb? Then maybe they <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/11/good-feedback-is-pokey/">need more support</a>, or maybe they’re in the wrong seat. <strong><a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/13/clear-is-kind-unclear-is-unkind/">Talk to them about it</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Is the problem that they <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/28/the-all-powerful-bad-apple/">have a bad attitude</a>? Then maybe they need <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/26/5-second-feedback/">some feedback</a>, or maybe they are lashing out because of <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/24/jobs-to-be-done-is-a-terrible-name/">an underlying issue</a>. <strong>Talk to them about it.</strong></p>



<p>Is the problem that they keep getting <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/15/dont-comment-your-code-refactor-it/">distracted by low value work</a>? Then maybe they are passive aggressively disagreeing with <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/20/plan-the-sprint-not-the-project/">priorities</a>, or they aren’t being <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/01/28/grinders-vs-thinkers/">used wisely</a>. <strong>Talk to them about it.</strong></p>



<p>As <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/02/we-become-what-we-are-told-we-are/">a genius once said</a>: <em>treat everyone like the person you want them to be, rather than the person you think they are</em>. Everyone has something to contribute. Instead of flipping the bozo bit on the idiot, <strong>talk to them about it</strong> (and <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/01/never-underestimate-peoples-ability-to-not-hear-you/">make sure they hear you</a>). </p>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>In the beginning of <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103064/">Terminator 2: Judgement Day</a>, John Connor uses a laptop to crack the PIN of a stolen debit card.</p>



<p>I don’t think I saw Terminator 2 in the theater. I probably watched it years later on LaserDisc but the scene left quite an impression on me. I had a similar reaction to the war dialer in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0086567/">WarGames</a> and the black box in <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0105435/">Sneakers</a>.</p>

<figure>

    <figcaption>Black Box in Sneakers (1992)</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Anyways, I was thinking about that scene from Terminator 2 recently which led me to googling, “What’s that laptop in Terminator 2?”</p>

<p>It’s an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_Portfolio">Atari Portfolio</a>, the world’s first palmtop computer. It was released in June 1989.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/portfolio.png" alt="Atari Portfolio"></p>

<p>It had a monochrome LCD with 240x64 pixels or 40 characters x 8 lines and ran off 3 AA batteries.</p>

<p>The next thing I wondered was, “How difficult would it be to write that program?” Not a program that actually cracks PIN numbers from debit cards, I don’t think you can actually do that with a serial cable and some aluminum foil wrapped around a debit card, but a program that can simulate the output of the palmtop in that scene.</p>

<p>Let’s gather some product requirements!</p>

<p>If we watch the video again, the first thing that happens is that it displays a banner for the program.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/pinip.jpg" alt="banner"></p>

<p>The image is clear enough that you can copy the banner easily.</p>

<div><div><pre><code>PPPPP   IIIIIII   N    N
P   PP     I      NN   N IDENTIFICATION
P   PP     I      N N  N
PPPPP      I      N  N N   PROGRAM
P          I      N   NN
P       IIIIIII   N    N

Strike a key when ready ...
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At this point, John hits Enter and the numbers start scrolling. If we look a few frames in:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/firstline.jpg" alt="first line"></p>

<p>We can see that the first line of numbers is:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>12345678901234567890123457890123456780
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>One might assume that this is just the digits 1 through 0 repeated four times, but upon closer look, it’s only 38 digits long. In the third set, the number 6 is omitted, and the last set, the number 9 is omitted.</p>

<p>The way the numbers decrease isn’t obvious either, but it seems like it prints about 5 lines at a certain length before decreasing the length by 1, but after the next set it decreases the length by 2 and then alternates back and forth until it identifies the 4-digit PIN code and dumps him back to a prompt.</p>

<p>Well, that seems pretty straightforward. I’ve been trying to get better at Python so here’s a script I wrote in Python 3:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#!/usr/bin/env python3
</span><span>import</span> <span>time</span>
<span>import</span> <span>random</span>

<p>The script runs really quickly so I added a delay between lines so that you can see the same progression as in the clip. I’m sure there are other optimizations that can be made, but if I were administering this as a bad coding challenge for a tech interview, I’d pass myself.</p>

<p>Using Google Image Search, I found a site selling OEM plastic bezels for the Atari Portfolio which had this nice graphic of the front of the screen:</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/bezel.jpg" alt="screen bezel"></p>

<p>After playing around with <a href="https://github.com/nbedos/termtosvg">termtosvg</a> a bit, in particular the <a href="https://github.com/nbedos/termtosvg/blob/develop/man/termtosvg-templates.md">SVG templates</a> feature, I managed to produce this crazy SVG:</p>

<p>Despite running <a href="https://html5zombo.com/">html5zombo.com</a> for over 10 years now, I’m not sure I really appreciated what SVGs were capable of until I built this one. They can embed images? CSS? Javascript? Any site that allows users to upload arbitrary SVGs and <a href="https://github.com/bertrandom/pinid">renders them</a> now has my utmost respect.</p>

<p>While I enjoyed making my little self-contained SVG, it bugged me that my Python code could never actually run on an Atari Portfolio. The Atari Portfolio runs “DIP Operating System 2.11” (DIP DOS) which is “mostly compatible” with MS-DOS.</p>

<p>In junior high, before anybody paid me to write software professionally, I used to write BBS software, mods, and door games in my spare time in a mix of Turbo Pascal and a scripting language called PCBoard Programming Language which was similar to BASIC. Based on my minimal research, if I could write this in Turbo Pascal and compile it, it’d probably run on an Atari Portfolio.</p>

<p>I haven’t written Turbo Pascal in about 25 years, but do you ever really forget?</p>

<p>I like a fork of DOSBox called <a href="https://dosbox-x.com/">DOSBox-X</a>, so I downloaded and installed the most recent SDL2 variant for OS X. Then I found a copy of Borland Turbo Pascal 7.0, which I’ll put <a href="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/tp7.zip">here</a> because it was kind of a pain to find.</p>

<p>You’ll find 4 files in that ZIP which are images of floppy disks. If you put them in a directory like <code>~/tp</code>, after you start DOSBox-X and mount a C Drive, you can mount them to the A Drive like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>imgmount a ~/tp/Disk01.img ~/tp/Disk02.img ~/tp/Disk03.img ~/tp/Disk04.img -floppy
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and then switch over to the A: drive and run INSTALL:</p>



<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_000.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_001.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_002.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_003.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p>At some point in the installation, you’ll have to change floppy disks, because it’s 1992.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_004.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p>You can do this by selecting <strong>Drive</strong> -&gt; <strong>A</strong> -&gt; <strong>Swap disk</strong> in DOSBox-X. It’ll go from Disk 1 to Disk 2. Then just keep doing that and pressing enter until you’ve installed all four disks.</p>

<p>After the installation is done, it’ll ask you to configure your <code>CONFIG.SYS</code> and <code>AUTOEXEC.BAT</code> because again, 1992.</p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/install_005.png" alt="turbo pascal install"></p>

<p>Neither of these are strictly necessary. DOSBox-X already sets the FILES higher than the recommendation and adding it to the path only really lets you run TURBO from anywhere. When it’s done, you can run:</p>



<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/turbo_000.png" alt="turbo pascal"></p>

<p><img src="https://bert.org/assets/posts/pinid/turbo_001.png" alt="turbo pascal"></p>

<p>I’d spent so much time looking at this IDE when I was a kid that it made me a bit nostalgic. But then I started porting my Python script to Pascal and that nostalgia faded quickly. I’d like to say that I wrote the whole thing in here but at a certain point I had to switch to VSCode and then copy the file back into the DOS directory. To the people that still run <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/wpdos/">WordPerfect for DOS</a>, I get it, but I also don’t get it.</p>

<p>Here’s the script I landed on after spending a lot of time on this <a href="https://wiki.freepascal.org/Basic_Pascal_Tutorial">Pascal tutorial</a>:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>program pinid;
uses crt;

var i: byte;
var pos: byte;
var lines: byte;
var length: byte;
var decrease: byte;
var delay_amount: integer;

begin
     randomize;

     delay_amount := 25;

     clrscr;

     writeln('PPPPP   IIIIIII   N    N');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P   PP     I      NN   N IDENTIFICATION');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P   PP     I      N N  N');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('PPPPP      I      N  N N   PROGRAM');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P          I      N   NN');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('P       IIIIIII   N    N');
     delay(delay_amount);
     writeln('');

     write('Strike a key when ready ...');
     readln;

     writeln('');
     writeln('');
     writeln('12345678901234567890123457890123456780');

     pos := 0;
     lines := 1;

     length := 38;
     decrease := 1;

     while true do
     begin
          for i:= 1 to length do 
               write(random(9));
          writeln('');
          delay(delay_amount);
          lines := lines + 1;
          if (lines = 5) then
          begin
               lines := 0;
               length := length - decrease;
               if (decrease = 1) then
                   decrease := 2
               else
                   decrease := 1;
          end;
          if (length &lt;= 4) then
               break;
     end;

     for i:= 1 to 10 do
     begin
          writeln('9003');
          delay(delay_amount);
     end;

     writeln('');
     writeln('PIN IDENTIFICATION NUMBER: 9003');
     writeln('');

end.
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Some quick explanations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Pascal has type declarations. A byte can be a number from 0-255.</li>
  <li>files start with <code>program</code> and the name of the program, presumably because all modules share the same namespace but the filename is irrelevant</li>
  <li>modules are imported with the word <code>uses</code>. <code>crt</code> is a module for manipulating the screen</li>
  <li>:= is the syntax for variable assignment, so you can compare with = and differentiate between the two.</li>
  <li>If blocks are longer than one line, you have to wrap them with <code>begin</code> and <code>end</code> instead of brackets or relying upon whitespace.</li>
  <li>If you don’t run <code>randomize</code> at the beginning of your script, hilariously it always seeds random numbers with the same seed and the output is the same.</li>
  <li>WRITE writes a string, WRITELN writes a string with a newline. READLN accepts input until a newline is received.</li>
</ul>

<p>Does it work? Here’s the program running in DOSBox-X:</p>



<p>In the spirit of owning less stuff, I’ve gone through the mental exercise of what it would take to make the rest of this a reality but will not follow through on any of it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Buy an Atari Portfolio on Ebay.</li>
  <li>Buy an <a href="http://www.best-electronics-ca.com/portfoli.htm">Atari Portfolio parallel interface and probably a new screen bezel</a> because it’s likely scratched.</li>
  <li>Find a parallel cable in my box of cables.</li>
  <li>Find a PC or laptop with a parallel port, install MS-DOS v6.22 on it.</li>
  <li>Download <a href="http://ftp.pigwa.net/stuff/mirror/www.umich.edu/%257Earchive/atari/Portfolio/Telecomm/index.html">FT.COM</a> and put it on the PC.</li>
  <li>Build the EXE in Dosbox-X and transfer it to the Atari Portfolio.</li>
  <li>Steal a debit card.</li>
  <li>Wrap part of the card in aluminum foil, buy an Atari Portfolio serial interface, run a cable to the card.</li>
  <li>Run the program.</li>
  <li>Easy money!</li>

<p>Well, 2020 is finally over and you’ll all agree that it’s been a bit of a challenge… But, despite all, and thanks to the strong commitment of both our fantastic team and the amazing OpenNebula Community, we’ve been able to deliver what we promised in our last <a href="https://opennebula.io/opennebula-2019-year-in-review/">Year in Review</a> post—a year full of wonderful developments for the OpenNebula project and its <a href="https://oneedge.io/">ONEedge</a> initiative! 🤓</p>



<p>Thanks to that collective effort, OpenNebula has consolidated its position as a <strong>powerful open source solution</strong> to build and manage Enterprise Clouds; one that combines virtualization and container technologies with multi-tenancy, automatic provision and elasticity. And all that to provide organizations with the tools they need for their <strong>digital transformation</strong> and for supporting the growing needs of their development teams and <strong>DevOps</strong> practices. So, congratulations everyone! 👏</p>







<h3>Welcome to the True Hybrid Cloud</h3>



<p>Apart from producing no less than four Hotfix Releases for version 5.10 “Boomerang”, there’s little doubt that the main event this year has been the release in June of our new version, the spectacular <a href="https://opennebula.io/firework/">OpenNebula 5.12 “Firework”</a> (codenamed after the beautiful <a href="https://opennebula.io/the-firework-nebula/">Firework Nebula</a>). We feel especially proud of this release, which followed our public announcement⁠ of <a href="https://opennebula.io/firecracker/">Firecracker</a> becoming a <strong>new hypervisor</strong> to be officially supported by OpenNebula. Firecracker is a new open source virtualization technology—widely used by <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> (AWS)<strong> </strong>as part of its Fargate and Lambda services—that is going to open up a whole new world of possibilities for OpenNebula users.</p>



<p>Now, thanks to the integration with both <strong>Firecracker and Docker Hub</strong>, OpenNebula has become a real alternative for <a href="https://opennebula.io/mastering-containers/">orchestrating application containers</a>! That is why OpenNebula 5.12 came as well with a<a href="https://opennebula.io/a-sneak-peek-into-oneflows-new-performance-improvements/"> fully redesigned OneFlow</a>, which has been expanded with<a href="https://opennebula.io/opennebula-flow-improvements-new-network-features/"> additional network features</a>. This powerful component of the OpenNebula stack, whose latest version shows an incredible improvement in performance, allows cloud admins to define and run complex services, like for example multi-tier applications based on <strong>containers that run as fast and secure Firecracker microVMs</strong> 😉</p>



<p>In 2020, and following the release of OpenNebula 5.12, we launched our<a href="https://opennebula.io/introducing-opennebula-enterprise-edition/"> new Enterprise Edition</a>, a more tested, hardened, and production-ready version of OpenNebula that incorporates additional bug fixes developed by OpenNebula Systems and software patches with minor enhancements, along with a series of <strong>Enterprise Tools</strong> to simplify upgrades and the maintenance of OpenNebula clouds in production environments 🎖️</p>



<p><a href="https://opennebula.io/introducing-onescape/">OneScape</a> is the name of the new enterprise extension that we’ve released this year, and its main objective is to simplify the <strong>maintenance, management and upgrade</strong> workflows for corporate users. It’s our way to say <em>thank you</em> to all those organizations supporting the project by purchasing an <a href="https://opennebula.io/subscriptions/">OpenNebula Subscription</a>. One of the tools that come with this new extension is called <em>onecfg</em>, a new command that is able to read all the changes and <a href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360048722992-How-to-Upgrade-OpenNebula-Enterprise-Edition">upgrade</a> the configuration files of your OpenNebula cloud all at once. Not bad, right? 😎</p>



<p>In July we also announced an additional development in our<a href="https://opennebula.io/new-enterprise-edition-lifecycle-with-lts-releases/"> enterprise product release cycle</a>: the introduction of new<strong> Long-Term Support </strong>versions to reduce the risk, expense, and disruption of software deployment. Starting with OpenNebula 5.12, the very first of them, LTS versions will be maintained and officially supported by OpenNebula Systems for a period of at least <strong>27 months</strong>.</p>



<p>Another major announcement in 2020 has been the release in December of our<a href="https://opennebula.io/new-architecture-for-true-hybrid-and-edge-computing/"> True Hybrid Cloud Architecture</a>, our new reference architecture composed of hybrid clusters that can run <strong>any workload</strong> (both virtualized and containerized), on <strong>any resource</strong> (physical or virtual) and <strong>anywhere</strong> (on-premises and on the cloud). This architecture is the basis of our new<a href="https://opennebula.io/new-opennebula-managed-services-for-corporate-users/"> Managed Services for Corporate Users</a> 📡</p>



<p>But that’s not all! This year we have updated OpenNebula’s <a href="https://opennebula.io/opennebula-new-microsoft-azure-driver-for-hybrid-clouds/">Microsoft Azure driver</a> to make it compatible with the new <strong>Azure Resource Manager</strong>, and we have also been working to improve our <a href="https://marketplace.opennebula.io/appliance">Public Marketplace</a>, updating several of our virtual appliances. We’ve updated, for instance, our<strong> GitLab Virtual Appliance</strong>, now supporting CE Security Release 13.6.2, as well as the service appliance that provides several<a href="https://opennebula.io/new-appliances-for-virtual-network-functions-and-virtual-router/"> Virtual Network Functions</a> (VNFs). And in November we confirmed that our <strong>Kubernetes Virtual Appliance</strong>—which gives you a “press-of-a-button”, simple tool for creating and deploying a Kubernetes-based <a href="https://opennebula.io/mastering-containers/">container orchestration</a> platform on top of OpenNebula—had passed all the tests to be included into the CNCF Landscape as a<a href="https://opennebula.io/certified-kubernetes-appliance/"> Certified Kubernetes installer</a>! 🎉</p>

<h3>Real-Life Use Cases of Cloud and Edge Computing</h3>



<p>With all that’s been going on around the OpenNebula project, we are aware that sometimes it might be difficult to keep track of all the news and new features that we have been working on. That’s why this year we’ve made an extra effort to produce <strong>new materials for both newcomers and expert users</strong> of OpenNebula. One of the resources we’ve used for this is a <a href="https://opennebula.io/screencasts/">new collection of screencasts</a> that provides a number of introductory videos as well as reviews of some of OpenNebula’s <strong>key features and use cases</strong>. In this series of screencasts you’ll find things like a new intro to <a href="http://vonecloud.today/">vOneCloud</a> (our open source replacement for VMWare vRealize), a tutorial on how to build a <a href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360042898271-How-to-Build-an-Image-for-Windows-Virtual-Machines">Windows image</a>, an explanation on how to use OpenNebula plus Apache Guacamole to set up an open source <a href="https://opennebula.io/opennebula-for-vdi-at-the-edge/">VDI solution</a>, or a tutorial on how to <a href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360042187272-How-to-Use-miniONE-to-Deploy-VMs-on-the-Edge">deploy VMs on the Edge</a>.</p>



<p>Several of those screencasts are also part of a new series of public articles that we’ve added to our <a href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/categories/360003026332-Solutions-and-Best-Practices">Knowledge Base</a>, a section of the <strong>OpenNebula Customer Portal</strong> whose full contents are only available to corporate users with an active <a href="https://opennebula.io/subscriptions/">OpenNebula Subscription</a>. In there you’ll also find additional resources for the general public such as a tutorial on our new native integration with the <a href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360046667892-Using-the-Docker-Hub-Marketplace-to-Deploy-Container-based-Applications">Docker Hub marketplace</a>, or a practical introduction to <a href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360049183972-A-Practical-Introduction-to-OpenNebula-on-the-Edge-with-Docker">OpenNebula on the Edge with Docker</a>. And if you need some more details, don’t forget we’ve also been working to expand our collection of <strong>white papers and reports</strong> to cover relevant topics such as <a href="https://opennebula.io/get-edge-computing-whitepaper/">Edge Computing with OpenNebula</a> and <a href="https://opennebula.io/get-mastering-containers-whitepaper/">Mastering Containers with OpenNebula</a>, as well as updated <strong>competitive pricing reviews</strong> of OpenNebula versus <a href="https://opennebula.io/vmware-competitive-pricing-review/">VMware</a> and <a href="https://opennebula.io/comparing-opennebula-vs-openstack-for-the-enterprise/">OpenStack</a> 💸</p>



<p>In late 2020 we also launched an initiative to publish a new series of <strong>testimonials by users and customers</strong>, sharing their specific requirements and ensuing experiences using OpenNebula. These new<a href="https://opennebula.io/our-new-opennebula-case-studies-initiative/"> Case Studies</a> are designed to help other members of the Community get a feel for how OpenNebula is meeting the needs of organizations across the globe. Special thanks to our initial contributors: Qt, Perspecta, Dustin, the Department of Environment and Spatial Planning (Flemish Government), and Ooma! 🤩</p>



<p>Special thanks to Tony Sarajärvi, CI Tech Lead at The Qt Company, for contributing as well to our Community Blog with such an inspiring guest post on the critical role that OpenNebula plays in Qt’s impressive <a href="https://opennebula.io/qt-opennebula-and-a-ci-system-running-millions-of-virtual-machines/">CI infrastructure</a>, in combination with tools like MAAS, Parallels and Grafana. And kudos to Mara Sorella, Postdoctoral Researcher at the Research Center of Cyber Intelligence and Information Security (Sapienza University of Rome), for inaugurating the new <a href="https://opennebula.io/building-emulation-environments-for-cybersecurity-analyses/">Cybersecurity section</a> of our blog 🤖</p>



<p>In fact, if you’ve been following our blog in 2020, you’ll have seen that during this year we’ve been publishing some really cool stuff! <a href="https://opennebula.io/opennebula-kubernetes-comparing-two-container-orchestration-models/">Here</a> you’ll find, for instance, an interesting comparative between a solution based on <strong>Kubernetes</strong> and our <a href="https://opennebula.io/mastering-containers/">native container orchestration model</a>, based on our support for <strong>Firecracker and Docker Hub</strong>. To illustrate the huge potential of this new integration we’ve also produced several <a href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360045122532-How-to-Use-miniONE-to-Deploy-a-Firecracker-Edge-Cloud-for-Containers">blog posts, including one that explains </a>in detail why we’ve fallen in love with the concept of<a href="https://opennebula.io/deploying-container-based-applications-with-opennebula/"> deploying applications containers as microVMs</a> and another one on <a href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360045122532-How-to-Use-miniONE-to-Deploy-a-Firecracker-Edge-Cloud-for-Containers">how you can use OpenNebula to </a><a href="https://opennebula.io/using-firecracker-clouds-at-the-edge-for-iot-deployments/">deploy an IoT solution at the Edge</a><a href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360045122532-How-to-Use-miniONE-to-Deploy-a-Firecracker-Edge-Cloud-for-Containers"> based on</a> the open source IoT platform <strong>ThingsBoard</strong><a href="https://support.opennebula.pro/hc/en-us/articles/360045122532-How-to-Use-miniONE-to-Deploy-a-Firecracker-Edge-Cloud-for-Containers">.</a></p>



<p>Still, if what you prefer is a <strong>Kubernetes</strong> deployment on top of your OpenNebula cloud, worry not, because you’ll also find some inspiration in this blog post explaining how to easily set up an OpenNebula environment with<a href="https://opennebula.io/using-opennebula-and-kubernetes-to-deploy-multiplayer-game-servers-on-the-edge/"> Kubernetes clusters on the Edge</a>, which includes a practical example based on deploying <strong>multiplayer game servers</strong> on Equinix Metal bare-metal resources 🎮</p>



<p>By now, you are probably perfectly aware that, thanks to our <a href="https://oneedge.io/">ONEedge</a> initiative, we are in fact turning OpenNebula into a powerful <strong>open source Edge Computing platform</strong>. Within that context, we’ve developed the first version of our new<a href="https://opennebula.io/an-elastic-private-cloud-opennebulas-solution-for-media-services/"> Elastic Private Media Cloud</a> concept, a tool for <strong>OTT services and Media companies</strong> to make use of on-demand Edge clouds to run high-definition video streaming and live broadcasting services. And we’ve also started to test our integration with<a href="https://opennebula.io/building-5g-edge-clouds-for-containers-with-opennebula-and-aws-wavelength/"> AWS Wavelength</a>, the amazing new service that <strong>Amazon Web Services</strong> has recently launched around the world in collaboration with Verizon, Vodafone and other <strong>5G telecommunication providers</strong>. In the near future, OpenNebula users will be able to deploy Kubernetes clusters and containerized applications on the <strong>5G edge</strong> using AWS Wavelength resources! 🌎</p>

<h3>Expanding the OpenNebula Community</h3>



<p>OpenNebula is an open source project that revolves around its community, and we are happy to say that, despite the global situation and the many professional and personal challenges that the COVID-19 crisis has brought, <strong>the OpenNebula Community is thriving</strong>! And to make sure that we all keep on the same page, this year we launched not only an <a href="https://opennebula.io/architecture-survey-results-2020/">OpenNebula Architecture Survey</a> for ensuring that we maintain a proper focus on our users’ evolving needs, but also a new<a href="https://opennebula.io/join-our-edge-computing-user-group/"> Edge Computing User Group</a> to make sure members of the Community have a direct channel to collaborate and provide feedback on OpenNebula’s new <a href="https://oneedge.io/">Edge Computing capabilities</a> 🛰️</p>

There are many ways this has been achieved, from giving admin logins to the cloud console, to having devs create request tickets to the central IT team, to creating a self-service catalogue in which business units can select what they need from a list of pre-approved resources or environments.</p><p>What ever model enterprises have chosen, one common thing happens. The cloud bill becomes less predictable. Someone didn't know what they were launching, they didn't turn it off, they didn't consider that when you create one resource, it will auto-create a bunch of other resources. As we shift left with Infrastructure as Code, and further with Serverless, in which code decisions have a direct impact on the cloud bill, we need a better answer than just policing what developers have access to and doing post-bill analysis.</p><p>Myself and my co-founders have been working in the cloud cost space for 10 years, and we now want to address this issue. Our theory is that if we give developers and DevOps engineers a clear picture of costs of their infrastructure before they launch, then they will be more mindful about what they launch. Think of it like <a href="https://powerhousedynamics.com/resources/white-papers/prius-effect1/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">The Prius Effect</a> in which it was observed and documented that a large subset of Prius drivers would respond to the data on the dashboard by driving in a manner that decreased fuel consumption, but for cloud costs.</p><p>We launched <a href="https://www.infracost.io/">infracost.io</a>, an <a href="https://github.com/infracost/infracost" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">open source tool</a> which looks at a terraform project and creates a cost estimate for the resources directly in the CLI:</p><p><img alt="The output of Infracost running directly in the CLI" src="https://www.infracost.io/assets/images/infracost-example-cli-fdffcd60a87458a9b42ab6405cc4a4d1.png"></p><p>You might say “developers don't care about cloud costs since they don't pay for it”.

Will a single person in a team pull the cost efficiency up?</li></ol><p>This is what Infracost looks like if you put it into the CI pipeline, a comment summarizes the percentage change in the cloud cost due to the changes in the terraform project, as well as a detailed breakdown:</p><p><img alt="Infracost explaining cloud costs in pull requests" src="https://www.infracost.io/assets/images/infracost-pull-request-90964186c52c189e8a473b4b0da46668.png"></p><h3 id="our-theory">Our Theory</h3><p>We are working on validating this theory: can we get better cloud cost efficiency if we give developers clear visibility into potential cloud costs directly in their workflow with no added effort.

    <p><strong>What can money buy?</strong></p>

<p>Depending on who you are asking, the answers vary:<br>
Power, comfort, land .. maybe even a sprinkle of Fake News.</p>

<p><strong>How about your influence? Is that for sale?</strong></p>

<p>With the explosive rise of TikTok, it was only a matter of time until we started seeing videos such as the ones in <a href="https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/12/15/22174581/walmart-amazon-tiktok-employee-worker-influencer"><strong>this article by Vox</strong></a>.</p>

<p>Employees in the monster factory warehouses of Amazon are now using the social platform as a medium to showcase the dark side of getting your shipment in 2 days.</p>

<p>The state of constant surveillance, optimized algorithmic performance evaluations, and being a human robot are hallmarks of the job. More and more videos trickle onto social media uncovering the reality of modern commerce.</p>

<p>On the other side of the table, this must look like an onslaught of nightmare PR and press. How do you fight this fire that only seems to be growing and growing?</p>

<p>That would depend on the size of your treasury.</p>

<p>If you have a treasury the size of several countries cumulative GDP, you might as well fight fire with fire, change peoples’ perceptions and distort reality.</p>

<p>Influence.</p>

<p>The results:<br>
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Vine"><strong>Pay to get 5 star reviews with Amazon Vine program</strong></a><br>
<a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-influencer-how-to-make-money-2019-2"><strong>Amazon Influencer program</strong></a><br>
<a href="https://gizmodo.com/whats-an-amazon-fc-ambassador-and-are-they-okay-1837274685"><strong>Amazon Influencer army</strong></a><br>
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/news/tiktok-sale-deadline-elapses-as-negotiations-with-us-continue/"><strong>Walmart is seeking to increase their stake in TikTok</strong></a></p>

<p>An army of influencers fighting under the banner of the wronged and the oppressed.</p>

<p>Wait.. which side is the wronged one again? The Influencer Amnesia has struck, yet again.</p>

<p>This is a feedback loop running right in-front of us. The influencers posting rave tweets and posts are also the ones that are buying fake followers, upvotes and many more. The savage cycle only repeats itself and proliferates.</p>

<p>It seems like the industry is too far gone to revert. What is even more astounding is that buying influencers doesn’t just limit itself to PR and media. Every facet of the Internet is affected.</p>

<p>Influencers aren’t only working to improve companies’ reputations by tweeting or using TikTok. By now, it should come as no surprise that <a href="https://saoudkhalifah.com/2020/10/19/lets-talk-about-fake-reviews-part-1"><strong>more than 40%</strong></a> (!) of the reviews you’re reading may have been manipulated and are unreliable. These types of campaigns are only growing with more reviews being written with the only intent to influence you and your buying decision. Without you even knowing it.</p>

<p>If you’re planning on starting or continuing your job hunt this year, the beginning of the year is a good time to consolidate your past accomplishments. Doing so allows you to control your story and therefore shape how an interview will go, all by presenting the right information about yourself at the right time.</p>

<p>As a bonus, I’ll also include a section at the end with some tips for interviewers.</p>

<h2 id="the-resume">The resume</h2>

<p>(Or your LinkedIn profile, or other representation of yourself.)</p>

<p>As an interviewer, <a href="https://hiringfor.tech/2020/12/07/getting-to-know-the-candidate-before-the-interview.html">I look at resumes to understand what experience a candidate has</a>. By doing so, I can ask them questions based suited to that experience, especially as it relates to their role within a project and the layers of the stack they worked in. For that reason, it’s good for a resume to tell interviewers where you are in your career and what your areas of expertise are.</p>

<p>Early on in my career, I worked on whatever was available, with limited leadership responsibilities. Over time, I took on larger projects and did more on each project. You can see this on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/avikdas1990/">my LinkedIn profile</a>, comparing the descriptions of earlier roles vs. newer ones. Either way, here are some ways to streamline your resume and online profiles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>If you didn’t have a large role in a project, as is typical earlier in your career, don’t make it seem like you did. However, be specific about what you worked on, namely the technologies and areas you worked in. This is helpful to pinpoint what you already know.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For projects where you had a larger role, still highlight your areas of contribution. For example, I make it clear I work on the backend, on distributed systems. You should also clearly communicate your role on the project, as you probably did more than write code. Use industry-standard terms, like “tech lead” or “architect”, for clarity if appropriate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Finally, <strong>clearly state impact</strong>, no matter the role. Did you release a product? Did you grow a team or a tech stack from the ground up? What did you accomplish at the end of the day?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The other consideration is how to treat different types of documents and online profiles. I try to be very comprehensive and visual with my LinkedIn profile, linking my writing and videos of my public speaking. With my resume, I trim everything down significantly to fit on one page, highlighting what people need to know at a glance. And <a href="https://github.com/avik-das">my Github profile</a> is more about what I’m interested in, to show the breadth of my knowledge, as opposed to career accomplishments.</p>

<p>All of these documents and profiles are ways to communicate to recruiters and interviews what your expertise is. And if those people are doing a good job, you’re more likely to be matched with the right role and interview questions. (And if they’re not, then a good profile won’t help anyway.)</p>

<h2 id="introducing-yourself-in-the-interview">Introducing yourself in the interview</h2>

<p>Once you’re actually talking to people at a company, you have a chance to really set the narrative. As an interviewer, I make sure to read people’s resumes, so I ask, “Is there anything else you’d like me to know about you?”</p>

<p>Whether or not the interviewer has done their research, focus on the most important parts of your career. Often, this will be your current role, as the technologies and product areas you’re involved in currently are the ones that are freshest in your mind.</p>

<p>Above all, get your story straight before the interview, so you can confidently introduce yourself.</p>

<p>If I were hypothetically looking for a job, here’s my two-minute introduction as of January 2021:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been working at LinkedIn for the last two years, and I’m a tech lead within the Messaging team. I work on both the foundational backend platform that powers messaging across multiple products at LinkedIn, as well as the APIs backing the flagship messaging product most people are familiar with. On the flip side, I’ve worked at small startups, building products and teams from the ground up. Even though my experience is primarily on the backend, I’ve worked on both web and native mobile apps, as well as in offline processing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Good interviewers will have a back-and-forth with you about your experience, so I would start by hitting the main points first, instead of trying to be comprehensive.</p>

<h2 id="what-about-the-interviewer">What about the interviewer?</h2>

<p>As an interviewer, this is a good time to reflect on your role within the company you’re interviewing on behalf of. After all, you also need to introduce yourself at the beginning of an interview.</p>

<p>A lot of the same advice as above applies, but focus on how you fit into the team and the type of the work goes on within that team. You’re representing your team, so your introduction isn’t solely about you anymore. Here’s my standard introduction during interviews:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been at LinkedIn for the last two years, though I was here before, left to do some startups and came back. I work on the Messaging team, on two parts of the stack. First, I work on the foundational backend platform that powers messaging all across LinkedIn, which stores and delivers messages. However, I primarily work on the APIs backing the flagship messaging experience, which is what you see when you go to linkedin.com or open your LinkedIn app.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I introduce the team and what the team does. The impact of the team is important, my specific contribution to the team less so. Finally, I give a little bit of my background so the candidate knows what experience I bring to the table, as well as give confidence that LinkedIn is a good place to work, given that I’ve come back after leaving.</p>

<hr>

<p>How you present yourself in an interview sets the framework for how you will be evaluated. For that reason, it’s important to reflect on your accomplishments and take note of the areas you have expertise in. If you present yourself as knowledgeable about certain areas, a good interview process can give you a better chance of showing your strengths in those areas.</p>

<![CDATA[Rich Boxplot, a more readable alternative to scatter plot]]>

January 4, 2021 | https://t0mk.github.io/posts/rich-boxplot/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://t0mk.github.io/posts/rich-boxplot/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
      <p>It’s often useful to visually understand how one statistic relates to another. For example, to see how rental apartment area affects its monthly price. The first visualization that would come to my mind is scatter plot, and I argue that scatter plot is not descriptive enough to offer good understanding of the simple case of two 1d statistics. I propose a rich boxplot visualization that gives better overview of the correlation to the reader.</p>
<h2 id="example-data">Example data</h2>
<p>Given about 24000 rental ads for apartments in Tampere, Finland in the last 3 years, perhaps in a DataFrame with two columns “area” and “price”, these are the distributions of apartment size in square meters, and apartment price in EUR per month.</p>
<p><img src="https://t0mk.github.io/img/rbp_area.png" alt="alt"> | <img src="https://t0mk.github.io/img/rbp_price.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>You can see that the histogram of apartment size is peaky, developers stick to certain apartment sizes. As there are many new high blocks of flats, the apartment sizes are the same for apartments above and below in the same block. The peaks can be seen as popular apartment sizes in Tampere. There’s 25 m², 32 m², 39 m², 45 m², 52 m², 59 m² and then 75 m².</p>
<p>The price is less peaky and more “naturally” (normally) distributed. Median is 680 EUR, but there is another peak around 600.</p>
<p>I have already removed some outlier categories, for example:</p>
<ul>
<li>short-term hotel-like apartments (Forenom), where 25 m² studio comes to 1200 EUR/month</li>
<li>single rooms - listings of area &lt;20 m²</li>
<li>listings out of sensible range for price and area</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="scatter-plot">Scatter Plot</h2>
<p>Now it would be good to see how the apartment size relates to the rental price. Let’s scatter plot. Scatter plot is a 2d plot where each data point (row in our dataframe) is displayed on [x,y] coordinates [area,price]. This is a scatter plot of area and price of rental apartments in Tampere:</p>
<p><img src="https://t0mk.github.io/img/rbp_scatter.png" alt="alt"></p>
<p>The blue dots are the datapoints, and the black line is a linear function fitted from all the datapoints. The line (linear function) says that, given no data but the apartment size, you can estimate rental price of an apartment in Tampere by solving</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Price [EUR] = 362 + 7.1 * Size [m²]</p>
</blockquote>
<p>.. so for 50 m² we get 717 EUR, which seems about right by looking at the scatter plot. It would be interesting to see what those coefficients (362 and 7.1) would be for other cities in Finland.</p>
<p>We can get a good feel of the relationship between the two distributions from the scatter plot and fitted linear function. However, coming from the histograms, we lose information about local density of the data. We don’t know how strong is the evidence for particular apartment size (or size interval). The linear function is surely more precise for median-sized apartments than for large ones (more than 100 m²) because those are much less common. We also have very limited information about how much the price spreads for a particular apartment size.</p>
<p>Even though we only investigate apartment size as a factor of price, it’s also interesting to see to what extent is the the price affected by the other features (year built, location, amenities, ..). We can get the idea by examining how much the price varies for a given size interval, e.g. what is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range">price range for the most common half</a> of apartments between 49 and 51 m². Looking at the scatter plot, I could guess that it will be from ~600 to ~800, but I have no means to qualitatively compare this guess to other size ranges.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a linear function will not have good information value for non-linear relationships, e.g. age of an apartment - very old (1950s) and very new (2010s) apartments will be more expensive than apartments built in the middle of the era (1980s).</p>
<h2 id="rich-boxplot">Rich boxplot</h2>
<p>The variance can be explained by using a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot">boxplot</a>. For some reason, boxplots are mostly used in scientific papers, and display dependency of numeric variable on a categorical variable, think sth like petal lenghts of species of the Iris flower.</p>
<p>In order to transform the scatter plot to be more informative, I decided to bin the control variable (size), and display the median and the 0.25 and 0.75 quantiles of prices in the bin. It’s not too hard to compute that, for apartments between 49 and 51 m², there is 1208 datapoints, the median price is 710 cheapest 25% of the apartments are below 650 (0.25 quantile) and the cheapest 75% of the apartments are below 780 (0.75 quantile). This means that the most common half of 49-51 m² apartments in Tampere are between 650 and 780 EUR per month.</p>
<p>Let’s take the 2D space from the scatter plot and imagine a rectangle with vertical edges on the apartment size interval bounds, and horizontal edges on the 25% and 75% percentile prices, with a dot on the median price level. for the example from previous paragraph, it would be a rectangle between points [49,650], [51,650], [51, 780] and [49, 780], with a dot on [50, 715]. If we divide all the size range into intervals, and then transform all of them into such rectangles, the plot will look like this:</p>


<p>You can hover over a rectangle and the tooltip will show parameters of the bin. I added histograms for both of the statistics (above and on the left), and I adjust intensity of the bin based on how many samples are in it. the darker the bin, the more samples it contain. I don’t show borders of the size interval, but rather the middle value from the interval. The width of the bin/interval is not important, and can be roughly estimated from the mid-value distance.</p>
<p>The rich boxplot will show how much the price values disperse based on the apartment size. It doesn’t only report the relationship between the variables but also the quality of the data in the range.</p>

  <p><span>04 Jan 2021</span></p><p>Over the holidays, I got a <a href="https://www.polar.com/us-en/products/accessories/oh1-optical-heart-rate-sensor">Polar OH1+</a> as a Christmas present. Its an optical heart rate monitor with similar tech to those found in smart watches (including my Garmin running watch), but much more accurate (at least for running) due to being smaller &amp; lighter, as well as fitting against the fleshier upper arm:</p>

<p><img src="https://jcdav.is/public/oh1-small.jpg" alt="Polar OH1"></p>

<p>Like any modern gadget these days, it supports Bluetooth (specifically Bluetooth Low Energy, or BLE/BTLE) for talking to your phone and/or smart watch. Which got me wondering, will it pair with a computer?</p>

<p><img src="https://jcdav.is/public/bluetooth.jpg" alt="It pairs"></p>

<p>This piqued my curiosity. I had long been at least somewhat curious about tracking my heart rate while say playing video games, if nothing else for curiosity. So how easy is it to grab data from this thing? As with the last few years, I had spent a bit of December doing a bunch of <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> in rust, only to forget and have to re-learn everything the next year. So figured I could maybe try my hand at a “real” project.</p>

<p>Some quick googling later, I found the promising-looking <a href="https://crates.io/crates/btleplug">btleplug</a> crate. Lets dump data from all nearby devices…</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>(Note that though this part should work cross-platform, I couldn’t get bluetooth working from WSL, so this was all done natively on Windows).</p>

<p>Sure enough, among the shockingly large list of nearby devices is my new toy:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>A0:9E:1A:XX:XX:XX properties: PeripheralProperties { address: A0:9E:1A:XX:XX:XX, address_type: Public, local_name: Some("Polar OH1 XXXXXXXX"), tx_power_level: Some(-64), manufacturer_data: Some([]), discovery_count: 6, has_scan_response: true }, characteristics: {}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Let’s see what characteristics it supports:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>    <span>let</span> <span>ohr</span> <span>=</span> <span>central</span><span>.peripherals</span><span>()</span><span>.into_iter</span><span>()</span><span>.find</span><span>(|</span><span>p</span><span>|</span> <span>{</span>

            <span>.unwrap_or</span><span>(</span><span>false</span><span>)</span>
    <span>})</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>();</span>

    <span>ohr</span><span>.connect</span><span>();</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{:?}"</span><span>,</span> <span>ohr</span><span>.discover_characteristics</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>());</span>

<p>Turns out..a lot?</p>

<p>Which of these do I want? The <a href="https://btprodspecificationrefs.blob.core.windows.net/assigned-values/16-bit%20UUID%20Numbers%20Document.pdf">Bluetooth UUID specifications</a> lists a bunch of different potentially interesting IDs, but they are all 16 bits, whereas are 128 bit. Making matters more confusing, <code>btleplug</code> ‘s UUID definition seems to allow for either:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>enum</span> <span>UUID</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>B16</span><span>(</span><span>u16</span><span>),</span>
    <span>B128</span><span>([</span><span>u8</span><span>;</span> <span>16</span><span>]),</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>However it seems like a lot of them seem to only differ in the 3rd and 4th bytes <sup><a href="#suff1">1</a></sup>, and those to roughly correspond to GATT Characteristic Ids, and in there is a <code>2A:37</code>, which represents Heart Rate Measurement - sounds promising. Lets see if we can listen &amp; dump that data:</p>

<p>Endianness issues out of the way this….seems to be working?</p>

<p>At least that second number sure looks like a heart rate reading. To confirm this, I hopped over to the technical specifications for the Heart Rate Service (downloadable <a href="https://www.bluetooth.com/specifications/gatt/">here</a>). Sure enough, byte 0 represents various flags and byte 1 is a heart rate measurement. The spec authors have even figured out support for heart rates &gt;255 on off chance you ever slap one of these bad boys on a hummingbird:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>3.1.1.2Heart Rate Measurement Value Field</p>

  <p>The Heart Rate Measurement Value field shall be included in the Heart Rate Measurement characteristic. While most human applications require support for only 255 bpm or less, special applications (e.g. animals) may require support for higher bpm values. If the Heart Rate Measurement Value is less than or equal to 255 bpm a UINT8 format should be used for power savings. If the Heart Rate Measurement Value exceeds 255 bpm a UINT16 format shall be used. See 3.1.1.1.1for additional requirements on the Heart Rate Value format change.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Other potentially interesting bit flags include a way to indicate if the sensor thinks it has lost skin contact.</p>

<p>Now its time to figure out a UI. Faced with a <a href="https://www.areweguiyet.com/">large number of different options</a>, I ended up settling on the not-even-listed-there <a href="https://crates.io/crates/native-windows-gui">native-windows-gui crate</a> , throwing cross-platform support into the wind on the suspicion I would need easy access to the underlying win32 APIs, since it is largely just a series of nice convenience abstractions over those. Using the associated native-windows-derive macro crate, I had a basic UI setup working fairly quickly:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#[derive(Default,</span> <span>NwgUi)]</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>BasicApp</span> <span>{</span>

<blockquote>Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I donâ€™t know which half.</blockquote>

<p>Knowing where your customers come from is one of (if not the most) important drivers for business strategy. To be a successful digital company it's paramount that you get the most bang for your buck when it comes to ad spending. However, even the most strategic businesses are relying entirely on platform level reporting to track the return of their marketing spend. While this is definitely convenient, it may often be inaccurate and lead to a glut of spending in the wrong places. This spending can ruin early level businesses, and even as your business grows, it can have a severe impact on large businesses as well.</p>


<h3>Case Study: Uber's Ad Spending.</h3>

<p>Uber <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/nandoodles/status/1345774768746852353">disclosed</a> that they have been defrauded out of <strong>100 Million</strong> or <strong>2/3</strong> of their overall ad spend. Their Head of Acquisition discovered this fraud by de-activating roughly 10% of their total ad budget in 2019. To his surprise, pausing roughly <strong>15 million dollars</strong> of ad spend had <strong>zero</strong> impact on their ridership.</p>

<p>After digging into this phenomenon it became clear that their ad vendors were making up the numbers they had been reporting. For example, one ad network launched "battery saver" style apps in the Google Play Store, which gave them root access to your phone. Whenever you typed "Uber" into Google Play it fired a click event to the ad at the top of the screen to make it appear as though you clicked the advertisement which would give them attribution for the entirely unattributable action.</p>

<blockquote>Uber disclosed that they have been defrauded out of <strong>100 Million</strong> or <strong>2/3</strong> of their overall ad spend.</blockquote>

<p>Uber then continued to deactivate their advertising partners to measure impact. One by one they went through each advertising partner and, in the end, it became clear that <strong>2/3</strong> of their marketing budget was fraudulent. These relationships were terminated resulting in savings of over <strong>100 million dollars</strong> for the tech behemoth.</p>

<h3>So What Can You Do?</h3>

<p>Well it's pretty simple, just don't take their word for it. Not all advertisers are bad, but when you let them grade their own tests, don't be surprised when they all get A's.</p>

<h3>How To Collect Attribution Data Directly From Your Customers</h3>

<p>Ask them using a Zigpoll on-site attribution survey. Click the button below to preview a pre-built <a href="https://www.zigpoll.com/blog/attribution-survey" target="_blank">attribution survey</a> that you can add anywhere on your website and tailor specifically to your site's needs.</p>



<p>Once you have the poll ready to go, you just need to know when to ask your customers. This part of the funnel will vary from business to business, but here are some ideas for a few different types.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>eCommerce</strong>: Ask about attribution as part of your post purchase survey.</li>
  <li><strong>Blogs/Content</strong>: Ask about attribution when the user lands on your page for the first time.</li>
  <li><strong>Software</strong>: Ask about attribution right after a user creates an account on your platform.</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>Not all advertisers are bad, but when you let them grade their own tests, don't be surprised when they all get A's.</blockquote>

<p>Asking your customers directly at a key point in your conversion funnel will ensure that you know what marketing tools are the most effective as well as which ones are falling short of their promises. You can then use this data to be more strategic about your ad spending to convert more customers and grow your business.</p>

 <li>The "rocky, cigar-shaped object with a somewhat reddish hue," was called "1I/2017 U1 'Oumuamua" by <a target="_blank" href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/oumuamua/in-depth/" rel="nofollow">NASA</a>.</li>
 <li>"There was only one conceivable explanation: the object was a piece of advanced technology created by a distant alien civilization," according to publisher <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/Extraterrestrial/9780358274551" rel="nofollow">Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</a>.</li>

<p data-pos="4">An extraterrestrial object skimmed through <keyword keytype="Company" smid="0" usetype="2" keywordseo="space" actualkeyword="space">space</keyword> close to Earth in 2017, wrote a Harvard University astronomer, Avi Loeb, in a book to be published this month. </p>
<p data-pos="6">It was the first sign of intelligent life outside Earth, according to Loeb. </p><p>
Scientists at a Hawaiian observatory saw "an object soaring through our inner solar system, moving so quickly that it could only have been from another star," according to the marketing summary for the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hmhbooks.com/shop/books/Extraterrestrial/9780358274551" rel="nofollow">Houghton Mifflin Harcourt</a> book, "Extraterrestrial: The First Sign of Intelligent Life Beyond Earth."</p><p>
The object wasn't a natural occurrence, but a bit of space junk ejected by another galaxy, according to Loeb, a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.cfa.harvard.edu/~loeb/" rel="nofollow">professor of science</a> with a doctorate in physics. 
</p><p data-pos="12">"There was only one conceivable explanation: the object was a piece of advanced technology created by a distant alien civilization," according to HMH. </p>

<p data-pos="18">But Loeb wasn't alone in his excitement about the object, which was called "1I/2017 U1 'Oumuamua" by Nasa.</p><p>
"The first confirmed object from another star to visit our solar system, this interstellar interloper appears to be a rocky, cigar-shaped object with a somewhat reddish hue," NASA said in its <a target="_blank" href="https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/asteroids-comets-and-meteors/comets/oumuamua/in-depth/" rel="nofollow">description of the object.</a> 
"For decades we've theorized that such interstellar objects are out there, and now - for the first time - we have direct evidence they exist," said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington, <a target="_blank" href="https://www.nasa.gov/feature/solar-system-s-first-interstellar-visitor-dazzles-scientists" rel="nofollow">when</a> it was originally discovered. </p>
<p data-pos="24">He added: "This history-making discovery is opening a new window to study formation of solar systems beyond our own." </p>
<p data-pos="26">In the book-jacket blurb, Anne Wojcicki, CEO and cofounder of 23andMe, wrote that Loeb's new book "convinces you that scientific curiosity is key to our future success."</p><p>
"An exciting and eloquent case that we might have seen a sign of intelligent life near Earth - and that we should search further," she wrote. </p>
<p data-pos="30">Fellow Harvard professor Eric Maskin, a Nobel laureate in Economics, added: "Is the hypothesis right? Who knows. But let's try to find out!"</p>

This idea is not new, it's not novel: software developers have been blogging as long as blogging has been around and the field has benefitted from developers who have generously shared their knowledge in the form of articles and blog posts. In less than one year, over 1,200 developers have purchased my eBooks on content creation and have started their own blogs, newsletters, podcasts, and screencasts.</span></p><p id="viewer-643i0"><span>But while I've had the opportunity to see developers pour their writing capabilities into blogs (and there are plenty of good reasons to blog), the same level of enthusiasm isn't there for another form of writing that is just as impactful<em>: </em><strong>business writing</strong>.</span></p><h2 id="viewer-f3cal"><span><strong>What is business writing and why is it important?</strong> </span></h2><p id="viewer-4hulc"><span>Business writing takes the form of emails, presentations, reports, and internal documentation, among other things. It includes everything from your team's quarterly OKR document to the technical spec you create for work items. This is the writing that keeps everyone in your workplace informed, trained, and it keeps things moving. Work gets done through business writing and business communications. </span></p><p id="viewer-auv0m"><span>Written and spoken communication, we know, is a crucial skill to cultivate. It will affect everything from the amount of influence you have, to how colleagues work and interact with you, to how you move up in an organization. But few of us are <em>taught</em> how to create great Wikis, excellent presentation decks, or craft thoughtful emails. We learn these skills by trial and error, if at all. If we're lucky, we may work for an employer that offers training on managing meetings effectively, writing professional emails, or putting together a slide deck. But in the absence of formal training, we have to find other ways to pick up these skills.</span></p><p id="viewer-b4sfl"><span>With that in mind, here are five ways software developers can improve their writing beyond personal blogging as well as resources for each:</span></p><h2 id="viewer-egif9"><span>1. <strong>Contribute to your team's internal documentation</strong> </span></h2><p id="viewer-fji4j"><span>Internal documentation in all its forms — videos, process documentation, post-mortems, incident reports, etc. — is critical in engineering team operations. We create these assets for numerous reasons, including for tracking work, onboarding, and communicating process changes. Few people peruse internal docs for fun, but creating them <em>and maintaining them </em>increases knowledge transfer within teams (this is critical when hiring new employees or when people leave) and ensures consistency across teams. Docs are a scalable way of recording how, and why, your team does things and sharing that across an organization.</span></p><p id="viewer-30pm9"><span><strong>Bonus points</strong>: Make sure you socialize the existence of your docs to external and internal stakeholders. If someone has a commonly asked question that is answered in your docs, point them to the right document. Documentation is only useful if people know it exists and if they know what they can find there. Help people find the answer to their problems by pointing them in the right place. </span></p><p id="viewer-nnlf"><span>	<strong>Resources:</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-dgu9e"><span><strong>        - </strong><a href="https://www.stephaniemorillo.co/post/the-what-why-and-how-of-internal-documentation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>The Why, What, and How of Internal Documentation</u></a></span></p><p id="viewer-424lf"><span>        - <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/getting-started-with-an-incident-communications-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Getting Started With an Incident Communications Plan</u></a></span></p><h2 id="viewer-90lbb"><span>2.  <strong>Get paid to write and work with an editor</strong></span></h2><p id="viewer-9oiqu"><span>Plenty of tech companies have paid writer programs, where they accept externally contributed guides and tutorials and compensate the author for their work. Companies will typically pair a writer with an internal editor who will review the writer's work, provide feedback, and edit for grammar, syntax, and other style issues. Working with an editor is one of the best ways to improve your writing because you are getting detailed feedback. They are showing you what needs to be improved, how to improve it, and why. </span></p><p id="viewer-u26t"><span><strong>Bonus points</strong>: If you've already purchased the eBook <a href="https://www.stephaniemorillo.co/product-page/the-developer-s-guide-to-content-creation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em><u>The Developer's Guide to Content Creation</u></em></a><em>, </em>there's a bonus chapter on pitching third-party publications with lots of actionable tips and advice!</span></p><p id="viewer-foiv0"><span>     <strong>Resources:</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-6rd7c"><span><strong>     </strong>- <a href="https://github.com/malgamves/CommunityWriterPrograms" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Tech Community Writing Programs List</u></a></span></p><h2 id="viewer-7on6u"><span>3. <strong>Improve your code review process </strong></span></h2><p id="viewer-8ldtb"><span>Every team has its own norms and standards for how to conduct effective code reviews. But there are still ways to make your feedback clear, respectful, and easier to follow.</span></p><p id="viewer-61eme"><span>	<strong>Resources:</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-ea43k"><span>    - <a href="https://angiejones.tech/ten-commandments-code-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>The Ten Commandments of Navigating Code Reviews</u></a></span></p><p id="viewer-fc1j0"><span>    - <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/blog/how-to-conduct-effective-code-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>How to Conduct Effective Code Reviews</u></a></span></p><h2 id="viewer-8oc6e"><span>4. <strong>Use templates for writing tech specs and reports</strong> </span></h2><p id="viewer-ace4h"><span>As is the case with code reviews, many teams have templates for their tech specs. But if yours doesn't, worry not — there are templates out there that can be tailored to your team's use case. Templates promote consistency (you're using the same format and including the same kinds of information and detail every time) while saving you time from recalling what to include. When I was in grad school, I had to write lots of reports. I looked for templates online for writing good usability reports and I found a template on <a href="http://usability.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Usability.gov</u></a> that was so useful, I even adjusted it for reports I created at work. Today I have templates for everything from tech specs to how I format meeting notes to emails.</span></p><p id="viewer-7gaac"><span>	<strong>Resources:</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-khlc"><span>      - <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2020/04/06/a-practical-guide-to-writing-technical-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>A Practical Guide to Writing Technical Specs</u></a></span></p><p id="viewer-c0d7v"><span>      - <a href="https://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/resources/templates.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Usability.gov Downloadable Templates</u></a></span></p><h2 id="viewer-ac0f"><span>5. <strong>Prioritize learning how to write better emails and chat messages</strong></span></h2><p id="viewer-9jmlh"><span>Many of us office workers went remote in 2020 due to COVID-19 and that meant more written messages. Email and chat are where a lot of interactions take place now and there are plenty of ways to get it wrong. In my 12-year career, I've never worked at a company that has given a "How to write good emails" class. I've learned it on my own. But if you want to be seen as effective at your job, reliable, trustworthy, and in general as a good colleague, make writing better emails a top priority moving forward. I recently released a 95-minute masterclass called "Writing Professional Emails" which shows you email features you must use, how to write emails in a variety of scenarios, and how to use email signatures, chat messages, and your work calendar to set boundaries. It's the email class you always wanted but haven't found – until now.</span></p><p id="viewer-8jcpd"><span>	<strong>Resources:</strong></span></p><p id="viewer-8ra65"><span><strong>        - </strong><a href="https://www.stephaniemorillo.co/product-page/writing-professional-email-class" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><u>Writing Professional Emails On-Demand Masterclass</u></a></span></p><p id="viewer-257vp"><span>In summary, personal blogging is one way software developers can extend their knowledge to others and improve their writing skills, but it's not the only way. Developers should also improve their business writing skills to help them establish a culture of knowledge sharing within their organizations.</span></p><p id="viewer-alg5r"><span><span><strong><em>Need help with your email communications strategy? Purchase </em></strong></span><strong><span>T<u>he Professional Writing Email Masterclass</u></span></strong><span><strong><em> for actionable guidance to write better emails.</em></strong></span></span></p></div></div></div></div></article></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I have been trying to use type-level programming in Haskell to solve interesting problems since I read <a href="https://thinkingwithtypes.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Thinking with Types</a> by <a href="https://reasonablypolymorphic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sandy Maguire</a>. Then I found myself solving the problems in <a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Advent of Code 2020</a> and some of them seemed quite suitable to be solved with type-level programming. So I decided to give it a shot.</p>

<p>Type-level programming (TLP) is, simply put, using the type system of a language to solve a problem (or a part of a problem). In some sense, we already do TLP when we create the right types to represent our problems and solutions in code. The right types do a lot of work for us by making sure that wrong models and states do not compile, hence reducing the solution-space for us. But in some languages like <a href="https://www.haskell.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Haskell</a> and <a href="https://www.idris-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Idris</a>, we can do much more than just crafting the right types. We can leverage the type-system itself for computation! Recent versions of Haskell have introduced superb support for various extensions and primitives to make TLP in Haskell easier than ever before. Many modern libraries are increasingly employing TLP for better type safe APIs<a href="#fn1" id="fnref1" role="doc-noteref"><sup>1</sup></a>. Let’s use TLP to solve an interesting problem.</p>

<p><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2020/day/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Handy Haversacks</a> is the problem for the day 7 of Advent of Code 2020<a href="#fn2" id="fnref2" role="doc-noteref"><sup>2</sup></a>. In this problem, we are provided (as input) a bunch of rules about some bags. The bags have different colors and may contain zero or more bags of other colors. Here are the rules for the example problem:</p>
<pre><code>light red bags contain 1 bright white bag, 2 muted yellow bags.
dark orange bags contain 3 bright white bags, 4 muted yellow bags.
bright white bags contain 1 shiny gold bag.
muted yellow bags contain 2 shiny gold bags, 9 faded blue bags.
shiny gold bags contain 1 dark olive bag, 2 vibrant plum bags.
dark olive bags contain 3 faded blue bags, 4 dotted black bags.
vibrant plum bags contain 5 faded blue bags, 6 dotted black bags.
faded blue bags contain no other bags.
dotted black bags contain no other bags.</code></pre>
<p>We are going to solve the part two of the problem: given the color of a bag, find of how many other bags in total that bag would contain. Since the bags can contain more bags, this is a recursive problem. For the rules above, a <code>shiny gold</code> bag would contain …</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1 dark olive bag (and the 7 bags within it) plus 2 vibrant plum bags (and the 11 bags within each of those): 1 + 1*7 + 2 + 2*11 = 32 bags!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>At this point, many of the readers would have already solved this problem in their heads: just parse the input to a lookup table and use it to recursively calculate the number of bags. Easy, isn’t it? But what if we want to solve it with type-level programming?</p>
<h2 data-track-content="" data-content-name="terms-types-and-kinds" data-content-piece="type-level-haskell-aoc7" id="terms-types-and-kinds">Terms, Types, and Kinds<a href="#terms-types-and-kinds"></a><a href="#top" title="Back to top"></a></h2>
<p>We are used to working in the world of <em>Terms</em>. Terms are “things” that a program manipulates at the runtime, for example, integers, string, and user-defined data type instances. The terms have <em>Types</em> which are used by the compiler to prevent certain behaviors at compile-time, even before the programs are run. For example, it prevents you from adding a string to an integer.</p>
<p>The compiler works (or computes) with types instead of terms. This chain goes further. Like the terms have types, the types have <em>Kinds</em>. Kinds can be thought of as “the types of the Types”. The compiler uses kinds to prevent certain behaviors of the types at the compile-time. We can use GHCi to explore terms, types, and kinds:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>&gt;</span> <span>True</span> <span>-- a term</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2">True</span>
<span id="cb2-3"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>type</span> <span>True</span> <span>-- and its type</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4">True :: Bool</span>
<span id="cb2-5"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind <span>Bool</span> <span>-- and the kind of the Bool type</span></span>
<span id="cb2-6">Bool :: *</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All terms have only one kind: <code>*</code>. That is, all types like <code>Int</code>, <code>String</code> and whatever data types we define ourselves, have the kind <code>*</code>.</p>
<p>It’s trivial to create new types in Haskell with the <code>data</code> and <code>newtype</code> definitions. How do we go about creating new kinds? The <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#extension-DataKinds" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>DataKinds</code></a> extension lets us do just that:</p>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>set <span>-</span><span>XDataKinds</span></span>
<span id="cb3-2"><span>&gt;</span> <span>data</span> <span>Allow</span> <span>=</span> <span>Yes</span> <span>|</span> <span>No</span></span>
<span id="cb3-3"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>type</span> <span>Yes</span> <span>-- Yes is data constructor with type Allow</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4">Yes :: Allow</span>
<span id="cb3-5"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind <span>Allow</span> <span>-- Allow is a type with kind *</span></span>
<span id="cb3-6">Allow :: *</span>
<span id="cb3-7"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind <span>Yes</span> <span>-- Yes is a type too. Its kind is Allow.</span></span>
<span id="cb3-8">Yes :: Allow</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <code>DataKinds</code> extension promotes types to kinds and data constructors of those types to the types of those corresponding kinds. In the example above, <code>Yes</code> and <code>No</code> are the promoted types of the promoted kind <code>Allow</code>. Even though the constructors, types, and kinds may have same names, the compiler can tell apart from their context.</p>
<p>Now we know how to create our own kinds. What if we check for the promoted kinds of the built-in types?</p>
<div id="cb4"><pre><code><span id="cb4-1"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>type</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb4-2">True :: Bool</span>
<span id="cb4-3"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>type</span> <span>1</span><span> ::</span> <span>Int</span></span>
<span id="cb4-4">1 :: Int :: Int</span>
<span id="cb4-5"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span><span>type</span> <span>"hello"</span></span>
<span id="cb4-6">"hello" :: [Char]</span>
<span id="cb4-7"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb4-8">True :: Bool</span>
<span id="cb4-9"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind <span>1</span></span>
<span id="cb4-10">1 :: Nat</span>
<span id="cb4-11"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind <span>"hello"</span></span>
<span id="cb4-12">"hello" :: Symbol</span></code></pre></div>
<p>As expected, the <code>Bool</code> type is promoted to the <code>Bool</code> kind. But the number and string have kinds <code>Nat</code> and <code>Symbol</code> respectively. What are these new kinds?</p>
<h2 data-track-content="" data-content-name="type-level-primitives" data-content-piece="type-level-haskell-aoc7" id="type-level-primitives">Type-level Primitives<a href="#type-level-primitives"></a><a href="#top" title="Back to top"></a></h2>
<p>To be able to do useful computation at type-level, we need type-level numbers and strings. We can use <a href="https://wiki.haskell.org/Peano_numbers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Peano numbers</a> to encode natural numbers as a type and use the <code>DataKinds</code> extension to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201128171625/https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2017/04/26/basic_type_level_programming_in_haskell.html#data-kinds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promote them to type-level</a>. With the numbers as types now, we can use them for interesting things like <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20201128171625/https://www.parsonsmatt.org/2017/04/26/basic_type_level_programming_in_haskell.html#vectors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sized vectors</a> with compile-time validation for index bound checks etc. But Peano numbers are awkward to work with because of their verbosity. Fortunately, GHC has built-in support for type-level natural numbers with the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/GHC-TypeLits.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GHC.TypeLits</a> package.</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind <span>1</span> <span>-- 1 is a type-level number here</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2">1 :: Nat</span>
<span id="cb5-3"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind <span>10000</span> <span>-- kind of all type-level numbers is GHC.TypeLits.Nat</span></span>
<span id="cb5-4">10000 :: Nat</span></code></pre></div>
<p>GHC supports type-level strings as well through the same package. Unlike term-level strings which are lists of <code>Char</code>s, type-level strings are defined as a primitive and their kind is <code>Symbol</code><a href="#fn3" id="fnref3" role="doc-noteref"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind <span>"hello at type-level"</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">"hello at type-level" :: Symbol</span></code></pre></div>
<p>GHC also supports type-level lists and tuples. Type-level lists can contain zero or more types of same kind, while type-level tuples can contain zero or more types of possibly different kinds.</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind [<span>1</span>, <span>2</span>, <span>3</span>]</span>
<span id="cb7-2">[1, 2, 3] :: [Nat]</span>
<span id="cb7-3"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind [<span>"hello"</span>, <span>"world"</span>]</span>
<span id="cb7-4">["hello", "world"] :: [Symbol]</span>
<span id="cb7-5"><span>&gt;</span> <span>-- prefix the tuple with ' to disambiguate it as a type-level tuple</span></span>
<span id="cb7-6"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind '(<span>1</span>, <span>"one"</span>)</span>
<span id="cb7-7">'(1, "one") :: (Nat, Symbol)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we are familiar with the primitives for type-level computations. How exactly do we do these computations though?</p>
<h2 data-track-content="" data-content-name="type-families" data-content-piece="type-level-haskell-aoc7" id="type-families">Type Families<a href="#type-families"></a><a href="#top" title="Back to top"></a></h2>
<p><em>Type families</em> can be thought of as functions that work at type-level. Just like we use functions to do computations at term-level, we can use type families to do computations at type-level. Type families are enabled by the <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#extension-TypeFamilies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeFamilies</a> extension<a href="#fn4" id="fnref4" role="doc-noteref"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Let’s write a simple type family to compute logical conjunction of two type-level booleans:</p>
<div id="cb8"><pre><code><span id="cb8-1"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>set <span>-</span><span>XTypeFamilies</span></span>
<span id="cb8-2"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>set <span>+</span>m</span>
<span id="cb8-3"><span>&gt;</span> <span>type</span> <span>family</span> <span>And</span> (<span>x ::</span> <span>Bool</span>) (<span>y ::</span> <span>Bool</span>)<span> ::</span> <span>Bool</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb8-4"><span>&gt;</span>   <span>And</span> <span>True</span> <span>True</span> <span>=</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb8-5"><span>&gt;</span>   <span>And</span> _     _   <span>=</span> <span>False</span></span>
<span id="cb8-6"><span>&gt;</span></span>
<span id="cb8-7"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind <span>And</span></span>
<span id="cb8-8">And :: Bool -&gt; Bool -&gt; Bool</span>
<span id="cb8-9"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind<span>!</span> <span>And</span> <span>True</span> <span>False</span></span>
<span id="cb8-10">And True False :: Bool</span>
<span id="cb8-11">= 'False</span>
<span id="cb8-12"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind<span>!</span> <span>And</span> <span>True</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb8-13">And True True :: Bool</span>
<span id="cb8-14">= 'True</span>
<span id="cb8-15"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind<span>!</span> <span>And</span> <span>False</span> <span>True</span></span>
<span id="cb8-16">And False True :: Bool</span>
<span id="cb8-17">= 'False</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Kind of <code>And</code> shows that it is a function at type-level. We can apply it using the <code>:kind!</code> command in GHCi to see that it indeed works as expected.</p>
<p>GHC comes with some very useful type families to do computations on <code>Nat</code>s and <code>Symbol</code>s in the <code>GHC.TypeLits</code> package. Let’s see them in action:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>GHC.TypeLits</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>set <span>-</span><span>XTypeOperators</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind<span>!</span> <span>1</span> <span>+</span> <span>2</span> <span>-- addition at type-level</span></span>
<span id="cb9-4">1 + 2 :: Nat</span>
<span id="cb9-5">= 3</span>
<span id="cb9-6"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind<span>!</span> <span>CmpNat</span> <span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>-- comparison at type-level, return lifted Ordering</span></span>
<span id="cb9-7">CmpNat 1 2 :: Ordering</span>
<span id="cb9-8">= 'LT</span>
<span id="cb9-9"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind<span>!</span> <span>AppendSymbol</span> <span>"hello"</span> <span>"world"</span> <span>-- appending two symbols at type-level</span></span>
<span id="cb9-10">AppendSymbol "hello" "world" :: Symbol</span>
<span id="cb9-11">= "helloworld"</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The <a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/~ghc/latest/docs/html/users_guide/glasgow_exts.html#extension-TypeOperators" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TypeOperators</a> extension enables us to define and use type families with symbolic names.</p>
<p>We have learned the basics of TLP in Haskell. Next, we can proceed to solve the actual problem.</p>
<h2 data-track-content="" data-content-name="setup" data-content-piece="type-level-haskell-aoc7" id="setup">Setup<a href="#setup"></a><a href="#top" title="Back to top"></a></h2>
<p>As usual, this post is written in a literate programming style, meaning if you take all the code snippets from the post (excluding the GHCi examples) in the order they appear and put them in a file, you’ll have a real working program. First go the extensions and imports:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>{-# LANGUAGE DataKinds, TypeFamilies, TypeOperators, UndecidableInstances #-}</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2"><span>module</span> <span>AoC7</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb10-3"></span>
<span id="cb10-4"><span>import</span> <span>Data.Proxy</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5"><span>import</span> <span>Data.Symbol.Ascii</span> </span>
<span id="cb10-6"><span>import</span> <span>GHC.TypeLits</span></span>
<span id="cb10-7"><span>import</span> <span>Prelude</span> <span>hiding</span> (words, reverse)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We have already encountered some of these extensions in the sections above. We’ll learn about the rest of them as we go along.</p>
<h2 data-track-content="" data-content-name="consuming-strings-at-type-level" data-content-piece="type-level-haskell-aoc7" id="consuming-strings-at-type-level">Consuming Strings at Type-level<a href="#consuming-strings-at-type-level"></a><a href="#top" title="Back to top"></a></h2>
<p>The first capability required for parsing is to consume the input string character-by-character. It’s easy to do that with term-level strings as they are simply lists of characters. But the type-level strings <code>Symbol</code>s are built-in primitives and cannot be consumed character-by-character using the built-in functionalities. So, the first thing we should do is to figure out how to break a symbol into its constituent characters. Fortunately for us, the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/symbols-0.3.0.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>symbols</code></a> library implements just that with the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/symbols-0.3.0.0/docs/Data-Symbol-Ascii.html#t:ToList" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>ToList</code></a> type family<a href="#fn5" id="fnref5" role="doc-noteref"><sup>5</sup></a>. It also provide few more utilities to work with symbols which we’ll use later for solving our problem. Let’s see what <code>ToList</code> gives us:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>&gt;</span> <span>import</span> <span>Data.Symbol.Ascii</span> (<span>ToList</span>)</span>
<span id="cb11-2"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind<span>!</span> <span>"hello there"</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3">"hello there" :: Symbol</span>
<span id="cb11-4">= "hello there"</span>
<span id="cb11-5"><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>kind<span>!</span> <span>ToList</span> <span>"hello there"</span></span>
<span id="cb11-6">ToList "hello there" :: [Symbol]</span>
<span id="cb11-7">= '["h", "e", "l", "l", "o", " ", "t", "h", "e", "r", "e"]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It does what we want. However, for the purpose of parsing rules for this problem, it’s better to have the symbols broken as words. We already have the capability to break a symbol into a list of symbols of its characters. Now, we can combine the character symbols to create a list of word symbols.</p>
<p>We can start with solving this problem with a term-level function. It is like the <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/base-4.14.1.0/docs/Prelude.html#v:words" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><code>words</code></a> function from the Prelude but of type <code>[<span>String</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>String</span>]</code> instead of <code><span>String</span> <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>String</span>]</code>.</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>words</span><span> ::</span> [<span>String</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>String</span>]</span>
<span id="cb12-2"><span>words</span> s <span>=</span> <span>reverse</span> <span>$</span> words2 [] s</span>
<span id="cb12-3"></span>
<span id="cb12-4"><span>words2 ::</span> [<span>String</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>String</span>] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Strin…</span></span></code></pre></div></section></div>

<p>I both love and <a href="https://twitter.com/internetofshit">hate</a> the idea of "smart" devices in my home. It's tough to balance the convenience of being able to turn lights on and off automatically, and adjust thermostats with my phone, with the risk that all of my devices are <a href="https://www.ckd3.com/blog/2019/6/6/attack-of-the-light-bulbs">doing</a> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-25780908">evil</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirai_(malware)">things</a> to my fellow Internet citizens. But, I think I've landed on a compromise that works.</p>
<p>I've had Internet-connected devices for a long time now. I've even <a href="https://www.uchobby.com/index.php/2007/10/08/arduino-beer-thermostat/">built devices</a> that can go online. At some point a year or two ago, I realized that I could <em>do better</em> than what I had. Here's a loose list of requirements I made up for my own "<abbr title="Internet of Things">IoT</abbr>" setup at home:</p>
<ul>
<li>works locally as a primary objective</li>
<li>works when my Internet connection is down or slow</li>
<li>avoids phoning home to the vendor's (or worse: a third party's) API or service</li>
<li>can be fully firewalled off from the actual Internet, ideally through a physical limitation</li>
<li>isn't locked up in a proprietary platform that will either become expensive, limited, or will cease to exist when it's no longer profitable</li>
</ul>
<p>My setup isn't perfect; it doesn't fully meet all of these criteria, but it's close, and it's been working well for me.</p>
<p>At the core of my home IoT network is a device called <a href="https://hubitat.com/">Hubitat Elevation</a>. It works as a bridge between the actual Internet, and my devices which are actually <em>incapable</em> (for the most part) of connecting to the Internet directly. My devices, which range from thermostats, to lights, to motion sensors, to switchable outlets, and more, use either <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zigbee">Zigbee</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z-Wave">Z-Wave</a> to communicate with each other (they form repeating mesh networks automatically) and with the hub. Again, they don't have a connection to my WiFi or my LAN, except through the hub, because they're physically incapable of connecting to my local network (they don't have ethernet ports, nor do they have WiFi radios). The hub brokers all of these connections and helps me control and automate these devices.</p>
<p>The hub—the Hubitat Elevation—is <a href="https://hubitat.com/products">fairly inexpensive</a>, and is not fully "open" (as I'd like), but has good integration abilities, is well-maintained, is <a href="https://docs.hubitat.com/index.php?title=List_of_Compatible_Devices">compatible with many devices</a> (many of them are devices compatible with the more-proprietary but similar <a href="https://www.smartthings.com/">SmartThings</a> hub), and has an active community of people answering questions, coming up with new ideas, and maintaining add-ons. These add-ons are written in Groovy, which I hadn't really used in earnest before working with the Hubitat, but you can write and modify them to suit your needs.</p>
<p>The hub itself is mostly controlled through a web UI, which I'll admit is <em>clunky</em>, or through a mobile app. The mobile app adds capabilities like geo-fencing, presence, and notifications. The hub can also be connected to other devices; I have mine connected to my Echo, for example, so I can say "Alexa turn off the kitchen lights."</p>
<p>The devices themselves are either mains-powered (such as my Hue lightbulbs, baseboard thermostats, and switching outlets), or are battery powered (such as motion sensors, door contact switches, and buttons). Many of these devices also passively measure things like local temperature, and relay this data, along with battery health to the hub.</p>
<p>I'm going to get into some examples of how I have things set up, here, though not a full getting-started tutorial, but first I wanted to mention a few things that were not immediately obvious to me, and will get you off on the right foot, if you choose to follow a similar path to mine.</p>
<ul>
<li>Third-party hub apps are a bit weird in their structure (there are usually parent and child apps), and keeping them up to date can be a pain. Luckily, <a href="https://github.com/dcmeglio/hubitat-packagemanager">Hubitat Package Manager</a> exists, and many add-ons can be maintained through this useful tool.</li>
<li>There's a built-in app called "Maker API" which provides a REST interface to your various devices, which technically goes against one of my loose requirements above, but I have it limited to the LAN, and authenticating, and this feels like a fair trade-off to me for when I want to use this kind of connection.</li>
<li>There's an app that will send measured data to <a href="https://www.influxdata.com/">InfluxDB</a>, which is a timeseries database that I have running locally on my SAN (as a Docker container on my Synology DSM), and it works well as a data source for <a href="https://grafana.com/">Grafana</a> (the graphs in this post come from Grafana). </li>
</ul>
<h3>Programmable Thermostats</h3>
<p>My house is heated primarily through a centralized heat pump (which also provides cooling in the summer), but many rooms have their own baseboard heaters + independent thermostats. Before automation, these thermostats were either completely manual, or had a hard-to-manage on-device scheduling function.</p>
<p>I replaced many of these thermostats with connected versions. My main heat pump's thermostat (low voltage) is the <a href="https://www.honeywellhome.com/us/en/products/air/thermostats/programmable-thermostats/t6-pro-z-wave-thermostat-th6320zw2003-u/">Honeywell T6 Pro Z-Wave</a>, and my baseboard heaters (line voltage) are now controlled with <a href="https://www.sinopetech.com/en/product/smart-thermostat-for-electric-heating-3000-w-zigbee/">Zigbee thermostats from Sinopé</a>.</p>
<p>Managing these through the web app is much better than the very limited UI available on programmable thermostats, directly. The Hubitat has a built-in app called "Thermostat Scheduler." Here's my office, for example (I don't like cold mornings (-: ):</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://files.scoat.es/XFsUuc2l.png"></p>
<h3>Lighting</h3>
<p>An often-touted benefit of IoT is lighting automation, and I have several lights I control with my setup. Much of this is through cooperation with the Hue bridge, which I do still have on my network, but I could remove at some point, since the bulbs speak Zigbee. The connected lights that are not Hue bulbs are mostly controlled by Leviton Decora <a href="https://www.leviton.com/en/products/dz6hd-1bz">dimmers</a>, <a href="https://www.leviton.com/en/products/dz15s-1bz">switches</a>, and optional <a href="https://www.leviton.com/en/products/dd00r-dlz">dimmer remotes</a> for 3-way circuits. Most of this is boring/routine stuff such as "turn on the outdoor lighting switch at dusk and off at midnight," configured on the hub with the "Simple Automation Rules" app, but I have a couple more interesting applications.</p>
<h3>Countertop</h3>
<p>My kitchen counter is long down one side—a "galley" style. There's under-cabinet countertop lighting the whole length of the counter, but it's split into two separate switched/dimmed circuits of LED fixtures—one to the left of the sink and one to the right. I have these set to turn on in the morning and off at night. It's kind of annoying that there are two dimmers that work independently, though, and I find it aesthetically displeasing when half of the kitchen is lit up bright and the other half is dim.</p>
<p>Automation to the rescue, though. I found an app called <a href="https://github.com/joelwetzel/Hubitat-Switch-Bindings">Switch Bindings</a> that allows me to gang these two dimmers together. Now, when I adjust the one on the left, the dimmer on the right matches the new brightness, and vice versa. A mild convenience, but it sure is nice to be able to effectively rewire these circuits in software.</p>
<h3>Cellar</h3>
<p>I have an extensive beer cellar that I keep cool and dark most of the time. I found myself sometimes forgetting to turn off the lights next to the bottles, and—as someone who is highly sensitive to mercaptans/thiols (products of lightstuck beers, a "skunky" smell/fault)—I don't want my beer to see any more light than is necessary.</p>
<p>With my setup, I can have the outlet that my shelf lighting is plugged into turn on and off when the door is opened or closed. There's also a useful temperature sensor and moisture sensor on the floor so I can know quickly if the floor drain backs up, or if a bottle somehow breaks/leaks enough for the sensor to notice, via the notification system, and keep track of cellar temperature over time.</p>
<p><img alt="these lights turn on and off when the door is opened and closed, respectively" src="https://files.scoat.es/AiBX0vGS.png"></p>
<p>I also receive an alert on my phone when the door is opened/closed, which is increasingly useful as the kids get older.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://files.scoat.es/wf4WMVJk.png"></p>
<h3>Foyer</h3>
<p>Our house has an addition built onto the front, and there's an entrance room that is kind of separated off from the rest of the living space. The lighting in here has different needs from elsewhere because of this. Wouldn't it be nice if the lights in here could automatically turn on when they need to?</p>
<p>Thanks to Simple Automation Rules (the built-in app), and a combination of the <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-home/smartthings/sensors/samsung-smartthings-motion-sensor-2018-gp-u999sjvlbaa/">SmartThings motion sensor</a> and the <a href="https://community.hubitat.com/t/release-darksky-net-weather-driver-no-pws-required/22699">DarkSky Device Driver</a> (which will need to be replaced at some point, but it still works for now), I can have the lights in there—in addition to being manually controllable from the switch panels—turn on when there's motion, but <em>only if</em> it's dark enough outside for this to be needed. The lights will turn themselves off when there's no more motion.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://files.scoat.es/yrVmcf3t.png"></p>
<h3>Ice Melting</h3>
<p>We have a fence gate that we keep closed most of the time so <a href="https://stanleydog.com/">Stanley</a> can safely hang out in our backyard. We need to use it occasionally, and during the winter this poses a problem because that side of the house has a bit of water runoff that is not normally a big deal, but in the winter, it sometimes gets dammed up by the surrounding snow/ice and freezes, making the gate impossible to open.</p>
<p>In past winters, I've used ice melting chemicals to help free the gate, but it's a pain to keep these on hand, and they corrode the fence posts where the powder coating has chipped off. Plus, it takes time for the melting to <em>work</em> and bags of this stuff are sometimes hard to find (cost aside).</p>
<p>This year, I invested in a <a href="https://kemf.ca/product-category/hotflake/">snow melting mat</a>. Electricity is relatively cheap here in Quebec, thanks to our extensive Hydro-Electric investment, but it's still wasteful to run this thing when it's not needed (arguably still less wasteful than bag after bag of ice melter). I'm still tweaking the settings on this one, but I have the mat turn on when the temperature drops and off when the ambient temperature is warmer. It's working great so far:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://files.scoat.es/Z2o6v4uM.png"></p>
<h3>Desk foot-warming mat</h3>
<p>My office is in the back corner of our house. The old part. I suspect it's poorly insulated, and the floor gets especially cold. I bought a warming mat on which to rest my feet (similar to <a href="https://www.cozyproducts.com/products/foot-warmer-2">this one</a>). It doesn't need to be on all of the time, but I do like to be able call for heat on demand, and have it turn itself off after a few minutes.</p>
<p>I have the mat plugged into a switchable outlet. In the hub, I have rules set up to turn this mat on when I press a <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/smart-home/smartthings/buttons/samsung-smartthings-button-gp-u999sjvleaa/">button</a> on my desk. The mat turns itself off after 15 minutes, thanks to a second rule in the built-in app "Rule Machine". Warm toes!</p>
<p>When I first set this up, I found myself wondering if the mat was …</p></div></div></div>

<p>These days, in the covid world we live in we have multiple videoconferences every day, with colleagues, family, friends… The average number of people attending has grown, and when I was in a call some time ago, I wondered, what would be the “optimal” way of splitting the videconference application window among the people in the call? What would be the definition of “optimal”? And, in how many ways could the space be split?, as sometimes you might prefer, for instance, one where space is shared equally or one where the current speaker has predominance.</p>



<p>This intrigued me, and I started some research to try to find answers to these questions. I started with the assumption that the videoconference application owns a window on the screen, which is a rectangle (we will call it the bounding rectangle), and we want to divide it in \(N\) different rectangles, being \(N\) the number of people in the call. We can define different criteria for optimizing like, say, dividing equally the window area among the callers. However, for that we need to define mathematically the dividing rectangles, and here is where the first difficulty arises, as the mathematical description changes depending on how you split the window. For instance, two of the ways of dividing the bounding rectangle (let’s call that “rectangulation”) for \(N=3\) are as displayed:</p>



<div><div>
<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alfonsobeato.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/N3.svg" alt="" width="755" height="355"><figcaption>Figure 1 – two possible ways of dividing a rectangle in three</figcaption></figure>




</div></div>



<p>Here we assign a width and a height to each rectangle. Note that optimizing means assigning values to these \(w_i\) and \(h_i\) to fulfill the optimizations criteria, which is like moving the “walls” between rectangles. The height \(h\) and width \(w\) of the bounding rectangle are considered fixed. In each rectangulation, it is possible to expose the implicit restrictions by equations that relate widths and heights of the different rectangles. For the first one in the image, the equations are:</p>



<p>$$\begin{array}{lcl}<br>w_1+w_2 &amp; = &amp; w \\<br>w_1 &amp; = &amp; w_3 \\<br>h_1+h_3 &amp; = &amp; h \\<br>h_1+h_3 &amp; = &amp; h_2 \\<br> \end{array}$$</p>



<p>For the second one:</p>



<p>$$\begin{array}{lcl}<br>w_1+w_2+w_3 &amp; = &amp; w \\<br>h_1 &amp; = &amp; h \\<br>h_1 &amp; = &amp; h_2 \\<br>h_2 &amp; = &amp; h_3<br>\end{array}$$</p>



<p>When we optimize we need to take into account these restrictions, which implies that for each rectangulation we have a different optimization problem with different solutions due to having different restrictions/equations in each case. The conclusion is that we need to solve the optimization problem for all possible rectangulations for a given \(N\), and then compare the different optimal values to select the best one. In summary, the steps we need to follow are</p>



<ol><li>Find all possible rectangulations for \(N\) callers</li><li>Decide an optimization criteria</li><li>Solve the optimization problem for all rectangulations, finding the best sizes for each way of splitting the bounding rectangle</li><li> Choose the best rectangulation by finding out which of them has the optimal solution that fulfills better the optimization criteria</li></ol>



<p>In the following sections we will go through each of these steps. I have developed some python code that implements the algorithms and that includes some unit tests that drive them and will be mentioned in different parts of the article. You can find it in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations" target="_blank">github</a>. If on an Ubuntu system, you can install dependencies and clone the repository from the command line with:</p>



<p><code>$ sudo apt install python3-pip</code><br><code>$ pip3 install numpy matplotlib scipy sympy</code><br><code>$ git clone https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations</code></p>



<p>N.B. In the mathematical expressions we use one-based indexes but, for practical reasons, the code uses zero-based indexes.</p>



<h2>Rectangulating a rectangle</h2>



<p>There is quite a bit of mathematical literature on the topic of rectangulations, motivated by applications like placing elements in integrated circuits. Depending on how you define them there can be more or less ways to “rectangulate” a rectangle. We want to take into account all possible rectangulations, but at the same time we need to be careful to avoid duplications. In our framework, a single rectangulation is one that can represent all rectangle sets that can fulfill a given set of equations as those shown at the beginning. Practically, that means that we can slide segments in the rectangulation (without changing the vertical or horizontal orientation) along the limiting segments, as that will not change the relationship that the equations describe. Each of these rectangulations is a class of equivalence of all possible rectangle sets described by a set of equations, and we need to find each of them and then find the optimal rectangles sizes for them, so we cover all possibilities. It turns out that each of these equivalence classes can be represented by what is called in the literature mosaic floorplans or diagonal rectangulations.</p>



<p>How to obtain these rectangulations? I will follow (mostly) the method explained in <span id="easy-footnote-1-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-558" title="S. Law, N. Reading, The Hopf algebra of diagonal rectangulations, Preprint, 2010. <a rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener&quot; href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2118&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;>arXiv:1011.2118</a>."><sup>1</sup></a></span>. First, we create a matrix of size \(N\)x\(N\), which conceptually splits the bounding rectangle in cells. We will call it the rectangulation matrix. We number the rectangles consecutively and put the numbers in the matrix diagonal. Then, we choose a permutation (any can do) for the numbers. This permutation determines how the rectangulation will look like. Finally, we follow the order in the permutation to create the rectangles, one by one. To build each rectangle, the rules are</p>



<ol><li> Start from the free cell as left and bottom as possible that can include the cell with the rectangle number</li><li>Do not include cells with numbers for other rectangles</li><li>Make it as big as possible, with the restriction that it must not surpass the right of the rectangle below it and it must not surpass the top of the rectangle to its left. The bottom and left walls of the bounding rectangle are considered bottom and left rectangles for rectangles touching them. </li></ol>



<p>This defines a map between permutations and diagonal rectangulations that we will call \(\rho\). Figure 2 illustrates this procedure for the rectangulation \(\rho(4,1,3,5,2)\).</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="425" height="656" src="https://www.alfonsobeato.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rectangulation.svg" alt=""><figcaption>Figure 2 – rectangulation for \(\rho(4,1,3,5,2)\)</figcaption></figure>



<p>This is implemented in the <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L48" target="_blank">do_diagonal_rectangulation()</a></code> function. There is a test to create random rectangulations that can be run with</p>



<p><code>$ ./rect_test.py TestRectangles.<a href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L183" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L183" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">test_diagonal_rectangulation_random</a></code></p>



<p>Figure 3 shows an example of a run, with numbered rectangles. The sizes are as returned by <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L48" target="_blank">do_diagonal_rectangulation()</a></code>, so we can see that all rectangles have part of them in the top-left to bottom-right diagonal.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.alfonsobeato.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/random_rect.svg" alt="" width="394" height="379"><figcaption>Figure 3 – rectangulation for N=10</figcaption></figure>



<p>It turns out that this map between permutations and diagonal rectangulations is surjective, so it would be interesting to filter out the permutations that produce duplicated rectangulations to reduce the number of calculations. Fortunately, it has been proved that it is possible to establish a bijection between a subset of permutations, called Baxter permutations, and diagonal rectangulations<span id="easy-footnote-2-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-558" title="E. Ackerman, G. Barequet, R. Pinter, A bijection between permutations and floorplans, and its applications, Discrete Appl.<br>Math. 154 (12) (2006) 1674–1684."><sup>2</sup></a></span>.</p>



<h3>Baxter permutations</h3>



<p>Baxter permutations can be defined by using the generalized pattern avoidance framework<span id="easy-footnote-3-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-558" title="E. Babson, E. Steingrímsson, Generalized permutation patterns and a classification of the Mahonian statistics, Sém. Lothar.<br>Combin. 44 (2000) Art. B44b, 18 pp. (electronic)."><sup>3</sup></a></span>. The way it works is that a sequence is Baxter if there is no subsequence of 4 elements that you can find in it that matches one of the generalized patterns 3-14-2 and 2-41-3. This is an interesting topic but I do not want to digress too much: I have based my implementation on the definition of section 2 of <span id="easy-footnote-4-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-4-558" title="N. Reading,Generic rectangulations.European J. Combin.33(2012) 610–623 <a href=&quot;https://arxiv.org/abs/1105.3093&quot;>arXiv:1105.3093</a>."><sup>4</sup></a></span>. The function <code><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L337" target="_blank">is_baxter_permutation()</a></code> checks whether a sequence is Baxter or not by generating all possible subsequences of 4 elements and checking if they avoid the mentioned patterns. An example using it can be run with</p>



<p><code>$ ./rect_test.py TestRectangles.<a href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L234" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rect_test.py#L234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">test_baxter_permutation</a></code></p>



<p>Using Baxter permutations to filter out permutations can save lots of time for bigger \(N\). For instance, for \(N=10\), only around 10% of the permutations are Baxter. There is a closed form formula for the number of Baxter permutations as a function of \(N\)<span id="easy-footnote-5-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-5-558" title="F.R.K. Chung, R.L. Graham, V.E. Hoggatt Jr., M. Kleiman, The number of Baxter permutations, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 24<br>(3) (1978) 382–394."><sup>5</sup></a></span>, so we can compare easily with the total number of permutations, \(N!\).</p>



<h3>Rectangle equations</h3>



<p>Once we have a rectangulation, we need to extract the equations that define the relations between widths and heights across the rectangles. To do this, we can loop through the rectangulation matrix and detect the limits between rectangles, which define horizontal and vertical segments. When found, we will create an equation that defines that the sum of the widths/heights of the rectangles at each side of the segment must be equal. There will be also two equations for the  bounding rectangle that make the sum of width/height of rectangles at the side be equal to the total width/height. Note that these are 2 and not 4 equations, as 2 of the 4 we can extract would be linearly dependent on the full set of equations (this can be seen because if we take the equation on one side and follow the parallel segments equations while moving to the opposite side we can deduce the rectangles that touch the bounding rectangle at the opposite limit). Example of the equation sets that would be extracted are those we have already seen for the rectangulations in figure 1. In the slightly more complex case of figure 2, the equations would be</p>



<p>$$\begin{array}{lcl}<br>w_1+w_2 &amp; = &amp; w \\<br>w_2 &amp; = &amp; w_3+w_5 \\<br>w_1+w_3 &amp; = &amp; w_4 \\<br>h_1+h_4 &amp; = &amp; h \\<br>h_1 &amp; = &amp; h_2+h_3 \\<br>h_3+h_4 &amp; = &amp; h_5<br>\end{array}$$</p>



<p>The function that implements this algorithm is <code><a href="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L93" data-type="URL" data-id="https://github.com/alfonsosanchezbeato/optimal-rectangulations/blob/blog-release/rectangles.py#L93" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">build_rectangulation_equations()</a></code>. It returns a matrix with the equation coefficients that will be used when optimizing the rectangulations.</p>



<p>The final number of linearly independent equations we will get will be always \(N+1\). This is a corollary of Lemma 2.3 from <span id="easy-footnote-6-558"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-6-558" title="E. Ackerman, G. Barequet, R. Pinter, On the number of rectangulations of a planar point set, J. Combin. Theory Ser. A 113 (6) (2006) 1072–1091."><sup>6</sup></a></span>. This lemma defines two operations, “Flip” and “Rotate”, that allow transforming any rectangulation on another one by a finite number of these operations. These operations do not modify the number of segments in the rectangulation. Therefore, we could transform any rectangulation in one having only, say, vertical segments. This rectangulation …</p></div></article></div>

  <p>I’ve read a book about management and it helped me to solve a long-standing personal conundrum about the code review process.
The book is “High Output Management”.
Naturally, I recommend it (and read this “review” as well: <a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190926">https://apenwarr.ca/log/20190926</a>).</p>
<p>One of the smaller ideas of the book is that of the managerial meddling.
If my manager micro-manages me and always tells me what to do, I’ll grow accustomed to that and won’t be able to contribute without close supervision.
This is a facet of a more general <strong>T</strong>ask-<strong>R</strong>elevant <strong>M</strong>aturity framework.
Irrespective of the overall level of seniority, a person has some expertise level for each <em>specific</em> task.
The optimal quantity and quality of supervisor’s involvement depends on this level (TRM).
When TRM grows, the management style should go from structured control to supervision to nudges and consultations.
I don’t need a ton of support when writing Rust, I can benefit a lot from a thorough review when codding in Julia and I certainly require hand-holding when attempting to write Spanish!
But the overarching goal is to improve my TRM, as that directly improves my productivity and frees up my supervisor’s time.
The problem with meddling is not excessive control (it might be appropriate in low-TRM situations), it is that meddling removes the motivation to learn to take the wheel yourself.</p>
<p>Now, how on earth all this managerial gibberish relates to the pull request review?
I now believe that there are two largely orthogonal (and even conflicting) goals to a review process.</p>
<p><em>One</em> goal of a review process is good <em>code</em>.
The review ensures that each change improves the overall quality of a code base.
Without continuous betterment any code under change reverts to the default architecture: a ball of goo.</p>
<p><em>Another</em> goal of a review is good <em>coders</em>.
The review is a perfect mentorship opportunity, it is a way to increase contributor’s TRM.
This is vital for community-driven open-source projects.</p>
<p>I personally always felt that the review process I use falls quite short of the proper level of quality.
Which didn’t really square with me bootstrapping a couple of successful open source projects.
Now I think that I just happen to optimize for the people’s aspect of the review process, while most guides
(with a notable exception of <a href="http://hintjens.com/blog:106">Optimistic Merging</a>) focus on code aspects.</p>
<p>Now, (let me stress this point), I do not claim that the second goal is inherently better (though it sounds nicer).
It’s just that in the context of both <a href="https://intellij-rust.github.io/">IntelliJ Rust</a> and <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/">rust-analyzer</a> (green-field projects with massive scope, big uncertainties and limited payed-for hours) growing the community of contributors and maintainers was more important than maintaining perfectly clean code.</p>
<p>Reviews for quality are hard and time consuming.
I personally can’t really review the code looking at the diff, I can give only superficial comments.
To understand the code, most of the time I need to fetch it locally and to try to implement the change myself in a different way.
To make a meaningful suggestion, I need to implement and run it on my machine (and the first two attempts won’t fly).
Hence, a proper review for me takes roughly the same time as the implementation itself.
Taking into account the fact that there are many more contributors than maintainers, this is an instant game over for reviews for quality.</p>
<p>Luckily, folks submitting PRs generally have medium/high TRM.
They were able to introduce themselves to the codebase, find an issue to work on and come up with a working code without me!
So, instead of scrutinizing away every last bit of diff’s imperfection, my goal is to promote the contributor to an autonomous maintainer status.
This is mostly just a matter of trust.
I don’t read every line of code, as I trust the author of the PR to handle ifs and whiles well enough (this is the major time saver).
I trust that people address my comments and let them merge their own PRs (<a href="https://bors.tech/documentation/"><code>bors d+</code></a>).
I trust that people can review other’s code, and share commit access (<code>r+</code>) liberally.</p>

<p>What new contributors don’t have and what I do talk about in reviews is the understanding of project-specific architecture and values.
These are best demonstrated on  specific issues with the diff.
But the focus isn’t the improvement of a specific change, the focus is teaching the author of (hopefully) subsequent changes.
I liberally digress into discussing general code philosophy issues.
As disseminating this knowledge 1-1 is not very efficient, I also try to document it.
Rather than writing a PR comment, I put the text into
<a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/41454eb1ebc87c0f35d247bfb600e775abe022f4/docs/dev/architecture.md">architecture.md</a> or
<a href="https://github.com/rust-analyzer/rust-analyzer/blob/41454eb1ebc87c0f35d247bfb600e775abe022f4/docs/dev/style.md">style.md</a>
and link that instead.
I also try to do only a small fixed number of review rounds.
Roughly, the PR is merged after two round-trips, not when there’s nothing left to improve.</p>
<p>All this definitely produces warm fuzzy feelings, but what about code quality?
Gating PRs on quality is one, but not the only one, way to maintain clean code.
The approach I use instead is continuous reafactoring / asynchronous reviews.
One of the (documented) values in rust-analyzer is that anyone is allowed and encouraged to refactor all the code, old and new.</p>
<p>Instead of blocking the PR, I merge it and then refactor the code in a follow-up (ccing the original author), when I touch this area next time.
This gives me a much better context than a diff view, as I can edit the code in-place and run the tests.
I also don’t waste time transforming the change I have in mind to a PR comment (the motivation bits go directly into comment/commit message).
It’s also easy to do unrelated drive-by fixes!</p>
<p>I wish this asynchronous review workflow was better supported by tools.
By default, changes are merged by the author, but the PR also goes to a review queue.
Later, the reviewer looks at the merged code in the main branch.
Any suggestions are submitted as a new PR, with the original author set as a reviewer.
(The in-editor reviewing reminds me <a href="https://blog.janestreet.com/putting-the-i-back-in-ide-towards-a-github-explorer/">iron workflow</a>.)</p>
<hr>
<p>For conclusion, let me reference another book.
I like item 32 from “C++ Coding Standards”: be clear what kind of class you’re writing.
A value type is not an interface is not a base class.
All three are classes, but each needs a unique set of rules.</p>
<p>When doing/receiving a code review, understand the context and purpose.
If this is a homework assignment, you want to share knowledge.
In a critical crypto library, you need perfect code.
And for a young open source project, you aim to get a co-maintainer!</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Grothendieck">Grothendieck</a> is, by far, the single most influential mathematician of the 20th century. He solved long standing mathematical problems, created whole new fields of human thought, and then spectacularly abandoned it all when his institute refused to accept military funding. The overarching theme of all his research was that when we study mathematical concepts, there are too many extraneous and distracting details. We need to simplify things to their very bare essence. </p>



<p>In this essay, I make the argument that our brain, when processing sensory input, uses this insight naturally. It simplifies things to its bare essentials, and then “fills in” the extraneous details. I then talk about how machine learning engineers designing neural networks may benefit from the same insight </p>



<h2>Machine learning and Perceptual Control Theory</h2>



<p>Obtaining and storing information is expensive. Hence, when we observe things, we notice only a few of the infinite features of the objects under observation. For instance, when we see a tree, we don’t notice all the leaves on each branch of the tree. We don’t notice each striation on the tree trunk. We just see a basic outline, and we know right away that it’s a tree. </p>



<p>Let us now use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptual_control_theory">Perceptual Control Theory</a> to understand why this may be the case. <a href="https://randommathgenerator.com/2020/12/20/perceptual-control-theory/">I have blogged about Perceptual Control Theory before</a>. When we see an object, we don’t really observe every feature of it. In our brain, we only have a grainy outline of the object in front of us. Our brain then superimposes what it “expects” the grainy outline to be filled with. For instance, when we see a conical leafy structure in front of us, we visually process only a very blurry and grainy outline of it. However, our brain then fills in some of the details. There’s probably branches that are supporting the leaves, although we can’t see them. This thing probably has roots that go into the ground, that are preventing it from falling over. We then classify the object as a tree.</p>



<p>It is completely possible that the leafy apparition in front of us is just a conical structure with “leaves” that are actually a weirdly shaped insects, supported by a stone structure in the center. However, our brain only notices a basic outline, and then fills in the details. </p>



<p>But a neural network does something entirely different. </p>



<h2>Why machine learning is overfitting</h2>



<p>Most of machine learning is overfitting because neural networks are being trained to notice too much. When a convolutional neural network sees a tree, it does not just retrieve a blurry outline and then “fill it in” with expected features. It first processes the outline of the tree. Then it notices smaller features like leaves, etc. It then starts processing even smaller features, until it can classify that object as a tree or not. </p>



<p>Why does the neural network need to continue processing and obtaining information like this? Clearly, this is what makes is to slow and expensive. Why does it also not obtain only bare information, like a bare outline, and then fill it in with expected details? This is because <strong>the neural network does not have any input data</strong>, that’ll help it fill in this information. </p>



<p>Hence, in order to have a generic neural network that can classify all objects that a human can, we somehow have to give it the “expected fill in” information that a human learns through experience in the real world. Hence, machine learning stands to benefit from pediatric research- how babies learn to identify things when they notice them for the first time. Moreover, Noam Chomsky also argues that babies are born with the adequate equipment to actually learn this information in a fast and efficient way, and that a baby’s brain is never a clean slate. If this is true, passing on this “fill in” information to a machine may be more difficult than expected. However, this is a question that perhaps deserves a closer look. </p>



<p>It is not just what a neural network notices about an object that is important. What it trained to “fill in” into the blurry outline is equally important. </p>

<p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> India’s method of green-lighting two COVID-19 vaccine candidates is not only mired in a questionable process and a <a href="https://pib.gov.in/PressReleseDetail.aspx?PRID=1685761">curious choice of words</a>, it could also have far reaching effects in how vaccines are viewed, Gagandeep Kang has said.</p>
<p>Indian authorities have, over the last weekend (January 1 and 2) approved two vaccines for administration. The first was ‘Covishield’, developed at the Oxford University with AstraZeneca and the second, Bharat Biotech’s ‘Covaxin’.</p>


<p>In an interview with <a href="https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/i-have-no-clue-i-have-never-seen-anything-like-it/articleshow/80087336.cms"><em>Times of India</em></a>, Kang, who is the<span>&nbsp;vice-chair of the board of </span><span>Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations</span><span>&nbsp;and a professor at the Wellcome Trust Research Laboratory at the Christian Medical College at Vellore, has said that she is quite confused by both the approvals.</span></p>
<p>While <a href="https://science.thewire.in/health/bharat-biotech-covaxin-covid-19-icmr-dcgi/">controversy has surrounded</a> the Bharat Biotech vaccine since it was first announced, Kang says that even the process of approval followed for the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine is confusing.</p>
<p>From the time when vaccines began going into trial across the world, Kang has appeared widely on Indian media channels – <a href="https://science.thewire.in/health/gagandeep-kang-interview-covid-19-public-health-surveillance-lockdown-vaccines-transcript/">including at <em>The Wire</em></a> – seeking to shed light on a process otherwise unfamiliar to most, with interviews and <a href="https://science.thewire.in/the-sciences/covid-19-vaccine-clinical-trials-participant-illness-aefi-data-safety-what-next/">explanatory pieces</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Language</strong></p>
<p>Her latest interview, Kang expresses blank dismay with the language used by the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) while announcing approval to the two vaccines. The DCGI heads the department of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation which deals with approvals for drugs and vaccines.</p>
<p>“I can understand what they are saying about the Covishield vaccine and then they have this very complicated language for the Covaxin vaccine. The DCGI has actually quoted that language, but its approval for both of the vaccines is identical,” said Kang.</p>
<p>She also said that approval for a vaccine (in this case, Covaxin) in a “clinical trial mode” is something she has not seen before in a career spanning several decades.</p>
<p><em>The Wire</em>‘s Vasudevan Mukunth, <a href="https://science.thewire.in/health/dcgi-vg-somani-serum-instityte-covishield-bharat-biotech-covaxin-approval-unanswered-questions/">has also highlighted</a> that the language used by DCGI Dr V.G. Somani in his announcement on January 3 is “not found in the New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules 2019.”</p>
<p>Somani announced that the expert panel reviewed safety and immunogenicity data for the two candidates “for grant of permission for restricted use in emergency situation in public interest as an abundant precaution, in clinical trial mode, to have more options for vaccinations, especially in case of infection by mutant strains”.</p>
<p>Kang in the interview expresses surprise as to how a vaccine which is already on clinical trial could be approved for use in the same mode.</p>

<p>Questions also arise as to the legal stand of receivers of such a vaccine, considering that trial participants are distinct from those signing up to be administered a vaccine.</p>
<p><strong>Data and efficacy</strong></p>
<p>Even the very limited data made available on exactly what basis the two vaccines were approved has not been transparent, Kang has said.</p>
<p>While vaccine developers like Pfizer, Moderna, Gamlaya and AstraZeneca have been submitting data to regulators of each country, they have been simultaneously submitting the same findings to peer-reviewed journals for publishing. Thus, Kang cites, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the apex body in India’s medical response to COVID-19, is well poised to publish <a href="https://science.thewire.in/health/india-astrazeneca-vaccine-approval-uk-mhra-doubts-vaccine-apartheid-anti-vaxx/">Covishield data</a> – and how it helped the regulator to arrive at approving it – in its own journal.</p>
<p>“It has already done that for many papers that it has published, like the hydroxychloroquine one, the observational study they had and many others,” Kang said.</p>
<p>In the absence of data to reflect efficacy of Covaxin, Kang questions how the conclusion was arrived at that the “vaccine required two doses,” especially considering that phase 3 trials which determine efficacy only began in November 2020.</p>
<p>Kang also points out that what is being labelled as a ‘phase 2/3’ study by India in the case of Covishield is actually a phase 2 study anywhere else in the world.</p>
<p>The DCGI statement, says Kang, depends entirely on the source of the vaccine, i.e. AstraZeneca, for data. “They have said that they are looking at 70% efficacy [Somani actually said the efficacy was 70.42%] which is pretty much what the UK regulator did even though we know that in the dosing schedule [<a href="https://science.thewire.in/health/what-different-regulators-have-said-about-the-astrazeneca-vaccine-candidate/">a full two-dose regimen</a>] that is proposed for India and that has been tried for India, the actual efficacy is about 62%. That’s fine as long as it is over 50%,” she says.</p>
<p>Somani, notably, did not clarify the intervals between shots of Covishield at his announcement.</p>
<p>Notably, for Covaxin, no such numbers exist. <em>The Wire Science</em> had <a href="https://science.thewire.in/health/covid-19-bharat-biotechs-covaxin-expected-to-be-60-effective-company-says/">reported</a> on Bharat Biotech’s claim of 60% efficacy within days of beginning phase 3 trials. The company has not followed this claim up with actual data from the trials.</p>
<p><strong>Trust</strong></p>
<p>The overwhelming lack of transparency on fronts ranging from how the approvals were decided upon, who decided upon them, how the vaccines will impact health and other parameters among takers have dented an essential bridge that needs to exist between consumers, makers and the authorities in the process – <a href="https://thewire.in/health/covid-19-vaccines-public-accountability">trust</a>.</p>
<p>“How are we different from Russia and China? I really don’t have an answer if anyone asks me that question,” says Kang. Russia’s vaccine <a href="https://science.thewire.in/health/russia-sputnik-covid-19-vaccine/">Sputnik V</a> was approved in a quick, questionable process.</p>
<p>The greyness of the approval process, feels Kang, is a feather in the cap of those who have been anti-vaccination (often with disastrous consequences).</p>
<p>“Essentially you are handing people who are anti-vaccine, anti-science a weapon that they can use. It is horrendously hard to think of why experts would think that this was a good way to go,” she says.</p>

  This is an excuse to have a blog post on the economics of Bitcoin to refer people to. <br> <b>Intended Audience:</b> Laypersons interested or confused about Bitcoin. <br> <b>Reading Time:</b> 15min
</p>
<p>A couple of months ago, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MicroStrategy">MicroStrategy</a> (MSTR) had a spare $400M of cash which it decided to shift to Bitcoin (BTC).</p>
<p>When a company has a pile of spare money it doesn’t know what to do with, it’ll normally do <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_repurchase">buybacks</a> or start paying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dividend">dividends</a>. That gives the money back to the shareholders, and from an economic perspective the money can get better invested in other more promising companies<a href="#footnote-1-1230" id="note-1-1230" rel="footnote">1</a>. If you have a huge pile of of cash, you probably should be doing other things than leave it in a bank account to gather dust<a href="#footnote-2-1230" id="note-2-1230" rel="footnote">2</a>.</p>
<p>However, this statement from MicroStrategy CEO Michael Saylor exists to make it clear he’s buying into BTC for all the wrong reasons<a href="#footnote-3-1230" id="note-3-1230" rel="footnote">3</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“This is not a speculation, nor is it a hedge. This was a deliberate corporate strategy to adopt a bitcoin standard.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s unpack it and jump into the economics Bitcoin:</p>

<p>No.</p>
<p>Or rather BTC doesn’t act as money and there’s no serious future path for BTC to become a form of money. Let’s go back to basics. There are 3 main economic problems money solves:</p>
<p><strong>1. Medium of Exchange.</strong> Before money we had to barter, which led to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants">double coincidence of wants</a> problem. When everyone accepts the same money you can buy something from someone even if they don’t like the stuff you own.</p>
<p>As a medium of exchange, BTC is not good. There are significant transaction fees and transaction waiting times built-in to BTC and these worsen the more popular BTC get.</p>
<p>You can test BTC’s usefulness as a medium of exchange for yourself right now: try to order a pizza or to buy a random item with BTC. How many additional hurdles do you have to go through? How many fewer options do you have than if you used a regular currency? How much overhead (time, fees) is there?</p>
<p><strong>2. Unit of Account.</strong> A unit of account is what you compare the value of objects against. We denominate BTC in terms of how many USD they’re worth, so BTC is not a unit of account presently. We can say it’s because of lack of adoption, but really it’s also because the market value of BTC is so volatile.</p>
<p>If I buy a $1000 table today or in 2017, it’s roughly a $1000 table. We can’t say that a 0.4BTC table was a 0.4BTC table in 2017. We’ll expand on this in the next point:</p>
<p><strong>3. Store of Value.</strong> When you create economic value, you don’t want to be forced to use up the value you created right away.</p>
<p>For instance, if I fix your washing machine and you pay me in avocados, I’d be annoyed. I’d have to consume my payment before it becomes brown, squishy and disgusting<a href="#footnote-4-1230" id="note-4-1230" rel="footnote">4</a>. Avocado fruit is not good money because avocados loses value very fast.</p>
<p>On the other hand, well-run currencies like the USD, GBP, CAD, EUR, etc. all lose their value at a <strong>low</strong> and most importantly <strong>fairly predictible</strong> rate<a href="#footnote-5-1230" id="note-5-1230" rel="footnote">5</a>. Let’s look at the chart of the USD against BTC:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=660%2C173&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="173" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?w=3058&amp;ssl=1 3058w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=300%2C79&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=1024%2C269&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=768%2C201&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=1536%2C403&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?resize=2048%2C537&amp;ssl=1 2048w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?w=1320&amp;ssl=1 1320w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screen-Shot-2020-10-18-at-8.40.24-AM.png?w=1980&amp;ssl=1 1980w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>While the dollar loses value at a predictible rate, BTC is all over the place, which is bad.</p>
<p>One important use money is to write loan contracts. Loans are great. They let people spend now against their future potential earnings, so they can buy houses or start businesses without first saving up for a decade. Loans are good for the economy.</p>
<p>If you want to sign something that says <em>“I owe you this much for that much time”</em> then you need to be able to roughly predict the value of the debt in at the point in time where it’s due.</p>
<p>Otherwise you’ll have a hard time pricing the risk of the loan effectively. This means that you need to charge higher interests. The risk of making a loan in BTC needs to be priced into the interest of a BTC-denominated loan, which means much higher interest rates. High interests on loans are bad, because buying houses and starting businesses are good things.</p>

<p>Some people think that going back to a standard where our money was denominated by a stock of gold (the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gold_standard">Gold Standard</a>) would solve economic problems. This is nonsense.</p>
<p>Having control over supply of your currency is a good thing, as long as it’s well run.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=660%2C480&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="480" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?w=1056&amp;ssl=1 1056w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=300%2C218&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=1024%2C745&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/vLdKpu5.png?resize=768%2C559&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Remember that what is desirable is low <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance">variance</a> in the value, not the value itself. When there are wild fluctuations in value, it’s hard for money to do its job well.</p>
<p>Since the 1970s, the USD has been a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money">fiat money</a> with no intrinsic value. This means we control the supply of money.</p>
<p>Let’s look at a classic poorly drawn econ101 graph:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?resize=660%2C495&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="495" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?resize=300%2C225&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Supply-Demand.png?resize=768%2C576&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>The market price for USD is where supply meets demand. The problem with a currency based on an item whose supply is fixed is that the price will necessarily fluctuate in response to changes in demand.</p>
<p>Imagine, if you will, that a pandemic strikes and that the demand for currency takes a sharp drop. The US imports less, people don’t buy anything anymore, etc. If you can’t print money, you get deflation, which is worsens everything <a href="#footnote-6-1230" id="note-6-1230" rel="footnote">6</a>. On the other hand, if you can make the <a href="https://brrr.money/">money printers go brrrr</a> you can stabilize the price:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?resize=660%2C242&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="242" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?w=928&amp;ssl=1 928w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?resize=300%2C110&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/brrrrrr-1.png?resize=768%2C281&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Having your currency be based on a fixed supply isn’t just bad because in/deflation is hard to control <a href="#footnote-7-1230" id="note-7-1230" rel="footnote">7</a>.</p>
<p>It’s also a national security risk…</p>
<p><strong>The story of the guy who crashed gold prices in North Africa</strong></p>
<p>In the 1200s, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansa_Musa">Mansa Munsa</a>, the emperor of the Mali, was rich and a devout Muslim and wanted everyone to know it. So he embarked on a pilgrimage to make it rain all the way to Mecca.</p>
<p>He in fact made it rain so hard he increased the overall supply of gold and unintentionally <a href="https://www.ancient.eu/Mansa_Musa_I/">crashed gold prices in Cairo by 20%</a>, wreaking an economic havoc in North Africa that lasted a decade.</p>
<p>This story is fun, the larger point that having your inflation be at the mercy of foreign nations is an undesirable attribute in any currency. The US likes to call some countries <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currency_manipulator">currency manipulators</a>, but this problem would be serious under a gold standard.</p>

<p>Since the USD is based on nothing except the US government’s word<a href="#footnote-8-1230" id="note-8-1230" rel="footnote">8</a>, how can we trust USD not to be mismanaged?</p>
<p>The answer is that you can probably trust the fed until political stooges get put in place. Currently, the US’s central bank managing the USD, the Federal Reserve (the Fed for friends &amp; family), has administrative authority. The fed can say <strong>“no”</strong> to dumb requests from the president.</p>
<p>People who have no idea what the fed does like to chant “audit the fed”, but the fed is already one of the best audited US federal entities. The transcripts of <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm">all their meetings</a> are out in the open. As is their <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/bst_fedsbalancesheet.htm">balance sheet</a>, <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases.htm">what they plan to do and why</a>. If the US should audit anything it’s the Department of Defense which operates without <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2013/11/accounting-fraud-and-waste-routine-pentagon/355233/"><em>any accounting at all</em>.</a></p>
<p>It’s easy to see when a central bank will go rogue: it’s when political yes-men are elected to the board.</p>
<p>For example, before printing themselves into hyperinflation, the Venezuelan president appointed a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-economy-idUSKBN0UL27820160107">sociologist who publicly stated “Inflation does not exist in real life”</a> and instead is a made up capitalist lie. Note what happened mere months after his gaining control over the Venezuelan currency:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Time_BsF_would_take_to_lose_90_percent_of_its_value.png?resize=660%2C453&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="453" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Time_BsF_would_take_to_lose_90_percent_of_its_value.png?w=1552&amp;ssl=1 1552w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Time_BsF_would_take_to_lose_90_percent_of_its_value.png?resize=300%2C206&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Time_BsF_would_take_to_lose_90_percent_of_its_value.png?resize=1024%2C703&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Time_BsF_would_take_to_lose_90_percent_of_its_value.png?resize=768%2C528&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Time_BsF_would_take_to_lose_90_percent_of_its_value.png?resize=1536%2C1055&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Time_BsF_would_take_to_lose_90_percent_of_its_value.png?w=1320&amp;ssl=1 1320w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>This is a key policy. One paper I really like, <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/sargent1984.pdf">Sargent (1984) “The end of 4 big inflations”</a> states:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The essential measures that ended hyperinflation in each of Germany, Austria, Hungary, and Poland were, first, the creation of an independent central bank that was legally committed to refuse the government’s demand or additional unsecured credit and, second, a simultaneous alteration in the fiscal policy regime.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In english: <em>hyperinflation stops when the central bank can say “no” to the government.”</em></p>
<p>The US Fed, like other well good central banks, is run by a <a href="https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm">bunch of nerds</a><a href="#footnote-9-1230" id="note-9-1230" rel="footnote">9</a>. When it prints money, even as aggressively as it has it does so for good reasons. You can see why they started printing on March 15th as the COVID lockdowns started:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Federal Reserve is prepared to use its full range of tools to support the flow of credit to households and businesses and thereby promote its maximum employment and price stability goals.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In english: <em>We’re going to keep printing and lowering rates until jobs are back and inflation is under control. If we print until the sun is blotted out, we’ll print in the shade.</em></p>

<p>Gold is a good asset for doomsday-preppers. If society crashes, gold will still have value.</p>
<p>How do we know that?</p>
<p>Gold has held value throughout multiple historic catastrophes over thousands of years. It had value before and after the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Bronze_Age_collapse">Bronze Age Collapse</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fall_of_the_Western_Roman_Empire">Fall of the Western Roman Empire</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongol_invasions_and_conquests">Gengis Khan being Gengis Khan</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you erased humanity and started over, the new humans would still find gold to be economically valuable. When Europeans d̶i̶s̶c̶o̶v̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ c̶o̶n̶q̶u̶e̶r̶e̶d̶ g̶e̶n̶o̶c̶i̶d̶e̶d̶ went to America, they found gold to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muisca_mythology">an important item over there too</a>. This is about equivalent to finding humans on Alpha-Centauri and learning that they think gold is a good store of value as well.</p>
<p>Some people are puzzled at this: we don’t even use gold for much! But it has great properties:</p>
<p>First, gold is hard to fake and impossible to manufacture. This makes it good to ascertain payment.</p>
<p>Second, gold doesnt react to oxygen, so it doesn’t rust or tarnish. So it keeps value over time unlike most other materials.</p>
<p>Last, gold is <strong>pretty</strong>. This might sound frivolous, and you may not like it, but jewelry has actual value to humans.</p>
<p>It’s no coincidence if you look at a list of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wealthiest_families">wealthiest families</a>, a large number of them trade in luxury goods.</p>
<p>To paraphrase <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Theory_of_the_Leisure_Class">Veblen</a> humans have a profound desire to signal social status, for the same reason peacocks have unwieldy tails. Gold is a great way to achieve that.</p>
<p>On the other hand, BTC lacks all these attributes. Its value is largely based on common perception of value. There are a few fundamental drivers of demand:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Means of Exchange:</strong> if people seriously start using BTC to buy pizzas, then this creates a real demand for the currency to accomplish the short-term exchanges. As we saw previously, I’m not personally sold on this one and it’s currently a negligible fraction of overall demand.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Criminal uses:</strong> Probably the largest inbuilt …</p></li></ul></div></article></div>

		<p><b>TL;DR:</b> GNNs can provide wins over simpler embedding methods, but we’re at a point where other research directions matter more
</p>
<p>I’m only lukewarm on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). There, I said it.</p>
<p>It might sound crazy GNNs are one of the hottest fields in machine learning right now. <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00982.pdf">There</a> were at least <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.11867.pdf">four</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.08434.pdf">review</a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00687.pdf">papers</a> just in the last few months. I think some progress can come of this research, but we’re also focusing on some incorrect places.</p>
<p>But first, let’s take a step back and go over the basics.</p>

<p>We say graphs are a “non-euclidean” data type, but that’s not really true. A regular graph <a href="#footnote-1-1311" id="note-1-1311" rel="footnote">1</a> is just another way to think about a particular flavor of square matrix called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adjacency_matrix">adjacency matrix</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/AdjacencyMatrices_1002.gif?resize=412%2C271&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="412" height="271" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>It’s weird, we look at run-of-the-mill matrix full of real numbers and decide to call it “non-euclidean”.</p>
<p>This is for practical reasons. Most graphs are fairly sparse, so the matrix is full of zeros. At this point, <em>where the non-zero numbers are</em> matters most, which makes the problem closer to (computationally hard) discrete math rather than (easy) continuous, gradient-friendly math.</p>
<p><strong>If you had the full matrix, life would be easy</strong></p>
<p>If we step out of the pesky realm of physics for a minute, and assume carrying the full adjacency matrix around isn’t a problem, we solve a bunch of problems.</p>
<p>First, network node embeddings <a href="#footnote-2-1311" id="note-2-1311" rel="footnote">2</a> aren’t a thing anymore. A node is a just row in the matrix, so it’s already a vector of numbers.</p>
<p>Second, all network prediction problems are solved. A powerful enough and well-tuned model <a href="#footnote-3-1311" id="note-3-1311" rel="footnote">3</a> will simply extract all information between the network and whichever target variable we’re attaching to nodes.</p>
<p><strong>NLP is also just fancy matrix compression</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take a tangent away from graphs to NLP. Most NLP we do can be <a href="https://thegradient.pub/transformers-are-graph-neural-networks/">thought of in terms of graphs</a> as we’ll see, so it’s not a big digression.</p>
<p>First, note that Ye Olde word embedding models like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word2vec">Word2Vec</a> and <a href="https://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/glove.pdf">GloVe</a> are <a href="https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2014/file/feab05aa91085b7a8012516bc3533958-Paper.pdf">just matrix factorization</a>.</p>
<p>The GloVe algorithm works on a variation of the old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag-of-words_model">bag of words</a> matrix. It goes through the sentences and creates a (implicit) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Co-occurrence">co-occurence</a> graph where nodes are words and the edges are weighed by how often the words appear together in a sentence.</p>
<p>Glove then does matrix factorization <a href="#footnote-4-1311" id="note-4-1311" rel="footnote">4</a> on the matrix representation of that co-occurence graph, Word2Vec is mathematically equivalent<a href="#footnote-5-1311" id="note-5-1311" rel="footnote">5</a>.</p>
<p>You can read more on this in my <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/2020/02/16/embeddings-from-the-ground-up/">post on embeddings</a> and the one (with code) on <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/2019/01/27/word-embeddings-from-the-ground-up/">word embeddings</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Even language models are also just matrix compression</strong></p>
<p>Language models are all the rage. They dominate most of the <a href="https://nlpprogress.com/">state of the art</a> in NLP.</p>
<p>Let’s take BERT as our main example<a href="#footnote-6-1311" id="note-6-1311" rel="footnote">6</a>. BERT predicts a word given the context of the rest of the sentence:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?resize=660%2C208&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="208" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?resize=300%2C94&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/bert.png?resize=768%2C242&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>This grows the matrix we’re factoring from flat co-occurences on pairs of words to co-occurences conditional on the sentence’s context<a href="#footnote-7-1311" id="note-7-1311" rel="footnote">7</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?resize=660%2C291&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="291" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?w=999&amp;ssl=1 999w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?resize=300%2C132&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM.png?resize=768%2C339&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>We’re growing the “ideal matrix” we’re factoring combinatorially <a href="#footnote-8-1311" id="note-8-1311" rel="footnote">8</a>. As noted by <a href="http://socsci.uci.edu/~rfutrell/papers/hahn2019estimating.pdf">Hanh &amp; Futrell</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[…] human language—and language modelling—has infinite statistical complexity but that it can be approximated well at lower levels. This observation has two implications: 1) We can obtain good results with comparatively small models; and 2) there is a lot of potential for scaling up our models. Language models tackle such a large problem space that they probably approximate a compression of the entire language in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov_complexity">Kolmogorov Complexity</a> sense. It’s also possible that huge language models just <a href="https://bair.berkeley.edu/blog/2020/12/20/lmmem/">memorize a lot of it</a> rather than compress the information, for what it’s worth.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Can we upsample any graph like language models do?</h3>
<p>We’re already doing it.</p>
<p>Let’s call a <strong>first-order</strong> embedding of a graph a method that works by directly factoring the graph’s adjacency matrix or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplacian_matrix">Laplacian matrix</a>. If you embed a graph using <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=1F03130B02DC485C78BF364266B6F0CA?doi=10.1.1.19.8100&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">Laplacian Eigenmaps</a> or by taking the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis">principal components</a> of the Laplacian, that’s first order. Similarly, GloVe is a first-order method on the graph of word co-occurences. One of my favorites first order methods for graphs is <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/2019/0594.pdf">ProNE</a>, which works as well as most methods while being two orders of magnitude faster.</p>
<p>A <strong>higher-order</strong> method embeds the original matrix plus connections of neighbours-of-neighbours (2nd degree) and deeper k-step connections. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2806416.2806512">GraRep</a>, shows you can always generate higher-order representations from first order methods by augmenting the graph matrix <a href="#footnote-9-1311" id="note-9-1311" rel="footnote">9</a>.</p>
<p>Higher order method are the “upsampling” we do on graphs. GNNs that sample on large neighborhoods and random-walk based methods like node2vec are doing higher-order embeddings.</p>

<p>Most GNN papers in the last 5 years present empirical numbers that are useless for practitioners to decide on what to use.</p>
<p>As noted in the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00687.pdf">OpenGraphsBenchmark</a> (OGB) paper, GNN papers do their empirical section on a handful of tiny graphs (Cora, CiteSeer, PubMed) with 2000-20,000 nodes. These datasets can’t seriously differentiate between methods.</p>
<p>Recent efforts are directly fixing this, but the reasons why researchers focused on tiny, useless datasets for so long are worth discussing.</p>
<p><strong>Performance matters by task</strong></p>
<p>One fact that surprises a lot of people is that even though language models have the best performance in a lot of NLP tasks, if all you’re doing is cram sentence embeddings into a downstream model, there <a href="https://openreview.net/pdf?id=SyK00v5xx">isn’t much gained</a> from language models embeddings over simple methods like summing the individual Word2Vec word embeddings <a href="#footnote-10-1311" id="note-10-1311" rel="footnote">10</a>.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors/blob/master/examples/link%20prediction.ipynb">I find</a> that for many graphs <strong>simple first-order methods perform just as well on graph clustering and node label prediction tasks than higher-order embedding methods</strong>. In fact higher-order methods are massively computationally wasteful for these usecases <a href="#footnote-11-1311" id="note-11-1311" rel="footnote">11</a></p>
<p>Recommended first order embedding methods are ProNE and my <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors">GGVec with order=1</a> <a href="#footnote-12-1311" id="note-12-1311" rel="footnote">12</a>.</p>
<p>Higher order methods normally perform better on the link prediction tasks<a href="#footnote-13-1311" id="note-13-1311" rel="footnote">13</a>.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the gap in link prediction performance is inexistant for artificially created graphs. This suggests higher order methods do learn some of the structure intrinsic to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1310.2636.pdf">real world graphs</a>.</p>
<p>For visualization, first order methods are better. Visualizations of higher order methods tend to have artifacts of their sampling. For instance, Node2Vec visualizations tend to have elongated/filament-like structures which come from the embeddings coming from long single strand random walks. See the following visualizations by <a href="http://byowen.com/">Owen Cornec</a> <a href="#footnote-14-1311" id="note-14-1311" rel="footnote">14</a>:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?resize=660%2C253&amp;ssl=1" alt="" width="660" height="253" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?w=994&amp;ssl=1 994w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?resize=300%2C115&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/www.singlelunch.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-28-at-1.59.34-PM-1.png?resize=768%2C294&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px" data-recalc-dims="1"></p>
<p>Lastly, sometimes simple methods soundly beat higher order methods (there’s an instance of it in the OGB paper).</p>
<p>The problem here is that <strong>we don’t know when any method is better than another</strong> and <strong>we definitely don’t know the reason</strong>.</p>
<p>There’s definitely a reason different graph types respond better/worse to being represented by various methods. This is currently an open question.</p>
<p>A big part of why is that the research space is inundated under useless new algorithms because…</p>

<p>Here’s the cynic’s view of how machine learning papers are made:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take an existing algorithm</li>
<li>Add some new layer/hyperparameter, make a cute mathematical story for why it matters</li>
<li>Gridsearch your hyperparameters until you beat baselines from the original paper you aped</li>
<li>Absolutely don’t gridsearch stuff you’re comparing against in your results section</li>
<li>Make a cute ACRONYM for your new method, put impossible to use python 2 code on github <a href="#footnote-15-1311" id="note-15-1311" rel="footnote">15</a> and bask in the citations</li>
</ol>
<p>I’m <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.03341.pdf">not</a> the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kee4ch3miVA">only one</a> with these views on the state reproducible research. At least it’s gotten slightly better in the last 2 years.</p>
<h3>Sidebar: I hate Node2Vec</h3>
<p>A side project of mine is a <a href="https://github.com/VHRanger/nodevectors">node embedding library</a> and the most popular method in it is by far Node2Vec. Don’t use Node2Vec.</p>
<p><a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/~jure/pubs/node2vec-kdd16.pdf">Node2Vec</a> with <code>p=1; q=1</code> is the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.6652.pdf">Deepwalk</a> algorithm. Deepwalk is an actual innovation.</p>
<p>The Node2Vec authors closely followed the steps 1-5 including bonus points on step 5 by getting word2vec name recognition.</p>
<p>This is not academic fraud — the hyperparameters <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11726.pdf">do help a tiny bit</a> if you gridsearch really hard. But it’s the presentable-to-your-parents sister of where you make the ML community worse off to progress your academic career. And certainly Node2Vec doesn’t deserve 7500 citations.</p>

<p>We’ve known how to train neural networks for well over 40 years. Yet they only exploded in popularity with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlexNet">AlexNet</a> in 2012. This is because implementations and hardware came to a point where deep learning was <strong>practical</strong>.</p>
<p>Similarly, we’ve known about factoring word co-occurence matrices into Word embeddings for at least 20 years.</p>
<p>But word embeddings only exploded in 2013 with Word2Vec. The breakthrough here was that the minibatch-based methods let you train a Wikipedia-scale embedding model on commodity hardware<a href="#footnote-16-1311" id="note-16-1311" rel="footnote">16</a>.</p>
<p>It’s hard for methods in a field to make progress if training on a small amount of data takes days or weeks. You’re disincentivized to explore new methods. If you want progress, your stuff has to run in reasonable time on commodity hardware. Even Google’s original search algorithm <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_data_centers#Original_hardware">initially ran on commodity hardware</a> <a href="#footnote-17-1311" id="note-17-1311" rel="footnote">17</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency is paramount to progress</strong></p>
<p>The reason deep learning research took off the way it did is because of improvements in <a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-efficiency/">efficiency</a> as well as much better libraries and hardware support<a href="#footnote-18-1311" id="note-18-1311" rel="footnote">18</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Academic code is terrible</strong></p>
<p>Any amount of time you spend gridsearching Node2Vec on <code>p</code> and <code>q</code> is all put to better use gridsearching Deepwalk itself <a href="#footnote-19-1311" id="note-19-1311" rel="footnote">19</a>. The problem is that people don’t gridsearch over deepwalk because implementations are all terrible.</p>
<p>I wrote the <a href="https://www.singlelunch.com/2019/08/01/700x-faster-node2vec-models-fastest-random-walks-on-a-graph/">Nodevectors library</a> to have a fast deepwalk implementation because it took <strong>32 hours</strong> to embed a graph with a measly 150,000 nodes using the reference Node2Vec implementation (the same takes 3min with Nodevectors). It’s no wonder people don’t gridsearch on Deepwalk a gridsearch would take weeks with the terrible reference implementations.</p>
<p>To give an example, in the original paper of <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02216.pdf">GraphSAGE</a> they their algorithm to DeepWalk with walk lengths of 5 <a href="#footnote-20-1311" id="note-20-1311" rel="footnote">20</a>. From their paper:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We did observe DeepWalk’s performance could improve with further training, and in some cases it could become competitive with the unsupervised GraphSAGE approaches (but not the supervised approaches) if we let it run for &gt;1000× …</p></blockquote></div></article></div>

<p>by Hugh Pickens, December 27, 2020
</p><p>I am a covid survivor. I got the Covid six weeks ago and yesterday I was declared virus free. I had what was called a moderate case of Covid. I was never hospitalized. I was never in any real danger of death. But I was in bed for three weeks. It knocked me on my ass. 
</p><p>I have been talking about my covid when I go out and a lot of people are interested in what it really means to have a moderate case of Covid. I don’t claim to speak for every Covid patient. I certainly can’t speak for the ones who went into the hospital and are on ventilators. But I think the majority of people have a moderate case of Covid so I thought I would write this up for people that were interested.
</p><p>I had what is called a moderate case of covid which according to the CDC is about 20% of covid cases. About 80% of covid cases are classified as "mild" which basically means no symptoms at all or very minor symptoms like you would have with a flu that you have for a few days. 1% of covid cases are "severe" and require hospitalization. 
</p><p>According to the CDC,when COVID-19 symptoms progress from mild to moderate, you’ll know because one or more of the following may occur: Your fever will be above 100.4 F. You’ll develop a more persistent cough. You’ll experience temporary shortness of breath when you exert yourself – going up the stairs for instance. You’ll feel like you need to stay in bed. If this occurs, call your doctor. The virus could be progressing into pneumonia. 
</p><p>I had "You’ll feel like you need to stay in bed". The covid knocked me on my ass. I spent three weeks in bed, didn't eat, and slept 12 to14 hours a day.
</p>

<h4> <span id="Being_Careful">Being Careful</span></h4>
<p>I don’t know how I got the Covid. I actually feel like I’ve been pretty careful since the Covid started. When Oklahoma Governor Stitt came to speak to our local chamber of commerce about six months ago there were about 200 people in the audience and I was sitting on the front row and I had on my mask and Governor Stitt did not have on a mask and he got the Covid about two weeks after that. And most of the 200 people in the audience did not wear masks. So I was pretty careful. I was in the top 1% of people who were social distancing and wearing masks and trying to stay at home when there weren't many people wearing masks and a lot of people weren't taking covid seriously it seemed.
</p><p>I do not know how I got the Covid. I have been basically quarantining in my house since about March. I would go out shopping once or twice a week or to the post office or to stop in and see my best friend down at his store. But I would always wear a mask when I got out of the car and I would be careful to social distance. So who knows how I got it. Maybe somebody who had Covid sneezed and one minute later I walked through it and that’s where it came from. 
</p><p>Now the interesting thing is I knew I got it almost right away. I monitor my health pretty closely. I have been doing this for several years. I keep a daily chart and I write down my weight, my O2 level, my temperature, and my blood pressure so I notice any changes in any of my vital signs right away.
</p>
<h3> <span id="I_Get_Covid">I Get Covid</span></h3>
<p>On November 24 I felt a little fever so I measured my temperature and it was 101. I kept checking my temperature on an hourly basis and it stayed above 100 for four or five hours. Then it dropped back down to normal and I didn’t really think anything about it. 
</p><p>I called my doctor the next day and told him that I had noticed that temperature rise and he told me to go in and get a covid test and so I did and it came back positive two hours later.
</p><p>My doctor sent me over to our local hospital and I had some x-rays taken of my chest. They were looking for viral pneumonia. While I was at the hospital I started feeling lightheaded and I started to hear a ringing in my ears. I felt like my blood pressure was falling so I sat down and after they finished my x-ray I asked them to get me a wheelchair and took me out to my car and I was able to drive home safely. It is the first time in my life I have asked for a wheelchair but I just didn't feel right. I don’t know it was if I felt bad because of the Covid or if I was just coming to the realization that I might have Covid.
</p><p>You can see the photograph of me sitting at the dining room table 3 days after I was diagnosed with covid and I’m feeling pretty good. I’m not really feeling sick. I’m feeling like hey maybe I’m one of those guys who is asymptomatic or hardly has any symptoms at all. I still had my appetite. Food still tasted good. I was up and around and paying bills and doing stuff around the house. But that wasn’t gonna last much longer.
</p><p>About four days in, I started feeling weak. I didn’t feel like getting up out of bed in the morning. 
</p><p>I lost my appetite. Food really held no allure for me. I just didn’t feel like eating and I didn’t eat. For some reason I was able to eat Jell-O and I guess I ate Jell-O for about two weeks. But covid knocked me on my ass. I was laying in bed all day long. I was sleeping 12 to 14 hours a day. 
</p><p>Luckily that’s as bad as it got. I was very fatigued and tired but I did not feel unwell. I was able to keep my food down. My stomach was not really upset. My stool was regular. I was getting up to urinate about 20 times a day. I wasn't drinking that much so I don’t know where that came from. But I spent about three weeks in bed and for two of them I couldn’t of got out of bed it would’ve taken a fire for me to get out of the house.

At this point I had taken to my bed. I am sleeping 12 to 14 hours a day and I am having the terrible nightmares every night.</p></div></div></div>
<p>I was spending each day spitting up phlegm. The mucus in my lungs was attacking the virus like white blood cells defending the body. And they would engulf the virus and I was expelling the mucus and the dead virus. 
</p><p>The mucus was green. The mucus was red. Some days the mucus was blue. I saw yellow mucus. I was getting up and getting in my hot tub to kind of jiggle my body around to break the mucus up so I could spit it out. 
</p><p>The covid was not particularly unpleasant. Even when I was spitting up the phlegm it wasn't particularly disagreeable. But keep in mind that I was in pretty good shape before I got the covid and I had good lung capacity. For the past year I’ve been doing treadmill twice a week and getting myself into the aerobic zone for 40 minutes each session and so I had good endurance and good lung capacity. 
</p><p>If I had not been in that good of shape it would have been a lot more difficult for me to breath. At no point did my oxygen level drop below 90%. That was the danger point. My doctor told me if my oxygen level dropped that low I should go to the emergency room. I wanted to avoid that at all costs. My late wife was a doctor and always told me to stay out of the hospital. That's where people go to die, she would say.
</p><p>I had significant weight loss. I have weighed about 206 for the past 10 years for a BMI which is at the high end of normal for my 6'4" frame. 
</p><p>I lost my desire to eat with covid. It wasn’t that food nauseated me or made me feel ill. Food just held no attraction for me. I would eat a little Jell-O every day and that was fine but I had no desire to eat anything more substantial. 
</p><p>I dropped 25 pounds. My weight went from 206 to 178. I didn’t have a loss of taste or smell. I could still taste my food. I just had no desire to eat it.
</p><p>Another symptom that I had was bleeding gums. I went into brush my teeth one day and when I looked in the sink it was filled with blood. I looked at my gums and they were bleeding and they looked like they were receding and I got kind of scared about that. I called my dentist about it and he called me back later and said he done some research and he couldn’t find any connection between Covid and bleeding gums. 
</p><p>He prescribed some special mouthwash for me which I already had and I started using that instead of brushing my teeth and I think that kept my gums from bleeding more. 
</p><p>The other thing I did is start taking megadoses of vitamin C. I was taking 1000 mg three times a day. 
</p><p>I remembered how sailors used to get scurvy because they didn’t get enough vitamin C and they had bleeding gums so I figured what do I have to lose. I don’t know if it was the placebo effect but after about two days of Vitamin C my gums stopped bleeding. I was able to get a soft bristle brush so I could brush my teeth without irritating my gums a lot. When I told my doctor about this he sent me in for some blood test he said it’s possible that I am low on my platelets or that I have some impaired liver function.
</p>
<h3> <span id="Wrestling_With_the_Devil">Wrestling With the Devil</span></h3>
<p>Now here’s the strangest part of my story. I was in bed sleeping 12 to 14 hours a day for about two weeks. I started having nightmares every night. These are the nightmares where you can't wake up and you’re drowning and you are gasping for your last breath of air. You feel like you are dying and you wake up and your lungs are heaving and you’re bathed in sweat. 
</p><p>I had these nightmares every night like clockwork. They were terrible and I began to dread falling asleep. I know that I was not in my right mind while I had the nightmares. The nightmares were so realistic that they felt like hallucinations.
</p><p>I began to carry on conversations with my father who has been dead 20 years and with my wife who has been dead …</p></div></div>

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>As a software engineer working in the San Francisco Bay Area, I get <em>a lot</em> of
unsolicited recruiting emails. I recently decided to dig through my email archives
and do some analysis of the long-term trends. Here are the results.</p>

<h2 id="methodology">Methodology</h2>

<p>I get career-related messages sent to both my LinkedIn and Gmail accounts. Here’s a typical
example (with the sender’s name blacked out for privacy):</p>

<p><img width="600" src="https://yolken.net/assets/typical_email.png" alt="typical email">
</p>



<p>The first step was to get all these messages out of my accounts and into a format
that I could use for the analysis.</p>

<p>For LinkedIn, this was easy- there’s a “Get a copy of your data” section in the account
privacy settings. I selected “Messages”, clicked the “Request Archive” button and then,
a few minutes later, downloaded a CSV that contained one row per message, with columns
for all of the important metadata: sender, recipient, subject, date, etc.</p>

<p>For Gmail, the process was a bit more involved. I had to go through Google’s general
export product, <a href="https://takeout.google.com/">Takeout</a>, scroll down the Gmail section,
then select the labels to export. Thankfully, I’ve done a good job labelling
all of my career related emails, so I could just export those and not everything in my account.</p>

<p>A few minutes later, I got the option to download a bundle of all my emails in an
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mbox">mbox</a> file. This is a legacy
format originally developed for text-based email clients in Unix; unfortunately, Google
doesn’t give you the option to download your emails in an easier-to-use format like CSV.</p>

<p>The file had several million lines that looked like this:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>From 1669160939957813740@xxx Thu Jun 11 00:38:38 +0000 2020
X-GM-THRID: 1669160939957813740
X-Gmail-Labels: Archived,Important,Opened,Category Updates,jobs
Delivered-To: XXXXX@gmail.com
Received: by 2002:a8a:40a:0:0:0:0:0 with SMTP id n10csp877323ocb;
        Wed, 10 Jun 2020 17:38:38 -0700 (PDT)
X-Received: by 2002:a17:902:ab87:: with SMTP id f7mr5405841plr.166.1591835918733;
        Wed, 10 Jun 2020 17:38:38 -0700 (PDT)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I then wrote a Python script to read this file, pull out the inbound messages, and convert
each one to a <code>&lt;from,subject,date,body&gt;</code> tuple. Thankfully, the Python standard library contains a
<a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/mailbox.html">mailbox</a> module that parses mbox files
and makes it easy to pull out the sender, recipient, subject, and date for each message.
Getting the bodies was a little trickier since mbox bodies can have multiple parts, each with
a different encoding (text, html, etc.), but I managed to find some
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26567843/reading-the-mail-content-of-an-mbox-file-using-python-mailbox">examples on Stack Overflow</a>
to copy.</p>

<p>I then merged the Gmail data with the LinkedIn data, exported everything to a CSV, and opened
this in Google Sheets. Finally, I spent an hour going through all the messages and deleting
the ones that weren’t unsolicited. The result was a clean spreadsheet with one row per recruiting
email that I could use for my analysis.</p>

<h2 id="the-results">The results</h2>

<p>The following shows the number of unsolicited recruiter emails I’ve received by month since the
beginning of 2014:</p>



<p>A few interesting trends:</p>

<h4 id="volume-has-increased-a-lot-over-the-years"><em>Volume has increased a lot over the years</em></h4>

<p>Back in 2014, I was only getting a handful of messages per month. Now, I routinely get more
than one a day. The fact that I have more experience now than I did earlier in my career is
certainly a factor. But, I think the key driver here is simply that tech keeps getting bigger
and bigger, and the need for skilled engineers has increased significantly over time.</p>

<h4 id="there-are-clear-seasonal-patterns"><em>There are clear seasonal patterns</em></h4>

<p>Email volume goes down significantly around the winter holidays. There’s also a smaller drop
in the middle of the summer. Spring and fall are the busiest times, which also matches when
companies do the most interviewing.</p>

<h4 id="i-get-more-emails-when-im-actively-engaged-in-a-job-search"><em>I get more emails when I’m actively engaged in a job search</em></h4>

<p>The peaks in 2015, 2017, and 2019 correspond to periods when I was actively on the job
market. During these times, I was much more active about updating my LinkedIn profile, which
is probably a strong signal that a candidate is looking for something new. It’s also possible
that word spread through recruiters or friends, and that led to more job solicitations.</p>

<h4 id="there-was-no-significant-drop-due-to-covid"><em>There was no significant drop due to COVID</em></h4>

<p>Despite many companies laying people off or implementing hiring freezes earlier this year, I
still got a lot of recruiter emails. Now that startup valuations are back up and companies are
hiring again, I’m getting more emails than ever.</p>

<h2 id="other-trends">Other trends</h2>

<h4 id="big-companies-can-send-lots-of-emails"><em>Big companies can send lots of emails</em></h4>

<p>Facebook has by far been the peskiest of all the companies over the years, sending me more than
25 unsolicited recruiting emails since 2014. They’ve also sent a few text messages to my phone,
which is super-annoying. I should note, though, that I did interview there back in 2012, so I’m
probably in their system as a past prospect, which makes me a more likely sourcing target.</p>

<p>Amazon has also sent a lot of emails, particularly over the last two years.</p>

<p>Interestingly, I’ve only gotten one email from Apple, and nothing from other tech giants like
Microsoft, Netflix, IBM, SAP, and Cisco.</p>

<h4 id="follow-ups"><em>Follow-ups</em></h4>

<p>A very common pattern is to send a message, then send a few follow-ups over the next
few days with slightly different bodies and subject lines. See the Opendoor example
at the beginning of this post for an example.</p>

<p>I guess that’s one way to make sure that an email isn’t missed, although it can get a little
tiresome if you’re not interested in the company at all.</p>

<h4 id="cute-and-not-so-cute-subject-lines"><em>Cute (and not-so-cute) subject lines</em></h4>

<p>Recruiters and sourcers try to be clever with subject lines and message introductions to
catch your attention and make the messages seem more personal.</p>

<p>Binary is one way to get attention, but I have no idea what it says since I’m not a
computer :-):</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://yolken.net/assets/message2.png" alt="typical email2">
</p>



<p>Another trick is to put your current and past employers in the subject so that
it looks more personalized, and then reference them in the body.
Not sure how effective it is, though:</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://yolken.net/assets/message3.png" alt="typical email3">
</p>



<p>Emoji are cute. Here’s a message that had one in the subject
and then used them liberally in the body:</p>

<p><img width="400" src="https://yolken.net/assets/message4.png" alt="typical email4">
</p>



<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final thoughts</h2>

<p>I’ve gotten a lot of recruiting emails over the years, and, assuming that current trends
continue, will get a lot more in the future. Despite these messages being unsolicited, I don’t
consider them “spam” and actually like reading them. The vast majority are polite, informative,
and well-written. Even if I’m not actively looking for a new job, it’s nice to learn about what’s
out there so I know where to apply the next time I’m on the market.</p>

    <p>A much requested feature in Peergos has been the ability to search your whole Peergos space for files. This is more difficult than it sounds in an end-to-end encrypted setting. </p>
<p>If you haven't heard of Peergos before, it is a peer-to-peer, private storage, social and application platform. You can read more in our book: <a href="https://book.peergos.org/">https://book.peergos.org</a>. </p>
<p>A normal web app like, say, Facebook, would implement search by just sending the query to the server, which would then do the search for you, and return back the results. This is only possible because in websites like Facebook the server can read all your data. We don't have that luxury and so we had to take a different approach to search. First, let's see it in action.</p>
<center>
<img alt="search" id="id" src="https://peergos.org/theme/img/blog/search.gif" width="90%">
<br>
Search for files by name, type, size or modification time.
</center>
<p>To implement search in Peergos we have to do it all client side, without exposing anything to the server (remember, our servers are trustless). Luckily, our systems are designed with this in mind, so you are able to search all the properties of files like name etc. without downloading and decrypting the entire file, just a small amount of encrypted metadata. In the future we might consider constructing an encrypted index of your files to speed things up further but it's plenty fast enough now for many use cases. You can search by name, modification time, file type or file size. If you want to limit your search to a particular directory you can right click on the directory and select search. </p>
<p>If you don't already have an account, you can create one for free on <a href="https://beta.peergos.net/?signup=true">our beta</a>. Let us know what you think!</p>
<p>Stay tuned for introductions to the other new features and apps we're building as part of our <a href="https://peergos.org/posts/next-generation-internet">grant</a> from the Next Generation Internet program (<a href="https://pointer.ngi.eu/">NGI POINTER</a>).</p>

2020<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>.</p>
<p>In July, I founded <a href="https://ritza.co/">Ritza</a> - a technical publishing company that offers
(very) technical content marketing, developer advocacy as a service, and
a bunch of related publishing services. What does that mean exactly? We
publish ebooks, documentation, and blog articles, usually with the goal
of helping developers or technical managers in some way. For example, we
did <a href="https://codewithrepl.it/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->https://codewithrepl.it<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> as a
companion website for <a href="https://repl.it/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Repl.it<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>. We offer this
content on a subscription basis.</p>
<p>The title is clickbait: I’ve been working on Ritza for quite a bit
longer than 6 months, but it only became ‘real’ in July this year as a
registered business which I was devoting 100% of my time to, and – from
what I’ve seen in Maker circles – writing about how you got your
initial revenue is the best way to 2x your revenue, so the title is also
an experiment in some ways.</p>
<p>I’ve gained a lot by reading about
<a href="https://www.coryzue.com/open/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->other<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>
<a href="https://twitter.com/SahinKevin/status/1334142235051520000"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->people’s<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>
<a href="https://themakingof.carrd.co/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->transparent<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>
<a href="https://nomadlist.com/open"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->revenues<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>. That said, talking about
money is still weird for me, and I think it’s harder to be fully
transparent when offering services instead of a SaaS - there is more
customized pricing both in charging for work and paying contractors and
talking money is a sure way to get emotions up and make people feel like
they got a bad deal.</p>
<p>Here are some high level figures for the last 6 months to get it out of
the way.</p>
<h2 id="revenue">Revenue</h2>
<p>Ritza made between $6000 and $14000 revenue each month between July and
December, with a total revenue of around $58000 for the last two
quarters of 2020.</p>
<p>This was below my target of hitting $20000/month in 2020, but –
especially given circumstances – this was way better than my worst case
predictions. There was no clear overall trend, but a definite drop off
in November and December, with July and October being our best
performing months.</p>
<p>All of our contracts are month-to-month and one client went quiet in
October. While most of our revenue comes from recurring contracts, we
also did some one-off work in July through October, but none in November
or December.</p>
<p>Nearly all of our costs are from paying writers, editors, and designers.
We additionally spent money on office space that we don’t use (over
$500/month for coworking space that is tied to my ‘visa facilitation’,
which is a requirement for my visa in the Netherlands), and accounting
costs. We pay a few dollars a month for various online services, such as
GSuite and various domains, and we have credits on DigitalOcean and AWS
which take care of all of our hosting for now. We also recently picked
up a subscription to <a href="https://www.semrush.com/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->SemRush<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> - a tool
that I think is overpriced and slightly shady, but which has proven its use
in better understanding what people are searching for.</p>
<p>Overall, this revenue allows me to pay myself a ‘salary’ that pays rent
in Europe, with more cash than my previous job as Head of Technology for
a South African EdTech startup.</p>
<p>That said, my plan B after quitting my previous role was to find a full
time job remotely or in Europe. I shopped around a bit and did some
interviews for roles that were offering $150k-$200k/year + benefits so
in terms of opportunity cost I am still ‘losing’ for now and it remains
to be seen how far Ritza can scale with its current business model.</p>
<h2 id="experiments-and-content">Experiments and content</h2>
<p>Our bread-and-butter service is producing technical content: writing
<a href="https://codewithrepl.it/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->tutorials<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> and
<a href="https://datarevenue.com/en-blog"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>
<a href="https://virtasant.com/blog/data-lake-vs-data-warehouse/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->content<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>.
While our mission is to unlock marketing budgets “for good” by making
this content available for free, we have also helped companies produce
and improve internal proprietary content that they then sell.</p>
<p>On the side, I have been playing around with the idea of building online
tools to help with producing and publishing content. None of these got
the attention they needed to get off the ground, but they remain on the
back burner as ideas I’d still like to work on. They included</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://vsgraphs.ritza.co/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->‘vs’ Graphs<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> -</strong> a tool
inspired by <a href="https://medium.com/applied-data-science/the-google-vs-trick-618c8fd5359f"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->this
article<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>.
I built this because I needed it - especially for writing articles
about ‘hot’ spaces like MLOps and DevOps, it’s easy to get
overwhelmed by the sheer number of tools, products, and services.
This visualisation makes it easy to explore a new area and find
the most popular products, as well as to find out how a specific
product ‘fits in’ (“Oh X plays in the same space as SageMaker”).
This is also useful to write ‘<a href="https://datarevenue.com/en-blog/data-dashboarding-streamlit-vs-dash-vs-shiny-vs-voila"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->x vs y vs
z<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>’
articles, which turn out to be very low hanging fruit in terms of
ranking well on Google. If you’ve ever tried to find out how two
products or services compare and found yourself frustrated at all
the low quality ‘alternativeTo-like’ pages you’ll know why these
articles are useful, and I ended up also building a <a href="http://versus.ritza.co/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->related
tool<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> to outline these articles
automatically. The fun part about this was that I built it in a
single train ride using only my iPad and repl.it, which felt like
a big step in the direction of being able to code as a nomad.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://ratemycopy.ritza.co/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Rate my Copy<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></strong> - Also while
researching products and services, I got annoyed at how cliched
most landing page copy is, and even more annoyed by how
uninformative it is. I scraped over 20000 landing pages for online
products and services and built a database of the most commonly
used cliches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://ritza.co/experiments/opinionated-tutorial-publisher.html"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Opinionated tutorial
Publisher<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></strong> -
while most of our clients have their own systems already in place
to host the content we produce, I was frustrated at how hard it
was to generate a lightweight, good looking page with writing,
code samples, and images. There’s a long way to go on the design
still, but some of the other pieces are in place.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I won’t link to all the content we produced in 2020, but some highlights
are</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.codewithrepl.it/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->CodeWithRepl.it<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> -</strong> a set
of tutorials, also in book form. This was very well received on
reddit and continues to rank well for a variety of search terms. I
am strongly against most kinds of tracking, but caved at the end
of the year and installed Plausible Analytics on it, which also
makes it easy to share publicly everything we track:
<a href="https://plausible.io/codewithrepl.it"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->https://plausible.io/codewithrepl.it<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>.
Traffic has died off a lot at the end of the year (based on some
server logs analytics I did), but rankings continue to improve and
I think the content is in pretty good shape now (we’ve done
several sets of updates since initially publishing it).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong><a href="https://datarevenue.com/en-blog"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->DataRevenue Blog<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a></strong> -
This is the project I’ve personally learned the most from this
year, writing about everything from general machine learning
through BioTech (I didn’t even know what Metabolomics was in 2019,
so there was a steep learning curve to write some of the articles
about that).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="growing-a-team">Growing a team</h2>
<p>While we initially mainly worked ad-hoc with contractors on various
projects, towards the end of the year Ritza started feeling like a real
company with a core team. <a href="https://dev.to/eugenedorfling/technical-writing-internship-it-can-only-get-better-from-here-10ma"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->Eugene
Dorfling<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>
joined in October for a full time internship and is continuing in 2021
as an Associate Developer Advocate. Several other freelancers have
regularly worked on projects throughout the year. I’m still trying to
figure out if the next full time hire should be a senior writer (to take
over some of the writing I am doing), or a managing editor (to help out
with client feedback and all the nitty-gritty but super important
aspects of getting from ‘first draft’ to ‘production’), but I’m leaning
more towards the latter.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ritza">What IS Ritza?</h2>
<p>Friends and family still don’t really understand what Ritza is. I get a
lot of “uh, so you make IT manuals, right? Isn’t that just telling
people to turn stuff off and on again until it works?”</p>
<p>Ritza is probably closest to a ‘content marketing agency’ at this stage.
But I really dislike most content marketing agencies. Not to name and
shame, but there’s definitely decent demand for very low cost content
such as
<a href="https://contentfly.com/blog/tag/content-sample/"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->https://contentfly.com/blog/tag/content-sample/<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a>,
and I honestly can’t see how that adds any value to the world at all, so
I want to avoid being pulled in that direction or associated with
content like that.</p>
<p>My initial response to this was to try to move towards “Developer
Advocacy as a Service”, but it doesn’t really roll off the tongue, and
I’m not sure that “Developer Advocacy” is actually a job that will
survive the Tech Bubble I’m convinced we’re in.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the year, it became clear that Ritza is simply a
publishing company (or at least the very beginnings of one). We are
slowly becoming experts in the entire publishing pipeline, from sourcing
high quality writing, through editing, designing, publishing, and
distributing. While we have started out with a strong focus on technical
content, there’s no reason that that has to remain a core focus forever.
I’ve had pretty mediocre experiences with technical publishing companies
like PacktPub and I believe non-tech publishers that have existed for
decades or centuries are even more in need of a bit of modernization.</p>
<p>I previously helped my Dad publish his first book of (hilarious)
<a href="http://leanpub.com/doctor"><!-- raw HTML omitted -->memoirs as a Doctor in Africa<!-- raw HTML omitted --></a> and
during the slower period between Christmas and New Year now I spent some
time tweaking the landing page, making a sample available, and doing
some marketing. So far, all I’ve done is burn $50 on Reddit ads that led
to zero sales, but I think with some experimentation with different
distribution channels there’s more potential. Stay tuned.</p>

<p><a href="https://drone.kaijucode.com/matt/dug" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://drone.kaijucode.com/api/badges/matt/dug/status.svg" alt="Build Status"></a></p>
<p>The <strong>real</strong> repository is located <a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<p>The GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/unfrl/dug" rel="nofollow">here</a> is used for issues and stars <span aria-label="glowing star">🌟</span></p>
<p>A powerful global DNS progagation checker that can output in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>The goal of dug is to make it easy to check the propagation of DNS records. It is also capable of providing templated output that can be used in scripts for things like monitoring.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Until theres a wiki for this, the easiest way to explore dug is through the help.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dug help</code> -&gt; Get top level help explaining the different verbs</li>
<li><code>dug help run</code> or <code>dug run --help</code> -&gt; Get details about a specific verb (run, which is the default)</li>
<li><code>dug help update</code> or <code>dug update --help</code> -&gt; Get details about the update verb</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest way to get started is to just run a query against the domain whose DNS records you’re updating.
For example: <code>dug git.kaijucode.com</code>:
<a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif1.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif1.gif" alt=""></a></p>
<p>You can also do complicated things like ask for specific record types, get the output as json, and pipe it into other applications: <code>dug git.kaijucode.com -q A --output-format JSON --output-template Ipaddress,city,value,responsetime | jq</code>:
<a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif2.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif2.gif" alt=""></a></p>

<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/releases" rel="nofollow">latest release</a> and download the .deb package.
<ul>
<li>It should look like <code>dug.&lt;version&gt;.linux-x64.deb</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On most distros double clicking the .deb package will allow you to install via a UI, alternatively it can be installed by running <code>sudo dpkg -i ./dug.&lt;version&gt;.linux-x64.deb</code></li>
</ol>
<h3 id="user-content-linux-rpm-rhel-centos-fedora">Linux RPM (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora)</h3>

</ul>
</li>
<li>You should be able to download that, make is executable, and run it from the terminal. Then you can put it somewhere and update your path so you can execute it from anywhere.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="user-content-windows">Windows</h3>
<h4 id="user-content-chocolatey-choco-cli">Chocolatey (choco cli)</h4>
<blockquote>
<p>Waiting on chocolatey to approve my package, then I can publish there so this wont require a manual download. <a href="https://chocolatey.org/packages/dug" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>EXPERIMENTAL! (Currently only supports linux-x64)</p>
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Run: <code>npm -g @unfrl/dug</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Idk why I wanted to publish it on npm as well, its really not a good way to distribute a binary...</p>
<h2 id="user-content-development">Development</h2>
<p>This is a .net 5 project, so as long as you have the dotnet cli, available <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0" rel="nofollow">here</a> you should be able to do the following: <code>dotnet build ./cli</code></p>
<p>The project was developed in VSCode so the debugger profiles that I have used are available if you’re also using VSCode.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-license">License</h2>
<p>The license used by dug, <a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/src/branch/main/cli/LICENSE" rel="nofollow">here</a>, is very explicitly designed to try to keep capitalists from benefiting from this tool. This is not a traditional license but it is very simple, please read it.</p>

<p>At the time of this post, I have lived in Alexandria City for 22 years, but I was not born here. </p>



<p>Many of the posts I’ve written here are to do with places and events related to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hampton_Roads">Hampton Roads</a> area, where I grew up. <a href="https://nostalgicvirginian.com/2015/07/remembering-coliseum-mall/">One such post</a> shares my memories and experiences connected to Coliseum Mall that once was, in the City of Hampton in southern Virginia. (I spent a quite a bit of time there, as a youth.) </p>



<p>My wife, on the other hand, <em>was</em> born here. Well, not here in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria,_Virginia">Alexandria</a> where we currently reside, but just a couple of miles west in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annandale,_Virginia">Annandale</a>. The Strathmeade neighborhood in which she lived as a youth is located in the northwest portion of Annandale, putting it close to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tysons,_Virginia">Tysons Corner area</a> in McLean / Vienna, which is home to not one but two of the most famous malls in America, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tysons_Corner_Center">Tysons Corner Center</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tysons_Galleria">Tysons Galleria</a>. In her youth, she and her crew of friends would walk a few blocks, jump on a bus (for only a quarter), and hang out at Tysons on many of those wide-open summer days. But, for any real structured shopping missions, it was another nearby mall she and her family patronized: Landmark Shopping Center.</p>

<p>Landmark Shopping Center, originally an outdoor mall located at the far western edge of Alexandria City at 5801 Duke Street, immediately off of Interstate 395 at exit 3, officially opened it doors in October of 1965 with 32 stores including anchors The Hecht Co., Sears and Roebuck, and Woodward and Lothrop. As originally opened, Landmark was a 675,000-square-foot center with a 4,000-space parking lot, the largest in the city.</p>



<p>In 1990, Landmark underwent a massive re-development during which it was converted from a single-story outdoor complex to a fully-enclosed three-story mall. </p>



<p>During the process of buying the house in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandria_Historic_District">Old Town Alexandria</a> that my then-fiancée and I would move into in the summer of 1998, I made several trips up to the area from Charlottesville to meet with our realtor. Northern Virginia was still quite alien to me at that time, and the first notable part of Alexandria that I spotted on every trip as I exited the Interstate was Landmark Mall. </p>



<p>My wife and I did much of our shopping at Landmark for the next 15 years. (We didn’t even log into Amazon at all until 2000/01.) I remember frequenting their nicely varied food court on the third floor, Barnie’s coffee shop just inside the front entrance, a video game store where I bought more than a few titles over the years, the arcade, Waldenbooks, FYE, Sears, Macy’s, and a variety of other shops over the years. I even got my hair cut their regularly, at Bubbles. A list of all stores within the mall as it existed in October 2004 is shown below, taken from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20041023162139/http://www.landmarkmall.com/html/storedirectory.asp">an archive</a> of the Landmark website.</p>

<p>When our daughter was a toddler we started taking her to <a href="https://nostalgicvirginian.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/carousel2.jpg">the open play area</a> in the center of the bottom floor. For a while there was  a train for kids that ran the perimeter of the lower floors. I recall squeezing myself on board a few times to take the ride with my daughter. There was even a traveling carnival that would take up camp in the front parking lot for a while, most summers. Those were good times and they formed very pleasant memories. </p>

<p>As the years wore on, though, the place started to dry up. Shops started closing one by one and with 2010 a few years behind us it was becoming a rather desolate space. At the time, the Howard Hughes Corporation had <a href="http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2013/jun/27/winds-change-landmark/">plans to revitalize the mall into a booming urban town</a>, but these never came to fruition. (An archived Howard Hugues <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160317220321/http://thenewlandmark.com/">development page</a> gives a glimpse of what “The New Landmark” might have been.) More and more shops closed, with Macy’s shuttering on January 4, 2017 (it was later turned into a homeless shelter). Tenants were told to vacate the space by January 31 of that same year, and that was basically the end of Landmark Mall. </p>



<p>I consider the ’80s to be the golden time of my youth. I am a <em>massive</em> fan of all-things-’80s — to the extreme — as my daughter could painfully tell you. This being the case, I was quite intrigued to hear that the derelict mall was being made up as a set for a portion of the in-development movie <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wonder_Woman_1984">Wonder Woman 1984</a></em> (which, as a film I must say, is not exactly my cup of tea). To facilitate this, all three floors of the central core of the mall were made into a visage of what the fully-enclosed mall may have looked like in the mid-’80s, had it then existed as such (as opposed to the outdoor center designed in the ’60s that it was). I was anxious to see the result, and a few months ago a teaser trailer for the movie was released that showed just that (and the movie has since been released). It <em>is</em> pretty glorious, in that glowing, neon ’80s way. </p>

<p>A desire to share a few glimpses of Landmark Mall “from the ’80s” is what prompted me to put this post together, sharing my own memories of this place, in the doing. Landmark making its way to the silver screen, even though “in costume,” seems a nice last hoorah for this now-dead mall.</p>

<p>The final chapter in this story is <a href="https://alexandrialivingmagazine.com/news/the-leftover-acres-inova-alexandria-development-landmark-mall-retail-housing/">the news that landed in just the past few weeks</a>. The Landmark Mall complex will be converted to an Inova medical campus and community area. (Inova is a leading hospital network in the region.) The land will be put to good use, but after all these years, the mall is no more.</p>

      <p>Growing a newsletter is the hardest part about running a successful newsletter. No matter if you're just starting out or if your newsletter has 10k+ subscribers. It doesn't get easier, but there are many ways to that can facilitate growth.</p><p>Growth by organic ways like word of mouth is possible but only works if you already people talking about your newsletter. It isn't the most viable solution in the beginning.</p><p>To reach a wider audience you'll have to go where your audience dwells, you can start with Twitter, Reddit, Quora, &nbsp;IndieHackers, or communties on Slack and Discord. These channels have a diversified audience but is only one of the many tools a newsletter creator has in their tool chest of growth. One of the best solutions is to list your newsletter in newsletter directories. It's very similar to the classifieds we see on newspapers but focused towards newsletters.</p><h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2><p>Submitting your newsletter to directories have multi-fold benefits. Below are all of the benefits you'll receive when you submit your newsletter to a directory.</p><h3 id="seo">SEO</h3><p>SEO is one of the most sought after growth avenues for newsletters. When you submit your newsletter to a directory you'll receive SEO in the form of a backlink to your newsletter.</p><p>What does that mean? When someone searches for anything on Google or any search engine, they usually place sites with the most backlinks at the top. It takes months and years to build up sufficient backlinks to rank for popular search phrases that your newsletter wants to compete for.</p><p>SEO is the long game and submitting your newsletter to all 21+ newsletter directories gives your newsletter a backlink boost.</p><p>The main goal of a newsletter directory is to help others discover amazing newsletters to read. This usually means that they want to spread the word as far as possible. Most newsletter directories have multiple social media accounts and will usually share to their audience any new newsletter that's submitted. It's nothing crazy in terms of growth, but it does give a little boost.</p><p>Most newsletter directories provide ways for visitors to share your newsletter to their audience as well, adding to the compounding effect.</p><!--kg-card-begin: html--><figure>

Capitalize on the interest of those visitors by submitting your newsletter. The more eyes your newsletter is in front of the more you'll grow.</p><h3 id="passive-growth">Passive Growth</h3><p>One of the most interesting benefits of submitting your newsletter to a directory is the passive growth you'll receive. Do the work of submitting your newsletter once, get passive subscribe growth forever. Every weekly you'll slowly grow from this channel without needing to think twice.</p><p>Nick Frost from <a href="https://www.newsletters.co/">Newsletters.co</a> and <a href="https://inboxstash.com/">InboxStash</a> says to expect about 10-20 new subscribers the first week you submit to a newsletter directory. Also a newsletter directories authority grows, growth picks up for all newsletters.

            <p>All about Newsletter Directories with Nick Frost</p>
            <p>About this episode: This week we have Nick Frost, the expert on newsletter directories. Nick runs two of the most popular newsletter directories, newsletters.co and inboxstash.com. We've been hearing a lot of questions about what newsletter directories are, what they're used for, why you should submit to them, and what benefits they provide. So we wanted to bring Nick on and have him answer them all.

<p>Before starting to form the content of this page, I decided to check how the events related to Covid-19 – lockdowns, no commutes, no travels – impacted our reading habits.</p>



<p>What I found wasn’t that surprising. Some news sites reported that <a aria-label="reading books has surged (opens in a new tab)" href="https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/may/15/research-reading-books-surged-lockdown-thrillers-crime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reading books has surged</a> during lockdowns others pointed out <a aria-label="completely the opposite (opens in a new tab)" href="https://theconversation.com/how-reading-habits-have-changed-during-the-covid-19-lockdown-146894" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">completely the opposite</a> – that a lot of folks were unable to concentrate and their progress with books was snail-like slow.</p>



<p>Why some people were able to read more while others struggled? Well, based on my findings, I can say that people who had difficulties concentrating all had one thing in common – kids.</p>



<p>Personally, I can familiarize myself more with the second group and categorize my reading habits as spectacularly fragmented. Yes, I’m a victim of domestic dysfunction. My son learned to walk around May of 2020 and what was previously a well-arranged apartment now looks like a little arena full of scattered toys and torn apart children’s books. I’m not saying this to complain, simply to give you perspective.</p>



<p>Fortunately, somehow, I was able to read the number of books I had set as a goal at the beginning of the year – 41 books. And to be honest, I’m quite thrilled about the titles I found in 2020. If you check my <a aria-label="book summaries page (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/category/book-summaries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">book summaries page</a> chronologically, you’ll see that I focused more on philosophy and psychology books. And also, you’ll probably see more unfamiliar titles. Yes, I no longer romanticize popular books.</p>



<p>Let me explain…</p>



<p>My initial intention when I started this site was to pick famous books that are categorized as best-sellers. The more I consumed those “celebrities” books, though, the more I realized that they don’t deserve the attention they get. Most of the books sitting on top of the charts are usually there because the marketing around the book is pretty decent. But best-seller books doesn’t mean best-content books. The truly eye-opening books are such that aren’t widely known to the public – I learned this the hard way. That’s why I focused more on finding books that are not that famous but on the other hand, are far superior in terms of quality.</p>



<p>So, without further ado, let me show you the best books I read in 2020. Hopefully, this reading list will help you find your next addition to your library.</p>

<h4 id="3-why-the-book-is-good">Why the book is good?</h4>



<p>I was quite hesitant to start this book. After all, why would you want to read a whole book – more than 400 pages – on how to read a book? But let me tell you, I’m glad I got the book and read it. This book gives you a unique perspective on how to approach reading and learning in general. If you consider yourself a lifelong learner, if you are interested in making positive improvements in your life, you absolutely need to read this book.</p>



<h4 id="4-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>You improve as a reader when you begin to ask better questions before and while you read. Consuming content printed on paper shouldn’t be considered a one-way type of communication where the author is doing all the talking. You should ask questions all the time and find the answers inside the text by yourself.</p>

<h4 id="8-why-the-book-is-good">Why the book is good?</h4>



<p>The ability to concentrate in a world full of distractions is an important skill. Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi explains what needs to happen in your mind, and life, so you can focus better and get more done. Interestingly, the first thing someone needs to do is not related to blocking distractions. Csikszentmihalyi explains that reaching the <a href="https://durmonski.com/productivity/the-flow-state/" target="_blank" aria-label="flow state (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">flow state</a> happens when what you’re doing, the actual task, is something you truly love doing.</p>



<h4 id="9-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>Deep, wickedly intense concentration is closely related to happiness. When you love what you do, you’ll naturally enter the state of optimal experience. Therefore, your lack of focus comes from a busy life. A life where nothing is prioritized, everything is important. To focus better, and to actually feel better, find one task that is important for you.</p>

<h4 id="13-why-the-book-is-good">Why the book is good?</h4>



<p>The writing style of Ryan Holiday reminds me of Robert Greene. And I love Greene’s books. Every chapter starts with a history-related story and based on the mentioned facts, a certain conclusion is formed. The Obstacle Is the Way is worth checking if you are currently in a pit. If you feel stuck and nothing seems to matter. The proposed ideas by Holiday inside will give you a new perspective on how to deal with hardship.</p>



<h4 id="14-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>“It’s supposed to be hard.” These simple words are still stuck in my head. I remind myself of this paragraph from the book every time I encounter difficulties and my progress stalls. Life can be portrayed as a <a href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/overcoming-obstacles/" target="_blank" aria-label="series of obstacles (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">series of obstacles</a> where things don’t get easier, it’s quite the opposite. Things get harder as you move. But this shouldn’t feel discouraging, it should motivate us to keep moving.</p>

<h4 id="18-why-the-book-is-good">Why the book is good?</h4>



<p>This is not a light read. In fact, you’ll most probably walk around with a couple of dictionaries while advancing through the text. Believe me, though, every minute spent on digesting the text is worth it. Kegan presents a profound evolutionary theory that aims to explain through what stages we go as human beings. Meaning that if you’re feeling currently stuck, thanks to the text, you can spot where you are and what you need to do in order to advance in life.</p>



<h4 id="19-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>You’re constantly changing. Not only physically, but also psychologically. Robert Kegan points out that you can better understand others, and yourself, by understanding where they are (and you are) in the human evolutionary stages. Initially, we’re extremely attached to physical things – <a href="https://durmonski.com/psychology/subject-object-relationship/" target="_blank" aria-label="called subject-object relationship (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">called subject-object relationship</a>. With age, we focus more on communities and relationships.</p>

<h4 id="23-why-the-book-is-good">Why the book is good?</h4>



<p>Susan Cain takes us on a journey to “introvert land.” In Quiet, the author explains the main differences between extroverts and introverts. Why the majority is keen on listening to the loudest person in the room and what you can do, if you’re sworn loner, to express your ideas better. Essentially, this book is something like a how-to-survive-in-a-alpha-dominated-world guide for quiet people.</p>



<h4 id="24-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>People are predisposed to believe people who loudly and clearly express their ideas. What they share can be terribly wrong but the enthusiasm in their voice is a lot of times convincing enough for the general audience.</p>

<p>Talent is not god-given and your abilities are not fixed. The main goal of Carol S. Dweck in the book is to convince us that we’re all capable of success. We only need to realize that the skills you want, but don’t currently possess, are within reach if you’re willing to work for them. Mindset is full of stories of famous people who were able to become popular through hard work, not with their natural talent.</p>



<h4 id="29-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>Success is not a one-time thing. It’s a continuous process. You don’t sweat in the gym to win one gold medal. You exercise daily to become great and <em>stay </em>great. If you want to advance in a field, any field, you first need to change your perspective about what success means. It’s always a process, not a one-off thing.</p>

<p>The text is a dissertation of the famous mimetic theory by René Girard. The author, Wolfgang Palaver, explains how the theory was formed, why it’s true, and what we can do to prepare ourselves for the resulting bad consequences. Or in other words, how to mitigate the negative influence of the outside world and create our own genuine worldview.</p>



<h4 id="34-key-takeaway">Key takeaway:</h4>



<p>Our desires and ambitions are projections of the desires and the ambitions of the people that are closest to us. This is both good and bad. It’s good if what our friends and family strive for is noble. It’s bad because, usually, what others want is not what we want – and also a lot of times vain and superficial. Therefore, if we choose to follow the outside “wants”, we …</p></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><span>We’ve had an idea for years since we first had to deal with the problem everyone who works with cloud services encountered. We ended up locked into public cloud providers and moving was just too complicated. Our developers were spending a lot of time on managing the cloud infrastructure they could instead dedicate to the innovations they wanted to build.&nbsp;</span></p>
<!--more-->
<p><span><br></span><span>Then it struck us. What if you could just migrate between cloud providers in seconds while achieving the best cost and performance combination? Can you deploy your application to the cloud in one day or maybe even in a few hours? Is it even possible? In theory, yes. But will it work?&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It took us some time to answer all these questions, but today we are happy to announce the first multi-cloud platform called CAST AI.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span><br></span><span>We built CAST AI with a few ideas in mind:&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Developers should have a tool to take advantage of everything that AWS, Azure, and other public cloud vendors offer.&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><span>Moving between cloud services should be easy so that developers can always benefit from the best combination of cost and performance.</span></li>
<li><span>Companies should never end up wasting the cloud resources they pay for again.</span></li>
<li><span>We want to save thousands of developer lifetimes and billions of company expenses on cloud computing.&nbsp;<br></span><span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>CAST AI connects AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud into one multi-cloud platform, allowing its users to deploy, manage, and cost-optimize applications in multiple clouds simultaneously. On a single cluster.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>After months of hard work, we’re finally ready to show it to you. </span><span><p><img src="https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=1200&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg" alt="cast_launch_blog.png-1" width="1200" srcset="https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=600&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 600w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=1200&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 1200w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=1800&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 1800w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=2400&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 2400w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=3000&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 3000w, https://resources.cast.ai/hs-fs/hubfs/cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg?width=3600&amp;name=cast_launch_blog.png-1.jpeg 3600w" sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px"></p></span></p>
<h2><span>What can you expect from CAST AI?</span></h2>
<p><strong><span>Multi-cloud capabilities</span></strong></p>
<p><span>We connect the clouds via a secure network mesh so that any cloud services of one provider are available on any other cloud. No more vendor lock-in, no more cloud waste. You can finally take advantage of everything that AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud have to offer.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Autoscaling</span></strong></p>
<p><span>An autoscaler that follows policies you set for it adjusts compute resources in real time - adding workload replicas when the application needs it. You get an infrastructure that is constantly resized to fit your application’s needs.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Opinionated and production-ready</span></strong></p>
<p><span>When creating a Kubernetes cluster in CAST AI, you get a few predetermined configuration choices that take you a step closer to production. We made some choices about logging, metrics, and health checks using our many years of Kubernetes expertise. The networking configuration allows for maximum observability while maintaining excellent performance.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Auto-healing&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
<p><span>If anything goes wrong or a component is accidentally deleted, you don’t need to worry. CAST AI will bring your cluster back to a healthy state.</span></p>
<p><strong><span>Built-in observability</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Your cluster will automatically come with Prometheus for Metrics collection, ElasticSearch and Filebeat for log collection and indexing, and a single sign-on to observability frontends (Kibana for logs and Grafana for metrics).</span></p>
<p><strong><span>You can leave anytime</span></strong></p>
<p><span>Want to stop using CAST AI? No problem, you can leave anytime. Your cluster will stay operational even if you’ve been using our multi-cloud features.</span></p>
<h2><span>Early birds: everyone is welcome to join for Free&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span>Early birds get up to 20 CPUs for free and pay no subscription fee. Our Engineering and product teams are looking forward to your feedback. We are building CAST AI to make developers' jobs easier, so don’t hesitate to ping us with any suggestions and join our community. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>We’re an open community of cloud users, so feel free to join us and have a chat with our engineers and founders on <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/castai-community/shared_invite/zt-i8fcn2xi-sM_iONKn35NmYR2E3dtfng" rel="noopener">Slack. </a><p>And of course, if you would like to get a demo, you can register <a href="https://cast.ai/get-a-demo" rel="noopener">here.</a></p></span><span>&nbsp;</span><span><br></span><span>After months of hard work, we're looking for your feedback. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Join us for this journey and fight.&nbsp;</span></p>

    <p>As mentioned in the <a href="https://naildrivin5.com/blog/2019/11/11/solid-is-not-solid-rexamining-the-single-responsibility-principle.html">original post</a>, I’m realizing that the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID">SOLID</a> principles are not as…solid
as it would seem.  The <a href="https://naildrivin5.com/blog/2019/11/11/solid-is-not-solid-rexamining-the-single-responsibility-principle.html">first post</a> outlined the problems I see with the Single Responsibility
Principle, but now I’d like to talk about the most confusing of the five, the Open/Closed Principle.</p>

<p>This principle states that software should be “open for extension, but closed for modification”. I find this
summary extremely confusing and when I dug deeper I found a whole lot of bad advice.  You should ignore this principle entirely.  Let’s see why.</p>

<!-- more -->

<h2 id="what-the-openclosed-principle-means">What The Open/Closed Principle Means</h2>

<p>This principle (as it is understood by SOLID) was developed by Robert Martin<a name="back-1"></a><a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a> in a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20060822033314/http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/ocp.pdf">paper he wrote</a>, based on Bertrand Meyer’s statements in the book <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Oriented_Software_Construction">Object-Oriented Software Construction</a>.</p>

<p>Martin paraphrases Meyer thusly:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He then defines “open for extension” as a module that can be made to “behave in new and different ways as the requirements of the application change, or to meet the needs of new applications”.  He defines “closed for modification” as when “no one is allowed to make source code changes to it”.</p>

<p>Huh?  This seems exactly backwards.</p>

<p>Adding un-needed flexibility to code (to make it open for extension) breeds complexity and carrying cost. It
requires imagining all sorts of use-cases that don’t exist in order to make it ultimately flexible.  This wastes
time, creates more complex and complicated code, and requires that you maintain, in perpetuity, all this flexibility that you don’t need.</p>

<p>This is not nearly as odd as the notion that you cannot change the source code.  How are we to fix bugs if we
cannot change the code?  Delete it and start over?  This part of the principle is so seemingly wrong that it makes
me question my own perception of reality.</p>

<p>Digging into the paper, it appears to be making the statement that classes should depend on abstract base classes,
so that you can swap out the implementations of a particular class without affecting the consumers of that
class. And since this is a <em>principle</em>, my interpretation is that you should always do this.</p>

<p>It’s bad advice.  Flexibility is almost never needed and almost always creates more problems than it solves.  It
can also make it hard to understand the system’s behavior.</p>

<h2 id="flexibility-is-expensive">Flexibility is Expensive</h2>

<p>All things being equal, code that is more flexible is more difficult to build, test, and maintain.  Building
features into your code that you don’t need is extra work.  Based on the concept of carrying costs alone, the
work required to make a class “open for extension” should be avoided. If you don’t need flexibility, don’t build
it.</p>

<p>One of those carrying costs is the ability to understand the system’s behavior.  Highly flexible code creates a
lot of code paths to navigate, and the type of flexibility demonstrated in the paper—added abstract base
classes—makes those code paths hard to discover.</p>

<p>Let’s see what we’re talking about.  The paper shows an example of a <code>Client</code> that depends on a <code>Server</code>:</p>

<p>Here’s what that code might look like in Java (Ruby makes it hard to see this because Ruby has no type annotations):</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Client</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>private</span> <span>Server</span> <span>server</span><span>;</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>Client</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Server</span><span>();</span>
  <span>}</span>

  <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>saveSomeData</span><span>(</span><span>String</span> <span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>server</span><span>.</span><span>post</span><span>(</span><span>"/foo"</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>);</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Server</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>String</span> <span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span> <span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ....</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>According to the Open/Closed Principle, this class is not open for extension, since we always use a concrete
<code>Server</code> instance, and it is also not closed for modification, because if we wish to change to another type of server, we must change the source code.</p>

<p>It is not a foregone conclusion that we <em>need</em> to make those changes.  It is also not clear that if we do, in
fact, need flexibility, then this class is where that flexibility must be added.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, this is what the paper (and thus the principle) says is how we should address this issue.  We should
introduce an abstract base class for our server implementation and have <code>Client</code> depend on that instead.</p>

  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In Java, this looks like so:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>public</span> <span>abstract</span> <span>class</span> <span>AbstractServer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>abstract</span> <span>void</span> <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>String</span> <span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span> <span>data</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Server</span> <span>extends</span> <span>AbstractServer</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>void</span> <span>post</span><span>(</span><span>String</span> <span>url</span><span>,</span> <span>String</span> <span>data</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>// ....</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>public</span> <span>class</span> <span>Client</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>public</span> <span>Client</span><span>(</span><span>AbstractServer</span> <span>server</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>this</span><span>.</span><span>server</span> <span>=</span> <span>server</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then, whenever we create <code>Client</code> instances, we pass in the concrete implementation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>Client</span> <span>client</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Client</span><span>(</span><span>new</span> <span>Server</span><span>())</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code>Client</code> is now open for extension, since we can pass an alternate implementation of <code>AbstractServer</code> into it, and it’s closed for modification because we don’t have to change the source in order to do that.</p>

<p>While this is a more flexible design, is it better?  I don’t think it is <em>definitely</em> better. If we never need
more than one <code>Server</code>, then we have added un-needed features to our code, and we must now maintain that.  It may
seem trivial in this example, but imagine an entire codebase built like this.  I have worked on one, and it was
not pleasant.  Writing code for it required the extra step of making abstract base classes (or interfaces) when
none were needed.</p>

<p>But it also made it <em>really</em> hard to explain and predict the system’s behavior.</p>



<h2 id="understanding-system-behavior-is-paramount">Understanding System Behavior is Paramount</h2>

<p>As programmers we must <em>frequently</em> explain and understand the system’s actual behavior.  We must diagnose and fix bugs, explain to others what happened in the system, or make changes to add features.</p>

<p>In the first implementation—which violates the Open/Closed Principle—it’s pretty easy to explain the system’s
behavior because it’s not flexible.  <code>Client</code> always uses a <code>Server</code>, so the path through the code is clear.</p>

<p>In the second implementation, however, it’s more difficult. Assuming we don’t know if <code>Server</code> is the only
implementation of <code>AbstractServer</code>, to understand the system’s observed behavior, we have to track down all uses
of <code>Client</code> to figure out which <code>AbstractServer</code> implementation was used, and then figure out which path through
the code used which one.</p>

<p>Imagine doing that to find that there is only one implementation of <code>AbstractServer</code>.</p>

<p>When you design your classes to be more flexible than the system needs them to be, you create complexity.  When
programmers add flexibility that they think they might need, the idea is to save time later by adding flexibility
now.  But you just don’t always know what sort of flexibility you need.  To make the system <em>truly</em> flexible, it
should implement only what it needs to and be well-tested.</p>

<p>My advice: <strong>Ignore the Open/Close Principle entirely. Write code to solve the problems you have.</strong></p>

<p>As we examine the remaining SOLID principles, we’ll see a recurring theme of adding flexibility when none is
needed, all in the name of…well…I’m not sure.</p>

<p>Next up is the Liskov Substitution Principle.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>I’ve been writing a DNS implementation in Rust.
This project started out as a vehicle for learning Rust, but the more I learned, the more challenging goals I was able to set, to the point where I can see its potential to become useful in its own right.
Here’s a post about what I’ve learned so far while writing <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nonymous">nonymous</a>, an embedded-friendly DNS library with <code>#![no_std]</code> and no-alloc support, and <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bore">bore(1)</a>, a CLI tool for sending DNS queries.</p><p>Rust already has <a href="https://github.com/bluejekyll/trust-dns">a mature DNS implementation</a> that I’ve heard wonderful things about, and there’s a <em>long</em> way to go before <a href="https://crates.io/crates/nonymous">nonymous</a> approaches anything resembling feature-complete or production-ready.
But <a href="https://crates.io/crates/bore">bore(1)</a> is useful enough that I actually reach for it in 90% of the situations I would have previously used dig(1)…</p><p>…and some situations that the incumbent struggles with, like dumping, replaying, and debugging messages.</p><p>DNS is a distributed database that stores information in a hierarchy of names.
The most familiar example of these is IP addresses (the information) and hostnames (the names).
This is how your browser knows to contact 107.191.57.160 when you go to <a href="https://opacus.daz.cat/">opacus.daz.cat</a>.</p><p>Let’s explore the challenges behind the first two.</p><div>

    <!-- FIXME jekyll option? -->
    <h2 id="naïve-decoders">Naïve decoders</h2>

    <p>My initial approach was based around a trait that would describe a type that we can instantiate from something we can <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html"><code>Read</code></a>.
After all, the network is just like a stream that you pipe into your program… right?</p>

    <figure>
      <div>
        <div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>trait</span> <span>Decode</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Read</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>:</span> <span>'static</span> <span>+</span> <span>Sized</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>decode</span><span>(</span><span>source</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>E</span><span>&gt;</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </div>
    </figure>

    <p>So if we defined a <code>Message</code> type that represents a message, we could then define how to parse one out of an octet stream.</p>

    <figure>
      <div>
        <div><div><pre><code><span>/// ```rust</span>
<span>/// let mut source = &amp;b"\x13\x13\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"[..];</span>
<span>/// let message = Message::decode(&amp;mut source)?;</span>
<span>/// ```</span>
<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Message</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>header</span><span>:</span> <span>Header</span><span>,</span>

<span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Header</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>u16</span><span>,</span>

    <span>opcode</span><span>:</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span>
    <span>aa</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>,</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>impl</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>:</span> <span>Read</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>Decode</span><span>&lt;</span><span>T</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageError</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>for</span> <span>Message</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>fn</span> <span>decode</span><span>(</span><span>source</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>T</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>Self</span><span>,</span> <span>MessageError</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>let</span> <span>header</span> <span>=</span> <span>Header</span><span>::</span><span>decode</span><span>(</span><span>source</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
        <span>// ...</span>

        <span>Ok</span><span>(</span><span>Self</span> <span>{</span> <span>header</span><span>,</span> <span>/* ... */</span> <span>})</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </div>
    </figure>

    <p>This approach has a few problems.
The most obvious one is that <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/io/trait.Read.html"><code>Read</code></a> isn’t available in <code>#![no_std]</code>, but this wouldn’t be too hard to work around with a shim trait.</p>

    <p>A deeper problem is that parsing DNS messages in one pass without random access is incompatible with <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1035#section-4.1.4"><strong>message compression</strong></a>, which allows names <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3597#section-4">in some places</a> to “point” to labels somewhere else in the message.
For example, this message represents <code>a.root-servers.net.</code> in full, then reuses part of that with <code>b.</code> followed by “go to 1Eh for the rest”:</p>

</picture></div>
</figure>

    <p>The solution I reached for here was, in retrospect, very inelegant: a pair of <code>Read</code> adapters that allow the caller to read behind or ahead (respectively) of the current position in the underlying stream.</p>

        <p>Note that many of the names of types and other symbols have been changed to make this post more clear and consistent. For example, <code>Rewind</code> was actually called <code>Elephant</code>(?!), and I actually flip-flopped between <code>View</code> and <code>Consume</code>.</p>

  <div id="hg-v1">

    <p>This approach only made sense under the premise that we should be able to stream DNS messages from a <code>Read</code> into the decoder, a premise that I clung to because I thought we might not know how long a message is without decoding it.</p>

    <p>As it turns out, this isn’t actually a problem for DNS as used with its two most common transports.
For UDP, each datagram contains exactly one message, and datagrams are inherently of fixed length.
For TCP, streams can convey many messages, but the sender has to prefix each message with its length.</p>

    <p>With that cleared up, I decided that this kind of “streaming” decoder wasn’t worth the effort, and I went back to the drawing board.</p>

    <hr>

    <h3 id="zero-copy-views">Zero-copy views</h3>

    <p>While I was at the drawing board, I also started developing some ideas that would pave the way for zero-copy decoding.</p>

    <p>Looking back at the old <code>Header</code> design below, notice how we painstakingly unpack everything from each field into neat little Rust fields?
Each thing we unpack involves some copying that adds precious instructions to the critical path.</p>

    <figure>
      <div>
        <div><div><pre><code><span>pub</span> <span>struct</span> <span>Header</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>id</span><span>:</span> <span>u16</span><span>,</span>
    <span>qr</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>,</span>
    <span>opcode</span><span>:</span> <span>u8</span><span>,</span>
    <span>aa</span><span>:</span> <span>bool</span><span>,</span>
    <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>        </div>
      </div>
    </figure>

    <p>What if we could walk through a DNS message as quickly as possible, doing only the work that’s absolutely necessary to reach the end of the message?
This turns out to be an interesting problem to solve, because most of the message is of <strong>unknown length</strong>.
A protocol element of unknown length means that its length can only be known by descending into, and walking through, that protocol element.</p>

    <p>This is distinct from other elements of <strong>variable length</strong>, where the length can be determined from surrounding information, but don’t worry about this just yet.
Let’s consider this overview of DNS protocol elements.
Walking through the header is easy — skip 12 octets — but the rest of the message is of unknown length.</p>

    <figure>
<p><img src="https://www.azabani.com/images/nonymous-bore-message0.svg"></p>
</figure>

    <p>This is because each section is of unknown length.
Even if questions and records were of known but variable length, there’s a variable number of them in each section.</p>

    <figure>
<p><img src="https://www.azabani.com/images/nonymous-bore-message1.svg"></p>
</figure>

    <p>To make matters worse, questions and records themselves are of unknown length anyway.
Notice that rdata is a good example of an element of known but variable length.</p>

    <figure>
<p><img src="https://www.azabani.com/images/nonymous-bore-message2.svg"></p>
</figure>

    <p>At the end of the day, the root cause is that names themselves are of unknown length.
While labels are of known but variable length, there’s a variable number of them in each name.
The length of a label depends on a couple of different things, and this has surprisingly interesting implications for extensibility<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup>.</p>

    <figure>
<p><img src="https://www.azabani.com/images/nonymous-bore-message3.svg"></p>
</figure>

    <p>The crux of my approach to zero-copy decoding is that walking to the end of a message in this way is, on some level, proof that the message is structurally sound.
When that proof succeeds, we want to return some type that represents the proof.
This is what I call a <strong>view</strong>, and it allows the caller to interrogate the message <em>efficiently</em>, because many of their “questions” can be made infallible<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">2</a></sup>, and <em>confidently</em>, because we’ve proven that those infallible “questions” are truly infallible (panic-free).</p>

    <p>A view under this definition can be a unit type (no fields), but in practice, we should also include any information that the caller can use to answer their “questions” <em>even more</em> efficiently.
To keep our design embedded-friendly, let’s avoid the need for a separate allocation by limiting ourselves to constant space.</p>

    <p>For records, that’s easy enough: one slice over the whole message (for compressed names), plus where the record starts in the message, and where the fixed part starts, or equivalent.</p>

    <p>As for messages, I think the most useful information we can return in constant space is a slice over the whole message, plus slices indicating where each section starts, to give question and record iterators what they need to know to start immediately.</p>

    <p>If we require the caller to provide the whole message upfront, we can dispense with all of that <code>Read</code> goop and ask for two slices (<code>&amp;[u8]</code>): one with the part of the message that this decoder should focus on, and one over the whole message for compressed names.</p>

    <p>To speed up our decoding of compressed names, let’s cache the set of pointer destinations that are known to be good.</p>

    <!-- for ~~*secure* message decompression, in the face of pointers that form a cycle.~~
These malformed pointers pose a serious denial-of-service risk that we’ve known about for [over] [twenty] [years].
The most obvious way to mitigate this is to remember which pointer destinations we’ve already jumped to while decoding an individual name, then bail out if we’ve been asked to jump to the same place twice.

    <p>Insecure deserialization vulnerabilities potentially result in the ability to remotely
execute code on the affected system. Once such a vulnerability is identified it is still
necessary to compose a gadget chain that provides this ability. This post deals with the
complex but also fascinating process of finding a gadget chain in the <a href="https://www.yiiframework.com/">Yii PHP framework</a>.
Finally, the discovered gadget chain is demonstrated by means of an example application.</p>
<p>Since 2017 insecure deserialization is included in the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/">OWASP Top
10</a> list that covers the most essential
vulnerability classes for web applications.</p>
<p><strong>Background Info:</strong> Several object-oriented programming languages allow to serialize
objects, so that they can be easily transferred and later deserialized to be processed
again. Some of them trigger side effects during deserialization. In that case, special
care must be taken when deserializing user-controlled data, or else <em>insecure
deserialization</em> vulnerabilities may occur. In order to exploit such a vulnerability,
attackers must provide a malicious serialized object to the application. Upon
deserialization, a combination of side effects performs attacker-supplied actions,
similar to executing attacker-supplied code. A combination of side effects is called
<em>gadget chain</em>. Gadget chains can be found by inspecting the affected application for
classes that provide side effects and composing affected instances. In order to map all
classes available for an exploit, it often helps to identify dependencies such as
frameworks or libraries used by the vulnerable application.
</p>

<p>Some time ago during an engagement we encountered an application that uses the Yii
framework. After we had identified an existing insecure deserialization vulnerability,
we were looking for a publicly known gadget chain in the Yii framework. As nothing could
be found for the specific version, we started to analyse the open-source Yii framework
to find a gadget chain.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>Since the test, a third party released this <a href="https://github.com/yiisoft/yii2/security/advisories/GHSA-699q-wcff-g9mj">security
advisory</a>
(<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-15148">CVE-2020-15148</a>). It describes the possibility to achieve remote code execution in PHP
software which uses the Yii framework given an existing insecure deserialization
vulnerability. Note that the actual deserialization vulnerability does not reside in the
Yii framework, but in the application itself, and that the security advisory only hints to
the existence of a gadget chain. Nevertheless, using the described object as payload was
mitigated in version 2.0.38 of the Yii framework.</p>
<p>The security advisory mentions the PHP class <code>yii\db\BatchQueryResult</code> as serialization
payload which is the same we found during our analysis. Furthermore, recently a gadget
chain built with an object of <code>BatchQueryResult</code> was submitted to the
<a href="https://github.com/ambionics/phpggc/commit/67eff7a0e7db05ab9155fe7a9c063d1c9a66e87a">PHPGGC</a>
project. However, in the following we will describe the process of finding another
variation of this gadget chain:</p>
<h3 id="identifying-the-gadget-chain">Identifying the Gadget Chain</h3>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>As already stated before, an object of the PHP class <code>yii\db\BatchQueryResult</code> can be used
as payload to trigger the remote code execution. However, to run through the whole process
of finding a gadget chain, we will start the search for a gadget chain by pretending not
to know about that.</p>
<p>PHP classes may define so-called <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php">magic
methods</a>. They function as hooks:
If a class defines one (or more) of these, they are automatically executed on certain
occasions. For example the method
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php#object.wakeup"><code>__wakeup()</code></a> is
called when an PHP object is deserialized using the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.unserialize.php"><code>unserialize()</code></a> function.
Another magic method is
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.decon.php#object.destruct"><code>__destruct()</code></a>
which is called when an object is about to be garbage-collected. As these two methods will
always be called some time during deserialization, they play an important role in gadget
chains.</p>
<p>Therefore, we searched the source code of the Yii framework version 2.0.37 for magic
methods. A search for <code>__destruct</code> yields only one result, the aforementioned class
<code>BatchQueryResult</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>__destruct</span>()
{
    <span>// make sure cursor is closed
</span><span></span>    <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>reset</span>();
}
</code></pre></div><p>Next, we have a look at the <code>reset()</code> function that is called here:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>reset</span>()
{
    <span>if</span> (<span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>_dataReader</span> <span>!==</span> <span>null</span>) {
        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>_dataReader</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>close</span>();
    }
    <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>_dataReader</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span>;
    <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>_batch</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span>;
    <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>_value</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span>;
    <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>_key</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>In the second line, the method <code>close()</code> of the <code>_dataReader</code> instance is
called. Thus, as a next step, the source code was searched for a class that
implements a <code>close()</code> method and which would likely be used as the
<code>_dataReader</code>. A definition can be found in the class <code>yii\web\DbSession</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>close</span>()
{
    <span>if</span> (<span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>getIsActive</span>()) {
        <span>// prepare writeCallback fields before session closes
</span><span></span>        <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>composeFields</span>();
        <span>YII_DEBUG</span> <span>?</span> <span>session_write_close</span>() <span>:</span> <span>@</span><span>session_write_close</span>();
    }
}
</code></pre></div><p>The method <code>getIsActive()</code> is defined in one of the parent classes, <code>yii\web\Session</code>.
It uses <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.session-status.php"><code>session_status()</code></a>
to find out whether the method is called in the context of an existing session:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>public</span> <span>function</span> <span>getIsActive</span>()
{
    <span>return</span> <span>session_status</span>() <span>===</span> <span>PHP_SESSION_ACTIVE</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>Now let’s go back to the <code>close()</code> function where the <code>getIsActive()</code> function is
called. If its return value is truthy, i.e. iff <code>close()</code> is called with a PHP session,
the following line will be executed:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>composeFields</span>();
</code></pre></div><p>The implementation of the method <code>composeFields()</code> can be found in the class
<code>yii\web\MultiFieldSession</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>protected</span> <span>function</span> <span>composeFields</span>(<span>$id</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span>, <span>$data</span> <span>=</span> <span>null</span>)
{
    <span>$fields</span> <span>=</span> <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>writeCallback</span> <span>?</span> <span>call_user_func</span>(<span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>writeCallback</span>, <span>$this</span>) <span>:</span> [];
    <span>if</span> (<span>$id</span> <span>!==</span> <span>null</span>) {
        <span>$fields</span>[<span>'id'</span>] <span>=</span> <span>$id</span>;
    }
    <span>if</span> (<span>$data</span> <span>!==</span> <span>null</span>) {
        <span>$fields</span>[<span>'data'</span>] <span>=</span> <span>$data</span>;
    }
    <span>return</span> <span>$fields</span>;
}
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s look at the first line of <code>composeFields()</code>: If the property <code>writeCallback</code> is
set, it is passed to PHP function
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.call-user-func.php"><code>call_user_func()</code></a>, using
<code>$this</code> as the second parameter.</p>
<p>The PHP function <code>call_user_func()</code> can be used to dynamically invoke PHP functions, for
example by their function names. There is little documentation on what happens if an
array is passed as the first argument. The following example call, taken from the
<a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.callable.php#example-77">examples of the PHP
manual</a>
illustrates that case. Here, an object’s method is called by using an array as argument
that contains the object as first and the method name as second element:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>$obj</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>MyClass</span>();
<span>call_user_func</span>(<span>array</span>(<span>$obj</span>, <span>'myCallbackMethod'</span>)); <span>// same as: $obj.myCallbackMethod()
</span></code></pre></div><p>The example demonstrates how we can call a defined method of an arbitrary object in the
scope.</p>
<p>At this point, let’s sum up what we got so far: We figured out that the class
<code>BatchQueryResult</code> has a private property called <code>$_dataReader</code>. This is set to the type
<code>DbSession</code>. A <code>DbSession</code> in turn has a property called <code>$writeCallback</code>.
Upon destruction of an object of <code>BatchQueryResult</code>, <code>call_user_func()</code> is called with
<code>$_dataReader-&gt;$writeCallback</code> as the first argument.</p>
<p>The following listing shows a minimal snippet building the aforementioned structure:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>namespace</span> <span>yii\db</span>
{
    <span>class</span> <span>BatchQueryResult</span>
    {
        <span>private</span> <span>$_dataReader</span>;

        <span>function</span> <span>__construct</span>()
        {
            <span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>_dataReader</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>\yii\web\DbSession</span>();
        }
    }
}

<span>namespace</span> <span>yii\web</span>
{
    <span>class</span> <span>DbSession</span>
    {
        <span>public</span> <span>$writeCallback</span>;
    }
}

<span>namespace</span> <span>main</span>
{
    <span>$obj</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>\yii\db\BatchQueryResult</span>();
}
</code></pre></div><p>We decided to build upon this minimal implementation in order to be able to set the
<code>$_dataReader</code> property, which is <code>private</code> in the original implementation. As
additional benefit the minimal implementation is much easier to comprehend because it
allows us to focus on the functionality really needed for the exploit. Remember also
that we saw that the gadget only works with PHP sessions. However, we expect that this
requirement will be fulfilled for most web applications.</p>
<p>So far, the gadget chain would allow us to call instance methods from the scope.
However, our goal as attackers is not only to call some internal methods, but to execute
arbitrary PHP code. For this reason, we search for class methods that, when invoked via
<code>call_user_func()</code> allow us to execute <em>arbitrary</em> PHP code. Decent candidates for these
kind of attacks are methods that invoke the PHP function <a href="https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.eval.php"><code>eval()</code></a>. A search for <code>eval</code>
in the Yii source code reveals the following method provided by the class
<code>yii\caching\ExpressionDependency</code>:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="php"><span>protected</span> <span>function</span> <span>generateDependencyData</span>(<span>$cache</span>)
{
    <span>return</span> <span>eval</span>(<span>"return </span><span>{</span><span>$this</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>expression</span><span>}</span><span>;"</span>);
}
</code></pre></div><p>That seems to be exactly what we are looking for: An invocation of <code>eval()</code>, which
evaluates PHP code given as an argument. In this case the PHP code to be evaluated is
stored in the property <code>$expression</code>.</p>
<p>So again, let’s build a minimal test case around the internal class structure of
<code>ExpressionDependency</code>:</p>

January 4, 2021 | https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/specialization-is-for-insects/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/specialization-is-for-insects/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<p>There is a whole field called “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recreational_mathematics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Recreational Mathematics</a>;” a moniker that might as well be replaced with “Mathematics as a Hobby.” I personally enjoy dabbling in it a lot; I am mostly interested in number theory feats: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Srinivasa_Ramanujan" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ramanujan</a>‘s hypergeometric series and continuous fractions converging to Pi in the most weird ways are among my favorites.</p>
<p>I regularly code as a hobby, as I have for the past 20 years. My hard drives are filled with unfinished experiments, code from books, unfinished ideas, in lots of different programming languages. Many of those experiments have to do with numerical approximations of those series or fractions. For example, the last such experiment was playing with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Philippe_Marie_Binet" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binet’s formula</a> to calculate Fibonacci numbers.</p>
<p>Coding for fun is relaxing, if anything, precisely because money is not involved. I can write and rewrite and refactor the code as much as I want. I can release new versions, even if they break previous ones. I can change the architecture without having to call for design meetings. Heck, I do not even need to run daily standup meetings with myself, or to be interrupted by Slack notifications every minute.</p>
<p>I also write as a hobby. My <a href="https://akos.ma/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">own blog</a> and this very magazine were born out of it.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/orangeduck/Cello#faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQ</a> of the <a href="http://libcello.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cello</a> C library explicitly puts hobbies at the antipodes of production systems:</p>
<blockquote><p>Can it be used in Production?<br>
It might be better to try Cello out on a hobby project first.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hobbies are based on pleasure, and dare I say, a certain cult of hedonism. Hitting the keys of my keyboard during weekends and holidays has exactly to do with that. I can escape the daily ailments of reality and learn, learn, and learn again.</p>
<p>Sometimes I re-learn things I had forgotten years ago. Just like great books are not meant to be <a href="https://www.kqed.org/arts/10145618/thank-you-for-re-reading-reading-books-about-reading-books" target="_blank" rel="noopener">read just once</a>, some things are not meant to be learnt just once.</p>
<p>I do not personally find more or less beauty with functional programming languages than with, say, object-oriented or procedural ones. Sometimes I enjoy writing in a language, sometimes in another. There is a certain <a href="https://www.mit.edu/~xela/tao.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tao</a>-like feeling when moving my brain from language to language.</p>
<p>Specialization, so valued and established in the world of business, can be left aside. Or as Robert Heinlein said, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competent_man" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it can be left for insects</a>. In a hobby setting, you can pursue your own interests, regardless of business needs, requirements, specifications, or screaming stakeholders. It is, arguably, the <em>only</em> situation where <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/a-brief-history-of-programming-artists/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">art can happen</a> through programming.</p>
<p>During the pandemic of 2020 I worked mostly on just one of those experiments. My own recreation, in 20+ programming languages, of <a href="https://gitlab.com/akosma/Conway" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Conway’s Game of Life</a>. Faithful readers of this magazine might remember that I have already talked about that project in these pages; that was in my <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/the-absolute-no-frills-quite-ignorant-very-incomplete-and-certainly-flawed-beginners-guide-to-smalltalk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">article</a> tracing my first steps writing a Smalltalk application.</p>
<p>As fun and satisfying as my little project is to me, I do not think it might make me a better programmer. At best, it gives me the option to try things I read elsewhere; I am not in the business of discovering anything new. I am not advancing science, by any stretch of the mind. I just learn, try things, fail once and again, and sometimes write about it.</p>
<p>Hobbies are not meant to be <a href="https://unmaintained.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">maintained</a>. They just exist per se, they are valid through and by themselves, without the need for external validations or justifications. They are a whim. They exist with the sole purpose of pleasure and enlightenment.</p>
<p>Sadly, the question, “Do you code in your free time” comes often in programming interviews. The answer is used as a gauge with which to measure the degree of “passion” a certain <del datetime="2020-12-12T10:42:39+00:00">victim</del> candidate might possess.</p>
<p>By all means, it is the humble wish of this author for this practice to end, on both sides of the equation. Recruiters must stop asking this question, just as we have to teach future candidates to stop answering it. If the practice continues on the side of the recruiters, which it will, we must then teach young members of our industry to ask for an automatic raise in case of an affirmative answer.</p>
<p>The fact that a person codes or not in their free time is absolutely irrelevant to their potential in a job. This is a fact. There is no correlation between those two things. Brilliant consultants from nine to five might just as well enjoy paragliding on weekends; otherwise unengaged and bored code monkeys might spend evenings creating brilliant games on their home PC.</p>
<p>Coding for fun, or coding for money, are two absolutely, completely, and irrevocably orthogonal activities. This offset applies not only for coding, by the way; performing any human activity for the mere objective of getting paid, substantially modifies the dynamics of the activity in question, and more importantly, of the person doing it, in ways that neither psychology nor economics fully understand.</p>
<p>I am not calling for, nor citing studies in either discipline at this moment. After all, at this point in time this magazine is a hobby, and it is solely <a href="https://deprogrammaticaipsum.com/contribute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in your hands</a> to help us make a business out of it.</p>

        <div>
            <p>In this series we’ll create a simulation of <strong>evolution</strong> using <strong>neural network</strong> &amp; <strong>genetic algorithm</strong>.</p>
<p>I’m going to introduce you to how a basic neural network and genetic algorithm works, then we’ll implement both in
<strong>Rust</strong> and compile our application to <strong>WebAssembly</strong> to ultimately end up with:</p>
<div>
<p><a href="https://pwy.io/en/projects/shorelark/"><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/intro-outcome.png" alt="intro outcome" width="100%"></a>

<p>This series is intended for <strong>Rust beginners</strong> - I’m assuming you know a thing or two about Rust and I’ll introduce you
to rest of the concepts (such as neural networks) as we go.</p>
<p>No fancy mathematics or IT background is required.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>This series will be divided into a few posts, roughly:</p>
<div>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Introduction to the domain (what are we going to simulate, how does a neural network &amp; genetic algorithm work),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing a neural network,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing a genetic algorithm,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implementing eyes, brain, and the simulation itself.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Due diligence: I’ll do my best to explain all the concepts, but if at any point you feel lost, feel free to take a look
at this article’s last section - it contains links to external (mostly popular science) sources that might prove to be
helpful in understanding the domain.</p>
<p>Curious? Hop on the bus, Gus, and onto the first chapter: <a href="#design">Design</a>.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="design"><a href="#design">Design</a></h2>
<div>
<p>Let’s start by clearly defining our objective: what are we going to simulate, actually?</p>
<p>The overall idea is that we have a two-dimensional board representing a <strong>world</strong>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/design-1.png" alt="design 1">
</p>
</div>
<p>This world consists of <strong>birds</strong> (hence the project’s original code name - <em>Shorelark</em>):</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/design-2.png" alt="design 2">
</p>
</div>
<p>... and <strong>foods</strong> (of an abstract kind, rich in protein &amp; fiber):</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/design-3.png" alt="design 3">
</p>
</div>
<p>Each bird has their own <strong>vision</strong>, allowing them to locate the food:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/design-4.png" alt="design 4">
</p>
</div>
<p>... and a <strong>brain</strong> that controls bird’s body (i.e. speed and rotation).</p>
<p>Our magic touch will lay in the fact that instead of <em>hard-coding</em> our birds to some specific behavior (e.g. "go to the
nearest food in your eyesight"), we’ll take a more intriguing route:</p>
<p>We’ll make our birds able to <strong>learn</strong> and <strong>evolve</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="brain"><a href="#brain">Brain</a></h2>
<div>
<p>If you squint your eyes hard enough, you’ll see that a brain is nothing but a <strong>function</strong> of some inputs to some outputs,
e.g.:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/brain-1.png" alt="brain 1">
</p>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>You’re a precious mathematical formula, remember that.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Since our birds will have only one sensory input, their brains can be then approximated as:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/brain-2.png" alt="brain 2">
</p>
</div>
<p>Mathematically, we can represent this function’s input (i.e. biological <em>eye</em>) as a list of numbers, with each number
(i.e. biological <em>photoreceptor</em>) describing <em>how close</em> the nearest object (i.e. food) is:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/brain-3.png" alt="brain 3">
</p>
</div>
<p><em>(<code>0.0</code> - no object in sight, <code>1.0</code> - object right in front of us.)</em></p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Our birds won’t see color, but that’s just for simplicity - you could use e.g.
<a href="https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html">raytracing</a> to make the eyes more realistic.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As for the output, we’ll make our function return a tuple of <code>(Δspeed, Δrotation)</code>.</p>
<p>For instance, a brain telling us <code>(0.1, 45)</code> will mean "body, please increase our speed by <code>0.1</code> units and rotate us
<code>45</code> degrees clockwise", while <code>(0.0, 0)</code> will mean "body, please keep our course steady".</p>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>It’s important that we use <em>relative</em> values (so <code>delta speed</code> and <code>delta rotation</code>), as our brain won’t be aware of its
own location &amp; rotation respective to the world - passing that information would increase our brain’s complexity for no
real benefit.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>Finally, let’s address the elephant in the room: so a brain is basically <code>f(eyes)</code>, right? But how do we find out what
actually <em>follows</em> the equals sign?</p>
<p><code>f(eyes) = what?</code></p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="nn-intro"><a href="#nn-intro">Neural network: Introduction</a></h2>
<div>
<p>As a fellow human, you are might be aware that brains are made of neurons connected via synapses:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-1.png" alt="nn 1">
</p>
<p>Figure 2. My attempt at drawing neurons; not to scale</p>
</div>
<p>Synapses carry electric and chemical signals between neurons, while neurons "decide" whether given signal should be
propagated further or stopped; eventually this allows for people to recognize letters, eat brussels sprouts, and write
mean comments on Twitter.</p>
<p>Due to their <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_neuron_model">inherent complexity</a>, biological neural networks are
not among the easiest to simulate (one could argue that neurons are thus not
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2F-DItXtZs">Web Scale</a>), which made some smart people invent a class of mathematical
structures called <strong>artificial neural networks</strong>, which allow to approximate - with a pinch of salt - brain-like behavior
using math.</p>
<p>Artificial neural networks (which I’m going to call just neural networks) are prominent at <strong>generalizing</strong> over datasets
(e.g. learning how a cat looks like), so they found their use in face recognition (e.g. for cameras), language
translation (e.g. for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Neural_Machine_Translation">GNMT</a>), and - in our case - to
steer colorful pixels for a handful of reddit karma.</p>
<p>The particular kind of network we’ll be focusing on is called <code>feedforward neural network</code> (FFNN)…​</p>

<p>... and it looks like this:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-2.png" alt="nn 2">
</p>
<p>Figure 3. Example of a multilayer perceptron (MLP), also called FFNN</p>
</div>
<p>This is a layout of an FFNN with <strong>five synapses</strong> and <strong>three neurons</strong>, all organized in <strong>two layers</strong>: the <strong>input layer</strong>
(on the left side) and the <strong>output layer</strong> (on the right side).</p>
<p>There may also exist layers in-between, in which case they are called <strong>hidden layers</strong> - they improve the network’s
ability to understand the input data (think: the bigger the brain, the "more abstraction" it might understand, to a
certain degree).</p>

<p>Contrary to biological neural networks (which piggyback on electric signals), FFNNs work by accepting some <strong>numbers</strong> at
their input and propagating (<em>feedforwarding</em>) those numbers layer-by-layer across the entire network; numbers that
appear at the last layer determine network’s answer.</p>
<p>For instance, if you fed your network with raw pixels of a picture, you might’ve got a response saying:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>0.0</code> - this picture <em>does not</em> contain an orange cat eating lasagna,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0.5</code> - this picture <em>might</em> contain an orange cat eating lasagna,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>1.0</code> - this picture <em>certainly</em> contains an orange cat eating lasagna.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>It’s also possible for a network to return <em>many</em> values (the number of output values is equal to the number of neurons
in the output layer):</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>(0.0, 0.5)</code> - this picture <em>does not</em> contain an orange cat, but <em>might</em> contain a lasagna,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>(0.5, 0.0)</code> - this picture <em>might</em> contain an orange cat, but <em>does not</em> contain a lasagna.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>The meaning of input and output numbers is up to you - in this case we’ve simply imagined that there exists <em>some</em>
neural network behaving this way, but in reality it’s on you to prepare so-called <strong>training dataset</strong> ("given this
picture, you should return 1.0", "given that picture, you should return 0.0").</p>

<p>Having the general overview of FFNNs in mind, let’s now take the next major step and learn about the magic allowing for
all of this to happen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="nn-deep-dive"><a href="#nn-deep-dive">Neural network: Deep dive</a></h2>
<div>
<p>FFNNs lean on two building blocks: <strong>neurons</strong> and <strong>synapses</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>neuron</strong> (usually represented with a circle) accepts some input values, processes them, and returns some output value;
each neuron has <em>at least</em> one input and <em>at most</em> one output:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-3.png" alt="nn 3">
</p>
<p>Figure 4. A single neuron with three synapses</p>
</div>
<p>Additionally, each neuron has a <strong>bias</strong>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-4.png" alt="nn 4">
</p>
<p>Figure 5. A single neuron with three synapses and annotated bias value</p>
</div>
<p>Bias is like a neuron’s <code>if</code> statement - it allows for a neuron to stay inactive (return an output of zero) <em>unless</em> the
input is strong (high) enough. Formally we’d say that bias allows to regulate neuron’s <strong>activation threshold</strong>.</p>
<p>Imagine you’ve got a neuron with three inputs, with each input determining whether it sees a lasagna (<code>1.0</code>) or not
(<code>0.0</code>) - now, if you wanted to create a neuron that’s activated when it sees <em>at least two</em> lasagnas, you’d simply
create a neuron with a bias of <code>-1.0</code>; this way your neuron’s "natural" state would be <code>-1.0</code> (inactive), with one
lasagna - <code>0.0</code> (still inactive), and with two - <code>1.0</code> (active, voilà).</p>

<p>Apart from neurons, we’ve got <strong>synapses</strong> - a synapse is like a wire that connects one neuron’s output to another
neuron’s input; each synapse is of certain <strong>weight</strong>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-5.png" alt="nn 5">
</p>
<p>Figure 6. A single neuron with three synapses with annotated weights</p>
</div>
<p>A weight is a <em>factor</em> (hence the <code>x</code> before each number, to emphasize its multiplicative nature), so a weight of:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>0.0</code> means that a synapse is effectively <em>dead</em> (it doesn’t pass any information from one neuron into the another),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>0.3</code> means that if neuron A returns <code>0.7</code>, neuron B will receive <code>0.7 * 0.3 ~= 0.2</code>,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>1.0</code> means that a synapse is effectively <em>passthrough</em> - if neuron A returns <code>0.7</code>, neuron B will receive
<code>0.7 * 1.0 = 0.7</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Having all this knowledge in mind, let’s go back to our network and fill-in missing weights &amp; biases with some random
numbers:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-6.png" alt="nn 6">
</p>
</div>
<p>What a beauty, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Let’s see what it thinks of, say, <code>(0.5, 0.8)</code>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-7.png" alt="nn 7">
</p>
</div>
<p>To reiterate, we’re interested in the output value of the rightmost neuron (that’s our output layer) - since it depends
on two previous neurons (the ones from the input layer), we’re going to start with them.</p>
<p>Let’s focus on the top-left neuron first - to calculate its output, we start by computing a <strong>weighted sum</strong> of all its
inputs:</p>

<p>... then, we add the bias:</p>

<p>... and <strong>clamp</strong> this value through so-called <strong>activation function</strong>; activation function limits neuron’s output to a
predefined range, simulating the <code>if</code>-like behavior.</p>
<p>The simplest activation function is <strong>rectified linear unit</strong> (<code>ReLU</code>), which is basically
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/primitive.f32.html#method.max"><code>f32::max</code></a>:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-8.png" alt="nn 8">
</p>
</div>
<div>
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Another popular activation function is <code>tanh</code> - its graph looks slightly different (like an <code>s</code>) and it’s got
<a href="https://machinelearningmastery.com/rectified-linear-activation-function-for-deep-learning-neural-networks">different
properties</a>.</p>
<p>Activation function affects network’s input and output - e.g. <code>tanh</code> forces a network to work on numbers from range
<code>&lt;-1.0, 1.0&gt;</code> instead of <code>&lt;0.0, +inf&gt;</code>, as compared to <code>ReLU</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>
<p>As you can see, when our weighted-sum-with-a-bias is lower than zero, the neuron’s output will be <code>0.0</code> - and that’s
exactly what happens to our current output:</p>

<p>Nice; now let’s do the bottom-left one:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="text"><span></span># Weighted sum:
0.8 * 1.0 = 0.8

# Bias:
0.8 + 0.0 = 0.8

# Activation function:
max(0.8, 0.0) = 0.8</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>At this point we’ve got the input layer completed:</p>
<div>
<p><img src="https://pwy.io/resources/learning-to-fly-pt1/nn-9.png" alt="nn 9">
</p>
</div>
<p>... which heads us towards the last neuron:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="text"><span></span># Weighted sum:
(0.0 * 0.6) + (0.8 * 0.5) = 0.4

# Bias:
0.4 + 0.2 = 0.6

# Activation function:
max(0.6, 0.0) = 0.6</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<p>This is an account of how the Play programming language came to be. Itâ€™s important for me that you realize that Elm is likely to be more mature than Play for several years, and that Play would not have existed if not for Elm.</p>

<p>That being said, there's a reason why I spend my free time developing an entirely new programming language, and that's because of how it differs from, in my opinion, the best programming language currently available: Elm.</p>

<h2>The beginning</h2>
<p>The first commit of the Play language was made on February 18th, 2020. At that time I had already toyed with the idea of making a programming language for several years. In fact, just six months earlier I had scrapped a project called Weblog, which was a modern implementation of Prolog, after I discovered that the logic-based paradigm didnâ€™t suit me as well as Iâ€™d initially hoped.</p>

<p>It might surprise you to learn that the initial idea of Play was <em>not</em> to make a concatenative, or stack-oriented, programming language. The initial goal of Play, which still is an important goal of the language, was to serve as a playground (hence the name) for different ideas I had for improving Elmâ€™s runtime.</p>

<p>Some of those ideas I believe are relevant to Elmâ€™s future, like web assembly and reference counting. Others I doubt will ever make into Elm, like Play's implementation of unions.</p>

<p>I quickly realized that I wanted to depart from Elmâ€™s syntax. One thing I was afraid of was someone picking up Play as an improved Elm and porting a bunch of code to it. I say <em>afraid</em>, because I rely on Elm for my day-job, as well as most of my hobby projects, including Play. Harming the Elm ecosystem in any way, however unlikely, would be devastating to me personally.</p>

<p>I stumbled across a video on YouTube where Slava Prestov introduced the Factor programming language, which was my first introduction to concatenative languages. I ended up reading much of the reference documentation of Factor, and even got two books on Forth (known as the first concatenative language). A little while later, on 20th of March, I decided that Play would use the syntax and semantics of a concatenative language, but be as pure and staticly typed as Elm.</p>

<h2>The concatenative language syntax</h2>
<p>While the syntax of Play was decided pretty much by accident, it does have some interesting properties. In fact, the more time I spent with the syntax, the more I became convinced that it was a perfect choice for Play. In May I wrote this  <a href="https://twitter.com/robheghan/status/1261177530230472705?s=20">tweet</a>, which sealed the choice of syntax going forward.</p>

<p>Before I can tell you exactly why I like this syntax so much, I first have to give you a primer. Letâ€™s start with this example:</p>
<pre><code>deftype: Language
: name String
: paradigm String

def: functional-languages
type: (List Language) -- (List String)
: [ paradigm&gt; "functional" = ] filter
  [ name&gt; ] map
</code></pre>
<p>For comparison, here's the same code in Elm:</p>
<pre><code>type alias Language =
  { name : String
  , paradigm : String
  }

functionalLanguages : List Language -&gt; List String
functionalLanguages languages =
  languages
    |&gt; List.filter (\lang -&gt; lang.paradigm == "functional")
    |&gt; List.map .name
</code></pre>
<p>The key differences between Elm and Play seems to be:</p>

<ul>
<li>In Play, arguments come <em>before</em> the function name.</li>
<li>This in turn enables code to be pipelinable by default. Play doesn't allow you to "opt-in" to pipelines as you do with the <code>|&gt;</code> operator in Elm.</li>
<li>Because everything is a pipeline, there are no local variables.</li>
</ul>

<p>For me, this is what makes the concatenative syntax so intriguing. The code I've found to be the easiest to follow, is in the form of pipelines. Personally, I try to write most of my code in the pipeline-style, but depending on how my colleagues write code, or depending on the third-party libraries we use, this is not always possible.</p>

<p>The idea of a pipeline-first language is interesting because it requires everyone to write pipelinable (and in my opinion, easy-to-read) code. Not all code is easier to read as a pipeline (certain math equations come to mind), but I'd say that on average this is the case.</p>

<h2>Multiple returns</h2>
<p>Another interesting element of the concatenative syntax is that a function can return multiple values. In Elm, this can be simulated with tuples:</p>
<pre><code>mostlyFunctional : List Language -&gt; Bool
mostlyFunctional languages =
  languages
    |&gt; List.partition (\lang -&gt; lang.paradigm == "functional")
    |&gt; Tuple.mapBoth List.length List.length
    |&gt; (\(fp, nonFp) -&gt; fp &gt; nonFp)
</code></pre>
<p>And in Play:</p>
<pre><code>def: mostly-functional?
type: (List Language) -- Bool
: [ paradigm&gt; "functional" = ] partition
  [ length ] apply2
  &gt;
</code></pre>
<p>While the fundamental solution is the same in both languages, working with multiple returns is a tad simpler in Play because Play has direct support for it. In Elm, if the <code>Tuple</code> module doesn't have a helper function for your use case, you can always use destructuring and a lambda to do what you want, but Play doesn't require any such acrobatics.</p>

<h2>Auto-generated, overridable, helper functions</h2>
<p>When defining a compound structure in Play, it will auto-generate several helper functions. In this example:</p>
<pre><code>deftype: Language
: name String
: paradigm String
</code></pre>
<p>Play will automaticly generate two getter functions (<code>name&gt;</code> and <code>paradigm&gt;</code>) as well as two setter functions (<code>&gt;name</code> and <code>&gt;paradigm</code>). In the future, it's not unlikely that additional functions will be generated.</p>

<p>The interesting part of Play is that there is no other way to get or set properties of a compound type than using its auto-generated getter and setter functions. Another key element, which is not yet implemented, is that such functions can be overriden with a user-defined implementation.</p>

<p>The equivalent example in Elm  will auto-generate two getter functions (<code>.name</code> and <code>.paradigm</code>). Setter functions will not be generated, but there's custom syntax in Elm for setting a property of a record:</p>
<pre><code>setName : String -&gt; Language -&gt; Language
setName newName lang =
  { lang | name = newName }
</code></pre>
<p>In Elm, there is no way to define whether certain properties of a record are settable or not. Instead, if you want to lock down access to a specific type, the common approach in Elm is to wrap the record in an opaque type and define your own setters and getters for this new type.</p>

<p>This means that the easiest/fastest thing to do in Elm, is not necessarily the most scalable thing to do. In my experience in writing Elm libraries, I use records directly when prototyping, then re-write much of the code to use opaque types when finalizing the library.</p>

<p>In Play, if there are getters and setters that you do not wish to be commonly accessible from a module, you can simply choose not to export them. The easiest practice, is also the best practice.</p>

<h2>Unions</h2>
<p>Play's unions are different from Elm's custom types. I think it's easiest to explain the difference using examples, so let's look at a possible implementation of Elm's <code>Maybe</code> type:</p>
<pre><code>type Maybe a
  = Just a
  | Nothing
</code></pre>
<p><code>Maybe</code> represents a value which may or may not be available. But it's important to realize that <code>Maybe String</code> is a very different type than <code>String</code>.</p>

<p>If you realize that it doesn't always make sense to pass a <code>String</code> to a function that you're already using in many places in your application, it would be tempting to change the type to a <code>Maybe String</code> instead. However, this would require you to refactor every call site where you pass a <code>String</code> by wrapping the <code>String</code> in <code>Just</code>.</p>

<p>In Play, <code>Maybe</code> would defined using a union:</p>
<pre><code>defunion: Maybe a
: a
: Nothing

deftype: Nothing
</code></pre>
<p>A type belongs to a union if it appears in any of its branches. A <code>String</code> is also a <code>Maybe String</code>. Changing the type of a function to accept a <code>Maybe String</code> instead of a <code>String</code> would not be a breaking change.</p>

<p>Another interesting property of unions and compound types being separate things in Play, is the extra flexibility you get.</p>

<p>For example, in Elm, a <code>NonEmptyList</code> is a different type than a <code>List</code>. Conceptually, these types could be implemented as:</p>
<pre><code>type List a = Cons a | Empty

type alias NonEmptyList a = ( a, List a )
</code></pre>
<p>A function which accepts a <code>NonEmptyList</code> does not work with a <code>List</code> and vice versa.</p>

<p>In Play, these types can be implemented as:</p>
<pre><code>defunion: List a
: NonEmptyList a
: EmptyList

deftype: EmptyList

deftype: NonEmptyList a
: first a
: rest (List a)
</code></pre>
<p>With this definition, a function that accepts a <code>List</code> will work with both a <code>NonEmptyList</code> <em>and</em> <code>EmptyList</code>. On the other hand, a function that accepts a <code>NonEmptyList</code> will not accept <code>EmptyList</code>.</p>

<p>This enables you to specify functions that can take in a possibly empty list, and return a list which is definitely not empty.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Play would not exist without Elm and many of the fundamentals (such as immutability and controlled side-effects) are the same in both languages. However, Play has certain key differences which can make your life as a developer easier.</p>

<p>To me, this is why I believe developing Play is a worthwhile endeavour.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p><h2>Updates</h2><h3>Tuesday, 22nd December 2020</h3></p><div><div><p>Today we are releasing <a href="https://supernotes.app/changelog">Supernotes 1.7</a>, which introduces embeddable note-cards to Supernotes. Like tweets, our note-cards can be embedded anywhere on the web, from Notion documents to your personal blog. But unlike tweets, our note-cards have extended markdown support and no character limit (although we recommend keeping below 1200), giving you a lot greater flexibility. </p>
<p>It's super easy to create an embeddable note-card, just create a share code and copy the embed from within the share dropdown. Here's a quick walkthrough below:</p>
<p><img alt="How to create an embeddable share code on Supenrotes" src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/e0375139aef29ba1fbb28cc7b584b3958be6f2e3/c9b64/faf17916af9b689168b6a5392b6241e1/embedcodetutorial.gif"></p><h5>Open the share dropdown and then click "Create new code". Make sure 'Publicly Viewable' is turned on and then 'Generate Code'. Finally hit the 'Embed' button to copy the embed code.</h5>
<p>Here are our favourite use cases for embeddable note-cards:</p>
<h2>Reusable Checklists</h2>
<p>Embed interactive checklists; for example read the card below and check the list as you go along. You can refresh the page to return to the card to it's original state. Or if you are the author of the card, log in to Supernotes to make permanent changes!</p>

<h2>Highlight Code Snippets</h2>
<p>Make use of Supernotes' code syntax highlighting feature, and quickly share blocks of code with friends. Like this introduction to <code>if</code> statements on Python below:</p>

<h2>Interactive Study Cards</h2>
<p>Create interactive elements such as using spoilers to hide important information –&nbsp;a great revision technique. Here's a brief card on one of our favourite thinkers from the 20th century. Let's see if you can guess the hidden elements correctly!</p>

<p>Overall 2020 been a great year for us, and Connor and I are very proud of how far Supernotes has come - especially with our awesome community. Keep up to date with our development journey over on Twitter (<a href="https://twitter.com/acnebs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@acnebs</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tobiaswhetton" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">@tobiaswhetton</a>). And please share your favourite uses of embeddable note-cards with us –&nbsp;we'd love to see them! </p></div></div></div></div></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><article><p>While I had some time off over Christmas I decided it would be useful to read up on product validation. Especially after the launch of my first startup, Readercatch, which although launching quite successfully on ProductHunt failed to generate any meaningful conversion.</p><p>I created a site called validationguide.com (using <a href="http://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>) to host all this research. Upon researching the topic, I realized something, Almost all product validation methods for successful bootstrapped companies are the same.</p><p>There's the odd sneaky company that uses Ads or just launches a product without validation. But for the most part almost all validated companies do these things:</p><h3>1) Listen To People</h3><p>Whether it's selling <a href="http://justinmares.com/how-i-validated-my-idea-for-kettle-fire/">Bone Broth</a> or <a href="https://tim.blog/2011/09/24/how-to-create-a-million-dollar-business-this-weekend-examples-appsumo-mint-chihuahuas/">launching the next platform for App deals</a>. <strong>Validating products requires listening to people's problems first</strong>.</p><p>In other words for your product to be validated you need to start talking to people and asking them about their problems, what's taking up their time at work, etc.</p><p>For Kettle &amp; Fire it was Justin's friends talking about how great Bone Broth was and Justin finding out that no business sold Bone Broth online. For App Sumo it was Kagan's last startup, Gambit, where he learned that startups wanted more users over more revenue.</p><h3>2) Sell Sell Sell</h3><p>Nowadays when a startup is launching you see the plain old email signup landing page. That's great if you're the next X in tech and everyone's hyping about you, but for validating your customer's needs an email sign up box sucks.</p><p>Instead try creating a fake (or real) checkout flow for the product that doesn't exist yet. Justin validated Kettle &amp; Fire by creating an Unbounce landing page with a PayPal checkout and knew he was onto something when he received $500 in orders. App Sumo validated it's business model by running Reddit Ads and selling pro Imgur accounts. Drip validated it's problem by emailing a bunch of founders asking about email marketing.</p><p>Being lean doesn't mean building the full product. In fact if you can get someone to pay you based off an idea then you're onto a real winner of a business.</p><h3>3) Find A Way To Easily Reach Customers</h3><p>So you've found a group of customers who have a problem and you want to see if your solution will solve it for them. Here's a few quick ways:</p><ol><li>Cold email/message/call your target customer (How Drip got started)</li><li>Run FB/Google/Bing/Etc Ads (How Kettle &amp; Fire got started)</li><li>Write blog content and share it online about how your product solves X and Y (How Basecamp got started)</li></ol><p><strong>Your target customer should be so relieved that your product exists that they should be willing to pay for it.</strong> Don't make the mistake of building something nice to have.</p></article></div></div></div>]]>

  return addUs.reduce((lastValue,current)=&gt; lastValue + current,0)
}</code></pre><p>We are now supporting a const known number of parameters. Getting better by the iteration. Now comes the interesting part that seems like our function is chainable in the example – meaning we can just invoke it again using the “()” syntax. This means we will need to return some sort of a function to the user.</p><pre><code>function sum(...addUs){
 const res = addUs.reduce((lastValue,current)=&gt; lastValue + current,0)
 return function(...args) {
 }

}</code></pre><p>We are summing the values and returning a new function. If we look carefully at our example – when our function gets only one argument it will pause the sum calculation and wait for the next argument. If it has what it needs it will fire away the calculation. Seems like its time for an if statement</p><pre><code>function sum(...addUs){
 const res = addUs.reduce((lastValue,current)=&gt; lastValue + current,0)
 return addUs.length &gt; 1 ? res : function(...args) {
 }

}</code></pre><h4><span id="Putting_it_all_together"></span>Putting it all together<span></span></h4><p> If our number of arguments satisfies us we can just return the current sum result. If not then we need to return a new function and hold for the next parameters to be added in the next invocation:</p><pre><code>function sum(...addUs){
 const res = addUs.reduce((lastValue,current)=&gt; lastValue + current,0)
 return addUs.length &gt; 1 ? res : function(...args) {
      return res + args.reduce((lastValue,current)=&gt; lastValue + current,0);
 }</code></pre><p>Its time to review all our example and check that they are all satisfied.</p><pre><code>sum(2,6); // 8 check
sum(3)(5); //8 check
sum(6,9,5); // 20 check
sum(3)(5,5); 13 check</code></pre><p><a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/borat-great-success-a0h7sAqON67nO" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via GIPHY</a></p><p>Please share your thoughts and make sure you check our getting ready for the <a href="https://www.talkinghightech.com/en/category/javascript-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview series</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>‍</p><div><p>Silicon Valley was the global cluster for computing, for software and for the consumer internet, and even a decade ago two thirds of all tech venture investing happened in the USA. Europe seemed to punch below its weight, despite a bigger population and a huge single market, some great computer science schools and plenty of entrepreneurs. Maybe Europe just couldn't do tech? </p><p>In truth, that was always something of a misconception. There has always been great and important tech coming out of Europe - Apple’s ARM (Cambridge) chips are made with equipment from ASML (The Netherlands). But Europe is a harder place to build a giant company. It’s many markets, not one, with different consumer behaviour, retail landscapes and competitive dynamics. Instacart can reach more consumers in New York and LA than the top ten markets combined in any European country. Americans are far more mobile (2% of Americans move state each year and 0.2% of Europeans move country), making it easier for them to concentrate in the Silicon Valley cluster, while the European ecosystem is more diffuse. And the UK is ahead of the US on most consumer tech adoption metrics, but less than 40% of Italians made any online purchase in 2019, and the French, Germans and Spanish spend half as much time online as the British. Europe is harder! </p><p>A lot of that is changing. Something over 120 ‘unicorns’ have emerged in Europe in the last decade, the top startup events have tens of thousands of eager attendees, and early stage venture investing is up 4x since 2010 and now within 15% of California levels. The virtuous cycle of startup creation is being put together &nbsp;piece by piece. Some of this is in the areas people talk of as a ‘European advantage’ - fintech, bio and frontier tech - but in fact European tech is now much more widely spread. Most of the unicorns aren’t actually in those ’special pleading’ segments, nor the investing, and at a high level the unicorn story has broadened out massively, from a handful of consumer ‘names' a decade ago to an even spread of big and important consumer and enterprise software companies. </p><p>Indeed, the real story is the generalisation and globalisation of tech company creation. When Apple launched the first Mac back in 1984, less than 7m PCs of every kind were sold that year on the entire planet. Computers have always been interesting and exciting, but they weren’t an important part of many people’s lives, and they were a small business, mostly clustered outside a small city in northern California. But today over 4bn people have a smartphone and there is more ecommerce in China than the US and Europe combined. Anyone will do anything online, and a whole wave of companies is being created to take advantage of that, even, yes, in Europe.</p></div><p>‍</p></div></div>]]>

<p>
<b>On inventions, improvements and stagnation in the software world.</b>
</p>

<p><i>Early 2021</i></p>

<blockquote>
But 1983 - and the whole decade - came and went without the "new thing".
<br>
<i>-- Alan C. Kay in The Early History of Smalltalk</i>
</blockquote>

<p>
I freely admit it: I'm likely to be the first person to triumphantly 
yell "Exactly!" at any statement claiming that computers were
<a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/ltmag">better before</a>, and that everything is pretty much
<a href="https://www.datagubbe.se/decusab">crap today</a>. Frankly, I'm kind 
of a backwards person: at some point I started enjoying computers more 
because of their rich and interesting history, rather than the magical 
air of futuristic high-tech that first drew me to them.
</p>

<p>
Consequently, I thought I'd agree with a blog post titled 
<a href="https://alarmingdevelopment.org/?p=1475">"The Great Software Stagnation"</a> - written by Jonathan Edwards, 
a former research fellow at MIT, no less!
</p>

<p>
Alas, I did not.
</p>

<p>
For those too lazy to click on links, Edwards roughly states that before 
1996, lots of amazing "software technology" appeared, such as C++, 
Windows, Unix and WWW. Then the Internet boom happened and "programmers 
could get rich quick", which effectively stopped "progress" in the field 
and replaced it with "incremental improvements" that aren't 
"fundamentally new".
</p>

<p>
The problem with this reasoning, in my opinion, is twofold: Firstly, 
1996 is far too late a date to use as a cutoff. Secondly, almost 
anything in any field at any time can, upon close examination, be 
described as derivative of something that appeared earlier. (The 
wonderfully lifelike, masterfully stylistic and cleverly shaded 
paintings in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chauvet_Cave">Chauvet Cave</a> comes to mind as an example 
within art.) This historical backtracking is especially 
applicable to sufficiently complex technology - <i>but that doesn't
necessarily mean something isn't inventive in its own right</i>.
</p>

<h3>Inventions and improvements</h3>

<p>
Who invented the automobile, for example? Without doubt it's a truly 
revolutionary creation, yet it's also mostly a joining together of 
already existing concepts. Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot constructed his steam 
powered "Fardier à vapeur" in 1769, but Ferdinand Verbiest is credited 
with thinking up the concept a hundred years earlier. Of course, Cugnot 
couldn't have built his vehicle without the invention and gradual 
refinement of steam power, with which experiments are recorded as early 
as during biblical times. And, besides - isn't a car really just an 
incremental improvement on the horse and carriage?
</p>

<p>
It wouldn't be controversial to say that the iPhone is a post-1996 
invention with considerable impact on a number of industries. On the 
software side of things, it introduced a new operating system with a new 
paradigm for interacting with a computational device. Of course, neither 
smartphones nor capacitive touchscreens were new in 2007 and Apple 
wasn't even <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LG_Prada">first with combining the two</a>. Thus, arguably, the iPhone was simply 
an incremental improvement on decades-old mobile phones -
and yet it was, of course, something  completely new. Anyone not
classifying it as a "radical  breakthrough" is surely rather alone in
that assessment.
</p>

<p>
Truly atomic and easily identifiable inventions are few, far between and 
often date back a very long time. They're also often discoveries as much 
as they are inventions. Some breakthroughs are old ideas that finally 
become reality thanks to other inventions. I'm pretty sure 
self-driving cars have been a childhood dream for many since at the very least 
Knight Rider in 1982 - and da Vinci's (non-working) concepts for flying 
machines from the late 1400:s have become iconic.
</p>

<h3>It's probably been done before</h3>

<p>
Edwards lists a number of pre-1996 technologies that, in the context of 
his text, can only be interpreted as what he considers to be major 
inventions or breakthroughs. On this point, I agree. I'm not writing 
this to discredit these inventions, or to belittle their inventors - I 
spend almost every day standing on the shoulders of these giants.
</p>

<p>
Most of what's mentioned in the list can however still be traced back to 
something similar that predates it. Lisp, for example, is a curiously 
elegant high level language considering it was invented in the 1950:s. 
The truth is of course that Lisp, despite featuring a lot of novel 
concepts, didn't appear in a vacuum. Its elegance derives heavily from 
mathematical notation and, later, lambda calculus. Other key concepts 
can be found in an earlier language called IPL (Garbage collection however,
is as far as I know, all Lisp).
</p>

<p>
The same can be said about Unix, which builds heavily on concepts in 
Multics, which in turn builds on earlier timesharing systems. Windows 
1.0 was pretty much crap compared to its chronological predecessor, 
Apple's Lisa OS. The story of the Lisa itself is no secret, either: 
Steve Jobs went to Xerox PARC in 1979, took a good look at the Alto and 
Smalltalk, and liked what he saw.
</p>

<p>
Xerox are often blamed for not understanding what they had and giving 
away their killer concept to Jobs, but that's not entirely true. They 
launched the Star in 1981, two years before the Lisa. It was the first 
commercial machine with a desktop metaphor. This was derived from the Smalltalk 
GUI, which was inspired by Douglas Engelbart's NLS (as featured in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mother_of_All_Demos">The Mother of All Demos</a>),
which was inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad">Sketchpad</a>. Smalltalk as a language 
builds in part on Simula, which introduced a lot of the concepts of 
modern object oriented programming. C++ is heavily influenced by Simula and,
of course, C.
</p>

<h3>Actual origins</h3>

<p>
This is where we can start identifying some kind of chronological 
tipping point. Simula, Lisp, Sketchpad and Engelbart's NLS - together 
with Algol, Fortran, Basic, artificial intelligence, 
multitasking/timesharing, networking, full screen text editors, 
relational databases and hypertext - all appear in a seemingly golden 
era between roughly 1955 and 1969.
</p>

<p>
This was the infancy of the digital general purpose computer. The ENIAC, 
being the first (although - of course - drawing heavily on earlier 
machines and research), was constructed in 1945. A decade later, the use 
of such machines had spread to comparably wider circles, which not only 
tickled the imaginations of some very fine visionary minds but also in a 
more hands-on sense called for simpler and quicker software development 
practices.
</p>

<h3>Post-1996 examples</h3>

<p>
The Internet boom irrefutably happened some time during the middle of 
the 1990s, so I agree that its effects began to clearly 
materialize in 1996. It's true that most of the makings of current 
software technology were already in place by then, but they too build on 
earlier inventions and improvements.
</p>

<p>
From his list of "new" things, Edwards omits CSS, 
XML (both from 1996), XMLHttpRequest (introduced in 2000) and JSON 
(conceived sometime shortly thereafter). This quartet forms the basis of 
the modern web and enabled things like single page applications. Of 
course one could quite correctly argue that these are simply incremental 
improvements upon earlier concepts, but that's also true of the web 
itself: Engelbart demonstrated clickable links in 1968, laying the foundation
for several following hypertext systems.
</p>

<p>
JavaScript hardly 
appeared out of thin air, either. It was influenced by a plethora of 
other languages and the concept of embedded scripting was already widely 
spread. Microsoft's VBA, for example, appeared two years earlier.
</p>

<p>
The combination of HTML, JavaScript and the DOM can be seen as a continuation
of PostScript, a Turing complete document formatting and presentation language.
</p>

<h3>Cashing in</h3>

<p>
The notion of programming as a get rich quick scheme was surely helped by 
the dotcom bubble, but seemingly unlikely 
overnight success in computing predates the Internet boom by more than a 
decade. I suggest that it's linked to the home computer revolution rather than 
the Eternal September. Bill Gates (no introduction needed), Ken Williams 
(Sierra On-Line), John Carmack (Doom) and Gary Kildall (CP/M) are all
examples of this, but there are many more success stories from this time.
The computer game Lemmings, for example, was released in 1991 and has since
sold a whopping 20 million copies.
</p>

<p>
I also think Edwards inadvertently stumbles into the trap of survivor 
bias. Just like with early home computer programmers, most web developers 
didn't - and still don't - get rich. For every success story there's also
a massive amount of failures - some of them so spectacular they've become
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boo.com">legends in 
their own right</a>.
</p>

<h3>Trickle down inventions</h3>

<p>
Claiming that we're still using a 50 year old OS with 30 year old text 
editors to write code in 25 year old languages can be tempting - but as 
I hope I've demonstrated above, the roots of almost all of those can be 
traced even further back and Edwards' choice of baseline technologies
can just as easily be dismissed as mere incremental improvements.
</p>

<p>
The fact that a contemporary programmer can get work done on a 30 or 
even 50 year old system doesn't mean they necessarily want to: there has 
been significant progress since then, albeit in - yes - increments.
</p>

<p>
Editor-wise, a programmer of today sent back to the early 1990:s would 
probably miss things like multi-language support and integration with
version control and linters. Even simple things like columnar marking, syntax 
highlighting and multiple document interfaces weren't standard editor 
features in 1990 - though the concepts were surely invented earlier. 
Python was released in 1991, but our time travelling coder is likely to 
be rather disappointed: list comprehension, while itself nothing new, 
wasn't introduced in the language until nine years later, in 2000.
</p>

<p>
In fact, most programmers probably didn't even use a multitasking 
operating system in 1990: Some improvements trickle down slower than 
others, in part because of hardware limitations, in part because of the 
curious whims of the software market. From a vantage point at MIT, it might 
seem as if little has changed during the …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>New year, new VPS Showdown!</p>
<p>While I don’t usually make big changes to these posts month to month, I do try
to refresh them every year or so. This year’s improvements include commas (on
the larger numbers) and charts!</p>
<p>I’ve also made the decision to drop the High Frequency plan from Vultr in favor
of their less expensive plan that marries up with the other provider’s price
point. Since I’ve avoided certain providers because they don’t offer the same
price point, it didn’t make sense to include the differently priced Vultr plan.</p>
<p>With regard to the data, there are a couple of metrics that I’ve decided to
drop. The <code>ab</code> benchmark, which was always at the mercy of my own Internet
connection and the Speed Test. The Speed Test may make a come back in the
future, but since not every provider has a server in the same geographical
region (looking at you AWS), it’s hard to do an apples to apples comparison
since Speed Test only works against close servers. Close servers for one
provider may not be close for another.</p>
<p>As per usual, I’ve spun up 3 server instances and averaged the results.
Additional information about which distro and software versions have been moved
down to the overview section.</p>
<p>Also, for the sake of being a non-biased reviewer, I am no longer going to be
“picking a winner” and will be letting the data stand on it’s own. If nothing
else, I’m tired of typing out “YMMV and you should weigh the needs of your
application against these benchmarks, yadda yadda blah blah blah” every month.</p>

<div><h3>Clinical Need</h3><p>When COVID-19 first hit, governments across the globe had to make tough public health decisions with little information. The measures they put in place to reduce spread can prevent COVID-19-related deaths but can also have <i>negative</i> consequences on physical and mental health😷.</p><p>Understanding what factors determine risk of serious outcomes from COVID-19 can help guide these policies. For example, people who are high risk may be advised to shield at home.</p><p>To understand these risk factors, there was a need to analyse large volumes of medical records. Unfortunately, getting access to these records and <sample>linking them appropriately</sample> typically requires lots of regulatory approvals and takes a long time.</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<div><p>To really understand COVID, we need to link up clinical appointment notes with test results, death records, etc.</p><p>However, this information is typically kept in different locations.</p></div>

<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>As a result, it’s hard to get really big datasets but <sample>the bigger, the better</sample>.</p><p>So what could we do? This research team came up with a great solution…</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<div><p>The larger the dataset, the greater statistical strength you have for the analysis.</p><p>In a smaller dataset, you might see trends - but then not have enough data to confidently say it is not due to random variation.</p><p>This is really important when looking at lots of different variables contributing to an outcome, as they did in this study.</p></div>

<div><h3>What did they do?</h3><p>They assembled a team of clinicians👨‍⚕️, programmers👩‍💻, data scientists👨‍🔬 and epidemiologists🧑‍💼 and came up with a new way of extracting and analysing health data. They called this platform OpenSAFELY.</p><p>The traditional approach is to: (i) clean data and <sample>pseudonymise it</sample> (ii) download it, then (iii) run an analysis.</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>This is a bit like anonymisation, but not as strict. Information that could enable the individual to be identified (such as date of birth or home address) is modified, but can still be re-identified by those (ie. the researchers) using a ‘de-identification key’.</p>

<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><p>However, this isn’t particularly secure (what if someone’s laptop gets stolen?), pseudonymisation isn’t fail-safe and it allows <sample>repeated analyses which risks identifying false relationships</sample>.</p><p>This team’s new approach is to upload the code for analysing the data to the electronic health record directly. The code is then run and returns the results. The data never leaves the health record. This maintains privacy and prevents repeated analyses 💯</p><p>They used this to look at the factors affecting risk of dying from COVID-19, in a GP health record dataset of 17 million individuals.</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<div><p>There’s always a possibility that patterns identified in the data are down to chance.</p><p>If a test has “95% confidence” it means there’s a 5% chance it happened by chance.</p><p>We can bear this in mind when interpreting results. However, what happens if we run multiple analyses, looking for a true result?</p><p>We give the data lots of chances to fall into that 5% that is due to chance.</p><p>With a pressure to publish interesting findings, this can incentivise researchers to run multiple tests in order to find these relationships – which may not be true. These may seem interesting, but they’re bad science.</p><p>This is known as ‘data dredging’ or ‘p-hacking’.</p></div>

<div><h3>How does it work?</h3><p>1️⃣ First, after the researcher decides which data they want to analyse (e.g. all patients with diabetes) — they write some code to extract that from the health records.</p><p>2️⃣ When that code is run, they receive data to download. However, the data is a placeholder. It looks like the real data - but all the values are made up! Knowing the structure of the data helps the researchers write the code.</p><p>3️⃣ The working code is sent over to the health record (packaged up in a wrapper called <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a>) where it performs the analysis. Only the results are returned to the researchers - the patient data never leaves the health records. So no-one (not even the researchers) see the raw patient data.</p></div>
<div><h3>What did they find?</h3><p>They looked at data from 17 million people and found COVID-19-related death is increased by:</p><ul><li>Being male</li><li>Being older</li><li>Higher deprivation</li><li>BAME ethnicity (part of this explained by higher prevalence of medical problems and higher levels of deprivation)</li><li>Obesity</li><li>Various other medical conditions (such as diabetes, severe asthma, cancer and dementia)</li></ul></div>
<section>
<div>
<p><span>
<div><h3>Any limitations?</h3><p>This analysis was done in the early days of the pandemic. This meant we didn’t have the testing capacity we have now🧪. To circumvent this, the researchers included ‘<sample>clinically suspected’ cases</sample> of COVID-19 – and not just ones where it had been confirmed by a COVID-19 test. Some of these ‘positive’ cases may not have actually had COVID-19.</p><p>There were other common issues seen in data analysis on this scale: Some patients had missing data, like obesity, smoking status and ethnicity. Also, health record availability varies between region. They used data from a single GP electronic record company (TPP), whereas some regions (such as Scotland and North-East England use an alternative called EMIS). This means the sample population for the study may not represent the whole population (or indeed populations outside of England).</p></div>
</span>
</p>
<div>

<p>They don't include their definition here, but from the UK Government, this includes: new continuous cough or temperature ≥37.8°C or loss of, or change in, normal sense of smell (anosmia) or taste (ageusia)</p>

<div><p>It was a great feat to get this platform up-and-running and publish the analysis in such a short space of time. This type of research doesn’t usually happen that fast.</p><p>The study helped public health teams and researchers make decisions. For example, in the UK this provided support for advising at-risk populations to shield🛡.</p><p>This also presents a new paradigm for data analysis of health data, that could enable faster, more secure and more reproducible research going forward. All the code is <a href="https://github.com/opensafely/risk-factors-research">open-source and freely available</a>. This means anybody can inspect the code and other researchers are free to use it.</p><p>Since this paper, the same research group have used this platform to look at the impact on COVID-19 risk of (i) living with school-age children, (ii) HIV, (iii) ethnicity, (iv) taking hydroxychloroquine and (v) steroids with asthma or COPD.</p></div>

<p><small><em>page updated on December 31, 2020</em></small></p>

<p>The early days of the (public) Internet felt like living in the science
fiction world of a Bruce Sterling or William Gibson, whether finally being able
to download a web browser with image support (Slipknot?) or realizing that you
were logged into a machine in Australia from the middle of farm country USA and
it was responding to your FTP commands.</p>
<p>To everyone who'd learned how to type on an old PS/1 computer running
WordPerfect for DOS—with the little plastic overlay giving you the
keyboard shortcuts for formatting hints—and for whom Alt-F3 "Reveal
Codes" made word processing make sense, HTML was the easiest thing in the world
to learn (even if the best design you could do was center things with
tables).</p>
<p>Your author remembers the first time he came across a web page which
<em>changed</em> when you reloaded it. Some university student had set up the
official homepage for a band and every new page view displayed a different
snippet of lyrics. These web pages weren't simple documents. They were
<em>programs</em>. This was science fiction. This was living in the future.</p>
<p>Then came forms and server side processing and your author graduated from
college and learned Java and scrounged together spare parts at work to build
his own Linux machine and learned that the Internet wasn't magic science
fiction. It was all programs and protocols, and the greatest magic protocol of
them all at that time was HTTP, especially when combined with the new HTML
extensions for form submissions and the Common Gateway Interface that let a web
server launch programs to process form parameters and produce a fresh batch of
HTML.</p>
<p>CGI programs could be anything. You could write them in a shell script on an
HP-UX or Irix box. You could write them in C. Netscape tried to make money
selling server software where you could write them in JavaScript (and oh how
everyone laughed).</p>
<p>Like almost everyone in the late '90s during the Internet boom, your author
learned Perl.</p>
<h2>Why Perl Won</h2>
<p>Perl was already everywhere, at least on the serious machines you wanted
connected to the Internet. (Microsoft was still struggling to understand why
you'd want to connect to the Internet. Then again, in the 2010s, Microsoft
started to wonder why you would want a computer which <em>didn't</em> behave
exactly like a tablet. Legions of gamers cringe as they consider a Halo 5 where
you must tap your TV screen to fight off the Covenant and Prometheans.) Perl
was everywhere because it was a good language for system administration,
bridging the gap between C and shell. Shell was a terrible language, mostly
because it didn't run the same way everywhere and it didn't handle things like
variables or functions very well.</p>
<p>Perl was everywhere, at least in the Unix world. It was good at manipulating
strings. Back in those days, HTTP and HTML were all stringy protocols. You get
a string, you parse it, and you emit a string. It was a mess, but it was a
simple mess and it was a small mess, so you could get away with it—more
importantly, you could get your work done before you figured out where you'd
gone wrong with string handling in C.</p>
<p>Perl was on version 5 of the language, as exemplified by the second edition
of a book called <em>Programming Perl</em>. You could walk into a room full of
techie cubicles and find that book on at least one desk, all dog-eared and full
of Post-its, because in any group of a couple of dozen
engineers/programmers/techies in those days, one of them was running a little
webserver on a Linux box under his or her desk and odds are he or she was using
Perl.</p>
<p>The code wasn't great. A lot of it was copied and pasted and modified and
downloaded and modified again from the kind of technical support forms that
StackOverflow has mostly thankfully (and almost entirely humorlessly)
supplanted.</p>
<p>But it worked.</p>
<p>Perl <em>did</em> have the advantage of momentum and ubiquity and efficacy
in those days. Then it lost. It seems competitive languages have eaten its
lunch. Why?</p>
<h2>Perl Wasn't and Isn't Perfect</h2>

<p>You can make the argument (and you're correct to do so) that people didn't
learn Perl for the sake of learning Perl. You can also make the argument that
people didn't really learn Perl at all—they learned enough to modify
programs that almost worked right to work a little bit righter. You can argue
that, but you're missing the important point: that's what people
<em>always</em> do. It looks different on the web now these days with bigger
frameworks and more choices and Google and StackOverflow replacing internet
relay chat and random web forums, but it's not materially different now than it
was then.</p>
<p>Goodness knows, Perl's core documentation is an updated version of the
venerable Camel book: thousands of pages of instruction on how the language
works and how to use it, at the fingertips of everyone who used it. If you want
a book, you can get one, but it ships with one.</p>
<p>Some people argue that learning Perl is easy, with the right training, such
as O'Reilly's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1491954329/ref=as_li_tf_il?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1491954329&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=trendshare0c-20">Learning
Perl</a> or <a href="https://modernperlbooks.com/books/modern_perl_2016/">Modern Perl 4e</a>,
but that argument relies on improvements made in the 2010s, after Perl had
started to stop winning.</p>
<p>Perl as a language had its quirks and flaws. It still has some of those
flaws and it definitely has those quirks. Perl's ease of using external
binaries within programs made it great for gluing things together, but there
were multiple documented cases of security holes and unintentional bugs from
people using backticks in <a href="http://modernperlbooks.com/books/modern_perl_2014/01-perl-philosophy.html#Y29udGV4dF9waGlsb3NvcGh5">scalar
or list context</a> and not knowing the difference and exposing sensitive
information.</p>
<p>People writing code by copy and paste and modify didn't learn the nuance of
the Perl philosophy which makes context important in part because people
writing code in that fashion don't learn the philosophy of <em>any</em>
language and in part because no Perl tutorial really explained the philosophy
of the language in an accessible fashion until 2010's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0985451947?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=outspeaking-20" rel="nofollow">Modern Perl</a>.</p>
<p>Is learning Perl hard? No. Not learning it is the hard way to learn it, but
Perl is dead easy to learn just enough to be useful.</p>
<h2>Ease of Beginning is Better than Eventual Perfection</h2>
<p>The execution model of CGI programs was simple and awful in its simplicity:
the web server would launch a new separate program and provide all of the data
received by the web browser to that program. It would listen for data produced
by that program and send it to the web browser. That doesn't sound awful, but
if you're reading this, you've probably replaced a couple of smartphones with
many times more memory and processor power than the web servers back in those
days had.</p>
<p>Launching a new program for every page requested was a little bit expensive
once your site became a little bit popular.</p>
<p>Even though that model of operation is conceptually straightforward to
understand (just launch a program), configuring your web server to execute
these programs (written in any language by any user) wasn't as easy as it
sounds. If you had a good system administrator, he or she would have set up the
web server to give every user a specific directory in which to put these CGI
programs where they'd run but not expose the world to security holes. If you
had a Linux box under your desk and you were your own system administrator, you
had to learn about directory structures and permissions and paths and the
details of how your web server was compiled and configured. Again, it was
relatively straightforward, but there was a lot to learn and there were a lot
of ways things could go wrong.</p>
<p>None of this was Perl's fault. It was a consequence of the Unix model
meeting the Internet and a lot of intelligent people figuring out the simplest
way to get something working quickly without necessarily thinking about the
<em>best</em> way to build something which would have to last for 20 years and
counting. (See also DNS, SMTP, FTP, NNTP, IMAP, IMAPS, SSL, TLS, et
cetera.)</p>
<p>Web programs were easier to write in Perl than they were in C because Perl,
as a language, made them easier, but the dominant execution model of Perl
programs was slow and expensive and difficult to configure.</p>
<p>A web server is just a program, however. If you modified the program, you
could make it do anything—including connecting it with a different
programming language. In fact, you could put Perl in the web server so that you
could simplify the configuration of these programs <em>and</em> not pay the
price of loading every program anew for every request.</p>
<p>This is what mod_perl did. Of course, mod_perl was part of making the Apache
httpd web server more configurable by giving it a plugin architecture where you
could write extensions to the web server to customize every part of the web
server request and response cycle, so mod_perl became less a way to make
writing and deploying Perl programs simpler and faster and cheaper and more a
way to write your own extensions to Apache httpd in Perl instead of C (because,
again, Perl was a better language for web programming than C).</p>
<p>This was great, until it wasn't. It addressed part of the problem but it
didn't address other parts of the problem. Installing and configuring mod_perl
wasn't trivially easy. It was downright difficult in some cases. You
<em>could</em> get a speed boost from using it, by trading some memory up front
for less memory used later, but every program attached to mod_perl could
potentially access the memory space of every other program attached to
mod_perl, even if both programs belonged to <em>different</em> users.</p>
<p>mod_php solved this problem. PHP was a terrible language back then, good
mostly for making very simple templates which represented web pages. PHP's
memory model fit mod_php better, though. PHP's deployment model was a lot
simpler, too. No one wanted to write Apache httpd extensions in PHP because it
was a template language, so there was no pressure to make mod_php anything
other than a very simple template processor which happened to be easy to
deploy.</p>
<p>In fact, it was so easy to deploy that people <em>used</em> it. System
administrators set it up because it was so easy to do they couldn't
<em>not</em> do it. People …</p></div></div>

<p><b> Aggiornamento 06/01/2020</b></p><ul>

	<li>
			<p>Quali dati sono stati sottratti?</p>
			<p>Dalle ulteriori verifiche effettuate, che sono tuttora in corso, emerge che sono stati sottratti illegalmente alcuni dati di parte della base clienti con riferimento ai soli dati anagrafici (nome, cognome, numero di telefono, codice fiscale, email, data e luogo di nascita, nazionalitÃ&nbsp; e indirizzo) e tecnici della SIM. NON sono stati in alcun modo sottratti dati relativi al traffico (telefonate, SMS, attivitÃ&nbsp; web, etc.) nÃ© dati bancari o relativi a qualsiasi sistema di pagamento dei propri clienti.</p>
				
			</li>
	<li>
			<p>Come faccio a sapere se i miei dati sono stati sottratti? </p>
			<p>Riceverai una comunicazione dedicata SOLO in caso tu sia stato coinvolto.</p>
				
			</li>
<li>
			<p>Sono un cliente ho. Mobile. Cosa devo fare? </p>
			<p>Abbiamo attivato ulteriori livelli di sicurezza per mettere i clienti al riparo dalla minaccia di eventuali frodi. Qualora tu voglia procedere alla sostituzione della tua SIM, potrai richiederla gratuitamente presso i punti vendita autorizzati. Trova il negozio piÃ¹ vicino a te su <a href="https://www.ho-mobile.it/trova-negozio.html?show=stores">https://www.ho-mobile.it/trova-negozio.html</a>.
Ã‰ comunque buona prassi aggiornare regolarmente le password dei tuoi account, scegliendole possibilmente differenti per i diversi siti e prestare attenzione a eventuali accessi anomali. Segnala sempre al fornitore dellâ€™account eventuali operazioni anomale e presta sempre attenzione a non accedere a siti web non sicuri e a non condividere le tue credenziali o altri dati personali via SMS o mail.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is on the rise, the economy is on a decline and businesses are re-structuring themselves around what many consider the new normal. Increasingly more organisations are opening themselves up to the possibility of working remotely beyond just the temporary measure in the fight against COVID-19. Many begin to see remote work as not only a necessary consequence, but rather as a new opportunity to diversify their workforce, increase employee productivity and cut some cost. The biggest cost saving obviously comes from office space, and not just in terms of raw square footage but also in location. When previously companies had to boast huge HQs in expensive areas, now they can spread themselves thinner across more affordable cities. Another big cost saving can come from employee salaries. A more distributed workforce and more work from home opportunities will inevitably mean a bigger talent pool competing for the same open positions, effectively giving employers a bigger choice.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to existing employees' salaries the direction taken by big tech companies couldn't be of starker contrast. Companies like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/zuckerberg-50percent-of-facebook-employees-could-be-working-remotely.html">Facebook or Twitter</a> have made it clear that employees who choose to relocate to more affordable cities can expect big cuts to their existing salary whereas companies like <a href="https://redditblog.com/2020/10/27/evolving-reddits-workforce/">Reddit announced that they won't reduce the salary of any of their 600 US workers</a> regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>These recent announcements have revived a <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-employee-compensation/">long standing debate</a> around the topic of <a href="https://www.nityesh.com/equal-pay-for-equal-work-at-a-remote-company/">equal pay for equal work</a>. Before COVID-19 <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/02/28/why-we-pay-local-rates/">GitLab has already sparked a lot of controversy</a> around the concept of "cost of living" adjusted salaries. At GitLab two engineers who perform the exact same work could get vastly differently compensated based on where they live. It doesn't require a lot of imagination to understand that such policies can alienate a lot of good people and further contribute to the perception of an ever growing inequality gap. Personally I find cost of living adjusted salaries very problematic as they deflect from the real market forces which come into play. Those should be a decent minimum living wage and the forces of demand &amp; supply. If someone is a professional in a niche market, a rare specialist in a scientific field or an exceptionally sought after engineer then cost of living should have no say in determining their pay. Those so called knowledge workers are often higher in demand than there is supply. A good indicator for the scarcity of one's profession is when their employer recruits talent from all across the world and advertises unique perks such as relocation bonuses, dental care or exceptional holiday packages. These benefits would not exist if there wasn't a fierce competition for a particular skill.</p>
<p>Regardless of the real economics at play, it still comes down to a good old negotiation where each person has to stand up for their own beliefs and reach an agreement on their pay. If you find yourself in a situation where your current salary might be at risk due to recent relocation then hopefully the following write-up can help you to negotiate equal pay for equal work. It is a curated list of relevant points to formulate a strong argument why one should receive the same or perhaps an even better pay for the same work carried out from a remote position.</p>
<h2 id="same-duties-same-pay">Same duties, same pay</h2>
<p>If you're reading this blog post then you're most likely not being paid for your time or place of work. You are being paid for your knowledge, your skills, your duties, the challenges which come with your work and most importantly the responsibilities of your role. Your professionalism and your personal commitment which you bring to your every day job will not diminish when you move into a new place. Whether you work remotely or not, you will still contemplate over that tough work problem in your spare time. You will still lose sleep over that big presentation the next day. You will still stay up late to meet an important deadline by the end of the month. You do it because you take pride in your work. You do it because of a sense of personal accountability to your team. It is those qualities which have earned you the trust of your manager over the years. It is those qualities which earned you a pay rise long ago. Changing postcodes doesn't take away your accomplishments from the past. Changing postcodes shouldn't take away the things which you have already earned before.</p>
<h2 id="same-value-same-pay">Same value, same pay</h2>
<p>The value of your contributions hasn't been compromised by moving house. Customers still pay the same price for the products which you have helped to build. Sales figures didn't drop when you went remote. Why should your employer reduce your pay when they are not passing that cost saving onto their customers by cutting their own price? Based on the same principle why your employer won't reduce their prices when downsizing office, you also shouldn't accept a lower salary after moving place. The concept is the same and you shouldn't accept one principle for them, but another for yourself. As you continue to deliver the same value and quality as before, you equally deserve the same compensation in return.</p>
<h2 id="your-savings-their-savings">Your savings, their savings</h2>
<p>Let's be clear, when you transitioned from office to home it's not like you're the only one who benefited from a lower cost of living as a result. Whatever savings you might have made on your rent, your employer does now too. Every person in an office requires an extra desk. Every additional person requires a fraction more of bathroom space. More people mean bigger kitchens, bigger break out areas, more meeting rooms, larger hallways, bigger stairways and more facilities to comply with fire safety regulations. There is more pressure on lifts to avoid bottle necks during peak times. There is more building maintenance work to be done and more frequent cleaning intervals required. A bigger workforce automatically means more individual needs. Extra bicycle storage rooms, canteens, car parks, private offices, outdoor spaces, a bigger selection of refreshments and a larger variety of office perks are just a few to name. Unless your employer is prepared to share their own operational saving directly with you, why should you share your personal operational saving with them? Fundamentally their savings are theirs, and your savings are yours.</p>
<h2 id="their-profit-your-profit">Their profit, your profit</h2>
<p>Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer re-structured themselves to benefit from lower tax? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer opened up a new factory in a less regulated place? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer outsourced a call centre into a country without minimum wage? Probably not, because it was your employer and not you who took the risk. Guess what, when you are courageous enough to relocate to a different country, city or state, then any financial gains from your move are also only yours to claim. This shouldn't be a huge surprise as nothing comes without its own significant risk. Economic security, social safety nets, unemployment benefits, retirement support, access to public health services, cost of qualitative education or medical treatment are often some of the compromises which have to be taken into account. Simple things such as free playgrounds for children, access to public recreational grounds, well maintained parks, a good public transport system funded by tax or basic luxuries such as political stability or the ability to safely park a new car on a public road are many other cost calculations not to be dismissed. Of course this is not always the case, but those considerations are for you to make. Nobody else, particularly not your employer, who has a financial interest of dismissing or downplaying those issues should be making those calculations on your behalf. This is such a basic principle that it's almost offensive to suggest the opposite. Your employer should not decide what sort of lifestyle you deserve.</p>
<h2 id="higher-cost-higher-pay">Higher cost, higher pay</h2>
<p>Contrary to common belief, working from home is not cheap. First of all, working permanently from home requires an entire additional room. If your family lived in a three bedroom house before, now you need four.
Thanks to COVID-19 most will agree that working from a sofa is neither practical, nor sustainable or realistic by any means. A proper office desk and a good ergonomic chair are a necessity at the least. Those requirements alone make a legitimate home office significantly more expensive than many would like to admit. Throw in a couple of monitors, a qualitative web cam, microphone, printer, shredder, peripheral devices, a whiteboard, noise cancelling headphones, a mesh router and a backup laptop (assuming you'll get a work laptop provided) then the true cost of a home office begins to reach eye watering levels.</p>
<p>Some employers will try to provide you those supplies, but any seasoned remote worker will tell you to decline such an offer. After all you're still equipping your own personal home. You shouldn't have to pick from a selection of office desks which don't match your walls. You shouldn't have to settle on a chair which doesn't appeal to your eye. You shouldn't have to accept a black bezelled screen when all your other equipment is in space grey. Most importantly though, you want to treat those things as your own. You don't want to change your monitors when you change your job. You don't want to have to go through your employer to make a warranty claim. You don't want to ask for permission to replace a worn out chair. Instead you want to get a pay rise which allows you to set up your home office in the most productive way. If your employer is smart enough then they will not want to manage all of that inventory (which they never get to see) either.</p>
<p>Speaking of inventory, the true cost of working from home does not stop there yet. When working remotely nothing disrupts productivity more than a low bandwidth internet connection. One cannot …</p></div></div>

      <h2>The first two hours of Kakoune in two minutes</h2>

<p>Learning a new editor can be a daunting task, especially when
coming over from a non-modal editor. I personally started with
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>, and it took me weeks to be
productive when I started using <a href="http://www.vim.org/">Vim</a>. The modal paradigm
is a powerful tool, but picking it up is generally not a painless experience.</p>

<p>When I discovered <a href="https://kakoune.org/">Kakoune</a> a few years ago, it felt
like the jump from Vim to it was even bigger than the one I’d made when
transitioning over from Emacs to Vim. Despite the two being fairly close on
paper, one still needs to unlearn all the muscle memory patiently cultivated
over the years and grow it back up from scratch. If we ignore the fact that
in those days the only (comparatively sparse) documentation was centralised
in the README file of the project, which might have contributed to why the
jump made itself felt so strongly, new comers still have to primarily
focus their efforts towards learning the “modal language”, or flavour,
of Kakoune.</p>

<p>In order to save them some time, whether they’re disembarking off the Emacs
(non-modal) or Vim (modal) boats, I’ve documented in the following article
some common configuration options. They won’t fit anyone’s workflow exactly
right, I trust the user to tweak the settings how they see fit. They will
however allow turning the two hours it would have taken me to figure out
what lines to write down in my user configuration to get a boilerplate setup
going into two minutes — the time it takes to read this introduction and
save the final

onto one’s system.</p>

<p><img src="https://lenormf.github.io/community-articles/assets/img/two_hours_two_minutes/screenshot.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="the-configuration-file">The configuration file</h2>

<p>You’ll find below an inlined, commented configuration file to steal from. You
can also
<a href="https://lenormf.github.io/community-articles/assets/download/two_hours_two_minutes/kakrc">download</a>
it directly, and save it as <code>~/.config/kak/kakrc</code> (or
<code>$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/kak/kakrc</code>).</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Set the colour scheme
colorscheme kaleidoscope-dark

# Width of a tab
set-option global tabstop 4

# Indent with 4 spaces
set-option global indentwidth 4

# Always keep one line and three columns displayed around the cursor
set-option global scrolloff 1,3

# Display the status bar on top

map -docstring "paste the clipboard" global user p "&lt;a-!&gt; xsel&lt;ret&gt;"

# Shortcut to quickly exit the editor
define-command -docstring "save and quit" x "write-all; quit"
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="explanations">Explanations</h2>

<p>These explanations expand on the purpose of the lines in the above file,
the salient parts in them, and hopefully give you a bird-eye view of the
various configuration instructions you might recognise in the
<a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=kakrc"><code>kakrc</code></a>
configurations of more advanced users.</p>

<p>The details are intentionally glossed over and might seem fuzzy, feel free
to refer to the list of recommended further readings at the end of this
article if you’re curious.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Set the colour scheme
colorscheme kaleidoscope-dark
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The Kaleidoscope colour scheme (also known as theme) is a high-contrast,
colour blind friendly palette of colours that should suit the largest subset
of users, at first. You can go for the dark variant (<code>kaleidoscope-dark</code>)
or the light one (<code>kaleidoscope-light</code>).</p>

<p>If you don’t care either way, comment this line and the default theme will
do just fine.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Width of a tab
set-option global tabstop 4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Options are scoped, which means that they can hold different values depending
on the context in which they’re being used. For general configuration
purposes, use the <code>global</code> scope.</p>

<p>The <code>tabstop</code> option holds the amount of space characters that tabulation
characters (stored in a file opened with Kakoune) will be rendered as.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Indent with 4 spaces
set-option global indentwidth 4
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This option impacts the behaviour of a couple of primitives (a primitive
is a “key”, more details about keys/primitives below) that indent or
de-indent a line, in normal mode.</p>

<p>In non-modal editors, hitting keys results in the letter associated with them
being inserted into the buffer (the “file”) as-is. In modal editors,
this behaviour applies only to the “insert mode”, which can be entered
by hitting <code>i</code> in normal mode — which is the default mode when starting
Kakoune.</p>

<p>The <code>indentwidth</code> option dictates how many space characters are inserted
or removed when using (respectively) the normal mode primitive <code>&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;</code>.</p>

<p>Note that when editing a file that is recognised by the editor, manual
indentation of lines should not be necessary, as that side-effect will be
handled automatically upon hitting the return key.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Always keep one line and three columns displayed around the cursor
set-option global scrolloff 1,3
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>When scrolling around a large file, the cursor tends to stick to the borders
of the window if more content needs to be displayed. You can have the window
show more context (i.e. lines and characters) when that happens with the
<code>scrolloff</code> option.</p>

<p>The first integer (<code>1</code> above) in the comma separated pair is the amount of
lines to show above/below the cursor when it hits the top/bottom of the
window, and more lines remain to be displayed in the file.</p>

<p>Similarly, the second integer (<code>3</code> above) is the amount of characters
displayed on the left/right when the cursor hits the left/right hand
window border.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Display the status bar on top
set-option global ui_options ncurses_status_on_top=true
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Kakoune follows a server/client architecture, and the behaviour of the user
interface (run by the client) can be tweaked via <code>ui_options</code>. It accepts
a list of equal-sign separated key/value pairs, and the above instructs
the NCurses client (default) to display the status bar on top.</p>

<p>Feel free to comment this line if the default behaviour (status bar on the
bottom) suits you.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Display line numbers
add-highlighter global/ number-lines -hlcursor
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Highlighters are decorators for the window or the text it contains. Similarly
to options (c.f. above), they are scoped, but we only care about their
<code>global</code> value. You might have noticed however that the above line uses
<code>global/</code>, and you might be tempted to remove it on account of it being
redundant — don’t, the character is significant.</p>

<p>The <code>number-lines</code> highlighter displays a file’s line numbers on the left
hand side of the screen. The <code>-hlcursor</code> flag allows highlighting the number
of the line that the cursor lies on.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Highlight trailing whitespace
add-highlighter global/ regex \h+$ 0:Error
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This line adds a <code>regex</code> highlighter which decorates trailing whitespace
with the built-in <code>Error</code> face. The number refers to the index of the match
within the regex. For instance, <code>0</code> refers to the text matched by the regex
(but not to the entire line).</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Softwrap long lines
add-highlighter global/ wrap -word -indent
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The <code>wrap</code> highlighter applies “soft wrapping” (e.g. the lines appear
broken up, but no newline characters are inserted into the file itself)
to lines that cannot be fully displayed within the window. The flags passed
to it keep words whole, and the indentation of the lines newly created will
have the same indentation level as their stem.</p>

<div><div><pre><code># Clipboard management mappings
map -docstring "yank the selection into the clipboard" global user y "&lt;a-|&gt; xsel -i&lt;ret&gt;"
map -docstring "paste the clipboard" global user p "&lt;a-!&gt; xsel&lt;ret&gt;"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Mappings (also known as “key bindings”, or more simply “bindings”)
allow customising the side effect upon hitting a key. Here is a breakdown
of the two lines above:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>map</code>: declare a new mapping</li>
  <li><code>-docstring "…"</code>: document what the side effect of the mapping is —
this is optional, but is quite helpful when the mapping is set in the
<code>user</code> mode (c.f. below)</li>
  <li><code>global</code>: mappings are scoped, just like options and highlighters</li>
  <li><code>user</code>: similar to the insert mode, the user mode is entered by hitting
a key (for instance, <code>,</code>) from normal mode (c.f. below for more information)</li>
  <li><code>&lt;key&gt; "…"</code>: upon hitting <code>key</code>, execute the given list of primitives</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, quite a few concepts have been packed into merely two
instructions.</p>

<p>In terms of functionality, these two mappings copy the current selection
to the clipboard and paste whatever is in it. They’re triggered by hitting
the comma <code>,</code> key followed by respectively <code>y</code> and <code>p</code>.</p>

<p>Read on if you’re not familiar with modal edition, or want to compare
the declaration of mappings in Kakoune with other modal editors.</p>

<p><strong>The user mode</strong><br>
Mappings allow overriding the behaviour of a given key, but since they all
have a specific purpose (c.f. primitives below) by default, one would have
to forego whatever functionality the key being overridden provided with,
in order to instantiate a custom mapping.</p>

<p>The user mode is entered from normal mode upon hitting the comma <code>,</code> key,
and allows “user mappings” to be declared within it. It’s a way to address
the above problem: you don’t have to override default keys/primitives,
you can just place them one keystroke away (“behind” the comma <code>,</code> key)
and be free to pick any key you see fit.</p>

<p><strong>Primitives</strong><br>
The difference between “key” and “primitive” is one of semantic, and both can
commonly be used interchangeably.</p>

<p>Keys are referred to as the letter (or symbol, for example the return key)
that is printed on them, on a QWERTY keyboard.</p>

<p>Primitives are triggered by single keys or a combination of them, and can
be invoked from a prompt (interactively) or script (programmatically). They
are referred to using a custom notation that allows combining letters and
modifiers (c.f. below).</p>

<p>When placing those cryptic definitions back into the context of the clipboard
management mappings above, we get:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>&lt;a-|&gt;</code>: holding the alt and pipe <code>|</code> keys together to invoke the <code>&lt;a-|&gt;</code>
primitive, which pipes the current selection into a given shell command</li>
  <li><code>&lt;a-!&gt;</code>: holding the alt and <code>!</code> keys together to invoke the <code>&lt;a-!&gt;</code>
primitive, which inserts the output of a given shell command into the file</li>
  <li><code>&lt;ret&gt;</code>: the return key, to …</li></ul></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Early on in the pandemic, it became mandatory to wear a mask indoors outside of my apartment when walking through my apartment complex. Because COVID spreads more readily indoors, it is prudent to mask up even when merely walking through the hall. I also got used to habitually avoiding elevators and other confined spaces where I might encounter people.</p>

<p>Virtually overnight, a strange new bifurcation between my apartment and the outside world emerged.</p>

<p>Inside my apartment is a bed for sleeping, a computer to access for various tasks, and assorted supplies/items. The moment I step outside of it, I am exposed in some way to vague and indeterminate danger. Inside, the state of my room does not change much. It is a place of safety and rest, coexisting uneasily with a suddenly unfamiliar external world.</p>

<p>I had never experienced anything like this before. That is, outside of video games. Because for all intents and purposes my apartment had become a <a href="https://ag.hyperxgaming.com/article/7602/how-to-save-in-resident-evil-hd-remaster">save room</a>.</p>

<p><img src="https://aelkus.github.io/resources/save_evil.jpeg" alt="save_room_header"></p>

<p>The pandemic has motivated me to think about save rooms, and I’ve come to the odd conclusion that their distinguishing feature really is not so much the save function at all. They are, in short, static pocket universes that are nonetheless contiguous with a dynamic external world.</p>

<p>This post is therefore broken into several parts – I cut most of the post after it became clear it was too unwieldy to hold together.</p>

<p>In this post, I will discuss my own idiosyncratic interpretation of video game save rooms. You will notice that my definition of the save room owes a lot to the survival horror genre. More discussion of that genre – and what about it resonated for me during 2020 – is reserved for the next post. In the last post, I will talk more broadly about why we use ambient features of games to make sense of life experiences, and whether or not this is in fact a good thing.</p>

<p>So what are save rooms?</p>

<p>Save rooms are, naively, places in which you save your game. The save function allows you to keep different restorable saved game states isolated from each other, and the save room is often where that function is realized.</p>

<p>Save rooms usually contain a discrete device, such as a computer, typewriter, or journal, that saves the state of the game to memory. Sometimes the device is a particular non-player character that the player must interact with to save the game state. Once the player saves the game in a particular save room, the player can return to this location in the following – but not exclusive – set of circumstances:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The player “dies” for some particular reason once they leave the save room.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The player voluntarily or involuntarily powers down the game and then restarts the game session from the saved location.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The player voluntarily launches the game from the saved file corresponding to the location using the main menu.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Supposing the player recorded a save inside every possible save room within a game upon their time of arrival to that particular save room, the save rooms could form a network of waypoints allowing the player to hop over large swathes of space and time within the game.</p>

<p>Save rooms overlap with checkpoints but are not interchangeable with them. A checkpoint is a particular location within a level in which the game state is either voluntarily or involuntarily saved. However, in some circumstances progress saved at a checkpoint will disappear if the game session ends. In this case, when the player returns they will need to play the level over from the beginning.</p>

<p>Progress recorded in save rooms will usually remain persistent unless they are purposefully erased by the player or some hardware or software problem wipes the recorded game state. Computer-savvy readers thus may analogize the checkpoint to volatile and temporary primary storage and the save room to non-volatile and long-term secondary storage. That being said, that particular cognitive shortcut would not be general enough to be reliable. Sometimes checkpoints really do save persistently.</p>

<p>Save rooms similarly overlap with <a href="http://howtomakeanrpg.com/a/what-is-a-hub-world.html">hubs</a>, self-contained environments that you can hang out in between missions. But a hub is not necessarily a save room, even if a hub sometimes can be a save room or a save room may be located within a hub. Hubs are, in fact, extremely different from save rooms in many important ways.</p>

<p>Hubs are big places like:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Fortress_of_Doom">Space stations floating in Earth’s orbit</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://starcraft.fandom.com/wiki/Hyperion#Interior">Flagships</a> traveling through the game universe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://metalgear.fandom.com/wiki/Mother_Base_(Seychelles)">Military/police/intelligence headquarters</a> of the particular faction the player belongs to.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The hub is often spacious, expandable and customizable via player action over time, explorable/discoverable for the player, and populated by a bevvy of non-player characters to interact with. There is usually only one hub per game, or at least one hub at a time. And the purpose of the hub is usually to connect the player to all of the game locations available to them at any particular point in play.</p>

<p>Save rooms – if they are not just a single room to begin with – are small and compact places comparable to dormitories, apartments, lounges, offices, or suites. Much of the time the player is the only inhabitant, and if this is not the case there are at least not that <em>many</em> inhabitants. Lastly, the save room usually does not allow the player to directly travel anywhere except through the door leading out of the save room.</p>

<p>Most importantly, the save room is a cousin of the kind of abstract “nonspace” that Marc Auge describes in his 2009 <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Non-Places-Introduction-Supermodernity-Marc-Auge/dp/1844673111/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=nonplaces&amp;qid=1609634431&amp;s=books&amp;sr=1-1">book</a>. For Auge, a nonspace is not really meant for long-term dwelling or common gathering – it is intended to be purely functional, interchangeable, and terminal. Hubs are places NPCs often live and gather. Save rooms are empty and spartan.</p>

<p>It should be said without any further ado, of course, that save rooms are not inherently coupled to the save function. They appear only in a subset of games, whereas some kind of persistent save storage function is present in many more games. Readers, if interested, should consult Samuel Tobin’s chapter on game saves in Henry Lowood and Raiford Guins’ <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Debugging-Game-History-Critical-Histories/dp/0262034190/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=1609707902&amp;sr=8-1">edited compilation</a> <em>Debugging Game History: A Critical Lexicon</em>.</p>

<p>To, well, save time I will just mention one very simple reason why saving need not be tied to a room or pretty much anything in particular. Suppose you take an old game you enjoyed on a console and emulate it on your personal computer. The game originally required you to save in a discrete place. But with the emulator as the platform instead of the console, you can now take a snapshot of the game state at any arbitrary place and then reload the game at that place.</p>

<p>This is true not just for this particular game. It holds for any game compatible with the emulator, unless there is some special circumstance blocking the emulator from saving the snapshot. There goes the save room! Having the player save their game at a particular type of enclosed space is – like anything else in the game – a design choice governed by the creator’s larger objectives and subject to hard and soft limitations and constraints the creator copes with.</p>

<p>For this reason, I have a significant amount of ambivalence about even calling them save rooms, as saving is perhaps the least salient of the associations that emerge when I think about them. So if saving isn’t the main point of the save room, what is?</p>

<p>What follows is a partial answer, peculiar to my own framing of the question.</p>

<p>Save rooms are members of a larger <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/#LangGameFamiRese">larger family</a> of self-contained interstitial and frequently immutable spaces separable from the external game world. These locations can be tucked within dungeons and other hostile environments but nonetheless are (mostly) secure from external danger.</p>

<p>For example, the <a href="https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Ghost_Shop">Ghost Shop</a> in <em>Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> contains a strange figure sitting on a bed in the corner of the room that buys ghosts you collect. The shop is in what was a guard house at the gates of Hyrule Castle Town. The town is abandoned at the time the Ghost Shop is available – except for zombie enemies, that is.</p>

<p>Don’t worry. The zombie enemies are not going to come inside the shop. Why? Don’t ask.</p>

<p>The merchant at the Ghost Shop is sitting on the bed, which implies that the room is minimally habitable. But most people would not want to live there. It is tolerable and even relaxing but not really all that cozy. It’s clearly not meant for long-term habitation.</p>

<p>Enemies (mostly) cannot enter these places. The normal flow of game play stops as you soon as you enter. Inside, the player can rest up both figuratively (due to the absence of action) and literally (restore health, restock items, etc). But once the player leaves the room, game mechanics suspended by the room immediately resume.</p>

<p>If enemies are immediately outside of the room, the player will be immediately in danger. In theory, the player could stay indefinitely inside such a room but at the cost of never making any further progress. Nothing will change as long as the player stays inside, for better or worse. Completing the game requires venturing outside.</p>

<p>But what makes the save room distinctive as a member of this class of places? After all, the Ghost Shop is not a save room. Since I have already dismissed the save function, something more is required. Here I will set up the discussion in the next post by arguing that the aesthetic features of the save room are best exemplified by survival horror games.</p>

<p>In survival horror games, you carefully and nervously maneuver through previously inhabited spaces crawling with creepy monsters. Ammunition is scarce, weapons are weak, and running is as common as fighting. Monsters are out of sight, vaguely suspected to be in the distance until they suddenly jump out to terrify the player. You are mostly alone, in the sense that you are one of the few humans present or one of the few humans left alive.</p>

<p>But you are not alone, in fact. Because there are horrifying creatures lurking somewhere out there and you …</p></div></div>

<p>I received a Lisp book for Christmas from mom (and no she does not have a PhD but knows how to find wishlists and sort by price). I am going through it now and I found a function definition that is endlessly amusing me as a Python developer. I am hoping to bring you the same warm fuzzies momentarily.</p>



<p>Imagine we have a name, “Mr Rick Sanchez”. We would like a function to return the first name of this name, “Rick”. </p>



<p>Usually what I might do is to split the string and get the second argument; then handle edge cases like the empty string yadda yadda. Then discover “Dr Mr Rick Sanchez”, another special case, and then get smart and <code>while current in TITLES</code> iterate over my string to find the first name. </p>



<p>All this is fine and it would work after 10 minutes, 2 syntax errors and 3 utterances of sh!t. But also look at this lisp implementation:</p>



<pre><code>(defun first-name (name)
  (if (member (first name) *titles*)
  (first-name (rest name))
  (first name)))</code></pre>



<p>I mean it is recursive and has cute functions like <code>first</code> and <code>rest</code>, but I think what I like most about it, is that it doubled down on the simple first-word-of-the-string approach with a smart maneuver and did not add more complexity by more loops and <code>current</code> variables and edge cases. This is probably partially Lisp and partially Peter Norvig; nonetheless it is very amusing.</p>



<h3>Still here? see me convert it to Python</h3>



<p>I tried writing exactly that in Python: a function of 3 lines beautiful as poetry. And here it is: </p>



<pre><code>def first_name(name):
    if first(name) in TITLES:
        return first_name(rest(name))
    return first(name)</code></pre>



<p>and here is all the duct tape that assisted us in accomplishing this ideal, thank you:</p>



<pre><code>def noner(func):
    def wrapped(*args, **kwargs):
        try:
            return func(*args, **kwargs)
        except:
            return None
    return wrapped

@noner
def first(string):
    return string.split()[0]

@noner
def rest(string):
    return ' '.join(string.split()[1:])</code></pre>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main"><article>
  
  <div><p>In iOS 14.3, Apple added their new <a href="https://developer.apple.com/app-store/app-privacy-details/">app privacy details</a> to App Store listings. App privacy details, which are sometimes compared to the nutritional labels on foodstuff, are details about the data an app collects and the purposes and use of such data. What can we learn by analysing this data?</p>

<p>From the 14<sup>th</sup> of December 2020, all new apps and app updates have to provide information on the data the app collects. This is used to power the app privacy details labelling. On Twitter, videos scrolling through the privacy listing for Facebook circulated immediately after the 14.3 release.</p>

<p>This system is somewhat flawed, because app developers can, at least in theory, lie about the data they collect. Some apps that profess to collect no data, actually turn out to collect a bunch if you read their privacy policy. However, the punishment for being caught lying, removal from the App Store, is a strong deterrent and it’s safe to assume most developers will have been truthful in their accounts.</p>

<p>An interesting side-effect of this, is that Apple has now made available the same data that can be found in terse and hard to parse privacy policies as simple and structured data that can be parsed and analysed. In this post I will do just that i.e. collect and analyse the privacy details for thousands of the most popular apps on the App Store.</p>

<h2 id="collecting-the-data">Collecting the Data</h2>

<p>If you just want to read the juicy details feel free to skip to the <a href="#analysis">analysis</a>.</p>

<p>Apple makes the privacy labelling data available for each app on the App Store via an API used by the App Store apps. By reverse engineering the App Store apps I’ve figured out how to make the API divulge this data on a per app basis.</p>

<p>This only gets me the privacy data for a single app, but I want to analyse popular apps. A good source of popular apps are the charts the App Store provides on a per app category basis. An example of this is “Top Free” apps in “Education”. These listings contain up to 200 apps per category and price point(i.e. free or paid).</p>

<p>On the UK store, which is the store I’ve used for all this analysis, there are 24 categories. Each of which have top charts with up to 200 paid and 200 free apps. This means the theoretical total number of apps is 9600. However, because some apps occupy chart positions in multiple categories and because the charts also contain app bundles the actual number is lower.</p>

<p>The full list of categories is:</p>

<h2 id="structure-of-the-data">Structure of the Data</h2>

<p>If you don’t care about the exact details and structure of the data feel free to skip to the <a href="#analysis">analysis</a>.</p>

<p>The structure of the data returned by the App Store API is</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>

<p>The <code>&lt;privacy-details&gt;</code> section of this document is the important bit. It’s an array where each item has the following structure.</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="json"><span>{</span><span>

<p><code>DATA_NOT_COLLECTED</code> is used as a marker in which case <code>dataCategories</code> and <code>purposes</code> are both empty and this is the only element in the <code>privacyDetails</code> array.</p>

<p><code>DATA_USED_TO_TRACK_YOU</code> contains details on data used to track you across websites and apps owned by other companies, Apple’s description is <em>The following data may be used to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies:</em>. For this entry <code>purposes</code> will be empty and <code>dataCategories</code> contain the different data types that are tracked across apps and websites owned by other companies.</p>

<p><code>DATA_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> and <code>DATA_NOT_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> both contain data types with purposes specific granularity. This means that <code>dataCategories</code> will be empty and the different data types are in <code>purposes</code>. Apple’s description for <code>DATA_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> and <code>DATA_NOT_LINKED_TO_YOU</code> are <em>The following data, which may be collected and linked to your identity, may be used for the following purposes:</em> and <em>The following data, which may be collected but is not linked to your identity, may be used for the following purposes:</em> respectively.</p>

<p>Let’s do some analysis of this data</p>

<h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2>

<p>The data set I’ve collected contains 9082 combinations of apps and a position in a given category chart. In total there are 9040 unique apps in this data set.</p>

<p>Most charts contain 200 or nearly 200 apps, however <strong>Graphics &amp; Design(Paid)</strong>, <strong>Developer Tools(Paid)</strong>, and <strong>Magazines &amp; Newspapers(Paid)</strong> all have fewer than 90 apps so I’m dropping them from further analysis.</p>

<p>Because the privacy details have only been required for new apps and updates since mid December, not all apps contain information about privacy details. After removing those apps 3164 apps remain in the data set. Breaking this down by chart, several charts have less than 25 apps so I am dropping them from further analysis too. This leaves 3027 apps in the data set.</p>

<p>In total the following charts have been dropped:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Education(Paid)</li>
  <li>Navigation(Paid)</li>
  <li>Sports(Paid)</li>
  <li>Business(Paid)</li>
  <li>Food &amp; Drink(Paid)</li>
  <li>Shopping(Paid)</li>
  <li>Medical(Paid)</li>
  <li>Magazines &amp; Newspapers(Paid)</li>
</ul>

<p>For the analysis there are a few different data points that are interesting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Apps that collect data this is linked to the user and how many such data types they collect.<sup>*</sup></li>
  <li>Apps that collect no data.</li>
  <li>Third Party tracking, i.e. tracking users across apps and websites owned by other companies and the how many(max 32) such data types they collect.</li>
</ul>

<p>* Data that is linked to the user for the purpose of supporting app functionality, that is the <code>APP_FUNCTIONALITY</code> purpose, is legitimate and will be exclude from the following analysis. This leaves 160 data types spread across 5 purposes.</p>

<p>I am excluding data that is collected but not linked to the user, in part to keep down the length of the analysis and in part because it’s the least interesting. I’ll probably do a follow up post on it later.</p>

<p>The questions I’ll be looking at for this analysis are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#free-vs-paid">Do free apps collect more data?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#worst-charts">Which are the worst charts?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#worst-apps">Which apps in the whole data set are the worst?</a></li>
  <li><a href="#oxymorons">Which apps lie subtly about the nature of data they collect?</a></li>
</ol>

<p>But first let’s have a quick look at the data set.</p>

<p><em>Note: The images in this post can be clicked to show larger versions</em></p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of data types collected. The apps that collect zero such data types dominate"></a></p>

<p>As we can see here, most apps collect no data outside of that which supports the app’s functionality. To get a better view of the apps that do collect data, let’s remove the majority of apps that don’t.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/data-collected-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of data types collected with zero values removed."></a></p>

<p>Still the amount of data collected is fairly low, but there’s a curious set of outliers somewhere around 120 data types collected. All of those outliers have something in common, see if you can figure it out before I reveal the answer later in the post.</p>

<p>How about third party tracking?</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of third party tracking data types collected. The apps that collect zero such data types dominate"></a></p>

<p>Again most apps don’t collect any data types for third party tracking. Let’s repeat the process from above by removing those that do no tracking.</p>

<p><a href="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg"><img src="https://hugotunius.se/img/app-privacy/ttp-histogram-non-zero-plot.svg?1609805186" alt="Histogram plot of third party tracking data types collected with zero values removed."></a></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div ?="">
        <p>China Miéville’s novel <em>Embassytown</em> describes a world in which an alien species, the Ariekei, becomes enthralled by a human’s ability to speak their language. What starts out as novelty gives way to obsession, and they become addicted to his voice, their lives falling to pieces, wandering the streets like zombies, tearing the world apart in search of more “god-drug”. Their obsession has nothing to do with the person behind it, but rather the thing he can provide.</p>

<p>Lately, I’ve amused myself by operating through the lens that the world is run by ideas, rather than people. We tend to discuss <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memetics">mimetic effects</a> in relation to mass <em>consumption</em> – its distributive effects – but less-frequently discussed is how mimetics affect creators themselves.</p>

<p>I like thinking of people as vessels, which provides a refreshing counterbalance to the well-trodden <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_man_theory">“great man theory”</a>. Rather than viewing people as agents of change, I think of them as intermediaries, voice boxes for some persistent idea-virus that’s seized upon them and is speaking through their corporeal form. You might think of this as <em>“great prophet theory”</em>.</p>

<p>Ideas ride us into battle like warhorses. We can witness, participate in, and even lead these battles, but their true meaning eludes us. We don’t really know where ideas come from, nor how to control them.</p>

<h2 id="birthing-new-ideas">Birthing new ideas</h2>

<p>Consider the obsessiveness with which creators birth new ideas into the world, which we’ve clinically termed <em>“intrinsic motivation”</em>, but don’t really seem to understand beyond that. We can observe that it is happening, but we don’t know what actually <em>causes</em> someone to drive themselves nearly to death just so they can give an idea a beating heart and a chance at survival in the world. <em>“Because I had to”</em> or <em>“Because I couldn’t stop thinking about it”</em> are symptoms, not causes.</p>

<p><img src="https://nadiaeghbal.com/assets/img/ideas/goodyear.png" alt="goodyear">
<em>One of my favorite recent examples. <a href="https://twitter.com/rivatez/status/1115627936411815937">Via Twitter</a></em></p>

<p>Once ideas find an audience, they’re hard to eradicate. Many a surprised creator has found that they’ve lost control over an idea, watching helplessly as it’s shaped and reinterpreted in ways they didn’t intend.</p>

<p>It is enormously difficult for a successful creator to escape their own idea, because ideas need hosts to survive. Their audience owns them now: creators become like the god-drug to the Ariekei, delivering their goods to a babbling crowd that frantically demands more, more.  The creator must battle their own idea in order to survive, taming it back into submission, or risk being subsumed by its demands.</p>

<p>For whatever reason, I often think about Lil Wayne’s rock album <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebirth_(Lil_Wayne_album)"><em>Rebirth</em></a> here, perhaps because the title is so wistfully aspirational. Lil Wayne tried in vain to “rebirth” himself, but he was widely panned by an audience that wanted him to produce rap, not rock. Because of his prior success, Lil Wayne became a vessel for a certain type of sound that we craved more of. He became “that person” for “that idea”.</p>

<h2 id="the-constraints-of-reputation">The constraints of reputation</h2>

<p>Even after an idea becomes sufficiently popular to survive in the world without a host, it’s still difficult for creators to escape them, because ideas bond to their hosts in the form of <em>reputation</em>, like a virus that lives in one’s body forever. Reputation is the aggregation of ideas that have swarmed your body. Reputation is a list of your chronic afflictions.</p>

<p>It’s strange to think that personal reputation is becoming simultaneously more and less valuable today. Reputation is the currency that powers our social systems – a symbol of your unique value – but at the same time, it’s easier than ever to find substitutes for a particular sound, style, aesthetic, or way of thinking. I think it’s a sign that ideas are winning over people, or perhaps just making their tyranny better known to us, an ominous signal flare shot into the sky.</p>

<p>The way in which we listen to music, for example, has changed. We don’t listen to entire albums as much as we used to. We don’t know as much about artists as we used to. Instead, we combine and recombine until we find precisely the sound we’re looking for, pumping god-drug into our veins, without really caring who’s behind it. Like an artist on an autogenerated Spotify playlist, my “thing” is interchangeable with a lot of other people’s “things” that would give my audience the same fix.</p>

<p>Returning to the Lil Wayne example, if Lil Wayne ever put his foot down and decided to stop making rap, we’d find another artist just like him, someone else who satisfies our desires. Lil Wayne commands an audience when it comes to rap. But his reputation is a devil’s contract: continue to make the same thing, and you’ll be rewarded, but don’t stray too far from the original concept.</p>

<p>Similarly, when an exceptional artist meets an untimely death, we don’t necessarily mourn them because of who they are. After all, we only really know their identity through the lens of the thing they produced for us. We mourn them because their product is scarce, and we can no longer get our fix. When someone says, e.g. <em>“Nobody ever played guitar like Jimi Hendrix”</em>, they’re saying that they crave a sound that feels hard to find elsewhere, not that they miss Jimi Hendrix himself.</p>

<p>Reputation has local value – it’s what distinguishes you within your world – but global demand for most people’s output is fairly elastic. In order to give people what they want, reputation is commoditized, bundled and traded on a global market. Spotify Discover Weekly satisfies the consumer by commodifying the creator. Today, internet creators can build up large audiences without ever becoming truly famous; they may command substantial local power, but their global value is very narrow.</p>

<h2 id="regaining-control">Regaining control</h2>

<p>How do creators preserve optionality? How do they maintain separation between themselves and their ideas, and avoid being consumed by demand?</p>

<p>One approach is to resist definition entirely, which seems like the obvious answer, but is hard to actually pull off well, because it requires engaging in constant battle against the many ideas that will inevitably swarm you. Still, some people find this to be a fun challenge in itself, requiring quite a bit of stealth to swim among the dark ocean depths without being detected.</p>

<p>The more I’ve kept an eye out for this approach, the more examples I’ve noticed among public figures. They’re the ones who always seem to keep coming up with interesting ideas, the generative thinkers that everyone likes to marvel at, but who manage to say a lot and a little at the same time. Kanye West is the canonical example that comes to mind: it’s hard to pin down what exactly he does, or what he thinks about, and yet the things he does seem uniquely “Kanyesque”.</p>

<p>The second approach is to compartmentalize, which is more tedious to manage, but probably easier for most to pull off. We tend to assume that people use pseudonyms or alts for privacy reasons. But alts aren’t always about hiding who you are, but rather keeping your ideas separate from some root identity (ex. one’s legal name), so that you can still remember who you are when the ideas aren’t riding you. [1]</p>

<p>Sex worker Stoya <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/09/opinion/sunday/can-we-learn-about-privacy-from-porn-stars.html">once likened her choice</a> of an alt to “deciding on a user name for any Internet service or website”:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My stage name is less about withholding parts of myself or maintaining privacy than it is a symbol of the idea that I am more than just my job or any other isolated slice of my identity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>My favorite example of this: a friend, who’s a mother of two, recently reflected that her daughter started calling her by her first name, because she wanted to know who she was beyond being her mom. The terms “mom” and “dad” are alts that protect the self, who exists <em>a priori</em> to being a parent.</p>

<p><img src="https://nadiaeghbal.com/assets/img/ideas/multiple-bios.png" alt="multiple bios">
<em>Compartmentalizing: multiple bios for multiple selves. <a href="https://lee94josh.com/About-Me">Via Josh’s website</a></em></p>

<p>Finally, to some extent, I find something sort of satisfying about accepting that ideas have a life of their own. Wielded carefully, they can shield, rather than drain, the creator. For example, actors and directors sometimes talk about making a big box-office hit, so they can do their artsy side project without feeling pressure to pander to an audience. If everyone manages a portfolio of ideas, some will be cash cows, some are risky bets, and others will be just for fun.</p>

<p>Ideas are fascinators that sparkle and dangle in front of the creator, distracting an eager audience from the person behind the curtain. Submitting to the tyranny of ideas gives us the freedom to explore who we are apart from our public reputations. If ideas are living entities that exist separately from our selves, what remains of us?</p>

<h3 id="notes">Notes</h3>

<p>[1] I am skeptical that alts don’t creep into your root identity anyway, but at least you can switch between modes in a more explicit way.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/scottnasello">Scott Nasello</a> recently introduced me to Dr. Hannah Harvey’s <a href="https://www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/the-art-of-storytelling-from-parents-to-professionals">The Art of Storytelling</a>. I’m about halfway through her course, and I absolutely love it, and I keep thinking about it in the context of learning from incidents. While I have long been an advocate of <a href="https://surfingcomplexity.blog/2019/08/24/in-service-of-the-narrative/">using narrative structure when writing up incidents</a>, Harvey’s course focuses on oral storytelling, which is a very different sort of format. </p>



<p>In this context, I was thinking about an operational surprise that happened on my team a few months ago, so that I could use it as raw material to construct an oral story about it. But, as I reflected on it, and read my own (lengthy) writeup, I realized that there was one thing I didn’t fully understand about what happened.</p>



<p>During the operational surprise, when we attempted to remediate the problem by deploying a potential fix into production, we hit a latent bug that had been merged into the main branch ten days earlier. As i was re-reading the writeup, there was something I didn’t understand. How did it come to be that we went ten days without promoting that code from the main branch of our repo to the production environment?</p>



<p>To help me make sense of what happened, I drew a diagram of the development events that lead up to the surprise. Fortunately, I had documented those events thoroughly in the original writeup. Here’s the diagram I created. I used this diagram to get some insight into how bug T2, which was merged into our repo on day 0, did not manifest in production until day 10.</p>



<p>This diagram will take some explanation, so bear with me. </p>

<p>There are four bugs in this story, denoted T1,T2, A1, A2. The letters indicate the functionality associated with the PR that introduced them: </p>



<ul><li>T1, T2 were both introduced in a pull request (PR) related to refactoring of some functionality related to how our service interacts with <a href="https://netflix.github.io/titus/">Titus</a>.  </li><li>A1, A2 were both introduced in a PR related to adding functionality around artifact metadata.</li></ul>



<p>Note that bug T1 masked T2, and bug A1 masked A2.</p>



<p>There are three vertical lines, which show how the bugs propagated to different environments.</p>



<ul><li><em>main (repo)</em> represents code in the main branch of our repository.</li><li><em>staging</em> represents code that has been deployed to our staging environment.</li><li><em>prod</em> represents code that has been deployed to our production environment.</li></ul>



<p>Here’s how the colors work:</p>



<ul><li><em>gray</em> indicates that the bug is present in an environment, but hasn’t been detected</li><li><em>red</em> indicates that the effect of a bug has been observed in an environment. Note that if we detect a bug in the prod environment, that also tells us that the bug is in staging and the repo.</li><li><em>green</em> indicates the bug has been fixed</li></ul>



<p>If a horizontal line is red, that means there’s a known bug in that environment. For example, when we detect bug T1 in prod on day 1, all three lines go red, since we know we have a bug.</p>



<p> A horizontal line that is purple means that we’ve pinned to a specific version. We unpinned prod on day 10 before we deployed.</p>



<p>The thing I want to call out in this diagram is the color in the <em>staging </em>line. once the <em>staging</em> line turns red on day 2, it only turns black on day 5, which is the Saturday of a long weekend, and then turns red again on the Monday of the long weekend. (Yes, some people were doing development on the Saturday and testing in staging on Monday, even though it was a long weekend. We don’t commonly work on weekends, that’s a different part of the story). </p>



<p>During this ten day period, there was only a brief time when staging was in a state we thought was good, and that was over a weekend. Since we don’t deploy on weekends unless prod is in a bad state, it makes sense that we never deployed from staging to prod until day 10.</p>



<p>The larger point I want to make here is that getting this type of insight from an operational surprise is <em>hard</em>, in the sense that it takes a lot of effort. Even though I put in the initial effort to capture the development activity leading up to the surprise when I first did the writeup, I didn’t gain the above insight until months later, when I tried to understand this particular aspect of it. I had to ask a certain question (how did that bug stay latent for so long), and then I had to take the raw materials of the writeup that I did, and then do some diagramming to visualize the pattern of activity so I could understand it. In retrospect, it was worth it. I got a lot more insight here than: “root cause: latent bug”.</p>



<p>Now I just need to figure out how to tell this as a story without the benefit of a diagram.</p>

<p>Emilua is an execution engine for Lua. It fills a role similar to NodeJS for
Javascript. Apart from being an execution engine, the two have leaps and leaps
of differences.</p>
<p>I believe a good first post for this blog would be to clarify the differences
between NodeJS and Emilua. NodeJS is very popular and people try to port its API
to different
languages<sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_1" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</sup><sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_2" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</sup><sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_3" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</sup>. Even
non-users of Javascript know NodeJS. By describing Emilua in terms of
differences against NodeJS I hope to offer a turbo heads-up. Comparisons also
offer me the opportunity to touch on many other topics that I enjoy.</p>
<p>I’ll also try to make it brief. If needed be, links to some lengthy posts from
other authors that already covered the topic in detail will be included.</p>
<div>
<h2 id="_one_color">One color</h2>
<div>
<p>The first difference is Emilua’s commitment to avoid
<a href="https://journal.stuffwithstuff.com/2015/02/01/what-color-is-your-function/">Bob
Nystrom' two colors problem</a>. The problem has been extensively covered
elsewhere:</p>

<div>
<p>NodeJS redundant interfaces</p>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript">tls = require('tls');
fs = require('fs');

options = {
    // sync interfaces
    key: fs.readFileSync('server-key.pem'),
    cert: fs.readFileSync('server-cert.pem')
};

// async interfaces
server = tls.createServer(options, function(socket) {
    // ...
});</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>In a nutshell, every function in Emilua has the ability to suspend the caller
function. The runtime will schedule every fiber behind the scenes, and you don’t
need to wrap the function operator call based on the resources the callee will
make use of.</p>
<p>Whereas manuals from some frameworks will instruct you to annotate every call
that might block with <code>await</code>…​</p>
<div>
<p>Pseudocode example on <code>await</code></p>
<div>
<pre><code>n = await read(sock, buf);
await write(sock, buf[:n]);
// ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Emilua won’t force you to do the same. IO scheduling is a transparent
resource. IO scheduling is not part of the function type signature. You don’t
need to break the API just because your function implementation just now
requires IO activity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_is_it_a_coroutine_or_is_it_a_fiber">Is it a coroutine…​ or is it a fiber?</h2>
<div>
<p>The previous point may have been extensively debated, and it was in this debate
that comparisons among the following styles was appropriate:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Events and polling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Callbacks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Signals &amp; slots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Observers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Promises.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functional patterns.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Coroutines.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>But Emilua is built around fibers and it is inappropriate to compare fibers and
the previous choices. I’ll now compare fibers and coroutines to make this subtle
point.</p>
<p>Coroutines may be an old concept that suggest language constructs capable to
suspend and resume a function
context<sup>[<a id="_footnoteref_4" href="#_footnote_4" title="View footnote.">4</a>]</sup>, but fibers come from attempts to
provide user-space threads, and, as such, will adhere to threads vocabulary. The
presence of threads vocabulary imply a scheduler (i.e. if you call
<code>mutex.lock()</code>, your code doesn’t need to know which fiber to awake next as this
will be taken care of by the scheduler). This difference is noted by authors of
fiber libraries, but rarely stated explicitly, so it’s worth to link one of the
few texts that make explicit the difference:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>The difference between a fibers facility and just coroutines is that with
fibers, you have a scheduler as well.</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>The difference is important because if you have threads vocabulary, you have not
only vocabulary to express concurrent tasks, but also vocabulary to tame this
very concurrency with mutexes, condition variables, and the like. None of the
previous options of this list — callbacks, promises, coroutines, etc — had such
sync primitives.</p>
<div>
<table>

<td>
<p>Note</p>
</td>
<td>
What Ruby calls fibers…​ well, they are nice and all, but I don’t believe
they understood the concept, so ping them about it.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
</div>

<p>Here’s a small example, an implementation for the very simple socket-pair
algorithm. First in NodeJS:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="javascript">var net = require('net');

function socket_pair(callback) {
    var result = {}

    var server = net.createServer(function(sock) {
        server.close()
        if (result.err) {
            return
        }
        if (result.sock) {
            callback(null, [ sock, result.sock ])
        } else {
            result.sock = sock
        }
    })

    server.on('error', function(err) {
        if (result.err) {
            return
        }
        result.err = err
        callback(err)
    })

    server.listen(0, '127.0.0.1', function() {
        var sock = new net.Socket()
        sock.connect(server.address().port, '127.0.0.1', function() {
            if (result.err) {
                return
            }
            if (result.sock) {
                callback(null, [ sock, result.sock ])
            } else {
                result.sock = sock
            }
        })
        sock.on('error', function(err) {
            if (result.err) {
                return
            }
            server.close()
            result.err = err
            callback(err)
        })
    });
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>Do notice how NodeJS’s lack of sync primitives forces you to write your own
synchronization (the <code>result</code> rendezvous point in the example). Now take a look
at how Emilua will make the task much simpler by enabling you to use the
<code>fiber.join()</code> sync vocabulary:</p>
<div>
<div>
<pre><code data-lang="lua">local ip = require 'ip'

function socket_pair()
    local acceptor = ip.tcp.acceptor.new()
    local addr = ip.address.loopback_v4()
    acceptor:open(addr)
    acceptor:bind(addr, 0)
    acceptor:listen()

    local f = spawn(function()
        local sock = ip.tcp.socket.new()
        sock:connect(addr, acceptor.local_port)
        return sock
    end)

    local sock = acceptor:accept()
    acceptor:close()
    return sock, f:join()
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<p>And there is a little something else. Preemptiveness isn’t a property exclusive
to OS-provided threads. Runtimes from some languages will manage to deliver just
this property to fibers as well. Emilua will stay out of preemptiveness
(i.e. you’re guaranteed to have a safer environment) just like many others. But
if you’re restricted to cooperative multitasking, you managed to migrate some
scheduling decisions from runtime to compile-time. Most frameworks will stop
here, but Emilua will go just one mile further.</p>
<p>If you moved some scheduling decisions to compile-time, it makes sense to also
move sync primitives to compile-time…​ or, rather…​ <em>scheduling
constraints</em>. Ideally, your code wouldn’t compile when these constraints aren’t
respected. I’m not there yet and there are static analysers waiting to be
written, but the vocabulary to encode the user expectation in Lua is here. The
vocabulary works like C’s <code>assert()</code>. One alternative would be to just rely on
<code>mutex</code>es as usual, but there are these little abusers — like me — of
deterministic suspension points that you’ll never tame, so I’m adding this
little tool anyway to prevent further damage.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_opinionated_concurrency_style">Opinionated concurrency style</h2>
<div>
<p>Bob Nystrom’s warning about two colors wasn’t enough.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Choose your async model; we don’t mind; we encourage experimentation.</p>
<p>If you don’t like callbacks and event emitters, use coroutines and write
blocking style code without actually blocking your event loop!</p>
</blockquote>

</div>
<p>From experience with Boost.Asio, I noticed that you can’t just defer the choice
to the user and get rid of making one. What happened to Boost.Asio is that you
cannot appropriately support any one model.</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Limitations from one model infect other models (e.g. orientation towards IO
objects and not threads). This point by itself could give a lengthy article,
but nowadays I’m less concerned with convincing people and more concerned with
respecting my own precious time, so you’ll only have my word here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You cannot rely on the strengths that are exclusive to one model (e.g. disable
interruption at critical blocks). It may seem redundant with the previous
point because it’s just another face of the same coin.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You just created a new model. <em>Your “unopinionated” model is a meta-model</em>
that forces every library provider to write convoluted code. Again, another
lengthy article that will not receive a share of my time. If you’re curious,
try looking for libraries built around Boost.Asio that work with the
completion token protocol.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Emilua cares about serving one concurrency style and serving it well: fibers.</p>
<div>
<blockquote>

<p>Boost.Fiber doesn’t need fibers::future::then - just suspend the fiber. If
you need more concurrency than that, launch another fiber. then() is
redundant with coroutine and fiber concurrency.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
— Nat Goodspeed<br>
<cite>Boost mailing list, 2018</cite>
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div>
<h2 id="_active_style">Active style</h2>
<div>
<p>A friend of mine teached me this principle early on that affected all my future
projects: <em>design your abstractions where the user is an active party on
scheduling decisions</em>. I’ve been calling it the active style and people usually
don’t get it what it is about, but consequences of this design are better
understood (e.g. <a href="https://lucumr.pocoo.org/2020/1/1/async-pressure/">dealing with
back-pressure</a>).</p>
<p>Ryan Dahl’s successor for NodeJS also got this point covered:</p>
<div>
<blockquote>
<p>Node’s counterpart to promises was the EventEmitter, which important APIs are
based around, namely sockets and HTTP. Setting aside the ergonomic benefits of
async/await, the EventEmitter pattern has an issue with back-pressure. Take a
TCP socket, for example. The socket would emit "data" events when it received
incoming packets. These "data" callbacks would be emitted in an unconstrained
manner, flooding the process with events. Because Node continues to receive new
data events, the underlying TCP socket does not have proper back-pressure, the
remote sender has no idea the server is overloaded and continues to send
data. To mitigate this problem, a pause() method was added. This could solve the
problem, but it required extra code; and since the flooding issue only presents
itself when the process is very busy, many Node programs can be flooded with
data. The result is a system with bad tail latency.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="_emilua_is_more_explicit">Emilua is more explicit</h2>
<div>
<p>Emilua is also just more explicit. Many years ago, NodeJS actually
attracted me. Its API (at the time) was better than the HTTP server libs that
I’d design. It helped to push me forward. Unfortunately it feels like it stopped
in time and didn’t preserve this "pusher" feeling.</p>
<p>What attracted me at the time was its lower-level approach to web protocols. I</p></div></div></article></div></div></div></div>

<p><em>Competitive ethics</em> (I’d be happy to find a better term) is the study of ethical ideas as strategies or phenotypes
that are competing for mindshare.  This is opposed to the usual study of ethics,<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> which is concerned with what’s right and what’s wrong.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Competitive ethics is to morality as FiveThirtyEight is to politics.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>FiveThirtyEight doesn’t tell us which candidate’s positions are correct, and we don’t expect them to.
We expect them to tell us who will win.</p>
<p>Unlike applied ethics (“How should I act in this specific situation?"),
normative ethics (“What criteria should I use to do applied ethics?"),
or meta-ethics (“How should I think about normative ethics?"), competitive ethics is amoral.
Not immoral: amoral.
It’s not concerned with right and wrong, just with predictions and understanding.</p>
<h3 id="how-ethics-compete">How ethics compete</h3>
<p>There are many lines of thinking relevant to this question, but I can’t find any that address it directly.</p>
<p>The most relevant are cultural selection theory, memetics, and neoevolution, though these
are too tied up with evolutionary theory.
The subfields of <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/morality-biology/">evolutionary ethics</a> and <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/game-ethics/">game-theoretic ethics</a>
stick to normative or occasionally meta-ethical questions, and don’t seem to have studied what happens when ethical
systems go toe-to-toe.</p>
<p>Other work studies the relationship between the ethics people espouse, the ethics they consciously believe, and how they actually behave.
All three can, of course, be quite distinct.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_falsification">Preference falsification</a>, social contagion theory, and behavioral economics are the relevent disciplines here.
Even <a href="https://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/arzjl19&amp;div=9&amp;id=&amp;page=">the legal profession</a> has touched on this.
Professed ethics are the fastest to change, <em>a la</em> preference falsification.
It’s an open question whether or not ethical beliefs change faster than behavior.</p>
<p>Another important issue is the fuzzy line between biologically-determined preferences and ethics.
The former clearly influence the latter in a single individual, and the latter influences the former across generations.
Plus, the more technology lets us intervene on biology, the fuzzier the line gets.
Wibren Van Der Berg’s <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Dynamic-Ethics-Burg/0e8a2f0d733e97a2fb8b226c89679518ef6606fa#citing-papers">Dynamic Ethics</a> is the closest work to addressing this, though it’s a work of normative ethics.
He says for example: “Our dynamic society requires a dynamic morality and thus a form of ethical
reflection which can be responsive to change.”
A <a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Nanotechnology-and-Technomoral-Change-Swierstra/8b9bc75dd29727959f2182ab9ce363419e2bd548">few</a>
<a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Anticipating-the-Interaction-between-Technology-and-Boenink-Swierstra/3211402ba6d43e414b23ad5b51d15421a876f141">others</a> have touched this question, but not many.</p>
<p>One interesting problem framing is ethics as a distributed or hierarchical controller, in the control theory sense.
This brings a host of ideas to the discussion about what might make ethical systems more or less stable, including Good System theories (e.g. <a href="http://pespmc1.vub.ac.be/books/Conant_Ashby.pdf">“every good regulator of a system must be a model of that system”</a>),
the potential optimality of false beliefs,
and the advantageous of certain types of internal variability.</p>
<h3 id="case-studies">Case studies</h3>
<h4 id="natalism-and-heritability">Natalism and heritability</h4>
<p>The most straightforward way ethical systems compete is by the degree of natalism and heritability they entail:
how many offspring do their believers produce, and how effectively are they passed from parents to children?</p>
<p>The best recent work on this topic is from demographers like Eric Kaufmann.
In his book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shall-Religious-Inherit-Earth-Twenty-First-ebook/dp/B004DL0OCG/">Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth?</a>,
Kaufmann lays out the remarkable growth trends of religious fundamentalist groups in the modern world.
Fundamentalist religious groups whose ethics encourage high fertility and strict adherence to the faith are contrasted with
modern Western cultures whose ethics deride (or at least don’t encourage) fertility and encourage freedom of thought.
Norms against homosexuality are also relevant to this question, at least in a world where homosexual couples have no or low fertility.</p>
<p>Most fundamentalist groups rely on the generosity of their host society to flourish as they do — e.g.
the ultraorthodox in Israel, who generally don’t have jobs — so it’s not clear when this will hit the breaking point.
Additionally, different natalist groups have differing success in retaining members: the ultraorthodox seem good at it, movements like quiverfull seem less so.
While I’m biased to think ethics of free thought are more attractive than ultraorthodox ethics, ethics of free thought combined with low fertility may not be sustainable.
After all, <a href="https://jcl.algosphere.org/abstract-child.pdf">nothing reproduces better than reproduction</a>.</p>
<p>More broadly than religion, there is a correlation between female power in society — especially regarding control over reproduction — and lower natality.
This is a bit worrying for the future of women’s rights, especially if male power is correlated to both natalism <em>and</em> warlike or proselytizing behavior.
Then again, weapons technology and fertility technology may completely change these dynamics.</p>
<h4 id="euthenasia-and-suicide">Euthenasia and suicide</h4>
<p>Norms against euthenasia and suicide are a counterpart to natalism.
One would expect such beliefs to be excellent at propagating themselves,
yet many cultures have practices of euthenasia or ritual suicide, so the competitiveness of such norms is not clear-cut.</p>
<p>Relatedly, anti-suicide ideas — Camus’s absurdism, perhaps — may have an interesting niche:
if you’re the only idea keeping someone alive, you’ve got an (at least temporary) monopoly on their life.</p>
<p>Would a society that fully embraced euthenasia and destigmatized suicide suffer the same fate as an antinatalist society?
I suspect it would be composed mostly of people who wanted to be alive, which could work in its favor.
But in the face of a changing world that might quickly become not-fun-to-live-in, perhaps anti-death norms are more competitive in the long run.
Then again, one might only need a <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/nature08504">minority of the population to maintain these norms</a> to get most of the benefit.</p>
<h4 id="nihilism-and-motivation">Nihilism and motivation</h4>
<p>I know of no work studying the comparative effects of ethical belief systems on motivation.
In fact, I don’t know whether it’s demonstrable that motivated individuals are more successful.
But assuming it does, and assuming ethics like moral nihilism demotivate people (or at least fail to motivate them), the long-term viability of these ethical systems is questionable.
Going further, it may be that selfish ethical systems (e.g. Ayn Rand, Gordon Gekko) are more associated with motivation and success than
egalitarian ethical systems.</p>
<p>Causality and correlation are hard to tease apart here, but doing so isn’t necessary.
An ethical system can win both by granting success to its holders or by being adopted by successful individuals.</p>
<h4 id="exclusivity-and-conversion-rates">Exclusivity and Conversion Rates</h4>
<p>Much like a sales team, the success of an ethical belief is determined by its conversion rate and its retention rate.
These two factors are sometimes at odds: exclusive ideologies often have higher retention rates, but inclusive ideologies are easier to join.</p>
<p>Take the far-left vs. the far-right in the US.
Social justice movements with ethics of “it’s not my job to educate you” probably repel many potential converts, but they provide their adherents with a feeling of being in an exclusive club.
On the other hand, I’ve heard that far-right groups are much more welcoming to newcomers — or at least willing to explain their doctrine and answer questions — than far-left groups.</p>
<p>The old question “Why aren’t there any libertarian states?” also comes to mind.</p>
<h4 id="ai-alignment">AI alignment</h4>
<p>Eliezer Yudkowsky is purported to have said “You are personally responsible for becoming more ethical than the society you grew up in.”
This quotation is interesting in that (1) it’s a normative claim about normative claims, and (2) it assumes that ethics has a direction.</p>
<p>While I like the sentiment, it’s reminiscent of when people make biologists cringe by saying things like “humans are more evolved than snails.”
Evolution doesn’t have a partial ordering by which some species can be more or less evolved than others.
From the competitive ethics perspective, neither do ethics.</p>
<p>Most people who work in AI alignment <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/GermiEmcS6xuZ2gBh/what-ai-safety-researchers-have-written-about-the-nature-of">treat human values</a> the way scientists treat complex systems they can’t fully model: there exist some true, foundational human ethics, and while we can’t articulate them, we can still try to hue to them.
I’m far from convinced that these true, foundational human ethics exist.
And even if you think you’ve found them, if the AI you build according to them keeps getting deleted by its â€œunethicalâ€� AI peers, have you accomplished your mission of building ethical AI?</p>
<p>I have trouble engaging with AI alignment research that doesn’t put competitive ethical questions front and center.</p>
<h4 id="when-you-can-truly-change-your-mind">When you can truly change your mind</h4>
<p>The entire AI alignment section applies to human beings, too, in a future where people can change their beliefs with neurotechnology.</p>
<h3 id="extensions-of-competitive-ethics">Extensions of competitive ethics</h3>
<p>Competitive ethics on its own is amoral.
But it can be a building block for other ideas.</p>
<p>Consider a meta-ethics — call it <em>ethical consistentism</em> maybe — where the probability of a moral statement being correct is proportional to its survival.
To be clear: this isn’t a creepy social Darwinism or might-makes-right idea since it’s a meta-ethics, not a normative claim.
Or one could propose a a weaker version of this: an ethical system shouldn’t directly or indirectly lead to itself not being believed.
This is analagous to logical consistency in mathematics.
Of course, if we’re going to treat ethical systems as competitive phenotypes, it seems only fair to treat meta-ethical systems (ethical consistentism included) as phenotypes too.  So the recursion begins…</p>
<p>Competitive ethics is also sortof nihilism 2.0, or at least relativism 2.0.
Of course right and wrong are ridiculous …</p></article></div></div>

        <p><span>F</span>orty-nine million years ago, a small aquatic fern called <em>Azolla</em> wrested control of Earthâ€™s climate. At the time, the landlocked Arctic Ocean developed a surface layer of freshwater, which allowed the ferns to grow unchecked in a wide-open environment. Billions of tons of plants died and sank to the bottom of the ocean, taking with them the carbon they had sucked from the air when they were alive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The consequences were extreme. Geologic evidence indicates that atmospheric carbon dioxide levels plummeted more than 80 percent over 800,000 years, sharply ratcheting down Earthâ€™s thermostat. Prior to the inferred â€œ<a href="https://www.geolsoc.org.uk/Geoscientist/Archive/June-2014/The-Arctic-Azolla-event" target="_blank">Azolla Event</a>,â€� most of the globe was lush and tropical. Afterward, the Arctic cooled by nearly 40 degrees Fahrenheit, the poles froze, and our planet entered a lurching cycle of ice ages that continue to this day.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Azolla Event was an environmental catastrophe for life in the Eocene epoch. Today, though, it is a source of inspiration—even optimism—in dealing with human-driven climate change. For years, some researchers have promoted the idea of geoengineering, using technology to offset the effects of carbon emissions. Such schemes are commonly dismissed as pie in the sky, but the Azolla Event suggests otherwise. After all, if a bunch of dumb ferns could naturally perform carbon sequestration on such a tremendous scale, why couldnâ€™t clever humans deliberately do the same thing?&nbsp;</p>
<p>â€œItâ€™s clear that plants have been able to contribute to really big geological events in the Earth's history,â€� says <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/research/faculty-staff/rob-martienssen/" target="_blank">Rob Martienssen</a>, a plant geneticist at <a href="https://www.cshl.edu/">Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory</a> in Long Island. â€œBeing able to harness that power and speed it up seems like a realistic goal to me.â€�&nbsp;</p>

<p><span>P</span>lanting another enormous fern garden in Arctic waters isnâ€™t an option this time around. The <em>Azolla</em> plants saw to that, eliminating their own habitat when they transformed the global climate (humans, take note). As a stand-in, Martienssen has set his sights on duckweed, the ubiquitous, scum-like greenery that spreads across stagnant ponds in summer. â€œJust like <em>Azolla</em>, itâ€™s an aquatic plant that grows extremely rapidly. It really does the same thing,â€� he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each individual duckweed plant consists of little more than a single, oval leaf roughly the size of a grain of rice that floats atop still or slow-moving freshwater. What they lack in size, though, the plants make up for in fortitude. Duckweed is one of the fastest-growing plants on Earth. A colony can double in mass every two days and is so hardy that it can grow in wastewater, according to bioengineer Jay Cheng of North Carolina State University.</p>
<p>Martienssen became intrigued by the extraordinary vigor of duckweed about a decade ago, partnering with Brookhaven National Labs to explore its potential as a raw material for making liquid fuels to replace petroleum. In principle, plant-based fuels would be endlessly renewable and carbon neutral—that is, the plants would absorb just as much carbon during their growth as they would emit when burned, adding no net carbon to the environment. Although he is still pursuing the biofuel angle, supported by a $6.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy, Martienssen has since been bitten by a more radical idea: If we could harvest vast quantities of fast-growing duckweed and dispose of them <em>Azolla</em>-style, we could take their carbon out of the environment entirely.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote><em>Our climate woes come from burning ancient plants. This would be like reversing the fossil-fuel industry.</em></blockquote>
<p>Step one would be finding a way to transform masses of duckweed into an efficient carbon-absorption machine. Growing normally, aquatic plants like duckweed have been <a href="http://theazollafoundation.org/azollas-uses/as-a-co2-sequester/" target="_blank">estimated</a> to take in up to 10 times as much carbon per acre as a healthy forest—good, but not good enough. In an industrialized setting, Martienssen proposes, engineers could use air-capture technology to pipe in extra carbon dioxide that would boost the plantsâ€™ growth, accelerating the process. â€œWe would grow them in indoor farms with LEDs,â€� he says. â€œWeâ€™d need very little water, since can grow in very shallow water or even in tubes or bags, to produce huge amounts of duckweed.â€�<br></p>
<p>Even so, this would be a long-term project; after all, it took the <em>Azolla</em> ferns 800,000 years to remove most of Earthâ€™s carbon dioxide. Fortunately, we donâ€™t need to go nearly that far. Rolling back modern atmospheric carbon dioxide levels by just 10 percent would have significant climate benefits, and it would reduce the job to the equivalent of 8,000 years of <em>Azolla</em> growth. Intensive cultivation could then speed things up considerably. â€œIf we use an indoor environment with highly enriched carbon dioxide, maybe we could get the number to 80 years,â€� Martienssen says. â€œThese are back-of-the-envelope calculations, but it seems to me that with the right investment and economic incentives, we really could do it,â€� he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That would then lead to step two, finding a place to dispose of all that duckweed. Sure, it could be treated like industrial waste and stuffed into airtight containers, but Martienssen is drawn to a more elegant solution. He notes that peat bogs around the world are being systematically drained and burned, destroying valuable ecosystems and further boosting greenhouse emissions. Harvested duckweed could potentially be converted into artificial peat and used to build up the bogs. Once buried, peat remains sequestered for thousands of years or more.</p>
<p>There would be a tidy symmetry in this approach. Much of our current climate woes come from digging up and burning ancient plants that transformed into fossil fuels. â€œMaking synthetic peat deposits would be like reversing the fossil-fuel industry,â€� Martienssen says. â€œIt would be running the process backward and doing something a bit more natural.â€�</p>

<figure><figcaption><span>Engineered "ideal plants" are being designed to put carbon into the ground, and keep it there. </span><br><span>Salk Institute</span></figcaption></figure>
<p><span>T</span>he biggest obstacle to using duckweed for climate control is the magnitude of the job. Really, that is the existential obstacle to any proposed geoengineering scheme, because the scale of human greenhouse emissions is so ridiculously vast. Last year, human activities released the equivalent of 43 billion tons of carbon dioxide, according to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.carbonbrief.org/analysis-global-fossil-fuel-emissions-up-zero-point-six-per-cent-in-2019-due-to-china" target="_blank">analysis</a>&nbsp;by the climate-research group Carbon Brief; thatâ€™s the mass of a good-size mountain. A bit over half that amount gets absorbed the land and water, leaving an extra 19 billion tons floating around in the atmosphere.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As Martienssenâ€™s calculations show, there is no easy way to make that much carbon disappear, even with the help of fast-growing plants. At the Salk Institute for Biological Sciences in La Jolla, California, plant biologist&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salk.edu/scientist/wolfgang-busch/" target="_blank">Wolfgang Busch</a>&nbsp;thinks that Martienssen has the right idea but is approaching it the wrong way, or at least, not the easiest way. Cultivating duckweed would require creating a vast new industry. Busch points out that we already have a global infrastructure of plants that could be adapted to reduce carbon emissions—farms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>â€œIf you reinvent the wheel, it will take a long time. In agriculture, you already have people planting updated seeds every year,â€� he says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The way itâ€™s practiced today, farming is actually part of the problem. â€œSoil carbon content has been reduced dramatically over the past century in industrialized, monoculture agriculture,â€� Busch explains. The carbon that was stripped out of the dirt has gone straight into the air, contributing significantly to climate change. Meanwhile, the crops themselves are no help. Farmers harvest and till, harvest and till, over and over, cycling carbon in and out of their fields with no net carbon absorption.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2017, a group at Salk led by plant biologist Joanne Chory founded the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.salk.edu/harnessing-plants-initiative/" target="_blank">Harnessing Plants Initiative</a>&nbsp;to find ways to make farming part of the solution instead. Busch, an expert in root growth, joined the project and became its co-director. The group soon zeroed in on the idea of genetically altered crops that would put carbon back into the soil, and then keep it there.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>As soon as you talk about messing with the plants that people eat, both consumers and producers get worried.</blockquote>
<p>Busch and his group hit on two types of genetic medication that could do just that. Plants could be altered to grow deeper root systems that would leave more of the roots (and their carbon content) buried in the soil after harvest. More dramatically, the Salk researchers realized that they could also engineer crops so that their roots would produce suberin, a waxy compound found in cork. Much like the cork in a wine bottle, fragments of the&nbsp;suberin-infused roots would then take an extremely long time to decompose. Up above, harvesting would go on as usual; down below, the roots of the crops would accumulate in the soil, building up its stored carbon. In essence, every square foot of farmland would become an <em>Azolla</em> event in miniature, entombing a little puff of atmospheric carbon dioxide.&nbsp;<br></p>
<p>Like Martienssen, Busch runs what-if numbers to make his approach could have a meaningful impact. â€œThere's already more than 600 million hectares of cropland worldwide,â€� he says. â€œThere are five target crops we think we can deal with: corn, soy, wheat, rice, canola. We considered that at some point in the future, 70 percent of those crops could be enhanced. Then we asked, â€˜What would happen if we could stabilize 30 percent of the biomass in the root mass?â€™ You end up with 5.5 gigatons of carbon dioxide per year, which is roughly 30 percent of the annual surplus [human emissions] that is leaked in the atmosphere. That was to us encouraging.â€�</p>

<p>Unemployment, hunger, institutional breakdown, and the destruction of social bonds are not symptoms of a virus. They are the indirect violence of class warfare. The pandemic is a convenient scapegoat for the largest upward wealth transfer in modern human history. Under the pretext of a public health policy, elites have successfully waged a counterrevolution that will result in the erosion of working conditions and quality of life for generations to come.&nbsp;</p>



<h5><strong>A Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</strong></h5>



<p>Death, disease, and pandemics have always been part of human life and they always will be. <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/deaths.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2.8 million</a> Americans die every year and <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">56 million</a> people die worldwide.

In 1968 <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/1968-flu-pandemic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1-4 million</a> people died in the H2N3 influenza pandemic, during which businesses and schools <a href="https://nypost.com/2020/05/16/why-life-went-on-as-normal-during-the-killer-pandemic-of-1969/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stayed open</a> and large events were held.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Indefinite closures have never before been used as a disease control method on a global scale.

<p>In March unprecedented policies were rationalized through shocking <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/13/italian-doctor-an-experience-i-would-compare-to-a-world-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stories</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_J60fQr0GWo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos</a> from northern Italy. The region’s crowded ICUs were presented as a warning for the rest of Europe and the US. Unknown to many was the fact that Lombardy had been severely impacted by <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/19/business/lombardy-italy-coronavirus-doctors.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing privatization efforts</a> and a <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/557042/hospitals-in-italy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shrinking hospital system</a> regularly overwhelmed by <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1201971219303285" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">influenza</a>. This omission by mainstream media played a key role in developing the mythology that economic shutdown could magically eradicate a virus.

They will also experience <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/opinion/sunday/covid-quarantine-children-immune-systems.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weakened immune systems</a> due to lack of exposure to seasonal viruses and natural pathogens.</p>



<p>For people with chronic health conditions or those in need of urgent medical treatment, the short- and long-term consequences of lockdown are disastrous. In the United States, cancer screenings fell by <a href="https://www.radiologybusiness.com/topics/healthcare-economics/cancer-screenings-epic-ehr-covid-19-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">86-94%</a> in the spring. Many hospitals <a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/finance/47-hospitals-closed-filed-for-bankruptcy-this-year.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to close</a> due to lack of revenue from routine surgeries and procedures. Hospitals are expected to lose a total of <a href="https://www.aha.org/news/headline/2020-06-30-aha-report-hospital-financial-losses-covid-19-expected-top-323-billion#:~:text=An%20AHA%20report%20released%20today,least%20%24323%20billion%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$323 billion</a> this year. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/10/853524764/amid-pandemic-hospitals-lay-off-1-4m-workers-in-april" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.4 million hospital staff</a> were laid off in April while private health insurance companies <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/05/health/covid-insurance-profits.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubled their earnings</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the absence of meaningful investments in healthcare infrastructure, the covid mitigation strategies being pushed by federal, state, and local governments are neither credible nor effective. Elected officials routinely amplify raw case numbers in order to stoke fear and blame individuals for viral spread. As a result, we are currently “saving lives” by killing people. This is not an unforced error or a good policy idea implemented poorly. It is an economic agenda disguised as a health protocol.</p>



<h5>The New Caste System&nbsp;</h5>



<p>California Governor Gavin Newsom sends his children to <a href="https://www.politico.com/states/california/story/2020/10/30/newsom-sends-his-children-back-to-school-classrooms-in-california-1332811" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in-person private school</a> while mandating virtual education for California public schools. He announced a <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/06/california-covid-lockdown-us-new-cases-hospitalisations-deaths-stay-at-home-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second statewide lockdown</a> just a few weeks after attending an indoor, unmasked <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2020/11/18/newsom-lobbyist-dinner-party-437892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dinner with lobbyists</a> at a Michelin three star restaurant where meals can cost up to <a href="https://sf.eater.com/2020/9/3/21421335/french-laundry-yountville-thomas-keller-indoor-dining-rich-people" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$850 per person</a>. Newsom is just one of many <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/23/nyregion/cuomo-thanksgiving-mother.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">politicians</a>, elites, and <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/mask-mischief-11595625179" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bureaucrats</a> who break the rules. A static social order is being solidified. In our new caste system the wealthy have political and social <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-03/u-k-to-exempt-high-value-business-travelers-from-quarantine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">privileges</a> because they are considered clean and disease-free, while the more low-income someone is, the more they are treated as contaminated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The goal of lockdown enthusiasts in the “work from home” caste is to shift risk away from themselves and onto essential workers and the poor. <a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20201023-coronavirus-how-will-the-pandemic-change-the-way-we-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Only 40%</a> of the workforce can afford to stay home. <a href="https://www.commonwealthfund.org/publications/issue-briefs/2020/aug/looming-crisis-health-coverage-2020-biennial#:~:text=In%20the%20first%20half%20of%202020%2C%2043.4%20percent%20of%20U.S.,uninsured%20rate%20was%2012.5%20percent." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">43% of US adults</a> do not have adequate health insurance, and only 31% of low-paid workers have <a href="https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2020/03/12/as-coronavirus-spreads-which-u-s-workers-have-paid-sick-leave-and-which-dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">paid sick leave</a> compared to 92% of high-paid workers. “Stay home” is the self-congratulatory mantra of professionals who believe that their virtuous behavior prevents them from contracting covid. In fact, income is the <a href="https://prospect.org/coronavirus/covid-19-class-war-death-rates-income/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">main determinant</a> of covid mortality.</p>



<p>Lockdown fanatics have helped manufacture consent for a brutal reorganization of labor that will plunge millions of people into serfdom. The work-from-home lifestyle is only possible through the labor of logistics workers who transport, sort, and deliver goods. Currently about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/live/2020/12/04/business/us-economy-coronavirus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million jobs</a> that existed in February have not been replaced. Many workers have been forced to take on part-time, no-contract work, a labor model that is <a href="https://qz.com/1556194/the-gig-economy-is-quietly-undermining-a-century-of-worker-protections/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolling back</a> decades of hard-fought protections.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Under the Obama/Biden administration, 94% of new jobs created were gig work, and in 2017 <a href="https://www.ilo.org/washington/WCMS_642303/lang--en/index.htm#:~:text=The%20Bureau%20of%20Labor%20Statistics,to%2043%20percent%20in%202020." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">34% of the workforce</a> was employed through the gig economy. Shutdowns are accelerating this trend, with food delivery apps <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/30/nyregion/bike-delivery-workers-covid-pandemic.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">growing their profits</a> as workers struggle to get by. Subscription platforms like OnlyFans saw a <a href="https://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/article/Coronavirus-took-their-jobs-away-OnlyFans-let-15175650.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surge in accounts</a> at the beginning of lockdown. In March the company saw a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/style/camsoda-onlyfans-streaming-sex-coronavirus.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75% increase in users and 60,000 new creators</a>.

<p>Internationally, workplace closures and supply chain disruptions will result in the loss of <a href="http://ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_743036/lang--en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">305 million</a> jobs. <a href="https://www.ilo.org/global/topics/employment-promotion/informal-economy/publications/WCMS_743534/lang--en/index.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.6 billion</a> informal economy workers are at risk of losing their livelihoods.

In July closed food markets were linked to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-ap-top-news-understanding-the-outbreak-hunger-international-news-5cbee9693c52728a3808f4e7b4965cbd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10,000 child deaths a month</a>. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/11/business/coronavirus-destroying-food.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Food is being discarded</a> and crops are rotting in the fields while the number of people facing acute hunger this year has doubled to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html">265 </a><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/22/world/africa/coronavirus-hunger-crisis.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">million</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the start of the covid crisis, vocal segments of the American left argued that economic shutdown was a way to resist <a href="https://jacobinmag.com/2020/03/donald-trump-wall-street-coronavirus-profits" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">billionaires</a> and <a href="https://www.dsausa.org/democratic-left/we-need-a-global-democratic-socialist-response-to-covid-19/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">capitalism</a>. This demonstrated a deep misunderstanding of the way <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/financial-edge/0411/5-investors-that-are-both-rich-and-smart.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financiers can profit</a> from economic contraction.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><div><div><div><div><div><div><h2>Hanlon's Razor</h2><p>Never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Hanlon's razor asks for reflection in situations where we perceive behavior  to be intentionally malicious. A useful exercise is to rethink the scenario  by replacing the malicious intent with reasons such as stupidity, stress or  just plain old misunderstanding.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Your five-year old probably isn't making a mess to make your life miserable  but rather because they're a toddler.</p></li><li><p>A social networking website probably didn't flag your content out of malice  but rather due to a faulty algorithm.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Occam's Razor</h2><p>When comparing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Occam's razor originally stated that entities should not be multiplied unnecessarily. In other words, don't complicate things when you don't need to. By shaving off unnecessary additions, the resulting explanation tends  to be less ambiguous, easier to verify, and just plain simpler. Occam's  Razor is often mentioned when selecting a simple solution over a complex  one. Note that this is a slightly stronger form than the principle  intended--reality can be complex and there are cases where the simple  solution is not correct.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>A sore throat during during the winter is probably the result of a cold even though the symptoms match a rare terminal disease on WebMD.</p></li><li><p>The pyramids being built by humans has far less assumptions than the pyramids being built by aliens.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>First Principles Reasoning</h2><p>Break complex problems into foundational elements and use these elements to build your reasoning.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>A first principle is a foundational assumption or proposition that cannot be derived from other assumption or propositions. By attempting to break down problems into first principles and re-constructing solutions using these building blocks, you're less likely to be biased by prior assumptions. This in turn can lead to more innovative solutions.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>A child repeatedly asking "why?" to answers for an initial question is intuitively thinking in first principles.</p></li><li><p>A company building a cheaper product than competitors by investigating ways of using the raw materials firsthand instead of just following existing conventions.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Proximate and Root Causes</h2><p>Discovering the root cause of an event involves looking deeper than the immediate causes for that event.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>A proximate cause is the event most closely associated with or immediately responsible for an observed result. This may differ from the root cause. Getting to a root cause often requires a deep dive into the situation using approaches like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Socratic_questioning">Socratic questioning</a> or the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys">5 Whys</a></p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Post-mortem reports for critical failures generally outline proximate causes and how they stem from the root cause. For instance a website was down due servers running out of disk space which was in turn a result of a bug which in turn was a result of poor testing and so on.</p></li><li><p>A child repeatedly asking "why?" to answers for an initial question is trying to get to the root cause.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Social Proof</h2><p>We tend to copy the behavior of others, especially during times of uncertainty.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Social proof is a term used to describe our tendency to follow the behavior of others. This tendency is amplified if we are uncertain about the situation. Social proof generally guides us into making fewer mistakesâ€”if many folks are doing something, itâ€™s usually the correct thing to do. However, this â€œauto-pilotâ€� behavior can be easily exploited to manipulate our decision making process. For instance, to lead us towards a decision that serves someone else's interests or is incorrect.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Laugh tracks in TV shows and hired clappers in a theater performance can trick us into perceiving the content to be funnier or higher quality than it actually is.</p></li><li><p>Testimonials increase our likelihood of buying a product, especially when they indicate popularity. Terms like â€œbest sellingâ€� or â€œrecommended by 9 out of 10 professionalsâ€� are marketing applications of social proof.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Survivorship Bias</h2><p>We tend to focus on things that survived and overlook things that didn't. This can lead to overly optimistic beliefs.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Survivorship bias occurs when we develop a skewed view of a situation by concentrating on the people or things that survived. Things that didn't survive lack visibility and are overlooked. A common result of survivorship bias is overly optimistic beliefs. By focusing primarily on the success stories, we fail to fully understand why the "failures" did not survive, often just assuming that it's due to a lack of qualities found in the survivors. Looking for counter examples when deriving patterns from success stories can be a useful exercise in combating survivorship bias.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>sWe often attribute the success of famous entrepreneurs solely to their behavior and overlook things like luck and timing. By ignoring the failed companies that followed similar approaches, we might be overly optimistic about the likelihood of our own entrepreneurial success.</p></li><li><p>It's easy to perceive music from the past as being higher quality than contemporary works. Music from the past, however, has gone through a selection process where higher quality works have survived. With contemporary music, we hear the mediocre along with the good.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Reciprocity</h2><p>We tend to feel obligated to repay positive actions towards us (e.g. favors, gifts) even if they are unwanted.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Reciprocity refers to a social norm in which we feel a sense of obligation when receiving positive actions towards us. For instance, receiving a favor or gift can trigger feelings of indebtedness to repay the act in someway. While reciprocity allows one to build relationships and exchanges, it can be exploited to gain someone's compliance to a request. This is because feelings of obligation can be felt even when receiving a positive action we do not want.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Before attempting to sell something, a salesperson may give you a small gift (e.g. a pen or a free sample). Even if this gift is unwanted, receiving it can still trigger a need to repay the gift, usually in the form of purchasing whatever is being sold.</p></li><li><p>A common compliance technique is to start by making a large request that's likely to be rejected followed by a second, smaller request. The second request, which is the intended request, is more likely to be accepted as it's seen as a favor.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Hindsight Bias</h2><p>The feeling that we could have predicted an event after it occurs (i.e. we "knew it all along").</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Hindsight bias is the feeling we get when we perceive an event as being predictable, even though there's little evidence to suggest we could have predicted it. Once the event has occurred, it's easy to work backwards and find explanations. While hindsight bias can result in increased confidence and performance, too much can lead to overconfidence and an inability to learn from experience. For instance, by assuming that we could have done better than others after knowing the results of their actions, we lost an opportunity to understand why those actions were made.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>In court, judgement of a defendant can be clouded by hindsight bias. The jury, knowing the outcome of the defendant's actions, might feel as if they could have predicted the outcome.</p></li><li><p>We may feel that people in the past were less intelligent or innovative than those of the present without acknowledging that they did not access to present day information. Related: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historian%27s_fallacy">Historian's fallacy</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronological_snobbery">chronological snobbery</a>.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Confirmation Bias</h2><p>We have a tendency to perceive things in a way that re-enforces or aligns with our preexisting beliefs.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Confirmation bias is a cognitive bias that causes us to see things in a way that confirms our preexisting beliefs. Because it involves selectively collecting and recalling information, the end result is a biased view point. In addition, confirmation bias may also cause us to ignore information that doesn't support our views. Closely related is the feeling of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dissonance">cognitive dissonance</a> which refers to the discomfort we feel when holding contradictory beliefs.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>In social media, we're often shown content that we're more likely to agree with. This amplifies confirmation bias--we only see things consistent with our beliefs resulting a sort of "echo chamber". For more on this, see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_bubble">filter bubbles</a>.</p></li><li><p>Belief in farfetched conspiracy theories can often be a result of confirmation bias. If one tries hard enough, they can find things that seem to support the theory while ignoring the evidence that refutes it.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Scarcity</h2><p>We tend to place higher value on things that are rare and lower value on things that are abundant.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>Scarcity refers to our tendency to place value on things according to how rare they are. It's often used as a mental shortcut to assess the value of something based on how easy or difficult is it to acquire. Scarcity doesn't just apply to objects--it can also be applied to things like time and information. For instance, we might place high value on spending some time with a busy individual or getting access to confidential information. Since scarcity can increase our desire for something, it's often artificially created to sell something. A good strategy to combat this desire is to remember that scarcity only increases our desire to obtain something and doesn't affect the actual value we'll extract from it.</p><h4>Examples</h4><ul><li><p>Sales techniques likes setting deadlines on promotions or indicating that limited quantities are available are designed to drive up scarcity driven desire for the item being sold.</p></li><li><p>When information is censored, we not only feel a stronger desire to know about it and but also tend to be more favorable to it.</p></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br><div><div><div><div><h2>Pareto Principle</h2><p>For many scenarios, 80% of the effects stem from 20% of the causes. This is often referred to as the 80/20 rule.</p></div></div><div><div><h4>Description</h4><p>In 1896, economist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vilfredo_Pareto">Vilfredo Pareto</a> found that 20% of the population in Italy owned 80% of the land.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
        <p>I have found it difficult to keep track of all the new
container-related terminology: container orchestrators, serverless,
cloud native, and so forth. I think a term that hasn’t gotten much
usage yet, <em>operatingsystemless</em> (<a href="http://blogdelsinkcom.azurewebsites.net/containerless/">mentioned
here</a>), is a
really apt way of understanding where compute is going and hopefully
will gain some increased adoption. This is based on an observation
that the trend over the last two decades, for production systems, has
been to increasingly reduce the usage of any explicit use of most
operating system features. Ultimately, production systems may evolve
to some form of Unikernel-like format(s), although it is hard to say
exactly what that would look like.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this blog entry I’m going to wildly oversimplify
and classify compute workloads into two camps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Interactive</strong> applications; workloads intended to be run on a
single machine, with a human logged in and, if not actively
interacting with the software, at least able to check in from time
to time and fix problems as they arise</li>
<li><strong>Production</strong> systems; workloads intended to be run on many
machines, without many humans close by; humans can be paged in
(ideally by automated systems) to fix problems, but only at
significant cost</li>
</ol>
<p>When my present company first deployed a major website in the late
1990s, Unix was the natural choice for the production systems.
Although designed for interactive workloads (multi-user workstations),
engineers working on our systems were familiar with Unix, and the
company needed to move fast. Unix was (and still is) an excellent
operating system for software development. Although there is no law of
physics stating that one must use the same operating system in both
production and development environments, there was no other practical
alternative at the time.</p>
<p>Our website had, roughly, the following architecture (circa 1999):</p>
<pre><code>webserver (x8)           database (cluster)
--------------           ------------------

httpd (master)        /--floating-ip
  \_ httpd (child)|  /
  \_ httpd (child)|_/
  \_ httpd (child)|
  \_ httpd (child)|
</code></pre><p>I won’t focus too much on the database side of things, just the
webservers. On each of the webserver machines, using Unix had a number
of missing features and even anti-features, when it came to
production services, which I’ll outline in the next few sections.</p>
<h2 id="process-management">Process Management</h2>
<p>You’ll notice in the diagram above that there was nothing to make sure
the master <strong>httpd</strong> process actually stayed up. In fact, we had a
Perl script that would sweep across all the webservers and make sure
those processes were running. This was because Unix was not really
designed for this kind of lights-out automated scenario. Unix has been
geared towards humans sitting at workstations. There are myriad ways
that processes can get
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_(system_call)#Uninterruptible_sleep">stuck</a>
(or become <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process">zombies</a>).
In production those states are difficult to handle correctly; one
would prefer they not exist. In the interactive workstation case,
they’re acceptable annoyances.</p>
<p>Process management is also primitive. For a production system one
wants <a href="http://erlang.org/documentation/doc-4.9.1/doc/design_principles/sup_princ.html">supervision
tree</a>
semantics to ensure fail-fast, crash-only systems that are naturally
self-healing:</p>
<ol>
<li>One can be certain that specific processes are always present, yet
also do not restart so quickly (under error conditions) that they
swamp the CPU</li>
<li>If a parent process dies, all child processes automatically die as
well</li>
<li>If a child process dies with an error code, the parent process must
explicitly inform the operating system that it handled the error,
otherwise it, too, dies</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zombie_process">Zombie processes</a> are not possible</li>
</ol>
<p>As another example of a missing feature, the Perl script mentioned
above had code that would try to ensure that all the child processes
of a webserver were actually killed, even if they themselves spawned
children. Unix does not provide this sort of behavior, and we were
never able to fix all the potential race conditions.</p>
<p>As a result, the industry has produced numerous “process managers”,
over the years, outside of the operating system proper, none of which
are wholly satisfactory: SYSV init, upstart, systemd, runit, monit,
daemontools, etc. All of these systems have their pros and cons, but I
think fully robust production-oriented process management cannot be
solved outside of the kernel. Without kernel-level guarantees, there
will always be edge cases where processes spawn endlessly, fail to
restart, etc.</p>
<p>The industry-wide trend in response to this has been to stop launching
multiple processes on the same (logical) machine at all, leveraging
new kernel features like chroot, namespaces and cgroups.</p>
<h2 id="terminal-handling">Terminal Handling</h2>
<p>Unix has a complex set of <a href="https://www.linusakesson.net/programming/tty/">terminal handling
capabilities</a> necessary
for multiple human users on the same machine. This capability is
useless for a service with thousands of machines running
non-interactive workloads. And no terminals in sight. Although
terminal handling is useful for those times when an engineer is trying
to diagnose a problem, even this is considered an anti-pattern. Partly
to accommodate terminal handling, Unix has an unnecessarily complex
process model centered around interactive control of processes.</p>
<h3 id="job-control">Job Control</h3>
<p>Closely intertwined with Unix support for terminals is Unix job
control functionality. It was not designed for production systems. The
most obvious example is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_control_(Unix)#Implementation">terminal
stop</a>
feature, allowing a human to suspend a running process by hitting a
key on the keyboard like Control-Z. In a headless service, processes
should never “stop” in this way. The mere presence of the concept of a
“stopped” process means either one more aspect of Unix one must
ignore, or else one more aspect to ensure never happens via
monitoring.</p>
<h3 id="sessions">Sessions</h3>
<p>Also closely related to terminal handling is the Unix idea of
<a href="https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/">sessions</a>.
Sessions are groups of processes that can be, as a group, associated
(or disassociated) from an interactive terminal. Although the name
“session” sounds like it might be useful, the implementation is
irrelevant for production systems.</p>
<h2 id="scheduling">Scheduling</h2>
<p>Scheduling on a single machine, with one process (or at least very
few), becomes a lot simpler, as there is only one (or, again, a very
few) process to schedule. At the same time, in production systems the
more important kind of scheduling occurs across a cluster of machines.
For example, scheduling two processes near or far from each other (for
either performance or blast radius purposes), requires cluster wide
knowledge of which workloads are related to each other and where they
are already running. Scheduling more processes of a certain type
because a queue or load-balancer has become backed-up requires both
knowing about the load balancer, knowing if/where there is free
capacity, and knowing what type of process to spawn in order to fix
that particular type of backlog. For reliability, this knowledge must
be distributed across the cluster, not just tracked on a single
machine.</p>
<h2 id="users-and-groups">Users and Groups</h2>
<p>One of the first pain points when using Unix for production, was
answering the question, “what users and groups should my processes run
as?” While we naturally did not want anything to run as root, picking
arbitrary users and groups at all was an annoyance. User and group
membership on an individual machine does not have much meaning in a
production environment. At best, it helped keep two services on the
same machine (which one needed to do from time to time, for cost
reasons, in the pre-VM era) somewhat separate from each other. This,
though, required complex management system to push the right user and
group configuration to every machine.</p>
<p>Worse, the things one would want to control (for example which
database servers were accessible to the process) also require
knowledge and ownership that exists outside of the production
machines. Over the network, everybody is <code>nobody</code>, even <code>root</code> users.</p>
<p>Overall, for production systems, machine-local users and groups just
add a lot of hassle without much benefit.</p>

<p>To get a sense of how little of Unix is necessary for distributed
systems, it’s worth taking a look at <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/google/gvisor/3ac00fe9c3396f07a1416ff7fc855f6f9a3c4304/pkg/sentry/syscalls/linux/linux64.go">gVisor’s list of supported
system
calls</a>.
This serves as a reasonable, albeit conservative, proxy for what a
modern “container” needs from an operating system. Note that under 50%
of all Linux syscalls are fully supported, and some of those
(<code>getgid</code>, etc) clearly aren’t necessary in the long run.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Count</th>
<th>Status</th>
<th>Percentage</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>165</td>
<td>Supported</td>
<td>47.5%</td>

</table>
<p>Overall there is a trend moving away from using traditional
workstation operating system features at all:</p>
<ol>
<li>Either a single process per “machine”, using multiple threads, if
necessary, or else using multiple processes but in a strict
supervision tree as outlined earlier</li>
<li>All IPC is over the network abstraction, even if physically local</li>
<li>No users or groups</li>
<li>Scheduling decisions made based on external factors (e.g., work
queue depth)</li>
<li>Little to no use of signals and no terminal handling features</li>
</ol>

      <article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/BlogPosting">

  

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>Two years ago, I did something that I’d never done in my career before- I left a job
(at <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>) only a few months after starting it. In this post, I want to explain
what happened and what I learned from the experience.</p>

<h2 id="what-happened">What happened</h2>

<h4 id="the-job-switch">The job switch</h4>

<p>Back in the spring of 2019, I decided to leave <a href="https://www.stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, where I’d
been a software engineer for about a year and a half. The full details are best left
to a separate post, but at a high level I just wasn’t very happy with my personal situation; the
work I was doing in compute infrastructure had the unfortunate combination of being both
overly stressful and underappreciated. At the same time, I felt like my career prospects
were limited because the upper rungs of Stripe’s engineering individual contributor (IC) ladder put
a lot of emphasis on cross-team coordination and other, managerial-like activities that I didn’t
enjoy and felt I wasn’t very good at.</p>

<p>Given how hot the job market was at the time and the number of other, seemingly more interesting
opportunities available, I figured that I had nothing to lose by interviewing elsewhere.</p>

<p>After a few weekends of furiously-paced <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/master-coding-interviews">Leetcoding</a>, I was ready.
Unlike my previous job searches, there wasn’t any particular company that I was aspiring
to get into; instead, I just went through my <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/six-years-of-emails">backlog of recruiting emails</a>
and wrote back to a bunch that looked interesting. Among the messages I responded to was one
about <a href="https://nuro.ai/">Nuro</a>, an autonomous vehicle startup that was attempting to do driverless
grocery delivery.</p>

<p>Over the following weeks, I went through the full recruitment slog, starting with lots of
recruiter phone calls, then following up with technical phone screens for a subset of
those, then doing onsite interviews for a subset of those. In the end, I got offers from seven
places, including Nuro.</p>

<p>During the process, I didn’t fall in love with any of the options. But, there
was something that made me feel more optimistic about Nuro than the other choices. Being a
hardware-oriented, robotics company, it was just really different from all of my previous employers,
and, after years of feeling stuck in my career, maybe different was good.</p>

<p>The company was super secretive about its technology; I wasn’t allowed to tour the office, for
instance, because they had hardware prototypes lying around that only employees were allowed to
see. I also wasn’t invited to ride along in their test cars, which would have been both fun and
informative. The external signs were good, though- they had raised a billion dollars from Softbank
and others, and the employee reviews on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.com/">Glassdoor</a> were gushing.</p>

<p>Aside from being in a somewhat different space than my previous employers, another potential
downside was the commute. Stripe and my three jobs before that were all within a 15 minute walk
of my apartment in San Francisco. Nuro’s office was 40 miles away in Mountain View, which was
more than an hour each way by train. But, I had done longer commutes earlier in my career and figured
that I could handle it.</p>

<p>In the end, I went with my impulses and signed the offer. I had my last day at Stripe, took a short
vacation, and then showed up at the Nuro office, brimming with optimism, for my first day two weeks
later.</p>

<h4 id="realizing-my-mistake">Realizing my mistake</h4>

<p>Unfortunately, that optimism lasted for a grand total of 2 days. By Wednesday of my first week,
as I was riding the train home, I realized that I had made a mistake. My colleagues were
friendly and smart, and the company was doing interesting things, but the job just felt like a
lifestyle downgrade to me.</p>

<p>At Stripe and each of my jobs before that, I had had a short commute to a beautiful office, and
got to experience the instant gratification associated with developing purely software-based
products. Now, I was stuck taking a crowded train to a dark office littered with hardware parts,
working on a product that would take many years to reach mass-market adoption due to pesky little
things like manufacturing and road safety.</p>

<p>I had left Stripe seeking an upgrade, but instead I got a downgrade. And, while minor improvements
were possible, it seemed unlikely that things would completely change for the better in the near
term.</p>

<h4 id="getting-back-on-track">Getting back on track</h4>

<p>At this point, I had three choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Quit immediately</li>
  <li>Start exploring new opportunities but don’t quit until something better is lined up</li>
  <li>Stick it out for at least a year</li>
</ol>

<p>My first instinct was to take option 1 and just go back to Stripe. When I reached out to my HR
contact, though, I found out that I’d have to go through team matching again and also get a new
offer; even though I’d left on good terms less than a month before, I couldn’t just revert back to
my previous position and pay. This was disappointing, but after giving it a little more thought,
I figured it was for the best because I had left Stripe for specific reasons; going back
to my old job wouldn’t fix those or make me feel better about them.</p>

<p>Another variant of option 1 would be to quit and take one of the other offers I had gotten
during my search. But, I had already rejected those for what I thought were good reasons,
so this didn’t feel like the best way out.</p>

<p>Option 3 was the one that would look the least bad from a resume perspective, and this seems to be
what a lot of people in tech do when they don’t like a job. But, life is short, I was really feeling
unhappy with the choice I had made, and I figured it wasn’t really fair to my colleagues at Nuro to
stick in a job that my heart wasn’t in.</p>

<p>So, in the end, I decided that option 2 was the best fit for me. I continued at Nuro and did my best
to get up-to-speed and to contribute to my team’s work, but at the same time jumped right back
into the job market. In addition to keeping things open with Stripe, I
<a href="https://yolken.net/blog/triplebyte-review">tried Triplebyte</a>, responded to more recruiter emails, and also
reached out to some former colleagues about the companies they were now at.</p>

<p>I then went through the whole recruitment process with a new set of companies. This time,
though, I was a lot pickier about where I interviewed (nothing in hardware or with long commutes!);
after a few weeks, I had four new choices including an updated offer from Stripe. After
a good amount of due diligence, significantly more than I had done in my previous search, I
decided to go to <a href="https://segment.com/">Segment</a>.</p>

<p>When I put in my notice at Nuro, people were surprised that I was leaving so soon, but ultimately
were understanding. I left, took a short vacation, and then started at Segment. Thankfully,
the new job was a much better fit for me, and I’m much happier now!</p>

<h2 id="lessons-learned">Lessons learned</h2>

<h4 id="do-your-due-diligence">Do your due diligence</h4>

<p>Switching jobs is a big deal, and it shouldn’t be done impulsively. Ideally, your due
diligence before signing a new offer should include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Meeting with the team you’ll be working with in a low-stress, non-interview setting</li>
  <li>Touring the office and understanding what your specific workspace will be like</li>
  <li>Trying out the commute for a few days (if it’s significantly different than your current one)</li>
  <li>Trying out any new languages/technologies that you’ll be using on the job</li>
  <li>Getting hands-on demos of the company’s products (if they’re not freely accessible to consumers
  already)</li>
  <li>Seeing a summary of the company’s income and expenses over time (if not public)</li>
</ol>

<p>Learning about these things doesn’t guarantee that you’ll be happy in your new job, but it
at least reduces the risk of any unexpected surprises after you start.</p>

<h4 id="its-ok-to-quit-after-a-few-weeks-just-dont-make-it-a-pattern">It’s ok to quit after a few weeks (just don’t make it a pattern)</h4>

<p>When I started my second job search, I was worried that the short
tenure in the job I was trying to leave would be a turn-off to perspective employers. In reality,
however, it wasn’t a big deal- people asked about it, but seemed satisfied with my 20 second
summary and then moved on to other things.</p>

<p>The sense I get is that you’re allowed to quit a new job once in your career without any
repercussions. If you do it multiple times, however, then recruiters and hiring managers might
have second thoughts about interviewing you without strong internal references or some other signal
that you’ll be a good employee.</p>

<h4 id="switch-teams-before-quitting">Switch teams before quitting</h4>

<p>As I noted in a <a href="https://yolken.net/blog/leaving-a-job">previous post</a>, switching teams is a lot easier than
switching jobs. I didn’t do this before I left Stripe because there weren’t any other teams that I
was super enthusiastic about at the time. But, in retrospect, I probably should have given this a
try before quitting.</p>

<p>Even if the new team hadn’t been a perfect fit, it would have at least bought some time and given
me some additional experience that could help in future work. This is what I did at Google
and Airbnb, and in both cases the “second team” was what really opened up new opportunities for me.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><div><div><p>A previous <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/tens-of-thousands-of-news-articles-are-labeled-as-unsafe-for-advertisers">Adalytics</a> post discussed how tens of thousands of articles on the <em>New York Times</em>, <em>Wall Street Journal</em>, <em>Forbes</em>, and <em>CNBC</em> websites appear to be marked as ‘unsafe’ by brand safety ad tech vendors. The post documented that those brand safety values appear to be utilized in ad auctions and ad server requests, meaning they could potentially be affecting news publishers’ ad revenues.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this year, journalists at a hedge-fund owned California newspaper <a href="https://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/news/2020/10/19/mcclatchy-tie-pay-to-clicks.html">declared</a> they were fighting an effort to tie performance reviews based on the “the popularity of their stories as measured by clicks.” Most major news publishers retain a long-standing separation between the revenue and editorial departments of their organizations. However, the mere possibility that ad revenue could in some rare instances bias managerial decisions warrants a further investigation into the factors that may influence the monetary value of a journalist’s content.

This analysis focuses on how content from individual journalists and contributors at The <em>New York Times</em> (NYT), <em>Wall Street Journal</em> (WSJ), <em>CNBC</em>, and <em>Forbes</em> are categorized as safe or unsafe by ad tech vendors. Notably, a number of war correspondents and Pulitzer Prize winners have more than two thirds of their news articles marked as ‘unsafe’ for certain digital ads to display on. Nicholas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Kristof">Kristof</a>, a double Pulitzer Prize winner who frequently advocates for human rights, has over 300 of his NYT articles (60.5%) labeled as brand unsafe. </p><p>A <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/tens-of-thousands-of-news-articles-are-labeled-as-unsafe-for-advertisers">previous</a> exploratory analysis of 22,722 recent New York Times articles revealed that 30.3% appeared to be labeled as unsafe by Οracle Grapeshοt. In this analysis, a more comprehensive dataset of 332,710 nytimes.com articles from 2015 to 2020 was assembled. For each of these articles that used Javascript code from Grapeshοt, a given page was considered to be ‘safe’ if it contained the term ‘gv_safe’ (based on information released in Grapeshοt’s documentation), and ‘unsafe’ if it included any labels such as ‘gv_crime’, ‘gv_adult’ or other unsafe categories. A large number (but not all) articles contained clearly labeled ‘author’ meta tags and ‘section’ meta tags that could be used to group articles.</p><p>The table below indicates which New York Times journalists and contributors had the largest proportion of their content labeled as ‘unsafe’. </p><p>Ali <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/ali-winston">Winston</a>, an investigative reporter who  “covers the New York City Police Department” and covered issues of criminal justice and surveillance across the United States, had more than 96% of his articles labeled as unsafe. Numerous foreign correspondents who cover warzones, such as Thomas <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/thomas-gibbons-neff">Gibbons-Neff</a> and Rukmini <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/by/rukmini-callimachi">Callimachi</a> (four time Pulitzer Prize finalist), had more than 90% of their articles labeled as ‘unsafe’. Double Pulitzer Prize winner and human rights activist Nicholas <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicholas_Kristof">Kristof</a> had 305 out of his 504 (60.5%) articles labeled as ‘unsafe’.</p><p><i>Table of observed Οracle Grapeshοt brand safety values from <a href="https://nytimes.com/">nytimes.com</a>, grouped by journalist or author.</i></p><p>Additionally, it’s clear that certain sections of the New York Times are disproportionately likely to be labeled as ‘unsafe’. For example, 79.3% articles in the "<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/obituaries">Obituaries</a>" section and 53.2% articles in the “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/section/world">World</a>” section are labeled as unsafe. This is likely due to the fact that journalists often have to use keywords related to "death" when covering such topics, which may automatically trigger a negative classification.</p><p><i>Table of observed Οracle Grapeshοt brand safety values from <a href="https://nytimes.com/">nytimes.com</a>, grouped by section.</i></p><p>As discussed in the previous <a href="https://adalytics.io/blog/tens-of-thousands-of-news-articles-are-labeled-as-unsafe-for-advertisers">analysis</a>, the Wall Street Journal (as well as other News Corp owned web properties) appear to be using brand safety technology provided by Οracle’s Mοat division and Cοmscοre. The two vendors provide labels which appear to be incorporated into network requests to ad auctions and header bidding services.</p><p>Based on an analysis of 30,033 wsj.com pages, it appears that a number of journalists have more than 90% of their work labeled as ‘unsafe’ by either Mοat or Cοmscοre. Zusha <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/zusha-elinson">Elison</a>, who covers various gun and police related topics, had 92% of his articles labeled as “moat_unsafe” often due to “gv_arms” or “gv_death_injury”. Ben <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/ben-chapman">Chapman</a>, who “covers criminal justice for The Wall Street Journal in New York”, had at least 104 of his articles marked as "moat_unsafe".</p><p>Katherine <a href="https://www.wsj.com/news/author/katherine-clarke">Clarke</a>, who covers residential real estate, appears to have 74 out of 132 articles (56%) labeled as “brandsafe: unsafe” by Comscore.</p><p><i>Table illustrating how many articles by each WSJ journalist were labeled as "unsafe" by either Mοat or Cοmscοre</i></p><p>There are a number of notable journalists, columnists, and writers who focus primarily on covering various advertising or digital marketing related topics. It appears that these writers are not exempt from having their content classified as “unsafe” by various vendors.</p><p>Megan <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/megan-graham/">Graham</a>, a reporter who covers advertising and marketing for CNBC and previously worked at Ad Age, had 23 out of her cnbc.com 219 articles (11%) marked as “moat_unsafe”. 15 were unsafe due to “gv_death_injury”, 7 were marked as unsafe due to “gv_arms”, and 3 were marked as unsafe due to “gv_tobacco”. The cnbc.com website also appears to use semantic <a href="https://adtechdaily.com/2018/06/21/admantx-launches-its-new-hyper-granular-contextual-taxonomy-for-more-precise-contextual-targeting-in-the-gdpr-era/">contextual intelligence</a> technology from Admantx, a company that was <a href="https://integralads.com/news/integral-ad-science-acquires-admantx/">acquired</a> by Integral Ad Sciences (IAS) in 2019. The Admantx technology does not appear to have binary classifications for “safe” or “unsafe”, but rather, seems to allow individual advertisers to avoid showing their ads on webpages that contain individual keywords. This hypothesis is supported by the presence of what appear to be individual brands’ keyword lists in various Javascript network calls. </p><p><img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/81MYYg9VNJb3Dn0IgzFKip0n_Klq2cgY1uOaLrpTRilIF-jJehcKjDJ5Rj3qVl_mKdU1BZVlXY6yFJ_hR4EhjHWloojQSNqi8_eObPXERggchiZgg0hLhnUV4yvFtLEalnJoI4zx" alt="Screenshot of Chrome Developer Tools showing IAS Admantx response values for an article on cnbc.com by Megan Graham"></p><p>The presence of a string ending in “_Neg” or “_Negative” may indicate that a given brand is blocking their digital ads from rendering on a given webpage due to the presence of certain keywords in that context (i.e. “Fidelity_Negative” may indicate that Fidelity wants to avoid having their ads show on that specific webpage). In Megan Graham’s case, 132 of her 219 cnbc.com articles contain the label "Barclays_Negative2" in the admantx.com network response. For example, 202 out 219 of her cnbc.com articles contain the Admantx label 'ErnstYoung_Neg', which may indicate that the British professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young want to avoid placing their ads on 92% of Graham’s articles because they consider them to be brand “unsafe”. Some of the keyword lists include interesting names, such as “IBM_JeffreyEpstein”, which appeared on 154 of Graham’s articles, or “FlexShares_Coronavirus” which appeared on 130 of her webpages.</p><p><i>Table illustrating which IAS Admantx category and keyword labels appear most frequently across CNBC reporter Megan Graham’s 219 articles. Some of these labels may correspond to brand specific keyword blocklists, which prevent a given brand’s digital ads from rendering on a given webpage. For example, the presence of “ErnstYoung_Neg” may indicate that the professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young is blocking their ads from showing on 202 of Megan Graham’s CNBC articles due to presence of certain keywords on those pages.</i></p><p>Sheila <a href="https://www.reuters.com/journalists/sheila-dang">Dang</a>, an advertising-focused Reuters reporter, had 7 out of 193 of her articles labeled as "moat_unsafe". Her February <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-football-nfl-superbowl-advertising-idUSKBN1ZX2JO">article</a> about how "<em>Doritos take top spot in Super Bowl Ads</em>" was categorized as "gv_arms" - this likely corresponds to a Oracle Data Cloud "avoidance category" <a href="https://www.oracle.com/a/ocom/docs/corporate/acquisitions/grapeshot-methodology.pdf">which</a> "avoids webpage textual content
around guns and weapons". Another <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cbs-results/cbs-beats-wall-street-estimates-for-quarterly-revenue-idUSKBN1KN2SQ">article</a> from August, 2018 about how "<em>CBS beats Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue</em>", was labeled as "moat_unsafe" due "gv_crime".

<h2 id="orgccf40df">Description</h2>
<div id="text-orgccf40df">
<p>
SchemeMosaic is a digital music mashup tool inspired by Steven Hazel's
<a href="http://awesame.org/soundmosaic/">soundmosaic</a>. The main technique employed is concatenative
synthesis. You can find out more about that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenative_synthesis">on wikipedia.</a>
</p>

<p>
SchemeMosaic is written in S7 Scheme as an extension to the <a href="https://ccrma.stanford.edu/software/snd/">Snd
editor</a>, and is released under the GPL Version 3. Right now
SchemeMosaic is under construction, and only tested with Snd 20.9 and
greater. (Snd itself is distributed under an MIT-like license.)
</p>

<p>
The goal is to reimplement soundmosaic with improved sound quality,
new features, and musical intelligence so that it can slice and
dice beats and remap tones (and, possibly someday, morph songs into
each other with the use of Autotalent and other algorithms.)
</p>

<p>
SchemeMosaic is designed to assist with making various kinds of
electronic music, such as so-called chopped and screwed or
vaporwave music. When you run SchemeMosaic, the input file is
sliced into (usually) beat-sized regions; these beat-slices are
then subject to chopping (rearrangement, repetition, skipping) and
screwing (pitch-shifting, time-stretching, and other effects.) With
various helper functions, SchemeMosaic will automatically chop and
screw according to your specifications. This can include arbitrary
Scheme code with the full power of Snd at your disposal.
</p>

<p>
Here is an Emacs image-dired view of a database:
</p>


<p><img src="http://xelf.me/snippets.png" alt="snippets.png">
</p>

<p>
The current version has GUI support via Emacs, for fully interactive
chop-and-screw sessions. The goal is a kind of exploratory
concatenative synthesis. Output can be saved to WAV or FLAC for use
with other applications such as Audacity, Mixxx, LMMS, Ardour, and so
on.
</p>

<p>
SchemeMosaic can use Soundtouch to guess the tempo (beats per minute)
of a song. The soundstretch command line program must be installed. If
you can't get that working, or if the result is inaccurate, try out
the BPM detection in <a href="http://mixxx.org/">Mixxx</a> and enter the number it reports into
SchemeMosaic.

<h2 id="orgb9f020e">Highlights</h2>
<div id="text-orgb9f020e">
<p>
2021-02-05: SchemeMosaic can now use a neural network to guess whether
a given sound slice contains a kick, snare, or cymbal. See this video:
<a href="http://xelf.me/scheme-mosaic-beat-slicer-wizard-demo-2.mkv">MKV file</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aa_ntQGECg4">YouTube</a>. I plan to include more types of percussion and
other tasks for the neural network soon, and this is a very exciting
new portion of the work.

that can use XMP to split an XM song into separate tracks and import
them at the proper BPM, soon to be wrapped in a nice "Module wizard"
that should help SchemeMosaic interoperate with the world of
Module tracking.
</p>

<p>
2020-12-27: I'm working on a Beatbox wizard, where you beatbox into
the mic with your mouth and SchemeMosaic attempts to come up with a
sampled beat to match. It's a very crude proof of concept, but have a
listen to <a href="http://xelf.me/beatbox-demo-2.mp3">this two-part mp3</a> that begins with me beatboxing and then
switches to a resynthesized version matched from a database of sliced
drum loops. Here is also <a href="http://xelf.me/beatbox-demo-4.mp3">another demo.</a> And <a href="http://xelf.me/beatbox-demo-5.mp3">another</a>.
</p>

<p>
This document covers SchemeMosaic internals. Check out
<a href="http://xelf.me/emacs-mosaic.html">http://xelf.me/emacs-mosaic.html</a> for information on using SchemeMosaic
through Emacs.
</p>

<p>
The sound slices that SchemeMosaic processes are called
regions. SchemeMosaic keeps a special hash table where a set of
properties for each region are recorded. Each property list is the
descriptor of its region. As stored in the hash table
*REGION-&gt;PROPERTIES*, these data together with the corresponding
regions constitute the database being used for concatenative
synthesis. The descriptors are the keys used to search for sounds in
the database. You can match against the entire database, or any subset
at a time.
</p>

<p>
The objects that generate sound mosaics are called synths. The main
way of getting things done is to call GENERATE-REGIONS on synths of
various synth classes, and mix, match, and chain them. SPLICE-SYNTHS
or other functions can be used to combine synths. 
</p>

<p>
The object system used by SchemeMosaic is the one included with Snd,
defined in stuff.scm and s7test.scm, plus a few tweaks of my
own. To avoid conflicts with other programs, I append a caret to the
names of the main OO symbols so that you use DEFINE-CLASS^,
DEFINE-METHOD^, and MAKE-INSTANCE^. The system it implements is a
simplified CLOS.
</p>

<p>
To find your project files easily, you may wish to set
(MOSAIC-PROJECT-DIRECTORY) to something like
/home/username/myproject/ and then make calls to (PROJECT-FILE
FILENAME).

<p>
Further below is a dictionary for all the important elements of
SchemeMosaic. To get an overview of how things work, check out the
following entries:

<h3 id="orga1b6b6e">Differences between SchemeMosaic and the original soundmosaic</h3>
<div id="text-orga1b6b6e">
<ul>
<li>SchemeMosaic, by default, applies click reduction when merging
fragments.</li>
<li>SchemeMosaic does not scale source regions to match the amplitude
of the target region. This may be added as an option so that
results can follow the amplitude contour of the target if desired,
but doing it by default can cause problems with a cappella
vocals. If a quiet area is matched to a louder one, soundmosaic
will scale it up. When this is applied to the near-silences between
words in an a cappella vocal track, the result is bursts of loud
noise in between better matches.</li>
<li>SchemeMosaic can pitch-shift suboptimal pitch matches, and has
many other new features.</li>

<li>Time-stretching needs improvement. It isn't terrible, but sounds
too reverberated for my taste. Some "new improved"

each category while choosing reasonable defaults.</li>

      <p>Coming up with ideas for your startup’s blog can be mentally taxing. While an <a href="https://ahrefs.com/blog/seo-audit/">SEO audit</a> can help you find opportunities in Google results, it can leave your blog topics feeling a little bit flat.</p>

<p>One strategy is to publish a mix of SEO-driven content with more creative, shareable posts that help you build organic backlinks and social proof. If you want to make sure you <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/ideas">always have some ideas in the hopper</a>, you need to put a healthy backlog of creative blog post ideas into <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/publishing-calendar">your publishing calendar</a></p>


      


      
<p>Over the past decade, I’ve written a lot of blog posts and I’ve seen many of these ideas work for myself or clients. While not every idea in this list is going to be a good fit for your startup, these might help spark your creativity.</p>

<h2 id="50-startup-blog-post-ideas">50+ Startup Blog Post Ideas</h2>

<h3 id="1-product-awareness">1. Product Awareness</h3>
<p>These ideas are great if your startup is still in the launch and product-market fit phase. Once you start building a collection of posts explaining your product, you can send these to prospective customers to help make your case.</p>

<p>Later on, as your product gains traction, these posts will offer Google searchers authoritative information that guides them into your funnel. If you’re going to start blogging, covering these topics should be at the top of your list.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highlight a little-known feature of your product.</li>
  <li>Highlight various use cases for your product.</li>
  <li>Write a “how to” guide for using/buying/setuping up your product.</li>
  <li>Create a customer case study.</li>
  <li>“10 ways to solve problem X” (One of which includes your product).</li>
  <li>Mythbusting a problem your product solves.</li>
  <li>Compare your product to your competition.</li>
  <li>Do a screencast or record a video using your product.</li>
  <li>Share an excerpt from an ebook, white paper, webinar, etc. with a call to action to download it.</li>
  <li>Respond to frequently asked questions about your product.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="2-interviews-and-surveys">2. Interviews and Surveys</h3>
<p>Another interesting way to generate content without quite as much writing work is to compile data from customers, partners, and prospects. I have published many interview posts and compiled the advice from an interview series into a comprehensive guide.</p>

<p>This strategy can net you dozens of blog posts with just a few hours of work, and your interviewees might even share it with their audience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interview customers who are using your product.</li>
  <li>Interview industry specialists.</li>
  <li>Interview someone who used to work for a competitor.</li>
  <li>Interview a professor, recent graduate, or someone who just retired from your industry.</li>
  <li>Interview speakers or sponsors at a conference.</li>
  <li>Ask a question or conduct a poll on <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter</a> and share the results.</li>
  <li>Do a survey with Survey Monkey (or <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/tools/surveys">one of these other tools</a>) among your community members.</li>
  <li>Get experts to offer a tip and do a round-up of their recommendations.</li>
  <li>Feature guest posts from industry experts.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-roundups">3. Roundups</h3>
<p>Lists of tools, tips, and ideas (like this one) are among the most widely-shared and easily read content on the internet. Readers can skim the piece quickly and use the roundup as a jumping-off point for solving their problems, and <a href="https://www.grizzle.io/listicles/">they tend to rank well in Google</a>.</p>

<p>Here are a few ideas for generating lists that might do well on your blog:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Compile a list of popular sites in your industry (be sure to notify them and encourage them to share).</li>
  <li>Compile the most popular social media posts in your industry this month/year/week.</li>
  <li>Create a list of benefits for doing something.</li>
  <li>Create a list of things to avoid.</li>
  <li>Find tips in other content, create a list of those tips, and give links to those articles as the sources.</li>
  <li>Share a list of conference takeaways.</li>
  <li>Collect the top motivational YouTube videos, ebooks, webinars, or infographics for your audience.</li>
  <li>Collect Tweets from a webinar or conference hashtag, and offer your own takeaways in the blog post.</li>
  <li>Create a list of trends to watch.</li>
  <li>Make a list of products that complement yours well.</li>
  <li>Collect a list of social media accounts people in your industry should follow.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="4-thought-leadership">4. Thought Leadership</h3>
<p>Positioning your startup’s founders as important leaders in the space is a good way to build your brand and showcase your expertise. Some founders do this naturally, and others work with a ghostwriter. Either way, people in your leadership team should make a point to do some thought leadership content as you get your blog started.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Take a stand on a controversial issue.</li>
  <li>Make a prediction related to your industry.</li>
  <li>Industry trends commentary.</li>
  <li>Side-by-side comparison of complementary company/service.</li>
  <li>Review a book your customers should read.</li>
  <li>Point out common mistakes in your industry and offer solutions on how to fix or avoid them.</li>
  <li>Relate your content to a current event or a celebrity (eg: “5 Lessons from Lady Gaga” or “What the Election Teaches Us About…”).</li>
  <li>Take the contrarian position on someone else’s article that you disagree with.</li>
  <li>Share your slides from a recent presentation.</li>
  <li>Respond to industry research with your own perspective. Offer a fresh angle to spark conversation.</li>
  <li>Do an in-depth case study about one company, or offer a few examples of how other companies do something successfully.</li>
  <li>Offer industry takeaways about breaking news.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="5-team-company-and-culture-focus">5. Team, Company, and Culture Focus</h3>
<p>Finally, if you’re looking to build more content that attracts talent or showcases your team, here are a few ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Highlight your culture, mission, or values.</li>
  <li>Write about “What we’re not”.</li>
  <li>Create a music video for your company.</li>
  <li>Interview each member of your team about their career and experience.</li>
  <li>Post photos from a recent event/conference.</li>
  <li>Post screenshots from a virtual event.</li>
  <li>Videos/photos of employees behind the scenes.</li>
  <li>If someone gets promoted, talk about how/why they were successful.</li>
  <li>Post about the current season or holiday.</li>
  <li>Sum up the year that was.</li>
</ul>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-419c6a0771684686d35c"><div><p>Everyone has a natural habitat. For some people it’s a big house in the suburbs. For others it’s a cabin in the woods. Some people thrive in a high rise tower in the central business district. Mine is a Main Street town of the kind that peaked about a century ago. But there’s another more obscure environment that’s harder to define because it’s more about cultural imperatives rather than physical structures or location.</p><p>A reader reached out to me with a query. He and his wife and three daughters are in search of “a slower, more nature and community bound life, but without leaving behind people who read books, et cetera. I'm forever looking for where Henry Miller's Big Sur is today, or Provincetown, or even the Upper West Side of 1960, or the San Francisco of the early 90s. We have some money, but we don't want to be around people who are money driven.”</p><p>First, note that the desired location isn’t specifically urban or rural. There’s a huge spread between Manhattan and the rugged California coast at Big Sur. Provincetown and San Francisco are in-between versions of Main Street towns at different scales. And I don’t detect an inherent exclusion of a quality suburb in the statement either. The quest is about the intangibles that a place might provide.</p><p>I have to acknowledge the tension inherent in the quote. There’s a yearning for high culture, meaningful engagement with neighbors, and an attractive landscape. These things tend to cost extra and can be scarce. But there’s also a rejection of crass materialism.</p><p>Wouldn’t it be great to live in exactly the right place at the right time when everything was still super authentic and affordable, but simultaneously unique and undiscovered? The whole thing is problematic and, let’s be honest, a bit tone deaf in terms of class and such. I understand the impulse. I will admit to sharing this same desire myself. So how to square these romantic notions with external reality without being a complete ass about it? I’ll start by poking holes in the nostalgia.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_35196"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_33388"><div><p>I got a flashback to my best friend Joann circa 1985. She was accepted to a prestigious art school in Manhattan and I helped her get settled into her first rented room. It was in pre-gentrification Times Square in what had once been a dentist office complete with linoleum floors, synthetic wood paneling, orange fiberglass chairs, and fluorescent lights. It felt like a public bus. There was no air conditioning in the sweltering heat of a New York summer. The makeshift kitchenette was equipped with an electric hot plate and an elderly microwave. Technically it wasn't a legal residence, but neither the authorities nor the landlord seemed to care. Code enforcement came years later - with Disney.</p><p>She rented her room from a married couple who painted and made documentary films about their artist friends in the city. Joann paid reduced rent in exchange for babysitting the couple's three year old son. Her bedroom was exactly the size of her mattress since the partition walls had been installed for maximum efficiency. The bedroom door opened outward toward the corridor and she would just fall in on the bed and hang her possessions on hooks like a boat. This was the version of urban loft living that never made it to the pages of Architectural Digest.</p><p>They all lived there because it was relatively cheap and the location allowed them to be close to the people and activities they cared about. They had an extraordinarily high tolerance for alcoholic schizophrenic neighbors. The accommodations were meant to be functional. They didn't strive to transform the place into anything beyond what it was. The apartment was filled with their art and film making equipment and the many visitors they collaborated with. The city was their living room, kitchen, and back garden.</p><p>While Joann was living there the couple bought a modest second home in rural Pennsylvania for about the cost of a nice car. Their goal was simple - provide a place to balance city life and enjoy the countryside with their kid without spending a lot of money. The house was absolutely nothing special and they made no effort to renovate the property beyond basic mechanical repairs. It wasn't in a bougie town with nice restaurants or themed boutiques. They hadn’t searched for a subdivision in a good school district. It was just a random spot in a farm field near nothing in particular.</p><p>What mattered most to them was the freedom that came with low overhead. Their city friends would migrate out with them for summer and winter holidays and they created their own cuisine, art, and conversation. And they read lots of books. They just weren't interested in much beyond the inner world they were busy creating themselves. They didn’t need to purchase culture from a fashionable postal code. They made their own. I learned a lot from that family and their example.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_14048"><div>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_14342"><div><p>Some years later I had a friend who worked at the <a href="https://www.stonybrook.edu/pkhouse/" target="_blank">Pollock-Krasner House and Study Center</a> on the far tip of Long Island which is now administered by Stony Brook University. In 1945 modern artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackson_Pollock" target="_blank">Jackson Pollock</a> and his wife, fellow artist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Krasner" target="_blank">Lee Krasner</a>, bought the little house on an acre and a half with water views for $5,000. That’s the current inflation adjusted equivalent of $73,000 today. Their patron <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peggy_Guggenheim" target="_blank">Peggy Guggenheim</a> provided the $2,000 down payment. Back then the average family earned $2,595 a year so a home could be bought with two years pay.</p><p>This was at a time when the Hamptons were still sleepy country villages and the national economy was only just emerging from wartime rationing. Their neighbors were farmers and fishermen, not financiers or movie stars. They had access to what was sold at the local general store, but not much else. And they were three hours from the city. Pollock struggled with his internal demons until his death in a drunken car wreck along with his mistress in 1956. The life of an artist isn’t always picturesque up close.</p></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1606454661608_45411"><div>

<p>In the United States, there is something of an intense debate over how the word&nbsp;<em>gyro</em>&nbsp;is supposed to be pronounced. Many people pronounce it /ˈdʒaɪɹoʊ/ (or, to use fauxnetics, “JAI-roh’). Many other people, however, insist that it is supposed to be pronounced /ˈjiː.ɹoʊ/ (that is, “YEE-roh” in fauxnetics). This debate even made it into the recent Disney Pixar animated film&nbsp;<em>Soul</em>, which includes a flashback scene in which a mischievous unborn soul named “Twenty-Two” is portrayed as arguing with the spirit of the ancient Greek mathematician Archimedes (lived c. 287 – c. 212 BCE) over the correct pronunciation of the word.</p>



<p>If I were an ordinary pedant, I would simply tell you that the pronunciation /ˈjiː.ɹoʊ/ is correct and that the people who say /ˈdʒaɪɹoʊ/ are wrong. I, however, am no ordinary pedant. On the contrary, I am the most obnoxious and loathsome kind of pedant: a pedant who has spent years studying the Greek language at the university level and who knows far too much about it for my own good.</p>



<p>Therefore, I feel the need to point out that<em>&nbsp;neither&nbsp;</em>of the pronunciations given above is reflective of the actual pronunciation of the word in Modern Greek, since the nominative singular form of the word in Greek is actually γύρος (<em>gýros</em>), with an /s/ sound on the end, and the nominative plural form is actually γύροι (<em>gýroi</em>). Moreover, I feel the need to explain exactly&nbsp;<em>why</em>&nbsp;the way the word is spelled in English is so different from how it is pronounced in Greek and to explain precisely how the debate over the pronunciation of the word arose.</p>



<p><strong>A little background</strong></p>



<p>In order to understand the roots of the present controversy over how the word&nbsp;<em>gyro</em>&nbsp;should be pronounced, we need to understand why Greek words are often transliterated in ways that don’t reflect how they are actually pronounced.</p>



<p>In order to understand this, we need to go all the way back to Classical Attic Greek, the dialect of the Greek language that was spoken in the region of Attike, which includes the city of Athens, in the fifth and fourth centuries BCE, since, as strange as it may sound, the modern system of transliterating Greek words into English is based primarily on equivalences between Greek letters as they were pronounced in the Classical Attic dialect and Roman letters as they were pronounced in Classical Latin over two thousand years ago.</p>



<p>In Classical Attic Greek, γυρός was not the name of a particular kind of sandwich, but rather simply an adjective meaning “round.” Here’s the breakdown of how the word would have been pronounced in Athens in the fifth century BCE:</p>



<ul><li>In Classical Attic Greek, the letter ⟨γ⟩ was usually pronounced as the voiced velar plosive /g/ like the letter ⟨g⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>got</em>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨υ⟩ was usually pronounced as the close front rounded vowel sound /y/ like the letter ⟨ü⟩ in the German word&nbsp;<em>über</em>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨ρ⟩ was pronounced as the voiced alveolar trill /r/ like the letter ⟨r⟩ in Modern Spanish or Italian.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨o⟩ was pronounced as a short close-mid back rounded vowel /o/ similar to the sound made by the letter ⟨o⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>tote</em>.</li></ul>



<ul><li>The letter ⟨σ⟩, which is conventionally written ⟨ς⟩ when it occurs at the end of a word, was pronounced as the voiceless alveolar sibilant /s/ like the letter ⟨s⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>this</em>.</li></ul>



<p>Thus, in Classical Attic Greek, the word γυρός was pronounced /ɡyː.rós/.</p>



<p>During the Hellenistic Period (lasted c. 323 – c. 30 BCE), a new dialect of the Greek language known as “Koine” developed. Koine Greek was based primarily on Classical Attic Greek, but it was also influenced to some extent by other ancient Greek dialects. It became widely spoken throughout the entire eastern Mediterranean.</p>



<p>In Koine, the adjective γυρός was nominalized to become the second-declension masculine noun γῦρος, which means “circle,” “ring,” or “rotation.” Through this nominalization, the accent shifted from an acute accent on the ultima (i.e., the last syllable) to a circumflex accent on the penult (i.e., the second to last syllable), resulting in the noun form being pronounced /ɡŷː.ros/.</p>



<div><figure><img src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-851fdc9c4f7c7e20256617b08febf0ff" alt=""></figure></div>



<p><em>ABOVE: Diagram </em><a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Circle-withsegments.svg"><em>from Wikimedia Commons</em></a><em> of a circle. The word γῦρος or γύρος in Greek literally means “circle” or “rotation.”</em></p>



<p><strong>Sound shifts in Koine and Medieval Greek</strong></p>



<p>At some point between the second century BCE and the third century CE, the consonant sounds represented by the letter ⟨γ⟩ shifted. From roughly this period onwards, ⟨γ⟩ became pronounced as a voiced velar fricative /ɣ/ before the vowels ⟨α⟩, ⟨ο⟩, and ⟨ω⟩. Meanwhile, it became pronounced as a voiced palatal fricative /ʝ/ before the front vowels ⟨ε⟩, ⟨η⟩, ⟨ι⟩, and ⟨υ⟩. This is a sound very similar to, but slightly different from, the voiced palatal approximant, which is generally represented in English by the consonantal ⟨y⟩.</p>



<p>Other changes in the pronunciation of the Greek language took place during the Middle Ages. By the Middle Byzantine Period, it seems that uneducated people in the countryside of Greece had begun to pronounce the letter ⟨υ⟩ as the close front unrounded vowel /i/, which is the sound made by the letter ⟨i⟩ in the English word&nbsp;<em>machine</em>. This shift occurred as part of a well-attested process known as “iotacism,” which resulted in the letters ⟨ι⟩, ⟨η⟩, and ⟨υ⟩, which had originally represented three different sounds in Classical Attic Greek, coming to all eventually represent the same sound in Standard Modern Greek.</p>



<p>This shift in the popular rural pronunciation seems to have greatly perturbed the educated elites at the time. In around the eleventh century CE, the Greek writer Michael the Grammarian wrote a satirical poem in which a speaker complains about the way uneducated people in the countryside were pronouncing the letter upsilon. He declares:</p>



<blockquote><p>“Ἐμοὶ πατρίς, βέλτιστε, τραχὺ χωρίον,<br>ὅπου περ ἀνδρῶν καὶ βοῶν ἶσαι φρένες,<br>οἳ το κρύον λέγουσιν ἀφρόνως κρίον,<br>καὶ τὸ ξύλον λέγουσιν ἀγροίκως ξίλον.”</p></blockquote>



<p>This means (in my own translation):</p>



<blockquote><p>“My fatherland, oh dearest one, is a coarse village,<br>where the minds of men and cows are just the same.<br>They foolishly say ‘κρίον’ instead of ‘κρύον’<br>and they boorishly say ‘ξίλον’ instead of ‘ξύλον.’”</p></blockquote>



<p>Over time, the pronunciation that Michael derided as coarse and uncivilized seems to have won out; in Standard Modern Greek, the letters ⟨υ⟩ and ⟨ι⟩ are both pronounced /i/. Thus, in Standard Modern Greek, the word γύρος is pronounced /ˈʝiros/.</p>

<p><em>ABOVE: Scene of everyday agricultural workers from an eleventh-century Greek manuscript of the gospels. It’s very likely that such laborers would have pronounced ⟨υ⟩ as /i/, while the scribe who copied the manuscript probably pronounced it /y/.</em></p>



<p><strong>Origin of the gyros sandwich</strong></p>



<p>Now that I’ve explained the origin of the Greek word γύρος and the history of its pronunciation, I should probably explain where the sandwich of this name originates from and how the name came to be applied to the sandwich.</p>



<p>Today in modern Greece, a cook who is preparing a gyros begins by roasting the meat vertically on a skewer and slicing pieces of meat away when they are done cooking. In Greece and Kypros, gyroi are normally made using pork, but a cook may sometimes choose to use chicken, beef, or lamb meat instead. Once the meat has been removed from the skewer, the cook usually serves it wrapped in pita bread as a sandwich. Often, it is served with tzatziki sauce, onions, and tomatoes.</p>



<p>The modern gyros didn’t arise all at once; many innovations had to be made before the gyros as we know it today could be invented. The first of these innovations was the invention of the idea of cooking meat on spits. This idea is extremely ancient; we know that people in the Aegean Islands were already roasting meat on horizontal spits at least over 3,600 years ago, and they were probably doing it long before that as well. Archaeologists excavating the Bronze Age site of Akrotiri on the Greek island of Thera unearthed stone firedogs dating to the seventeenth century BCE or earlier with notches clearly designed to hold skewers for roasting meats.</p>



<p>The<em>&nbsp;Iliad</em>, an ancient Greek epic poem that was most likely composed in around the early seventh century BCE, describes Chryses, the Trojan priest of the god Apollon, roasting meat on horizontal wooden skewers in book one, lines 458–466. The Athenian comic playwright Aristophanes (lived c. 446 – c. 386 BCE) references similar cooking practices in his plays&nbsp;<em>Acharnians</em>&nbsp;(line 1007),&nbsp;<em>The Clouds</em>&nbsp;(line 178),&nbsp;<em>The Wasps</em>&nbsp;(line 354), and&nbsp;<em>The Birds</em>&nbsp;(lines 388 and 672). Today, meats grilled on horizontal spits are known in Greece as&nbsp;<em>souvlakia</em>; they are distinct from, but similar, to gyroi.</p>

<p>The various other ingredients that are used in gyroi today also had to be introduced to Greece. Some of these ingredients were introduced to the Greek diet relatively early. Notably, pita bread—or at least a very similar kind of flatbread—is known to have existed in ancient Greece. The Greek Egyptian writer Athenaios of Naukratis, who wrote sometime in around the late second or early third century CE, quotes a description of the cooking process for a kind of flatbread known as&nbsp;<em>apanthrakis</em>&nbsp;in his book&nbsp;<em>Wise Men at Dinner</em>&nbsp;3.110b. The description reads as follows, as translated by S. Douglas Olson:</p>



<blockquote><p>“The&nbsp;<em>apanthrakis</em>&nbsp;is more delicate than wafer bread. This type too is probably produced on top of coals, like what Attic authors refer to as an&nbsp;<em>enkryphia</em>. The inhabitants of Alexandria offer it to Kronos and put it out in his temple for anyone who wants some to eat.”</p></blockquote>



<p>Similarly, onions, which are often served on gyroi today, were fairly common in ancient Greek cuisine and they are often mentioned as an ingredient in surviving ancient Greek recipes.</p>

<p>The onset of the worldwide autism epidemic has seemed a bizarre and unknowable phenomenon, existing through a wide range of symptoms and debilitating conditions. The underlying causes, however, are deceptively simple.</p>
<p>Long held birthing practices in hospitals have been abandoned in lieu of more “progressive” policies, and though seemingly innocuous, the results have been <span>disastrous</span>.</p>
<p>The human error involved in the onset of autism is very simple. Doctors have stopped spanking babies’ bottoms at birth, accused of abuse or trauma-inducing practices. Circumcision has also been on a widespread decline. Venupuncture at birth or shortly soon after is unheard as well for the same reasons. <span>All</span>&nbsp;of these have contributed to the massive spike in autism, for <span>ONE</span>&nbsp;very important underlying reason:</p>
<p>Without the PAIN stimulus, the baby is stuck in a biologically immature, semi-wake state leftover from the womb. The PAIN stimulus at birth is what compels the 1) baby’s CRY, which innervates the auditory pathway, the postnatal neuronal maturation process and begins&nbsp;the process of spatially encoding the environment (this tonotopy becomes the basis for the ocular system as well as finger joint/grasping abilities). It is also responsible for 2) the jump start of the reflexive processes to synapse at the brainstem for quick reaction speed, as well as internal endogenous processes such as the gastrocolic reflex (this is why autistic children are chronically constipated, fussy eaters). And, 3) the initiation of the <span>Ascending Reticular Activating System</span>, the body’s <span>wake up</span>&nbsp;call, which the auditory system is tasked with initially triggering after leaving the womb.</p>
<p>These three main underlying “missing factors” define the causal mechanisms of the autism epidemic.</p>
<p><span>1. Postnatal Auditory Development</span><br>
The most important thing to understand is that the auditory pathway is the <span>first</span>&nbsp;step of sensory organization and <span>begins</span>&nbsp;the brain’s understanding of its external environment. Every <span>other</span>&nbsp;sensory encoding system begins with the auditory system. Why? Because sound is the <span>only</span>&nbsp;sense we can actually initially physically “interfere” with and <span>interpret</span> the results. Meaning we can put out a stimulus <span>ourselves</span>, that interacts with and <span>interferes</span>&nbsp;with existent noise and environmental conditions. Our brains then decipher and interpret&nbsp;the results to spatially encode the environment so as to be able to interact with it.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.acousticintegrity.com/acousticintegrity/Hugo_Zuccarelli.html">Hugo Zuccarelli</a>&nbsp;first established this in 1980 with his discovery of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holophonics">holophonics</a>&nbsp;as well as his proposal that the human ear and auditory system work as an <span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interferometry">interferometer</a></span>. The ramifications of his discovery, however, were lost on the medical community.</p>
<p>In animals like bats this auditory feedback system is very large, as they have adapted to acquiring food from their environments strictly by use of sound, e.g. sonar. In primates this system is smaller, because we only use the auditory pathway primarily until we fine-tune our finger motor skills, <i>and</i>&nbsp;our visuospatial system kicks in.&nbsp;Once&nbsp;human vision orients itself <span>based</span>&nbsp;on the auditory encoding of the environment, the biological Law of Precedence takes effect and strict emphasis on the auditory system is abandoned.</p>
<p>This is why babies <span>coo</span>. They are pinging their environments and learning to orient and fine-tune their ability to recognize and interact with physical stimuli, and focus their eyes.&nbsp;Their finger grasping and understanding of the positioning of their own joints, fingers, and body positioning becomes more honed and fine-tuned as they coo and grasp.</p>
<p>Autistic babies have also been observed to fail the “tilting test”, e.g. they fall over without catching themselves like normal babies.&nbsp;This is because the vestibular system is innervated at the same time as the auditory pathway as they both make up the vestibulocochlear nerve. Without this primal innervation, the saccule and utricle never become sensitive to linear acceleration and head-tilting.</p>
<p><span>2.&nbsp;</span><span>Nociception/”PAIN”</span><br>
The mechanoreceptors associated with physical insult to the human body initiate internal reflexive “smooth muscle” processes such as peristalsis, sphincter relaxation, and proper pulmonary function. The <span>lack</span>&nbsp;of this stimulus results in many of the known conditions and symptoms of autism.</p>
<p>Glutamate and Substance P/NK<span>1</span>&nbsp;binding work together to trigger proper intestinal smooth muscle contraction and control. This results in peristalsis, sphincter relaxation, even vomiting.&nbsp;This is why without the required “stimulus” autistic babies are chronically constipated, and extremely fickle eaters.</p>
<p>Acetylcholine and nitric oxide production work together to coordinate proper pulmonary function for clearing airways of pathogens. This is why&nbsp;doctors and medical personnel have begun to take notice of the differences in sound that autistic babies make versus normal babies. ASD babies are known to make cries that are higher pitched and with smaller intervals between, because they are not drawing breath properly. Mothers have also reported being confused by the sounds their babies make, not knowing or being able to interpret what’s wrong so they can properly care for them.</p>
<p>These normal bodily processes are all initially triggered by “noxious stimuli”, e.g. PAIN.</p>
<p><span>3.&nbsp;</span><span>Ascending Reticular Activating System</span><br>
“Residual muscle tension” which keeps us still during sleep, needs to be cut as fast as possible, otherwise it’s like living in a slow waking state and we simply cannot survive on our own. Bottom line, the human body and mind need to be able to react&nbsp;<em>reflexively</em> to the external environment.</p>
<p>Our body’s waking system, the <span>ascending reticular activating system</span>, is stimulated directly by sound and touch. “Neurons of the reticular formation, particularly those of the ascending reticular activating system, play a crucial role in maintaining behavioral&nbsp;<a title="Arousal" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arousal">arousal</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a title="Consciousness" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consciousness">consciousness</a>.”&nbsp;In 1949 Dr. Magoun recorded potentials within the medial portion of the brain stem and discovered that auditory stimuli directly fired portions of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticular_formation">reticular activating system</a>.</p>
<p><span>Robotics</span><br>
This has profound&nbsp;implications for robotics, as without this baseline understanding of sensory integration, scientists have been stuck attempting to create robots that walk/move with zero predictable precision. Without the auditory integration and understanding of their environment, robots are stuck “learning” their environment over and over again every time they take a step as visual processing systems are a <span>secondary</span>&nbsp;source of information-gathering. They cannot be fine-tuned and honed without an auditory platform upon which to be based off of.</p>
<p>Smart cars will now be able to be programmed to be much more “aware” of their surroundings, and be able to navigate much&nbsp;more accurately.</p>
<p><span>Conclusion</span><br>
All of this is easily explained by the simple logic that it makes no biological sense&nbsp;for a baby to start any of these processes until it’s outside the womb. It’s not supposed to be moving around grasping for things, gastrointestinal processes are not needed until the baby is ready to start processing food itself, and of course a baby in the womb cannot safely use its own airways.</p>
<p>To make sense of this it would serve to go back and examine <span>very closely</span>&nbsp;how an entire generation of medical professionals was <i>shamed</i> into giving up practices long-held as routine and necessary since before recorded human history.</p>
<p>But there’s more to the scenario, another disturbingly false pocket of data being propagated worldwide with ruinous results,&nbsp;a false sense of communal sharing of information among young families that preaches the “evils” of vaccinations. We’ve just seen firsthand the dangers of this, epidemics in western states, reports of single individuals unknowing of their condition, passing on antiquated diseases to dozens of people.&nbsp; But there’s a heinous concurrence at work here, because&nbsp;the <span>hidden</span>&nbsp;horror is to realize that all it can take is a <i>single</i> vaccination to <span>CURE the autism condition</span>. Venupuncture provides the same level of stimulus as a spank at birth, and can serve to finally fully integrate a child’s senses correctly. The process isn’t immediate, and it <i>may</i>&nbsp;take a bit of reinforcement, but it’s there.</p>
<p>There’s a special kind of destructive irony to the fact vaccinations are being presented as the <i>cause</i>&nbsp;of autism. Which of course serves to make parents of autistic children even less likely to vaccinate.</p>
<p>This is also&nbsp;why&nbsp;there are reports of medical professionals and school teachers wondering why some children were ever diagnosed in the first place, it’s because&nbsp;that child ended up experiencing some type of injury and subsequently completed the auditory/reflexive circuit on their own. Everyone <span>else</span>&nbsp;is imbuing their child with a <i>powerful</i> learning disability. In fact I would not hesitate to say that the autistic condition is a hellish reality, to be trapped in a perceptual prison, a primitive, <a href="https://drhyman.com/blog/2010/05/12/functionalapproach/">psychedelic drug trip</a> with no escape. They can’t make sense of what they see or hear, they know only confusion, fear, and oblong shapes that fill their visual field with threatening gestures, emitting loud echoing noises that blanket their landscape with unknowable, imperceptible monsters.</p>
<p>Because of the curvature of our eyes, we are born with an inverted view. Light and visual info coming into the eye gets refracted upside down onto the retina, over time the brain learns to correctly orient the image. It’s clear autistic children have major problems with their vision and ocular systems. Some may presumably never learn to invert the image their retinas project, or only partially, many presumably experience a warped view of reality.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder autistic children experience chronic levels of stress, inflammation and anxiety; their lives are living nightmares. <br></p><p> <a href="https://www.manwhore.org/drills-based-training-with-mw/">

<p>The last year has been particularly annoying for nocoiners—those of us who don’t hold crypto and view bitcoin as a Ponzi, like a Ponzi, or <a href="http://www.tr0lly.com/bitcoin/bitcoin-is-not-a-literal-ponzi-scheme/">something more complex</a>.</p>



<p>We have had to endure Tether minting tethers with abandon ($17 billion worth in 2020 alone) and bitcoiners obnoxiously cheering bitcoin’s new all-time highs, the latest being <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hits-30k-for-1st-time-ever">$33,000</a>. Considering bitcoin began 2020 at around $7,500, that is a long way up. (<a href="https://amycastor.com/2020/11/21/are-pixie-fairies-behind-bitcoins-latest-bubble/">Things went full crazy in March</a>.) But we believe 2021 will be a year of comedy gold when this giant hill of dung all comes tumbling down.  </p>



<p>I’ve spoken with several notable bitcoin skeptics, gathered their thoughts, and compiled a list of new year predictions. They shared their prophecies on Tether (a stablecoin issuer that has so far minted $21 billion in dubiously backed assets to pump the crypto markets), new regulations and the future of bitcoin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here is what they had to say:</p>



<h2><strong>Nicholas Weaver: T’will be the year the music stops</strong></h2>



<p>“This is the year the music stops,” Nicholas Weaver, a researcher at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley, told me.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg"><img loading="lazy" data-attachment-id="5212" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/nicholas-weaver-2/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg" data-orig-size="400,400" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="nicholas-weaver-2" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=400" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=400" alt="" width="257" height="257" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=257 257w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=150 150w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg?w=300 300w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/nicholas-weaver-2.jpg 400w" sizes="(max-width: 257px) 100vw, 257px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Weaver has been following bitcoin since 2011. His work is largely funded by the National Science Foundation. He believes the bitcoin ecosystem is running low on cash. (This is the fate of all Ponzi schemes. Ultimately, they run out of new investors and when that happens, the scheme collapses.) In the case of bitcoin, he believes real dollars in the system are rapidly being replaced by fake ones in the form of tethers.</p>



<p>“Tether has been squeezing every dollar out of the system, and there aren’t enough suckers,” he said, meaning there aren’t enough folks waiting in line to buy bitcoin at its ever increasing prices. “When the dollar stock goes to zero, the system will collapse completely because you get a mining death spiral.”</p>



<p>Miners reap 900 newly minted bitcoin per day in the form of block rewards. If they can’t sell those for enough fiat money to pay their monstrous power bills, it makes no sense for them to stay in business. And since their job is to secure the bitcoin network, bitcoin will become vulnerable to repeated attacks.</p>



<p>Also, governments are finally waking up, said Weaver, alluding to new global efforts to clamp down on money laundering, capital outflows, and the financing of terrorism via cryptocurrencies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>He foresees Tether getting the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/nyregion/liberty-reserve-operators-accused-of-money-laundering.html">Liberty Reserve treatment</a> any day now. He also thinks China will decide “screw it, bitcoin is evading capital controls as a primary purpose, let’s cut off the subsidized electricity.” </p>



<p>Without cheap electricity, bitcoin miners—most of whom are in China—may find it difficult to stay afloat.&nbsp;Already bitcoin miners in Inner Mongolia <a href="https://decrypt.co/39718/bitcoin-miners-in-china-lose-access-to-cheap-electricity">no longer receive electricity at subsidized rates</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>Jorge Stolfi: I can’t make price predictions</strong></h2>



<p>A computer science professor in Brazil, Jorge Stolfi wants to avoid making predictions on bitcoin’s price. He’s been following bitcoin since 2013—and has seen it through two prior bubbles—so he knows too well that anything can happen. </p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg"><img data-attachment-id="5227" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/stolfi/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg" data-orig-size="300,168" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="stolfi" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=300" alt="" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg 300w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/stolfi.jpeg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px"></a></figure></div>



<p>“I really don’t know how far the insanity can go. The crypto market is 100% irrational, sustained entirely by ignorance and misinformation,” he said. “How can anyone make predictions about that?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Stolfi is a denizen of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/">r/Buttcoin</a>, a subreddit that makes fun of bitcoin, where he painstakingly explains the finer points of crypto nonsense to the unenlightened. In 2016, he submitted a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-cboebzx-2018-040/srcboebzx2018040-4064523-169183.pdf">letter</a> to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission warning against the risks of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund and comparing bitcoin to a Ponzi scheme. (The SEC has shot down every bitcoin ETF proposal to date on the basis that bitcoin’s price is too easy to manipulate.)</p>



<p>“And since price determines everything else in the crypto space, I can’t make predictions on pretty much everything else,” Stolfi continued. “For example, If the price were to crash below $10,000, I bet that we would have a lot of comedy gold coming from MicroStrategy.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the last several months, the Virginia-based enterprise software company has funneled $1.2 billion of its funds into bitcoin. As a result, Michael Saylor, the company’s CEO, now spends most of his time on Twitter shilling bitcoin.&nbsp;In September, Saylor <a href="https://twitter.com/michael_saylor/status/1307029562321231873">compared</a> bitcoin to “a swarm of cyber hornets serving the goddess of wisdom, feeding on the fire of truth, exponentially growing ever smarter, faster, and stronger behind a wall of encrypted energy.”</p>



<p>Stolfi also thinks that we will probably forget about several coins that were big in the past, like Bitcoin SV (BSV) and IOTA, maybe even bitcoin cash (BCH). “And we will also forget about blockchain technology.”</p>



<h2><strong>Frances Coppola: Crypto exchanges will become like licensed banks&nbsp;</strong></h2>



<p>Over the last week, Frances Coppola has been battling an army of bitcoin trolls and sock puppets on Twitter after suggesting that <a href="https://twitter.com/Frances_Coppola/status/1345395222243586050">bitcoin is not scarce</a> in any meaningful sense.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="5222" data-permalink="https://amycastor.com/frances-coppola/" data-orig-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg" data-orig-size="260,260" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="frances-coppola" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg?w=260" data-large-file="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg?w=260" src="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg?w=260" alt="" srcset="https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg 260w, https://amyhcastor.files.wordpress.com/2021/01/frances-coppola.jpg?w=150 150w" sizes="(max-width: 260px) 100vw, 260px"></a></figure></div>



<p>Scarcity is a key part of the myth bitcoiners perpetuate to make people think bitcoin is valuable in the same way gold is and to create a sense of buying urgency—quick, grab some before it’s all gone!—so naturally, bitcoiners responded by dog piling on her. She isn’t happy about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I hope bitcoin crashes and burns because I am so bloody furious, but I think it will be a while yet before it does—maybe about June,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Coppola is a UK-based freelance writer, who spent 17 years in the banking industry. She wrote the book, “<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Case-Peoples-Quantitative-Easing/dp/1509531300">The Case For People’s Quantitative Easing</a>,” and has 58,000 Twitter followers.</p>



<p>The cause of bitcoin’s upcoming crash, she believes, will be an epic battle between the Wild West of crypto and regulators, a topic she covered in a recent <a href="https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-financial-system-fight-it">Coindesk article.</a></p>



<p>If the regulators win, crypto exchanges will become like licensed banks and have to comply with things like the Dodd-Frank Act, a sweeping law that reined in mortgage practices and derivatives trading after the 2008 financial crash, she said. On the other hand, if the regulators lose, she believes their next move will be to protect retail investors.</p>



<p>“We’d see drastic restrictions on what interactions banks can have with crypto, perhaps a total ban on retail deposit-takers having crypto exchanges and stablecoins as clients,” she said.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We might also see something akin to a Glass-Steagall Act for crypto exchanges and stablecoins, so that retail deposits are fully segregated by law from trading activity.” By that, she means exchanges won’t be able to lend retail deposits to margin traders or use them to fund speculative positions in crypto derivatives.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><strong>David Gerard: Bitcoiners will get their big boy wish</strong></h2>

<p>After years of begging for bitcoin to be taken seriously as a form of money, bitcoiners will be getting exactly what they asked for, said David Gerard, a bitcoin skeptic and author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Libra-Shrugged-Facebook-Tried-Money-ebook/dp/B08KK9SZP6">“Libra Shrugged,”</a> a book on Facebook’s attempt to take over the money.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This year will see more regulation of crypto, as coiners discover to their dismay just how incredibly regulated real-world finance is, he said. “Just wait until someone sits them down and explains regulatory real-time compliance feeds.”</p>



<p>What does Gerard think about Tether? “I could predict the guillotine will finally fall on Tether, but I predicted that for December 2017, and these guys are just amazing in their ability to dodge the blade just one more day,” he said.</p>



<p>Since 2018, the New York Attorney General has been investigating Tether and its sister company, crypto exchange Bitfinex, for fraud. Over the summer, the New York Supreme Court ruled that the companies need to hand over their financial records to show once and for all just how much money really is underlying the tethers they keep printing. The NYAG <a href="https://iapps.courts.state.ny.us/nyscef/ViewDocument?docIndex=2AsYgvjJAsSdalpfkInbHA==">said</a> Bitfinex/Tether have agreed to do so by Jan. 15.</p>



<p>Gerard also foresees that there will continue to be no use cases for crypto that absolutely anything else does better. “Everything the <a href="http://buttcoinfoundation.org/">Buttcoin Foundation</a> was talking about in 2011 is still dumb and broken,” he said.</p>

<p>Elon Musk says he is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/12/01/elon-musk-highly-confident-spacex-will-land-humans-on-mars-by-2026.html">“highly confident”</a> that his company SpaceX will be sending humans to Mars in six years. Naturally, Musk wants to set up a self-sustaining city on the red planet. And, come to think of it, the city will need its own crypto, something like Dogecoin or <a href="https://www.marscoin.org/">Marscoin</a>. Otherwise, how else will its citizens pay for things?</p>



<p>Pseudonymous crypto blogger Trolly McTrollface has this prophecy for 2021: “Elon Musk creates its own cryptocurrency, and adds it to the<a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24TSLA&amp;src=cashtag_click"> $TSLA</a> balance sheet. It ends the year in the top 10 crypto list by market cap.”</p>

<p>Nouriel Roubini, an economics professor at New York University, doesn’t mince words when it comes to crypto predictions. He simply told me: “The Bitcoin bubble will burst in 2021. Triggers will be reg/law enforcement action.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>There is good reason to take him seriously. Roubini famously warned of the 2008 financial crisis, a prophecy that earned him the moniker “Dr. Doom.”&nbsp;He is also <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2013/09/dr-doom-s-bubble-burst-nouriel-roubini-s-hot-tub-gets-heave-ho">known for his parties</a>, which leads a few of us nocoiners to believe that bitcoiners’ are fundamentally driven by bitterness over the fact that we have better soirées.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><section><div><p>Most people who are interested in smart home automation start very enthusiastically into their new hobby, automating as much as they can within their home.
Many are completely unaware of the cybersecurity risk they introduce to their homes, allowing cybercriminals to access their private space just by some clicks.</p><p>In this article, you get an idea about threads in home automation and four simple &amp; effective best security practices, so you can build-out your home smarter without exposing you to additional risk!</p><h2>Security Threads in Home Automation</h2><p>Home automation has hit the mainstream market in recent years. Previously only a limited group of tech enthusiasts was enjoying the benefits of controlling their homes via their DIY automation systems. Now, we look at a young but fast-growing industry, which offers a wide range of consumer-graded devices like thermostats, televisions, smart locks, and lights. This fast evolution of the ecosystem is shaped by many new inexperienced vendors, vast user adoption and continuously changing technology. Consequently, this boom has drawn a lot of attention from cybercriminals and hackers. It's an ideal habitat for malicious intruders.</p><p>Most of these virtual intruders probably wouldn't empty your home right away, but the increasing amount of connected devices already makes you vulnerable against all kinds of threads. But, once you connect your projects to the web, you are exposed to pretty much any malicious user on the planet, interested in hijacking your devices.</p><p>Consequently, if you're learning about home automation and plan to build some DIY projects around the use case, you’ll want to invest some time to understand secure implications too.</p><p>Hence, we're going to unpack four easy but powerful precautions you can take to defend your DIY smart home ecosystem against cyber-attacks.</p><h2>Simple &amp; Effective Defence Practices</h2><h3>1. Secure your Router</h3><p>It's common sense that locking your front door, or at least keeping it closed is a simple way to prevent intrusion, right? In cybersecurity, not securing your router, is like leaving your front door wide open while you are on holiday.</p><p>It's key to understand, that your router should be untouchable, as it connects all of your IoT devices. Here are some simple tips and tricks to get there.</p><h4>Change the Router's Default Name</h4><p>As a first step, change your router's default name. Usually, it's the model name given by the manufacturer. Knowing which hardware you use, gives cybercriminals a great advantage to gain access to your network as this makes it easy to exploit your model's vulnerabilities. So simply give your router a unique name that can’t be traced to you or your home address.</p><h4>Generate a Complex Password</h4><p>Another simple but powerful precaution is to generate a complex password that consists of uppercase, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. The longer the password, the better. To make your life easier, consider using a password generator so your password is truly random.</p><p>Also, it's recommended to use a strong encryption protocol — like WPA2 instead of WPA or WEP. WPA2 encryption has the advantage to protect your Wi-Fi access points and also secures your network.</p><p>If available go even for the WPA3 protocol, it is the next revolution in router protection and leverages 128-bit encryption.</p><h4>Use Multiple Passwords</h4><p>Using different login credentials for every IoT device is another easy step to stop intruders from freely navigating through your system. With different passwords in place, even if one device is compromised, others remain unaffected.</p><p>To make it easier to create and manage and securely store your passwords consider using a password manager app. The only password you must remember the main keyword to access your app.</p><h3>2. Set Up A Separate Network for IoT Devices</h3><p>In general, it's important to keep control of your network. You always want to remain in total control over access and modification of your router and all linked smart home devices.</p><p>If you got a modern router you can start implementing this idea, by creating a guest network separate from your primary network. This way, your relatives, friends, and guests will all access a separate network that doesn’t tie to your IoT devices. That way, you protect your password from unnecessary exposure.</p><h3>3. Ensure All Devices Are Always Up-To-Date</h3><p>Keeping your devices' firmware always up-to-date helps to limit your risk of attack and ensures you got all available security patches available.
Unfortunately, many routers and IoT devices, do not update their corresponding apps automatically.
Best you create a list of all your devices to verify, which once you can make update automatically and which need your special care. Set yourself a reminder to check for updates for your devices that need manual updates. For the rest, always install updates right away.</p><h3>4. Enable Two-Factor Authentication</h3><p>To verify your identity, you get a one-time password (OTP) or a verification code sent to your smartphone or email address. That way, you make it harder for intruders, as they would need to gain access to those accounts first before they could get into your IoT devices.
Most commercial IoT devices have a built-in two-factor feature, if you build your project there are a couple of companies that offer 2FA as a service. Most of these solutions are easy to integrate and still affordable.</p><p>Hopefully, the best practices outlined above sharpened your awareness of cybersecurity and encourage you to take charge of your digital as you do for your analog security.</p><hr></div></section></main></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="skip-nav"><p><time>03.01.2021</time> — <a href="https://jacopomartolini.com/tags/roam">Roam</a> — <span>2<!-- --> min read</span></p><section><hr><p>I often use the highlight feature while reading on my Kindle, but rarely I get back to them.
For those occasions, where I would like to get back to a particular passage of a book, having them well organised and at reach is not always possible for books that are stored on Kindle.</p><p>There are several ways to access and export Kindle highlights:</p><ul><li><p>Export from the Amazon webpage:&nbsp;<a href="https://read.amazon.com/notebook">https://read.amazon.com/notebook</a>. Amazon let you export the highlights through the notebook page and app, then they can be imported with existing services like:</p><ul><li><a href="https://kindle-formatter.vercel.app/">https://kindle-formatter.vercel.app/</a></li><li><a href="https://github.com/krystofl/kindle-notes-to-md">https://github.com/krystofl/kindle-notes-to-md</a></li></ul><p>Note that, Amazon’s own Kindle account page doesn’t show highlights from books that weren’t purchased from the Kindle store. You can export one book at a time, which is useful for regular updates but, very tedious for first time, big batch, export.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://help.readwise.io/article/71-how-does-the-readwise-to-roam-export-integration-work">Readwise</a> seems the best option for centralising highlights from across various platforms. For Evernote export feature there is a plan of $7.99/month, which, in my case, seems too expensive.</p></li><li><p><a href="https://en.toolinbox.net/Klib/">Klib</a> is a Mac application to manage highlights and notes for Kindle &amp; Apple Books that allow the export for Evernote and markdown. The unlimited version has a price of $14.99.</p></li><li><p>You can plug in your Kindle into your computer and copy the 'My Clippings.txt' file. This document contains all the highlights you made, even from books that aren't loaded from Kindle store. The result is a file similar to this:
<span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="myclippings" title="myclippings" src="https://jacopomartolini.com/static/4568282573e58422049080a309acf5f1/7d769/myclippings.png" srcset="https://jacopomartolini.com/static/4568282573e58422049080a309acf5f1/5243c/myclippings.png 240w,https://jacopomartolini.com/static/4568282573e58422049080a309acf5f1/ab158/myclippings.png 480w,https://jacopomartolini.com/static/4568282573e58422049080a309acf5f1/7d769/myclippings.png 960w,https://jacopomartolini.com/static/4568282573e58422049080a309acf5f1/f0baf/myclippings.png 1390w" sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" loading="lazy">
    </span>
As you can see the format is not very friendly, entries are chronologically entered and difficult to navigate.</p></li></ul><p>In order to import them as single book in Roam, I've created a script to split the My Clipping file and aggregate highlights by book title:</p><p><a href="https://github.com/jacopom/kindleToRoam">https://github.com/jacopom/kindleToRoam</a></p><p>The result is a markdown file for each book with the following formatting:</p><ul><li>book title as filename<ul><li><strong>Author:</strong></li><li><strong>Reading Status:</strong></li><li><strong>Date Finished:</strong></li><li><strong>Why:</strong></li><li><strong>Tags:</strong> #book</li><li><strong>Notes:</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>In order to execute the script:</p><ul><li>clone or download the repo</li><li>plug your kindle and navigate to the 'Documents' folder</li><li>make a copy of 'My Clippings.txt' in the same folder of kindleToRoam.py</li><li>open terminal and navigate to the folder</li><li>execute the command:</li></ul><ul><li>import your freshly formatted book entries in Roam Research</li></ul><p>The imported book are then manually revised to add tags and references, and apply <a href="https://fortelabs.co/blog/progressive-summarization-a-practical-technique-for-designing-discoverable-notes/">progressive summarization </a>.</p><p>This article also has been helpful in the setup of my library on Roam:
<a href="https://superorganizers.every.to/p/how-i-took-notes-on-250-books-in">https://superorganizers.every.to/p/how-i-took-notes-on-250-books-in</a></p><p>In the near future I would like to convert this script in a webpage and add other customisations in the output format. If interested in collaborating, <a href="https://twitter.com/jacopomar">my dm's are open</a>  😉</p></section></div></div>]]>

binding across the EU.</p><p>The right to privacy is not a new concept. It’s already expressed as Article 8
in the <a href="https://www.echr.coe.int/Pages/home.aspx?p=basictexts">European Convention on Human
Rights</a> and Article 12 in
the <a href="https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/">United Nation’s Universal Declaration of Human
Rights</a>. There are
similar legislation across the world too, such as
<a href="https://www.priv.gc.ca/en/privacy-topics/privacy-laws-in-canada/the-personal-information-protection-and-electronic-documents-act-pipeda/pipeda_brief/">PIPEDA</a>
in Canada and <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa">CCPA</a> in California. One thing
to keep in mind here is that it’s far from obvious how legislation interacts
across borders.</p><p>The European Commission provides an official website about <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/data-protection-eu_en">Data protection in
the
EU</a>
with their own overview.</p><h3 id="gdpr-and-the-eu-cookie-law">GDPR and the EU cookie law</h3><p>The GDPR is not the only privacy legislation in the EU. There’s also the
<a href="https://edps.europa.eu/data-protection/our-work/subjects/eprivacy-directive_en">ePrivacy
Directive</a>
(<a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:32009L0136">Directive
2009/136/EC</a>),
which is sometimes called simply the “cookie law”<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>. The GDPR didn’t repeal
this directive and there’s a new <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52017PC0010">proposed
regulation</a>
to replace it, so it seems to be here to stay in some form too.</p><p>This blog post will focus only on the GDPR.</p><h3 id="important-definitions">Important definitions</h3><p>There are a couple of definitions<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup> that are necessary to know before we
continue. Note how some definitions are much wider in the context of the GDPR
than in common language use, which provides a potential trap unless we pay close
attention to the terms.</p><dl><dt>Personal data</dt><dd><em>Information</em> that is <em>related</em> to an identified or <em>identifiable natural
person</em> (the <em>data subject</em>).</dd><dt>Natural person</dt><dd>A <em>natural person</em> is the same as a physical person, i.e. an individual human
being. Compare to <em>legal person</em>, such as a company.<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup></dd><dt>Identifiable natural person</dt><dd>A natural person who <em>can be identified</em>, directly or <em>indirectly</em>, for

used elsewhere, but not within the GDPR itself.</dd></dl><p>To avoid getting bogged down in details, I will simplify the rules here to make
them easier to comprehend. I won’t cover all exceptions or special cases, even
as it relates to personal websites.</p><p>The GDPR applies to:</p><ul><li>Processing of personal data, whether automated or not.<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" role="doc-noteref">11</a></sup></li><li>Given that either:<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" role="doc-noteref">12</a></sup><ul><li>The controller or processor is located in the European Union.</li><li>The data subject is located in the European Union.</li></ul></li></ul><p>If the controller or processor is not located in the EU, the GDPR is only
applicable for data processing related to:</p><ul><li>Offering goods or services, whether paid or free.</li><li>Monitoring of the data subject’s behaviour within the EU.</li></ul><p>So far, it’s clear that more or less all processing of personal data within the
EU (even by controllers or processors outside of the Union) is within scope.</p><h4 id="processing-of-personal-data">Processing of personal data</h4><p>To determine if the GDPR applies, it’s necessary to figure out what activities
it considers to be <em>processing of personal data</em>. As we’ve seen above,
<em>processing</em> means almost any activity related to data (especially if
automated). It’s still important to determine who is responsible for the
processing, i.e. the controller.</p><p>Identifying <em>personal data</em> requires more consideration. The scope is extensive
and almost all websites will process at least some personal data. Note that it’s
enough that a natural person related to the data <em>could</em> be identified even
indirectly by putting together different pieces of data for it to be <em>personal
data</em>.</p><p>Examples of personal data include:<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" role="doc-noteref">13</a></sup></p><ul><li>Full name</li><li>Home address</li><li>E-mail address of an individual</li><li>IP address</li><li>Cookie identifier</li><li>Advertising identifiers on phones</li><li>Location data</li></ul><p>To avoid data being <em>personal data</em>, it needs to be fully anonymised.
Pseudonymisation where additional data could be used to identify the data
subject is still personal data.<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" role="doc-noteref">14</a></sup></p><p>Since almost all web servers keep access logs with IP addresses, to be able to
avoid abuse and deal with outages, even a fully static website typically
processes some personal data. This leads me to believe that the GDPR applies to
some extent to basically all websites.</p><h4 id="exceptions-to-the-scope">Exceptions to the scope</h4><p>There are some exceptions to the GDPR’s scope:<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" role="doc-noteref">15</a></sup></p><ul><li>Activities that fall outside the scope of EU law. In other words, it only
covers what it can cover.</li><li>Processing of personal data performed by a natural person in the course of a
<em>purely personal or household activity</em>.</li></ul><p>The second exception above gives us another important consideration that affects
whether, and to what extent, a personal website is within the scope of the GDPR.
More on this below. There are also some interesting exceptions to individual
rules that will be covered later.</p><h4 id="purely-personal-activity">Purely personal activity</h4><p>To further investigate what is meant by <em>purely personal or household activity</em>,
let’s have a look at <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/recitals/no-18/">recital 18</a> from the
preamble of the GDPR:</p><blockquote><p>This Regulation does not apply to the processing of personal data by a natural
person in the course of a purely personal or household activity and thus with
no connection to a professional or commercial activity. Personal or household
activities could include correspondence and the holding of addresses, or
social networking and online activity undertaken within the context of such
activities. However, this Regulation applies to controllers or processors
which provide the means for processing personal data for such personal or
household activities.</p></blockquote><p>In other words, when you process personal data in your spare time related purely
to your personal life or household or talk to your friends, this is outside the
reach of the GDPR. Same thing when this is done by posting something on
Facebook, Twitter, or YouTube. In this case, these companies are the
<em>controllers</em> and they are responsible under the GDPR, but you are not.</p><p>If you use a blog service for your personal blogging, the same might apply here.
The blogging platform is the controller and the GDPR doesn’t apply to you
personally. All the time, this assumes that any processing of personal data by
you is strictly within the context of purely personal activities and that the
blog service is the controller for any other data processing.</p><p>The situation changes if you decide to provide a blog directly to the public,
where you control the entire blog. A few aspects are different in this scenario.
First, any processing of personal data relating to public blog visitors is no
longer in the context of a <em>purely personal or household activity</em> since it
involves unsuspecting strangers whose right to privacy the GDPR is meant to
protect and who are outside of your personal or household life. Second, there’s
no longer another <em>controller</em> for you to point at. You are now clearly the
controller who makes the overall decisions about the website and as such the
GDPR is fully applicable. Third, if you provide a <em>professional</em> (or
<em>commercial</em>) service in any way, you are definitely outside of this exception
even if you make no money. These are several ways to reach the same conclusion.</p><p>It’s naturally hard to draw the exact line for purely personal activities. Only
the <a href="https://europa.eu/european-union/about-eu/institutions-bodies/court-justice_en">Court of Justice of the European
Union</a>
can decide what the correct interpretation is. There are, luckily, multiple
rulings that give precedents for this.</p><p>Court rulings, …</p></div></div>

            <p><i></i> Jan. 3, 2021, 10:14 p.m.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Update 4th Jan 2021: If you don't need Python 3.9, installing azure-cli natively can be done&nbsp;by using this homebrew formula:&nbsp;<a href="https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/azure-cli">https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/azure-cli</a>. Note: there's an open issue with upgrading:&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/16417">https://github.com/Azure/azure-cli/issues/16417</a>.</em></strong></p>

<p>Anyone else having trouble installing Azure CLI natively on Apple Silicon? You may remember some <a href="https://www.thectgrid.com/blog/apple-silicon-right-tool-remote-work-economy/">rough edges being mentioned in our previous post</a>.&nbsp;If like me you're a big user of Azure's cloud services and you've got your hands on a new M1 MacBook Pro or MacBook Air, then you might have noticed that installing some software isn't as straight forward as it used to be. In this post I'll take you through the steps I took to install Azure CLI natively on your Apple Silicon Mac.</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/cli/azure/install-azure-cli-macos">Official install docs</a></p>

<p><em>Note: this post is likely to become old pretty quickly given the pace at which things are being fixed for M1.</em></p>

<h2>Install HomeBrew</h2>

<p>As of the last few days, homebrew now supports Apple Silicon Mac natively which means no more <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation#alternative-installs">manual steps</a> on the M1, just go to the <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew homepage</a> and install as normal. It should install into <code>/opt/homebrew/</code>, you can test it by running <code>$ brew</code> in the terminal.</p>

<h2>Install wget</h2>

<p>This step is the simplest in this whole process, savour it:</p>

<pre><span>brew install&nbsp;wget</span></pre>

<h2>Install Python 3</h2>

<p>Install Python 3 with this command:</p>

<pre><span>brew install python3</span></pre>

<p>It will download and build targetting Apple Silicon ARM. We now need to check you can access python3 via the Terminal and that the right version is being loaded (MacOS comes with older versions of both Python2 and Python3):</p>

<pre><span>type&nbsp;-a&nbsp;python3
python3 is /usr/bin/python3</span></pre>

<p>If a path going via your homebrew folder isn't at the top of the list, e.g. <code>python3 is /opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9</code> , you can simply create an alias for it in your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file.</p>

<p>Open <code>~/.zshrc</code> with either nano or vim:</p>

<pre><span>nano ~/.zshrc</span></pre>

<p>and add these lines:</p>

<pre><span>alias&nbsp;python3='/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9'
alias&nbsp;pip3='/opt/homebrew/bin/pip3'</span></pre>

<p>Save (<code>Control + O</code>) and exit (<code>Control + X</code>), and run this for the changes to take effect:</p>

<pre><span>source&nbsp;~/.zshrc</span></pre>

<p>Now check that your homebrew version of python3 is at the top of your <code>type -a</code> list:</p>

<pre><span>type&nbsp;-a&nbsp;python3
python3 is an alias&nbsp;for&nbsp;/opt/homebrew/opt/python@3.9/bin/python3.9
python3 is /usr/bin/python3</span></pre>

<p>You can run the same test for <code>pip3</code>. If the homebrew version is at the top of the <code>type -a pip3</code> list then you're good to go!</p>

<h2>Wall of Compilation Errors: pip3 install azure-cli</h2>

<p>Normally it would be enough to run:</p>

<pre><span>pip3 install azure-cli</span></pre>

<p>and this would've been the end of the post had it not been for the wall of compilation errors I received as pip attempted to compile the dependencies for azure-cli. The following packages needed manual intervention:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>cffi</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>cryptography</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>bcrypt</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>PyNaCl</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>After spending some hours troubleshooting these errors I was close to throwing in the towel, calling it a day on native brew/python and moving over to rosetta2. And then a breakthrough...</p>

<h3>Build cffi</h3>

<p>Building and installing the <code>cryptography</code> package requires <code>cffi</code> to be installed, and OpenSSL lib include files to be in your PATH. Both of these need manual attention:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>cffi doesn't build via pip</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>OpenSSL isn't in the path</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<p>To build and install cffi follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
	<li>
	<p>Install libffi</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<pre><span>brew install pkg-config libffi</span></pre>

<ol start="2">
	<li>
	<p>Take note of the path to this libffi.pc file:</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<pre><span>find&nbsp;/opt/homebrew/ |&nbsp;grep&nbsp;"Cellar.*libffi.pc"
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/libffi/3.3/lib/pkgconfig/libffi.pc</span></pre>

<ol start="3">
	<li>
	<p>Grab the sources from <a href="https://pypi.org/project/cffi/">https://pypi.org/project/cffi/</a>:</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<pre><span>wget&nbsp;https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/66/6a/98e023b3d11537a5521902ac6b50db470c826c682be6a8c661549cb7717a/cffi-1.14.4.tar.gz
​
tar&nbsp;-xzvf&nbsp;cffi-1.14.4.tar.gz
cd&nbsp;cffi-1.14.4</span></pre>

<ol start="4">
	<li>
	<p>Edit setup.py and add the path for libffi.pc that you noted down in step 2 to <code>include_dirs</code>:</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<p><span><code>setup.py</code></span></p>

<pre><span>import&nbsp;sys,&nbsp;os
import&nbsp;subprocess
import&nbsp;errno
​
# on Windows we give up and always import setuptools early to fix things for us
if&nbsp;sys.platform&nbsp;==&nbsp;"win32":
&nbsp; &nbsp;import&nbsp;setuptools
​
​
sources&nbsp;= ['c/_cffi_backend.c']
libraries&nbsp;= ['ffi']
include_dirs&nbsp;= ['/usr/include/ffi',
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'/usr/include/libffi',
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'/opt/homebrew//Cellar/libffi/3.3/lib/pkgconfig/']
​
...</span></pre>

<ol start="5">
	<li>
	<p>Build</p>
	</li>
</ol>

<pre><span>python3 setup.py install</span></pre>

<p>cffi is done! Now to the next dependency ...</p>

<h3>Build cryptography</h3>

<p>azure-cli requires an older version (&lt;3.0.0) of cryptography, which in turn needs the OpenSSL library. First grab OpenSSL via brew:</p>

<pre><span>brew install&nbsp;openssl</span></pre>

<p>Grab the lib path:</p>

<pre><span>find&nbsp;/opt/homebrew |&nbsp;grep&nbsp;"Cellar.*openssl.*/lib$"
​
/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1i/lib</span></pre>

<p>Now install version 2.9.2 and reference the OpenSSL lib and include folders from above:</p>

<pre><span>pip3 install&nbsp;cryptography==2.9.2&nbsp;--global-option=build_ext&nbsp;--global-option="-L/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1i/lib"&nbsp;--global-option="-I/opt/homebrew/Cellar/openssl@1.1/1.1.1i/include"</span></pre>

<p>Only two more dependencies to go.</p>

<h3>Build bcrypt and PyNaCl</h3>

<p>Both bcrypt and PyNaCl have the same steps:</p>

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Download sources</p>
	</li>
	<li>
	<p>Manual install</p>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>bcrypt</h4>

<p>Go to <a href="https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/">https://pypi.org/project/bcrypt/</a> and download sources, unpack, and run setup.py:</p>

<pre><span>wget&nbsp;https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/d8/ba/21c475ead997ee21502d30f76fd93ad8d5858d19a3fad7cd153de698c4dd/bcrypt-3.2.0.tar.gz
​
tar&nbsp;-xzvf&nbsp;bcrypt-3.2.0.tar.gz
cd&nbsp;bcrypt-3.2.0
python3 setup.py install</span></pre>

<h4>PyNaCl</h4>

<p>Go to <a href="https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/">https://pypi.org/project/PyNaCl/</a>, get sources and do the same:</p>

<pre><span>wget&nbsp;https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/cf/5a/25aeb636baeceab15c8e57e66b8aa930c011ec1c035f284170cacb05025e/PyNaCl-1.4.0.tar.gz
​
tar&nbsp;-xzvf&nbsp;PyNaCl-1.4.0.tar.gz
cd&nbsp;PyNaCl-1.4.0
python3 setup.py install</span></pre>

<h3>Install azure-cli</h3>

<p>Finally, you should have everything you need to install azure-cli via pip. Go ahead and try it:</p>

<pre><span>pip3 install azure-cli</span></pre>

<p>Good luck and thanks for reading!</p>

        <p><img src="https://jerseyfonseca.com/projects/images/swapiverse/landingpage.png"></p><p>
            Last night, <a href="https://www.dwold.com/">David</a> and I put up our 
            <a href="https://www.swapiverse.com/">Swapiverse's landing page</a>. 
            It's a simple idea: trade books you have for books you want. I had the 
            same stresses most people have. Where do I get my users? How do I do 
            SEO? I can't afford ads! Am I wasting my time? However, we've quickly 
            seen a really high conversion rate with organic marketing! I want to 
            share what I think has helped us find an idea worth showing people.  
        </p>
        <h2>Finding A Problem I Have</h2>
        <p>
            I used to go out and seek problems to solve. I would code something up 
            for these problems I have never personally experienced, but knew others had. 
            It's no coincidence that these were always my least successful projects. Why 
            have I been looking for other people's problems? I have enough of them on my own!
        </p>
        <p>
            Last year, I made <a href="https://jerseyfonseca.com/projects/bujo.html">Vim Bujo</a>, a minimal task manager 
            for vim. I made it for myself - to solve a problem I personally had: how do I 
            manage a todo list without leaving my workflow? It should not have been to 
            my surprise that this was my first open source project with consistent users. 
            I know deep down about the problem they are facing, because I have the same one! 
        </p>
        <p>
            This time, my problem was buying books. Since I just graduated from 
            The University of Chicago, <a href="https://www.unigo.com/colleges/university-of-chicago/reviews/what-is-the-stereotype-of-students-at-your-school-is-this-stereotype-accurate">"the place where fun goes to die,"</a> 
            I have been experiencing more free time than I've had in the last four years. 
            There were no brutal nights up late studying, reading for class, or even partying 
            with students! Sure there are some nights where I need to stay a bit later at work, 
            but nothing in comparison to what college was like. With all this free time, I've 
            found lots of hobbies. I go bouldering a few times a week, and have finally been 
            reading books.  
        </p>
        <h3>Inspiration Strikes</h3>
        <p>
            Now, I'm admittedly a slow reader. I have ADHD and get distracted really easily! 
            However, with all this free time, I've been able to plow through books pretty quickly. 
            When I ran out, my partner and I went to a bookstore where I bought four books, for... $80!!!
        </p>
        <p>
            $80?!? Jeez. These are all recent bestsellers, I'm sure someone also reading a recent 
            bestseller would be willing to trade with me after they're done. Wait... That would 
            be awesome! I save money, I help the environment, and I get to connect with someone 
            over what we read!
        </p>
        <h2>Researching Competition</h2>
        <p>
            I started looking up products that do this, and, as always, it already exists. 
            In fact, a lot of them exist! I've learned not to be discouraged by this, though. 
            That means that my idea has a market. Furthermore, I believe in myself to do it 
            even better. Maybe this is just because I'm arrogant, but we have to believe that 
            we can do it better if we want to create things!
        </p>
        <p>
            I signed up for just about every competitor I can find. I used their sites and apps extensively. 
            I studied how their process works. I took notes on where the user experience was strong, and 
            just as importantly, where it was weak. I researched their audiences, their keywords, their 
            social media presence, etc.. This was probably the most important part of the entire process. I 
            can't create a better product, if I don't know the ins and outs of the competing products. 
        </p>
        <p>
            After a few weeks of this, I was ready to begin working on Swapiverse.
        </p>
        <h2>Making The Pre-Launch Landing Page</h2>
        <p>
            I believe that this is where I struggled the most. I wanted my landing page to 
            be perfect! Of course I did; who doesn't? I read <a href="https://www.indiehackers.com/@pedrocortes/694e691963">articles</a> 
            on building a great landing page and tried to get it all right. Unfortunately, there 
            were so many areas that I felt were slacking. Even worse, there was so much more I wanted to add. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At this point, we were a few days past our deadline to finish our landing page. 
            I knew that getting something out is better than nothing, so we decided to launch it anyway.  
            The most important criteria were fulfilled: users knew what the site does, they knew how to sign up, 
            and they could find all our other social medias. Of course, this page will be iterated on, but 
            I couldn't help but feel as though if I try to perfect it now, I will never finish my MVP.
        </p>
        <h3>Realizing My Resources Aren't Infinite</h3>
        <p>
            I find that I end up comparing my landing site to that of Facebook, Stripe, etc.. But I need to remind 
            myself that Facebook pays countless engineers hundreds of thousands of dollars to make their landing 
            page perfect. One day when Swapiverse is a billion dollar tech giant, I'll be able to make it perfect. 
            But for now, as a dev with a fulltime job, I'll accept my limitations. Heck, I'm not even a frontend developer!
        </p>
        <h3>Realizing Most Sites Aren't Pretty</h3>
        <p>
            The More I think about it, the more I realize that most websites aren't as gorgeous or functional as 
            they could be... I come across bugs and clunky UIs with just about every site or app I use! On top of 
            that, I don't even care when I really like the site/app I'm using. 
        </p>
        <h2>Sharing Our Landing Page</h2>
        <p>
            Our marketing tactics have been inspired by Paul Graham's advice: 
            <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html"> Do Things That Don't Scale</a>.
            If I want my first users, I just gotta grind it out and go out there and get them.
        </p>
        <h3>Reaching Out To People On Social Media</h3>
        <p>
            The golden answer for us has just been to find the right people and DM them. 
            You're going to be rejected a lot, but if you are genuinely excited and solving 
            a problem of theirs, they're going to be interested in your solution! Have a really 
            succinct starter message, and as soon as you get a positive response back, hit them 
            with the link. Our conversion rate when we DM people on social media has been much 
            higher than we anticipated.
        </p>
        <h3>Telling Our Friends</h3>
        <p>
            I am lucky enough to have good friends. We genuinely care about each other. 
            The moment I tell them that I am building something, they are instantly willing 
            to sign up and use it! While we gain a lot of users from social media marketing, 
            nothing is better than the support of those you care about. 
        </p>
        <h2>Now Onto Building The Rest...</h2>
        <p>
            There's a long way to go, but don't underestimate the success of getting your first 
            users. Thanks for reading, and I hope you'll stay in touch :)

  <time datetime="2021-01-03T13:30:00+00:00">03 Jan 2021</time>
  <p>Swift in a sense is very much like C++, and when I say C++ I mean C++11 and beyond. One could also say that Swift is <em>cleaner</em> C++, or C++ without the backwards compatibility baggage from the 80s. To give an idea here’s a minimal <em>modern</em> C++ code:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;iostream&gt;       // 1
</span><span>using</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>std</span><span>;</span>      <span>// 2</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span>      <span>// 3</span>
  <span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span> <span>// 4</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>               <span>// 5</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now lets break them down from Swift perspective.</p>


<p>Swift equivalent would be <code>import iostream</code>. Frameworks usually come with an umbrella header as a single file, so typically we need to add only one include statement per framework like in Swift. But unlike Swift, we need to add include statements for every file we want to use from our own code.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>#include &lt;framework&gt;      // external framework
#include "path/to/file.h" // local file
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>using</span> <span>namespace</span> <span>std</span><span>;</span> <span>// 2</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Unlike Swift, C++ has a proper support for namespaces. So if two types in different frameworks have same type name they can be resolved using their namespaces. For example <code>fwkA::JSON</code> and <code>fwkB::JSON</code>. To get a more Swift like behavior we can add <code>using</code> to indicate that the symbols do not need their namespace for every single usage.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>int</span> <span>{</span> <span>// 3</span>
  <span>// ...</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This is the modern way of writing functions in C++. In classic fashion this function could also be written as:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>int</span> <span>main</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span>cout</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>;</span> <span>// 4</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Like Swift we can also override operators in C++. In this case the <code>iostream</code> library provides <code>cout</code> which is an object of type <code>ostream</code> that outputs to <em>standard output stream</em>. <code>iostream</code> also provides overrides for <code>operator &lt;&lt;</code> for many common types like for <code>string</code> that we’re using above. But it can also work for our custom types if we provide the <code>operator &lt;&lt;</code> for our type. The Swift equivalent to this would be the <code>CustomStringConvertible</code> protocol.</p>



<p>And finally since our function requires a return type <code>int</code> we have to end our function with a <code>return</code> statement.</p>

<p>With a basic introduction, now let us take a look at C++ in a bit more detail from Swift perspective.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#variables">Variables</a></li>
  <li><a href="#string">String</a></li>
  <li><a href="#array">Array</a></li>
  <li><a href="#dictionary">Dictionary</a></li>
  <li><a href="#optional">Optional</a></li>
  <li><a href="#function">Function</a></li>
  <li><a href="#closures">Closures</a></li>
  <li><a href="#classes">Classes</a></li>
  <li><a href="#error-handling">Error handling</a></li>
  <li><a href="#generics">Generics</a></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="variables">Variables</h2>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
var myVariable = 42
myVariable = 50 
let myConstant = 42
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto myVariable = 42;
myVariable = 50;
const auto myConstant = 42;
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>Just like in Swift types can be deduced by the compiler using <code>auto</code>, but if required we can always also provide the type information explicitly.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
let myFloat: Float = 3.14
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
float myFloat = 3.14;
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>Unlike Swift, type conversions can also occur implicitly in C++. This needs to be carefully watched out for to avoid hard to find bugs. For other cases we need to explicitly convert data from a type to another. For example <code>int</code> to <code>string</code></p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
let label = "The width is "
let width = 94
let widthLabel = label + String(width)
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto label = "The width is ";
auto width = 94;
auto widthLabel = label + to_string(width);
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="string">String</h2>

<p>String interpolation in C++ isn’t as good as with Swift. But nonetheless we can construct <code>string</code> with either explicit string conversion, like we saw above</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
let apples = 3
let oranges = 5
let appleSummary = "I have \(apples) apples."
let fruitSummary = "I have \(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit."
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto apples = 3;
auto oranges = 5;
auto appleSummary = "I have " + to_string(apples) + " apples.";
auto fruitSummary = "I have " + to_string(apples + oranges) + " pieces of fruit.";
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>Or using <code>ostringstream</code> which works just like <code>cout</code> and makes use of <code>operator &lt;&lt;</code></p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>apples</span> <span>=</span> <span>3</span><span>;</span>
<span>ostringstream</span> <span>ss</span><span>;</span>
<span>ss</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>"I have "</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>apples</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>" apples."</span><span>;</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>ss</span><span>.</span><span>str</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>which can then further be reduced to:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>str</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>ostringstream</span><span>()</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>"I have "</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>apples</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>" apples."</span><span>).</span><span>str</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
let apples = 3
let oranges = 5
let appleSummary = "I have \(apples) apples."
let fruitSummary = "I have \(apples + oranges) pieces of fruit."
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto apples = 3;
auto oranges = 5;
auto appleSummary = (ostringstream()&lt;&lt; "I have "&lt;&lt;apples&lt;&lt;" apples.").str();
auto fruitSummary = (ostringstream()&lt;&lt;"I have "&lt;&lt;(apples + oranges)&lt;&lt;" pieces of fruit.").str();
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="array">Array</h2>

<p>Swift <code>Array</code> equivalent in C++ is <code>vector</code>. Here’s how you use it</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
var shoppingList = ["catfish", "water", "tulips"]
shoppingList[1] = "bottle of water"
shoppingList.append("blue paint")
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto shoppingList = vector&lt;string&gt;{"catfish", "water", "tulips"};
shoppingList[1] = "bottle of water";
shoppingList.push_back("blue paint");
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>And this is how you iterate a <code>vector</code></p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
for item in shoppingList {
  print(item)
}
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
for (auto &amp; item : shoppingList) {
  cout &lt;&lt; item &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>The <code>&amp;</code> here means that we wish to use <code>item</code> as a reference. If we were to use <code>auto item</code> it would always create a new copy.</p>

<h2 id="dictionary">Dictionary</h2>

<p>Swift <code>Dictionary</code> equivalent in C++ is <code>map</code>. Here’s how you use it</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
var occupations = [
  "Malcolm": "Captain",
  "Kaylee": "Mechanic",
]
occupations["Jayne"] = "Public Relations"
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto occupations = map&lt;string, string&gt; {
  {"Malcolm", "Captain"},
  {"Kaylee", "Mechanic"},
};
occupations["Jayne"] = "Public Relations";
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>And this is how you iterate over a <code>map</code></p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
for (key, value) in occupations {
  print("\(key) : \(value)")
}
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
for (auto&amp; [key, value]: occupations) {
  cout &lt;&lt; key &lt;&lt; " : " &lt;&lt; value &lt;&lt; endl;
}
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<h2 id="optional">Optional</h2>

<p>Swift developers love <code>Optional</code> types. Fortunately for us, C++ also got <code>optional</code> types starting c++17. Although not as fancy as with Swift, but the core idea is the same: A type that either has the value or not. Here’s an example:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
func greeting(_ required: Bool) -&gt; String? {
  return required ? Optional("Hello") : nil;
}

func main() -&gt; Int {
  let s = greeting(false) ?? "Hi"
  print(s) // Hi

  if let str = greeting(true) {
    print(str) // Hello
  }

  return 0
}
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto greeting(bool required) -&gt; optional&lt;string&gt; {
  return required ? optional{"Hello"} : nullopt;
}

auto main() -&gt; int {
  auto s = greeting(false).value_or("Hi");
  cout &lt;&lt; s &lt;&lt; endl; // Hi

  if (auto str = greeting(true)) {
    cout &lt;&lt; *str &lt;&lt; endl; // Hello
  }

  return 0;
}
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>The <code>*str</code> can be thought of as force unwrapping in Swift, <code>str!</code>. And after <em>dereferencing</em> we can either use the <code>.</code> or the handy <code>-&gt;</code> operator to access the variable.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>*</span><span>str</span><span>).</span><span>size</span><span>();</span>
<span>str</span><span>-&gt;</span><span>size</span><span>();</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="function">Function</h2>

<p>C++ functions do not have argument labels</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
func greet(_ person: String, on day: String) -&gt; String {
    return "Hello \(person), today is \(day)."
}

greet("John", on: "Wednesday")
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto greetPersonOnDay(string person, string day) -&gt; string {
  return (ostringstream()&lt;&lt;"Hello "&lt;&lt;person&lt;&lt;", today is "&lt;&lt;day&lt;&lt;".").str();
}

greetPersonOnDay("John", "Wednesday")l
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>But if you really miss having named arguments there are many tricks of all shapes and sizes out there. The simplest is to use a <code>struct</code> for arguments</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>struct</span> <span>Args</span> <span>{</span> <span>string</span> <span>person</span><span>,</span> <span>day</span><span>;</span> <span>};</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>greet</span><span>(</span><span>Args</span> <span>args</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>string</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>(</span><span>ostringstream</span><span>()</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>"Hello "</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>args</span><span>.</span><span>person</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>", today is "</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>args</span><span>.</span><span>day</span><span>&lt;&lt;</span><span>"."</span><span>).</span><span>str</span><span>();</span>
<span>}</span>

<span>greet</span><span>({.</span><span>person</span> <span>=</span> <span>"John"</span><span>,</span> <span>.</span><span>day</span> <span>=</span> <span>"Wednesday"</span><span>})</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="closures">Closures</h2>

<p>C++ has a good support for closures. Here’s an example:</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
func hasAnyMatches(list: [Int], condition: (Int) -&gt; Bool) -&gt; Bool {
  for item in list {
    if condition(item) {
      return true
    }
  }
  return false
}

func lessThanTen(number: Int) -&gt; Bool {
  return number &lt; 10
}

var numbers = [20, 19, 7, 12]
hasAnyMatches(list: numbers, condition: lessThanTen)
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
auto hasAnyMatches(vector&lt;int&gt; list, function&lt;bool(int)&gt; condition) -&gt; bool {
  for (auto item : list) {
    if (condition(item)) {
      return true;
    }
  }
  return false;
}

auto lessThanTen(int number) -&gt; bool {
  return number &lt; 10;
}

auto numbers = vector&lt;int&gt; {20, 19, 7, 12};
hasAnyMatches(numbers, lessThanTen);
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>That said, C++ still doesn’t has all the fancy functional operations like <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>...</code> that we get with Swift, but they’re coming soon with <a href="https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/ranges">C++20 ranges</a>. For now we can use <code>transform</code> as an equivalent to Swift <code>map</code></p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
numbers.map({ (number: Int) -&gt; Int in
  let result = 3 * number
  return result
})
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
transform(numbers.begin(), numbers.end(), numbers.begin(), [](auto number) -&gt; auto {
  auto result = 3 * number;
  return result;
});
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>The C++ code here would actually mutate the <code>numbers</code>. If we want the truly Swift <code>map</code> equivalent we would have to create an empty <code>vector</code> and append data to it</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>auto</span> <span>mappedNumbers</span> <span>=</span> <span>vector</span><span>&lt;</span><span>int</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{};</span>
<span>transform</span><span>(</span><span>numbers</span><span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>(),</span> <span>numbers</span><span>.</span><span>end</span><span>(),</span> <span>back_inserter</span><span>(</span><span>mappedNumbers</span><span>),</span> <span>[](</span><span>auto</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> 
  <span>return</span> <span>3</span> <span>*</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span> 
<span>});</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="classes">Classes</h2>

<p>Unlike Swift in C++ there isn’t much difference between a <code>struct</code> and a <code>class</code> with the only difference being that a C++ struct has all members <code>public</code> by default whereas a <code>class</code> has all members as <code>private</code> by default. Whether the instance is mutable or not depends on how it is declared.</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
class Shape {

  func simpleDescription() -&gt; String {
    return "A shape with \(numberOfSides) sides."
  }

  var numberOfSides = 0
}

var shape = Shape()
shape.numberOfSides = 7
var shapeDescription = shape.simpleDescription()
</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>
class Shape {
public:
  auto simpleDescription() -&gt; string {
    return (ostringstream()&lt;&lt;"A shape with "&lt;&lt;numberOfSides&lt;&lt;" sides.").str();
  }

  int numberOfSides = 0;
};

auto shape = Shape();
shape.numberOfSides = 7;
auto shapeDescription = shape.simpleDescription();
</code></pre></td>
</tr></tbody>
</table>

<p>Initializer (or constructor as they are called in C++) have a slightly different syntax</p>

<table>
<thead><tr><th>Swift</th><th>C++</th></tr></thead>
<tbody><tr>
<td><pre><code>
class Shape {

  init(name: String) {
    self.name = name

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><p>After the JPEG standard was released in 1992, JPEG images became synonymous with digital photography and are used in almost every application which works with photo quality images. The reason the adoption of the standard was fast and nearly universal is that it makes use of multiple techniques simultaneously to reduce the compressed file size. One of those is an understanding of the limits of the human visual system and which information is important to preserve versus which is less important and can be removed.</p><h2 id="the-jpeg-coding-algorithm">The JPEG coding algorithm</h2><p>There are several steps needed to compress an image using the JPEG method (see image below). To begin, it is usually converted from RGB into the YCbCR colorspace. The reason this is necessary is to allow sub-sampling of the pixels. The human eye is more sensitive to changes in luminance than changes in chrominance. This allows the chroma channels to be downsampled while keeping the luma channel at full resolution. The image can lose 50% of its data with this step and the perceived degradation is quite minimal. The image is then divided into 8x8 MCUs or minimum coded units (the equivalent terminology for video codecs is Macro Blocks). These MCUs are square blocks of pixels which are compressed based on the similarity to each other. The pixels in each MCU are transformed from the spatial domain to the frequency domain with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Discrete Cosine Transform</a> (DCT). The operation allows for the easy removal of high frequency information (fine detail) to further compress the image. The more high frequency coefficients are removed, the smaller the file and the blurrier the image becomes. This effectively controls the “Q Value” or compression amount used by encoders.</p><figure><img srcset="https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/jpeg-coding.png, https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/jpeg-coding@2x.png 2x" alt="JPEG coding steps"><figcaption>JPEG coding steps</figcaption></figure><p>One of the many clever ideas incorporated into the standard is to use the similarity in DC value (essentially the brightness) between adjacent MCUs to further reduce the data size by compressing just the change from one to the next instead of encoding the entire value. This is depicted above in the “DPCM coding” block. This is a great idea, but it creates a small problem. By having each successive MCU’s DC value(s) depend on a delta from the previous, it means that if there is an error in the data, the MCUs from that point on down will all be wrong.</p><p>Making matters slightly worse is that the compressed symbols which encode the image data (shown above as “Huffman coding”) are Variable Length Codes (VLC). A single wrong bit can corrupt the data from that point forward. Back in the ‘old’ days when JPEG was invented, this was a very real concern because images were often transmitted over channels (e.g. acoustic modem) that may not have had robust error correction or stored on media (e.g. floppy disks) that were prone to errors. Knowing that the data may suffer from errors, a feature was added to the standard to mitigate the amount of the image that would be corrupted by bad data. The idea was to periodically reset the previous DC value to 0, forcing the next MCU to encode its entire value as a delta from 0. This means that any corrupted DC values will only affect pixels up to the next restart point.</p><p>This is implemented with Restart Markers. They are 2-byte markers placed in between the MCUs at regular intervals (e.g. every 100 MCUs). If a data corruption occurs, it’s easy to scan forward in the file to the next restart marker (JPEG markers are always on byte boundaries and preceded by 0xFF). Once the next restart marker is found, the image can be properly decoded from that point on since the number of MCUs between each restart marker is known.</p><h2 id="the-ever-evolving-use-of-digital-images">The ever evolving use of digital images</h2><p>Starting not long after the JPEG standard was released, computer networks and storage were getting more reliable and incorporated error detection and correction (e.g. TCP/IP). The solid state storage cards used in digital cameras were quite reliable and the restart markers were ‘forgotten’ for a while since they made the files slightly larger without giving much perceived benefit. During that period, computer software was mostly designed to run on a single processor using a single thread. The fact that a JPEG image needed to be decoded in a single pass due to its use of variable length codes and a string of successive delta values for the MCU didn’t cause any problems for software since it was designed to run as a single thread anyway.</p><p>In the last few years however, computers and our use of JPEG images have changed dramatically. Nearly every computing device has multiple CPUs and runs an operating system with multiple threads (even phones). The other change is that people are taking, editing and viewing billions of JPEG photos on their mobile phones. Each generation of phones produce larger and higher resolution images. For anyone working with tons of photos, the time to encode and decode them has become increasingly important because of the sheer volume and size of new images being generated.</p><figure><img srcset="https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/images-chart.png, https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/images-chart@2x.png 2x" alt="The sum of transfer size kilobytes of all external images requested by the page."><figcaption>The average transfer size of images requested by the web page. Data source: <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/state-of-images#bytesImg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HTTP Archive</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="repurposing-a-good-idea-into-an-even-better-idea">Repurposing a good idea into an even better idea</h2><p>Computers have been getting more powerful on a mostly continuous trajectory since the 1970s. A general term used to describe the continuous improvements in silicon processing called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Moore’s Law</a> was coined many years ago to commemorate Gordon Moore’s prediction that computers will double the number of transistors every 18 months. This has held mostly true for the transistor count, but the maximum speed of computers has basically hit a dead end due to the physical limitations of silicon and power+heat issues. Since individual processor speed hasn’t advanced much in the last few years, the emphasis has shifted to employing many processors to complete tasks faster by working in parallel. In today’s computing environment, it’s advantageous to be able to divide a task into sections and assign them to multiple CPUs. Not all tasks are possible to divide because each successive part may depend on the results from the previous. JPEG encoding and decoding are normally difficult to divide into pieces and run in parallel because of the way each successive MCU depends on the previous one and the use of variable length codes.</p><p>However… A convenient benefit of restart markers is that the VLC data is reset to a byte boundary (after the marker) and the MCU DC delta value is also reset. This means that both JPEG encoding and decoding could be divided into multiple threads with the use of restart markers. For encoding, the image could be divided into symmetrical strips and each strip could be encoded by a different processor. When each processor completes that task, the output of each can then be ‘glued’ together using restart markers. For decoding, the task can be spread across as many processors as there are restart markers. The only extra effort needed is to scan forward in the compressed data looking for the restart markers first since the size of the compressed data between each varies and there is no ‘directory’ in JPEG files showing where the restart markers are located.</p><h2 id="real-world-example">Real World Example</h2><p>With multi-threaded applications, the performance rarely scales 1:1 with the number of CPUs utilized (e.g. splitting a task into 12 threads on 12 CPU cores doesn’t mean it will run 12x faster). There is extra overhead in managing the threads and the memory is usually a single entity shared among the processors. Let’s run a test on the following image:</p><figure><img srcset="https://optidash.ai/assets/images/blog/accelerating-jpeg-coding-with-multiple-threads/jpeg-timings-image.jpg" alt="JPEG timings example image"><figcaption>Image credit: <a href="https://unsplash.com/@matthewhenry" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Matthew Henry</a> on Unsplash</figcaption></figure><p>Among other techniques, at Optidash we incorporate this idea of using restart markers to greatly accelerate both the decoding and encoding of images. The image above was run through one of our testing tools on a 2018 MacBook Pro 15” laptop with a 6-core Intel i7 processor. Here are the results:</p><div><table><thead><tr><td>Number of CPUs</td><td>Image decode time</td><td>Image encode time</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>53ms</td><td>264ms</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>25ms</td><td>104ms</td></tr><tr><td>6</td><td>18ms</td><td>61ms</td></tr></tbody></table></div><p>As you can see in the table above, there is a measurable advantage to splitting JPEG coding into multiple parts and assigning them to different CPUs. Depending on the task, the speed rarely scales linearly when using more CPUs. In this case, the intense use of large areas of memory limits how much benefit multiple CPUs can improve the overall speed.</p><p>Here’s some pseudocode which demonstrates how a multi-threaded JPEG encoder might look:</p><pre><code>void ThreadedWriteJPEG(assorted JPEG parameters, int numThreads) {
    int slice;
    pthread_t tinfo;

    // set completion counter
    sliceRemaining = numThreads;

    // Start a thread for each slice
    for (slice = 0; slice &lt; numThreads; slice++) {
        pthread_t tinfo;

        // Use a ‘slice’ structure to hold info about each thread’s work
        // This includes a pointer to the start of that strip of pixels
        // and the number of lines to compress

        &lt;setup slice structure for each thread’s work&gt;

        pthread_create(&amp;tinfo, NULL, JPEGBuffer, &amp;slices[slice]);
    } // for each slice

    // wait for all worker threads to finish
    WaitForThreads(&amp;sliceRemaining);

    // merge slices into a single file and write it
    WriteJPEGBuffer(slices, numThreads);
}
</code></pre></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main><section><div><p>The buzz around&nbsp;5G, AI, Blockchain, and IoT has enabled many new hardware use cases.</p><p>Thus, hardware development experiences a surge in practicality and popularity. This makes it the most exciting time since 20 years to get into electronics and hardware!
As a result, more and more hobbyists get excited to about the niche. Many, without putting the necessary care into their projects.
This practice might lead to self-inflicted </p><p> security breaches in smart homes</p><p> or other serious flaws.</p><p>To avoid such beginner's pitfalls and make your journey into electronics and hardware development a success, here are a few general Do’s and Don’ts to guide you.</p><h2>Don’t: Cutting Cost by all Means</h2><p>Components can eat up your project budget quickly. Keeping track of expenses is important in any development scenario.</p><p>However, fixating too much on the cost of your project and optimizing too early can distract you from making progress, delay or even hinder the successful completion.
You shouldn't start buying components at cheap &amp; dodgy overseas suppliers directly, just to save some bugs.
The potential negative implications are not worth it. Read more about this, in our </p><p>Hardware Guide</p><p>.</p><h2>Do: Push for prototypes</h2><p>One way to keep cost under control without sacrificing parts quality is to focus on building prototypes early on.</p><p><a href="https://blog.seebo.com/iot-prototypes/">Oren Ezra of Seebo</a> writes:</p><blockquote><p>“Prototypes can be used to test behaviors, software and firmware interactions in advance, that will affect the final <!-- -->[result]<!-- -->."</p></blockquote><p>A working prototype will tell you what’s easy or difficult to build and how much a fully build-out project might cost.
You can also build independent prototypes of individual parts of your project.
Instead of buying all components at once in the beginning, you can first only buy some components to build your prototypes.
When you have verified the practical feasibility of your design, you can incrementally acquire the missing parts.</p><h2>Do: Choose the right dev platform</h2><p>We are bombarded with new development platforms every day. Choosing the right hardware platform is now becoming a critical task for successful hardware development. When you build prototypes, make sure all the functionalities of the final project are validated.
The most popular development platforms are Arduino, Raspberry Pi and Galileo. Some are scalable, whereas others are more customizable, or secure. These have a huge community and many projects are powered by them. Apart from the community support, there are so many add-on modules available for these platforms for different purposes such as display, connectivity, motors, etc.</p><p>The principle of "fail fast, fail early" applies here. You should verify early on, if you work with the right platform. Otherwise, if you find out late that you have picked the wrong platform, you might spend a lot of time with design translation (both software &amp; hardware).
The latest point in time to migrate to a new platform should be after you completed prototyping and before starting the production development.</p><h2>Don’t: Underestimate manufacturing</h2><p>Often developers get so wrapped up in the theoretical part of hardware design they forget to give proper thought to the actual printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing process.
Designing and making projects that physically work takes trial and error. You need to plan extra time to development and testing your PCB design and run through multiple manufacturing loops till you eliminated all layout flaws.</p><p>If possible, get into contact with the PCB manufacturers early on. Find out about the specifications they recommend for your kind of project, and whether your initial design would be feasible.</p><h2>Do: Decide on the Technology for Connectivity</h2><p>Cellular or WIFI connectivity? It might look like a straight forward decision, but it's crucial to know your use case. When your project should work outside of your own home network, WiFi can be error prone as many networks are not friendly to unknown IoT devices.</p><p>As a result, you’re much better off looking at&nbsp;cellular connective technologies&nbsp;like LPWA or LTE-M1, which are low cost. use less energy and can be battery-powered.</p><h2>Don’t: Assume you know everything</h2><p>Even if it's not your first project anymore, and you have already gained some experienced, don’t fall into the trap that you don’t have anything to learn.</p><p>Electronics, hardware and IoT are complex and ever-evolving fields with strands of expertise that spread from circuit design to product interaction design and a hundred places in between.
Thus, it's almost impossible for one individual to be considered an hardware expert, and even difficult for a whole team.</p><p>Best, you actively seek out areas you are not confident in and build projects around it to improve.
However, don’t let this dishearten you. While you may not be experts in hardware development, you are an expert on your own project. Focus on how your vision and mission and the details will fall naturally into place over time.</p><hr></div></section></main></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post-content">
            <p>A small business based out of South Dakota was able to turn an initial investment of $2,500 into over $500,000 a month in sales, all by leveraging the power of TikTok Influencers.</p>

<p>Craig Mount and Erika Peterson started their peanut butter company, Nerdy Nuts, out of their home in the summer of 2019. The idea stemmed from a feeling of uncertainty, when Petersonâ€™s go-to peanut butter plug shut down, thatâ€™s when Craig Mount purchased an Olde Tyme PN1 nut grinder for $870 on Ebay. The grinder was eventually forgotten about, until Peterson put it to use in the summer of 2019, and just like that, <a href="https://nerdynuts.com/">Nerdy Nuts</a> was born.</p>

<h2>Starting Small</h2>

<p>The couple started small, with two flavors, honey roasted and white chocolate. They would begin selling their new peanut butter at local farmers markets, and their booth would consistently bring in around $1,000 every Sunday, not bad for what they considered a â€œlow-stressâ€� side hustle.</p>

<p>Although their decision to start small was solely based off the fact that the couple was busy raising and child and working their day jobs, this turned out to be a massive factor that ultimately contributed to their success. Selling at the farmers market meant that they had a lot of face-to-face interactions with their customers, this allowed for them to hand out samples and gather real-time feedback on their product, â€œIt became an excellent testing ground â€“ and a perfect way for us to iterateâ€� said Mount. This real time feedback allowed for Nerdy Nuts to iterate at a rapid pace, something that wouldâ€™ve been more difficult if they decided to cast a wider net at the start.</p>

<h2>Branding &amp; Early Success</h2>

<p>After doing some market research, Mount decided that Nerdy Nuts should be branded as a flavorful and fun brand, considering that a majority of direct-to-consumer (D2C) peanut butter brands were more focused on advertising themselves as â€œhealthyâ€� or â€œketo-friendlyâ€�. </p>

<p>By deciding to go the â€œfunâ€� approach with their branding, Nerdy Nuts opened up the door to many more possibilities when it came to growth tactics and marketing, one example of this would be their US election candidate inspired flavors. In June of 2019, Nerdy Nuts decided to launch a specialty line of flavors based on the favorite foods of each US election candidate.</p>

<p><img src="https://d5ik1gor6xydq.cloudfront.net/blog/29/nerd_nuts_peanut_butter.jpg" alt="Nerdy Nuts used TikTok influencers to boost sales."></p><p>This tactic ultimately landed Nerdy Nuts their first taste of virality, when their story was picked up by Fox Business. Within 48 hours of their national talk show appearance, the company made $20,000 in sales. This early virality showed the small business that there was demand beyond the farmers markets that they were used to, so they transitioned their focus to becoming a D2C brand and ditched the farmers market/retail approach. This decision would not only give them a larger reach, but also be more cost-effective than running a storefront.</p>

<h2>TikTok Virality</h2>

<p>Months after their first taste of going viral, Nerdy Nuts was once again a viral sensation, but this time on TikTok. This was nothing compared to the virality they experienced with Fox News, it was even better, â€œthese influencers made the Fox News sales look like a jokeâ€� said Mount.</p>

<p>The growing company was experimenting with different marketing approaches when they decided to try out influencers on TikTok. Mount reached out to Ali Grace Morsell and Hailey Peters, both of which had around 500,000 followers on the platform at the time. He offered both influencers free product, â€œthey were just so flabbergasted that anyone would want to send them something for free.â€� <a href="https://thehustle.co/how-a-tiny-peanut-butter-company-grew-to-500k-per-month-in-sales/">said Mount</a>. Aside from offering them the product for free, Mount also promised the influencers a 10% cut of all sales.</p>

<p>I think itâ€™s safe to say that things went better than expected. The influencers posted about the product and racked up over a million views, which <a href="https://thehustle.co/how-a-tiny-peanut-butter-company-grew-to-500k-per-month-in-sales/">ultimately resulted in 5,947 sales</a>. The hashtag #nerdynuts currently has just under 2 million views alone, definitely a contributing factor to the $165.2k in sales during the month of July, not too shabby for a small peanut butter company out of South Dakota.</p>

<p><img src="https://d5ik1gor6xydq.cloudfront.net/blog/29/hashtag.jpg" alt="The Nerdy Nuts TikTok hashtag has over 2 million views."></p><p>Sales continued to increase until August of 2020, when the company topped over $500,000 in sales â€“ a 20x increase from just a few months prior.</p>

<h2>Breaking Down the Strategy</h2>

<p>Mount is well aware that not everyone can just recruit some influencers and expect to go viral on TikTok, heâ€™s seen other influencer collabs flop, so what made the Nerdy Nuts collab pop? Whether or not Mount is aware of it, there are some key decisions he made that allowed for the Nerdy Nuts collab to become a success.</p>

<h3>1. Choosing the Right Influencers</h3>

<p>The most obvious, yet crucial, aspect of running an influencer campaign is definitely <a href="https://collabstr.com/blog/Crucial-Steps-to-Identifying-The-Best-Instagram-Influencers-in-Your-Industry">choosing the right influencers</a> for the job. If you take a look at <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@happyhealthyhailey?source=h5_m">Hailey</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@aligracemorsell?source=h5_m">Aliâ€™s</a> TikTok pages, it wonâ€™t take much to realize that these are both middle-aged woman that have children and have food-focused pages, both ideal candidates for a brand like Nerdy Nuts.</p>

<p>By being very picky with the influencers you choose to represent your brand, not only are you getting in front of an audience that is actually interested in hearing about your product, but youâ€™re working with an influencer that would be highly likely to enjoy your product as well. Ali and Hailey both have a young family, so theyâ€™re most likely already cooking all the time, experimenting with new foods and packing their childrenâ€™s lunches. By choosing influencers that are highly relevant to your niche, you are ensuring you get someone that is just as passionate about your brand.</p>

<h3>2. Having a Good Product</h3>

<p>This one is not as obvious as the previous point, but it is still an important piece of the puzzle. We mentioned in our influencer marketing <a href="https://collabstr.com/blog/how-hismile-teeth-built-a-multi-million-dollar-brand-using-influencers">case study on HiSmile Teeth</a>, that the founders ensured they had a product that people actually wanted before sending it out to influencers. The bottom line is, if you have a product that nobody wants, then influencers are not going to want to promote it because at the end of the day they are consumers too.</p>

<p>By starting small and only selling at farmers markets, without knowing it, Nerdy Nuts was perfecting their product as much as possible to get it ready for the mass market. It was apparent that customers were loving the product, so by sending it out to influencers, the company was giving them a product that they most-likely would have enjoyed or even bought without the company asking.</p>

<p>While this point may not be directly correlated to the success of an influencer marketing campaign on TikTok, it most definitely plays an important role. Weâ€™ve seen cases of this before, <a href="https://collabstr.com/blog/The-Greatest-Example-of-Influencer-Marketing-On-Instagram-Fashion-Nova">such as with Fashion Nova</a>, where having a product that consumers genuinely loved ended up resulting in a viral feedback loop.</p>

<h3>3. Leave the Creativity to the Creators</h3>

<p>If you take a look at the content posted by Hailey and Ali as part of their original Nerdy Nuts campaign, you will notice that the content came off as very authentic and genuine, this is because the creativity was left to the creators.</p>

<p>When working with influencers on any platform, it is important to be aware of type of content they post and ensure that your vision aligns with theirs. The last thing you want to do is force an influencer to post a piece of content about your brand that comes off as disingenuous or scripted. Content coming from an influencer is not a TV or radio ad, so it shouldnâ€™t come off as one.</p>

<p>In order to the maximize your ROI, it is important to understand your boundaries when working with influencers.</p>

<p><b>Your responsibilities:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Sourcing and vetting the influencers.</li>
    <li>Getting the product to the influencer.</li>
    <li>Making influencer aware of campaign goals.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Influencer responsibilities:</b></p>
<ul>
    <li>Formulating the creative strategy and creating the content.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>If youâ€™re reading this thinking to yourself â€œdamn, I should try using TikTok influencersâ€� youâ€™re in luck, because just as Nerdy Nuts discovered for themselves, TikTok influencers are highly underrated and undervalued at the time of writing this article. Influencers are also a topic we discuss in our <a href="https://collabstr.com/blog/The-Ultimate-Guide-to-TikTok-for-Brands-in-2020">ultimate guide to TikTok for brands in 2020</a>, we think they're an essential part to anybodies marketing strategy.</p>

<p>While 500,000 followers on TikTok may not be as valuable as 500,000 followers on Instagram, reaching nearly 2 million people organically just by gifting your product to an influencer is unheard of on any other platform aside form TikTok. </p>

<p>Nerdy Nuts is a prime example of how small direct-to-consumer businesses can leverage the power of influencer marketing. If youâ€™re looking to source some influencers for your campaign, and youâ€™re not sure where to start, check out <a href="https://collabstr.com/">Collabstr.</a></p>

January 3, 2021 | https://www.thefortunelabs.com/knowledge/obsidian-note-taking-app/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.thefortunelabs.com/knowledge/obsidian-note-taking-app/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
<p>Obsidian is described as “A second brain, for you, forever”. It is a desktop app (available for Windows, Mac and Linux) that acts as a knowledge base working on top of a local folder of plain text Markdown files.</p>



<p>The app is developed by the hugely talented Licat (Shida Li) and Silver (Erika Xu) who also brought us the delightful&nbsp;<a href="https://dynalist.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dynalist</a>&nbsp;(an outliner note-taking tool similar to <a href="https://www.thefortunelabs.com/knowledge/logseq-the-note-taking-app/">Logseq</a>).</p>



<p>The app is offered as a free download, although sponsoring the devs is possible by upgrading your license through a one-time payment (USD 25+). By upgrading the license, we gain insider builds (early releases) and access to the exclusive dev channel on Discord.</p>



<h2>Why Obsidian?</h2>



<p>Your notes are saved locally on your machine in plain text markdown format, allowing you to easily transfer your notes to other apps or open them with Notepad, in essence, there is no vendor lock-in. You are in complete control of your notes and files and can use Google Drive, GitHub, Dropbox etc. to sync your notes between different machines.</p>



<p>Having control over my notes gives me peace of mind. I am free to do what I want with them, and even though with the Obsidian app I can use various functions (backlinks, graph view, etc.) I know that should the app disappear, the content is mine and will forever be mine.</p>



<p>The ease of using the app could not be more straightforward. Once downloaded and installed, you are greeted with a welcome screen similar to the one below:</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="800" height="650" src="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=800%2C650&amp;ssl=1" alt="" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=300%2C244&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=768%2C624&amp;ssl=1 768w" sizes="(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px" data-recalc-dims="1" data-lazy-srcset="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?w=800&amp;ssl=1 800w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=300%2C244&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=768%2C624&amp;ssl=1 768w" data-lazy-src="https://i2.wp.com/www.thefortunelabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Obs-Welcome.png?resize=800%2C650&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1" data-old-srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"></figure></div>



<p>From here you can either create a new vault (notes repository) or open an existing vault. You can also open the “help vault” which includes several help files such as a formatting guide, and appearance customisation guides amongst other how-tos.</p>



<p>Once you have created / opened a vault, you can start taking notes at your heart’s content. You are free to choose to structure your notes the way you wish. You can have folders similar to traditional note-taking tools or go structure free and store all your notes in one main directory.</p>



<p>The beauty of creating links between your notes (with a simple [[“name”]] link) means that you should always be able to find what you are looking for and generate ideas (see <a href="https://www.thefortunelabs.com/personal-knowledge-management/">Personal Knowledge Management</a>) from your notes.</p>



<p>The app works in markdown format with the possibility of rendering the preview side by side, as shown below. You can also have more than one note open simultaneously by opening additional panes that can be infinitely split and resized. This is great if you want to cross-reference notes or create a work product from multiple notes.</p>

<p>The markdown format may feel a little overwhelming at first, but things get easier after taking a few notes. The other benefit of having notes in markdown or rendered view is that it is easy to copy and paste the text into an online blogging platform or a Word document. For instance, I created this post in Obsidian and copied and pasted the text to WordPress and voila.</p>



<p>Having said the above, the lack of a What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) type interface is a little annoying in my point of view. Sometimes the markdown format is confusing to read, or if you are in preview mode, you need to go back to edit mode to tweak the text. The good news is that this is on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roadmap</a>. Fingers crossed this comes soon.</p>



<p>In addition to the devs being hugely talented and ever-present to answer questions and chat on the Discord, the speed of development is phenomenal. Nearly every other week, we are presented with an update that includes new features and bug fixes.</p>



<h2>Features</h2>



<p>There are a significant amount of features available in Obsidian, so I thought to include below what I consider to be the main ones:</p>



<ul><li>Offline – <em>can access whether connected or not. Notes are stored offline and are yours</em></li><li>Backlinking – <em>easily see which pages link to the page</em></li><li>Random Note – <em>opens a random note which is useful for discovering old content</em></li><li>Daily Note – <em>create today’s note at the click of a button</em></li><li>Starred Notes – c<em>an star “favourite” notes for easy access</em></li><li>To-do list – <em>easily create to-do lists</em></li><li>Outline – <em>see the structure of your note and easily navigate to other sections by clicking</em></li><li>Search – <em>easily find what you are looking for</em></li><li>Graph View –&nbsp;v<em>isualise a page or your notes collection in a graph with many different filter / view options</em></li></ul>



<p>I have included below a brief video I did of the main features available in Obsidian.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Obsidian Introduction - A alternative Roam Research app for Notes / PKM / To Do / Journal" width="1200" height="675" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SJYHMCbqZbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In addition to the above main features, there are a couple of additional features which warrant a separate mention. These are:</p>



<h2>Publish</h2>



<p>A useful feature of Obsidian is Obsidian Publish where you can take your notes and convert them into an online digital garden / blog. The simplicity of doing this through “no code” means that there is no prior technical knowledge required. You only need to sign up (USD 8 per month per site (early-bird price)), choose a name, select which notes to publish and there you have it – your own personal online space.</p>



<p>The outcome can look something like this <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/help/Index" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">example</a>. Developments are in the pipeline to allow for custom domains and other tweaks to make it more personal and improve the experience.</p>



<h2>Plugins</h2>



<p>With the ability to install and use third-party plugins and such a large community of users, many plugins are available to choose from to customise the app to suit your needs. The plugins are easily installed in the app (simply click install on the plugins browser page within Obsidian) and allow you to do things like:</p>



<h3>Mind Map</h3>



<p>View your note as a mind map. For example, activating the mind map view on this article results in the following diagram:</p>







<p>I find this plugin great as although you can see the note’s outline using the Obsidian outline feature, this allows you to visualise it differently.</p>



<h3>Calendar</h3>



<p>Enables a Calendar View to visualise and navigate between daily notes and easily create a daily note for a past, or future date.</p>







<h2>Areas of Improvement / Wish List</h2>



<p>There are a few areas of improvement which I feel would elevate the app even further. These improvements include:</p>



<ul><li>A What You See Is What You Get (WYSIWYG) type editor interface,</li><li>Mobile app to view / take notes on mobile,</li><li>Ability to see more information on notes in bulk (like date created, last modified, word count).</li></ul>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>With a few tweaks and the addition of a WYSIWYG interface, this app has the potential to become a top note taking app. Notes are stored locally, so are yours and forever yours. The features available in the app allow you to take notes, visualise your notes and generate ideas easily.</p>

</div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_14361"><div><p>The desire to get more sales off-Amazon doesn’t just come from the risk that they suspend our company from their platform. It’s also about the cost of selling there relative to other channels. If we sell $100 worth of product on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/viahart">our Amazon store</a>, on average, we get $48.25 back. At <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?query=viahart&amp;redirect=false">our Walmart.com store</a>, we get $54.50 and on <a href="https://www.ebay.com/str/viahart">eBay store</a>, we get $57.50 back. On <a href="https://viahart.com/">our website (which could use a bath!)</a>, by virtue of not having a commission and by having much lower per unit shipping costs driven by larger orders (the more you ship, the cheaper it is to ship per unit), we get $83.10 back!</p><p>What’s driving those cost differences between the big marketplaces Amazon, eBay, and Walmart? It’s not shipping. It costs us roughly the same to ship out of our warehouse as it does for us to use Amazon’s FBA. eBay’s has slightly lower commissions, but the main reasons for the cost differences between these marketplaces are:</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>Refunds - It could be Amazon’s customer service or perhaps the customers themselves, but Amazon grants more refunds (2.6% of revenue) than either Walmart (1.9%) or famously seller friendly eBay (1%)</p></li><li><p>Storage - It costs a lot of money to store your products in Amazon’s fulfillment centers. We spent 2.4% of our Amazon revenue on storage. Amazon’s service was very spotty this year, but being able to reach 99.99% of America within 1-2 days is pretty awesome and this is a big driver of why Amazon owns 93.4% of our sales.</p></li><li><p>Advertising - Depending on what website A/B testing they’re doing, as many as 6 out of the top 7 results in an Amazon search can be advertising.  Even when a customer searches for your brand, if you want to be seen before your competition, you need to pay Amazon. We paid them 3.55% of our Amazon revenue in 2020. As less competitive marketplaces, we did not see the need to pay for advertising on eBay or Walmart. </p></li></ol></div></div><div data-block-type="5" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1609697572806_20928"><div>

At that level of margin, moving your sales from Amazon to eBay would result in a 38% improvement in profits, which is huge. Shifting those sales from Amazon to one’s own website would represent a more than 3x increase in profits! Of course, if this were easy, we would have done it already. Unfortunately, getting traffic to one’s website is oftentimes a costly affair and it could be expected that a good portion of those profits would go to Facebook or Google.</p><p>Logistics and Covid-19 or Why It’s Better to Be Lucky Than Good</p><p>When the lockdowns first hit in the United States, it caused a massive shift in spending from brick-and-mortar to e-commerce.

Perhaps it was to combat their fake review problem, or perhaps it was to increase the social proof on their website, to make it look like a lot more purchases were happening on Amazon.com than Walmart.com.</p><p>Other Interesting E-commerce Observations</p><ol data-rte-list="default"><li><p>$4.6 million dollars worth of product were added to carts on our website in 2020.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This tutorial is meant to help find clues as to who is calling you when you’re receiving calls from an unknown phone number (a number that is displayed on your phone’s screen, but you don’t recognize).</p><p>It’s quite short and simple, and I hope it helps, as it’s written with the intention of tracking whoever may be bothering or harassing you.</p><p>First I’d like to clear up the following meanings:</p><ul><li><strong>unknown phone number</strong> – a phone number that is displayed on my phone’s screen but I don’t have the caller’s information</li><li><strong>private phone number</strong> – a number that’s not displayed on my screen when someone is calling because the caller is withholding their number.</li></ul><p>I wanted to quickly clear this up because I suspect some interpret the term of <strong>unknown phone number</strong> as <strong>private phone number/call</strong>, and I don’t want to take up someone’s time with information that’s not useful to them.</p><h2 id="method-1-finding-the-facebook-account-associated-with-the-unknown-number">Method 1 – Finding the Facebook account associated with the unknown number</h2><p>With this method we’ll try to have Facebook show us the account associated with the phone number by trying to login with it and then clicking <code data-enlighter-language="raw">Forgot Password?</code>, which will lead us to the next page where Facebook shows us the associated account.</p><p>Please also keep in mind that I am not an expert in this area. Although I don’t think that investigating an unknown phone number in this manner is an offence in any way, I do think you should proceed at your own risk.</p><p>Another thing to keep in mind is that even though this method probably has a good chance of working, the number may not be associated with a Facebook account.</p><p>Also, since it will look like you’re trying to log in, Facebook will probably notify the user in some form. In my case I just got notified that I can enable one click login, for security reasons.</p><p><img width="593" height="532" src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp" data-src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp" data-srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp 593w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-300x269.png.webp 300w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-380x341.png.webp 380w" data-sizes="(max-width: 593px) 100vw, 593px" alt="word image 7" title="Look Up Unknown Phone Numbers using Facebook Reset Password or WhatsApp 12" srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7.png.webp 593w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-300x269.png.webp 300w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-7-380x341.png.webp 380w"></p><p>I’m not certain of other cases, however.

Add the unknown number to your contact list</h3><p>I assume it doesn’t have a high success rate, but it’s pretty low effort and I think it’s worth a shot.</p><p>Just add the phone number to your contacts under whatever name you’d like, and then look up that contact in WhatsApp to check out if they have a profile pic.</p><p>That profile pic may be either a selfie or something that can help you identify if you know that person.</p><h3 id="2-reverse-image-search-the-profile-picture-video">2. Reverse Image Search the Profile Picture [Video]</h3><p>If you think the image is not very generic, and it’s likely they used it on other websites, such as social media, you can also perform a reverse image search using <a href="https://images.google.com/" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://images.google.com<span></span></a> and see if something comes up.</p><p>I know this is probably nothing new, but an additional thing you can do is limit the image search to a specific site.</p><p>For example if you search someone’s profile picture and get a good deal of results with all sorts of websites, and additional similar images that aren’t an exact match, you can limit the search to just one social media site, such as Twitter.</p><p>To do this you use the <code data-enlighter-language="raw">site:example.com</code> operator.</p><p>For example if we want to limit our reverse image search to Twitter, we’d search for the image first, and then replace the existing text in the Google search bar with <code data-enlighter-language="raw">site:twitter.com</code></p><h4 id="quick-demo-video-2">Quick Demo Video</h4><p>The steps are:</p><ol><li>Go to <a href="https://images.google.com/" rel="noopener external" data-wpel-link="external" target="_blank">https://images.google.com<span></span></a></li><li>Drag the image onto the search bar, or click the little camera icon and insert the URL to the image, or select <strong>Upload an image</strong> and then <strong>Choose File</strong> and then browse for the picture on your computer.</li><li>Next, Google will show us what matches were found.I’ll use this website’s social media profile pic as an example.<p>As you can see, Google sees our profile pic as being similar to many other images, and provides a list of many other websites associated with those images.</p><p><img width="665" height="683" src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp" data-src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp" data-srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp 665w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-292x300.png.webp 292w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-380x390.png.webp 380w" data-sizes="(max-width: 665px) 100vw, 665px" alt="word image 12" title="Look Up Unknown Phone Numbers using Facebook Reset Password or WhatsApp 19" srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12.png.webp 665w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-292x300.png.webp 292w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-12-380x390.png.webp 380w"></p></li><li>Since we’re interested in mainly social media websites to have a good chance of identifying someone, we’ll filter the results by limiting the search only to Twitter, in this example.<p>You can, of course, try other social media websites popular in your region.</p><p>So in the search bar we’ll just remove the text, in this case <strong>digital alberta</strong>, and replace it with <code data-enlighter-language="raw">site:twitter.com</code>.</p><p>After the search is complete, we can see that even though it’s not the first result, we’ve still found the Twitter profile associated with the image.</p><p><img width="732" height="1270" src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp" data-src="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp" data-srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp 732w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-173x300.png.webp 173w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-590x1024.png.webp 590w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-380x659.png.webp 380w" data-sizes="(max-width: 732px) 100vw, 732px" alt="word image 13" title="Look Up Unknown Phone Numbers using Facebook Reset Password or WhatsApp 20" srcset="https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13.png.webp 732w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-173x300.png.webp 173w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-590x1024.png.webp 590w,https://y7p8z3w8.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/word-image-13-380x659.png.webp 380w"></p></li></ol><p>I hope these methods come in useful or give you some peace of mind in some cases when you’re having issues with numbers you don’t recognize.</p><h2 id="other-methods">Other Methods</h2><p>Here I’ll just list other methods that could work.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    
    <p>Every time I go back to Rust, I have to figure out how the module system works again. Here are some of my notes comparing it to Python’s module system.</p>

<p>These notes are for Rust 2018.</p>

<ul id="markdown-toc">
  <li><a href="#crates" id="markdown-toc-crates">Crates</a></li>
  <li><a href="#packages" id="markdown-toc-packages">Packages</a></li>
  <li><a href="#file-layout" id="markdown-toc-file-layout">File layout</a>    <ul>
      <li><a href="#crate-roots" id="markdown-toc-crate-roots">Crate roots</a></li>
      <li><a href="#module-lookups" id="markdown-toc-module-lookups">Module lookups</a></li>
      <li><a href="#nested-modules" id="markdown-toc-nested-modules">Nested modules</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="crates">Crates</h3>

<p>A <strong>crate</strong> is a build target in Rust. A crate can either be a library or a binary. It can be built with <code>cargo build</code>.</p>

<p>In Python, libraries are called “packages”. Binaries are an entirely heterogenous concept, typically installed by configuring <a href="https://packaging.python.org/specifications/entry-points/">entry points</a>. Such a binary doesn’t even need to be Python code (for example, it can be a shell script instead).</p>

<h3 id="packages">Packages</h3>

<p>A <strong>package</strong> in Rust consists of up to one library crate and any number of binary crates. (It’s required that there be at least one library or binary crate.)</p>

<p>In Python, a single “distribution package” (i.e. one that you can <code>pip install</code>) can contain multiple “import packages” (i.e. one that you can <code>import</code>), while Rust allows at most one import package per distribution package.</p>

<h3 id="file-layout">File layout</h3>

<h4 id="crate-roots">Crate roots</h4>

<p>Python places <code>__init__.py</code> at the root of a package to indicate that it’s importable as a package. Similarly, Rust conventionally puts <code>lib.rs</code> at the root of a crate as the library <strong>crate root</strong>. (Unlike Python, the name can be re-configured, but <code>lib.rs</code> is the default.)</p>

<p>In Python, <code>__main__.py</code> corresponds to the main entry point for the module when run with <code>python -m</code>. Rust conventionally puts <code>main.rs</code> as a binary crate root. (This can also be renamed, which is probably desirable if you have more than one binary.)</p>

<h4 id="module-lookups">Module lookups</h4>

<p>In Python, all modules are available by importing them via their filesystem path name. For example, <code>import foo.bar</code> first looks for a <code>foo/</code> directory on the <code>PYTHONPATH</code>. Then it looks for a <code>bar/</code> package or a <code>bar.py</code> module underneath the <code>foo/</code> directory.</p>

<p>In Rust, modules also correspond to their paths on the filesystem (by default; <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/reference/items/modules.html#the-path-attribute">you can use the <code>path</code> attribute</a> to change this behavior). However, they are not immediately <code>use</code>-able just because the corresponding file is present! They must be declared with a <code>mod foo;</code> declaration in the crate root file (e.g. <code>lib.rs</code>).</p>

<h4 id="nested-modules">Nested modules</h4>

<p>In Python, a nested module <code>foo.bar</code> is implemented either by <code>foo/bar.py</code> or <code>foo/bar/__init__.py</code>. You can’t use both. If you want to have sub-modules of <code>foo.bar</code>, you’ll place additional modules or packages under <code>foo/bar/</code>.</p>

<p>A statement like <code>from foo.bar import qux</code> could either be importing a symbol declared in <code>foo/bar/__init__.py</code> or the module <code>foo/bar/qux.py</code>. Some developers choose to explicitly re-export the public interface of <code>bar</code> in <code>__init__.py</code> for clarity, and prefix sub-modules with underscores (e.g. <code>_qux.py</code> instead of <code>qux.py</code>).</p>

<p>In Rust, you use <code>foo/bar.rs</code> to declare members of the namespace <code>foo::bar</code>. If you also want to have sub-namespaces of bar (e.g. <code>foo::bar::qux</code>), then you additionally create the <code>bar/</code> directory alongside <code>bar.rs</code>. To access a sub-namespace <code>qux</code> inside <code>bar.rs</code>, the line <code>mod qux;</code> must be added to <code>bar.rs</code>. (This is similar to how we have to add <code>mod foo;</code> at the top-level <code>lib.rs</code>.)</p>

<p>To re-export the namespace and make it available to all users outside of <code>bar</code>, it should be changed to <code>pub mod qux;</code>.</p>

<p>The main take-away is that Rust requires the explicit re-exporting of nested modules using <code>mod</code> at each step of the hierarchy, while Python does not.</p>

            <p>
    Posted on January  3, 2021
    
</p>


<ul>
<li>I spent the year as a software engineer writing Haskell, and switched to remote work during the pandemic with everyone else.<br>
</li>
<li>Wrote a lot of code, and focused on Haskell as a language for software engineering.<br>
</li>
<li>Completed 3 courses from Georgia Tech on bayesian statistics, computer networking, and embedded compilers, as part of a masters program I’ll finish in 2021.<br>
</li>
<li>Wrote more Haskell code this year than probably all other years combined, and made it through 2020 feeling pretty good about things. I’ll mark that in the win column!</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m writing this post as a collection of my thoughts on the last year, and a reflection on the major things I’ve learned.<br>
The majority of my Haskell experience is in the form of writing code for web servers that talk to databases serve up APIs, although I am very interested in compilers and language research!</p>
<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<ul>
<li>On The Practice Of Software Engineering</li>
<li>Haskell Observations</li>
<li>Musings On Type Level Programming</li>
<li>Build Systems</li>
<li>The Year In Readings</li>
<li>Summary</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="on-the-practice-of-software-engineering">On The Practice of Software Engineering</h2>
<p>Software engineering is about understanding the trade offs (performance, latency, domain modelling, et cetera), and implementing a solution that solves a problem with a solution space of development time, cost, and quality. Not every project you engage in will focus on code quality, but working at a company where some projects can focus on quality is a tremendous joy and enriching experience, and am very thankful to my teammates who made this possible!</p>
<p>One of the best exercises I had this year was going through my PRs and consolidating all the comments by theme, which taught me as much about my own code as what other people think about code in general.</p>
<p>An important perspective when writing code, is understanding how that software will exist through time, what demands will be placed on it, and how the fundamental assumptions will inevitably change. A big lesson for me this year is learning that a system can start out well, but through product mis-alignment, tight time constraints, and feature expansion, it can become an irreplaceable web of sadness littered through your code base too costly to remove!</p>
<p>On a psychological note, through trial and error I realized I only have so many “high performance” hours in a week where you can be sustainably productive without lowering the quality of the hours you work. Some corporations have even found workers are even more productive with 3 day weeks versus 5! <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20191105011855/http://nypost.com/2019/11/04/microsoft-japans-3-day-weekends-boost-productivity-by-40/">source</a> I’m not saying we should go that far, but when you’re home all the time coding in a pandemic, balance is key to staying fresh and effective!</p>
<h2 id="haskell-observations">Haskell Observations</h2>
<p>Contributing to ghc is HARD!<br>
It’s a complex and old code base, and although there is plenty of documentation, it takes a ton of work to be able to understand ghc well enough to contribute at the level needed to fix bugs and implement new features. That said, there is a ton of documentation work that still needs to be done, and is pretty beginner friendly work!</p>
<p>Use Template Haskell to generate code only as a last resort! The available alternatives, including deriving instances, have grown rich with options over the past few years, and these alternatives are less likely to eat up your compiler time or make cross-compilation an herculean task! Quasiquoters are a notable exception to this, as are inserting filenames/git commits at compile time, the key is to use it sparingly!</p>
<p><a href="https://haskell.pl-a.net/">Haskell Planetarium</a> as a link aggregation has enough content to be readable everyday, and along with <a href="https://haskellweekly.news/">Haskell Weekly</a> are my <code>goto</code> sources of Haskell related content.</p>
<p>Next, and pretty obviously, <strong>you can use Haskell to deliver value in business</strong>. This is already established, but watching different teams write similar web services at their direction showed me that there is a lot of variety within the ecosystem.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, answers the following questions will vary from project to project, and asking them will get you oriented in a new project pretty quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which prelude is being used?<br>
</li>
<li>How are effects handled?<br>
</li>
<li>How are API routes defined?<br>
</li>
<li>How do you interact with the database and manage a transaction session?<br>
</li>
<li>How do you write an sql query?<br>
</li>
<li>What’s the nature of the “expression problem” for internal data types?<br>
</li>
<li>What is the strategy for manipulating internal objects, i.e.&nbsp;lens/generic lens?<br>
</li>
<li>How are log messages generated?<br>
</li>
<li>What’s the testing strategy, is a fuzziness generator used?<br>
</li>
<li>How do you run the tests locally, given the architecture?</li>
</ul>
<p>By the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expression_problem">Expression Problem</a> I mean which typeclasses are needed to be derived or defined, like <code>ToJSON</code> or serialization. I’d like to add that the overwhelming majority of effects I’ve seen have been handled using <a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/mtl">mtl</a> and/or <code>IO</code>, but we appear to be close on extensible effects, and the work done on <a href="https://github.com/hasura/eff">eff</a> looks promising!</p>
<h2 id="musings-on-type-level-programming">Musings On Type Level Programming</h2>
<p>A theme for this year for me was exploring the intersection between type level programming and good software engineering practices. It’s one thing to know Haskell, it’s another to write beautiful code that’s as easy to understand as it is to maintain. As a prior, my stance on new, complex Haskell features is to “write junior code”. However, given a sufficiently experienced team familiar with type level programming, the trade-offs of the features themselves can be evaluated per se…</p>
<h3 id="haskell-type-level-solutions-worth-their-weight">Haskell Type Level Solutions Worth Their Weight</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/squeal-postgresql">squeal</a>, takes a while to learn, but with generated schemas helping write some code, a deep embedding tied to the schema is very maintainable. A key aspect of getting this solution to work is to have a repeatable way to generate the same schema that’s used in production. Ours is (<a href="https://github.com/mwotton/squealgen">squealgen</a>), which works great!<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/generic-lens">generic-lens</a>. For a long time, I avoided lenses, but with <code>DuplicateRecordFields</code> and <code>OverloadedLabels</code> <code>generic-lens</code> provides some great utilities beyond lens/prism for manipulating structures that I’ve come to rely on.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/package/servant">servant</a> great for defining routes for clients/servers, and even the streaming stuff can work!<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://ghc.gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/doc/users_guide/exts/deriving_via.html">DerivingVia</a>, very useful way to extend newtypes and generic deriving, and gives you a way to write a lot of maintainable code in a few short lines.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="haskell-type-level-programming-ideas-ive-unsuccessfully-tried-to-apply-but-am-holding-out-hope-for">Haskell Type Level programming ideas I’ve unsuccessfully tried to apply, but am holding out hope for…</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Type level witnesses</strong>: although they did work for a specific problem, getting kind constraints to play nicely with associated libraries turned out harder than I imagined, and I’m not 100% convinced the added complexity if worth the effort.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>GADTs</strong>: Know the type for each individual data constructor? Sounds good! I just haven’t had a problem where this is exactly what I’ve needed.<br>
</li>
<li><strong>Existensial Types</strong>: There is a bug that prevents generic deriving from “just working” reasonably in the last situation I tried them, and I’d rather just use an alternative approach, like a smart constructor, over writing my own generic instance. <a href="https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/issues/10514">GHC bug report</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="build-systems">Build Systems</h2>
<p>I’m not sure what else to say here, other than build systems in Haskell leave something to be desired!<br>
Stack works, but doesn’t cache well, and there’s the dreaded <code>flat namespace error</code> and related errors that sometimes are most easily fixed by manually removing the offending library, or worst case removing your <code>.stack</code> directories.<br>
Alternatively, Nix is an efficient and robust build system, but is really complicated, and takes a non-trivial amount of time to learn and set up if you’re going to use that for your CI build system. I want to learn Nix and use it for personal projects, it’s just a question of priorities, and figuring out how to get it to work with <code>ghcid</code>.<br>
In 2021, I should really try <code>cabal</code> :)</p>
<h3 id="my-development-environment">My development environment</h3>
<p>The Haskell development environment has really improved over the last few years, and here’s the setup I eventually settled on:</p>
<ul>
<li>iTerm2 on MacOS, using <code>tmux</code> as a window/panel manager.<br>
</li>
<li><code>neovim</code> as my version of <code>vim</code> for writing code.<br>
</li>
<li><code>hasktags</code> to “jump to definition” with <code>vim</code> shortcuts. Not perfect with <code>OverladedLabels</code> within a large code base, but good enough!<br>
</li>
<li><code>hoogle</code> command line utility to search for polymorphic function types or package sources.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage.haskell.org/">Hackage</a> online to browse docs. (press ‘s’ on a package page to open a search prompt).<br>
</li>
<li>A variety of tools using <code>fzf</code> for searching within and for files, and browsing git diffs and commits.<br>
</li>
<li><a href="https://hackage-search.serokell.io/">Serokell’s Regex Hackage Search</a> which just came out, but something I think could be very useful for arbitrary searches over Hackage!<br>
</li>
<li><code>ghcid</code> is pretty amazing, and I’m not sure how I wrote Haskell without it! It gives fast incremental recompilation, and can be configured to run a test suite or bash command on completion.</li>

<p>The haskell development environment is getting better all the time, and although I’ve set up Haskell Language Server a few times for small side projects, I haven’t taken the time to try it on a larger code base, despite the extremely helpful project devs!</p>
<p>My ideal tool, would be something that consolidates the different search interfaces (hackage, regex on hackage, local search, jump to definition, et cetera), to create a utility that jumps to definition or docs given what’s in scope for a given module or even project.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p><span>03 Jan 2021</span></p><p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/generating_platonics_teaser.png" alt="Platonic solids in front of blurry C++ code"></p> <p>This is a short tutorial on generating polygonal surface meshes of the five <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid">Platonic solids</a> in C++. You can learn a few basics of working with meshes along the way. I’m using the <a href="https://www.pmp-library.org/">Polygon Mesh Processing Library</a> for implementation. The code is straightforward, so you can easily adapt it to another data structure or programming language.</p> <h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2> <p>My primary motivation for this article is very simple:</p> <ul> <li>You want to generate a mesh of a Platonic solid</li> <li>Here is some straightforward C++ code to do so</li> </ul> <p>Now why exactly would this be interesting? Well, having the possibility to generate a mesh with known properties is useful in many situations. Here are three examples:</p> <ol> <li>Generating example data for an algorithm you are developing</li> <li>Generating shapes in your application without shipping meshes</li> <li><a href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2018/09/11/unit-testing-geometric-algorithms.html">Unit testing geometric algorithms</a></li> </ol> <p>Generating simple shapes also is a canonical example for doing your first steps using a mesh library, a sort of “Hello, mesh!”. If you are new to working with meshes, this is a great starting point to get familiar with the basics.</p> <h2 id="bootstrapping">Bootstrapping</h2> <p>I’m using the <a href="https://www.pmp-library.org/">Polygon Mesh Processing Library</a> (PMP) as mesh data structure in this tutorial. However, any modern mesh data structure providing basic functions such as adding vertices and polygonal faces should be sufficient for this tutorial. Skip this section if you’re using another data structure.</p> <p>If you want to quickly visualize the resulting meshes, I recommend downloading and compiling the PMP <a href="https://github.com/pmp-library/pmp-template">project template</a>, which contains a ready-to-use mesh viewer. Just clone the repository:</p> <div><div><pre><code>git clone <span>--recursive</span> https://github.com/pmp-library/pmp-template.git
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Build the project:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>cd </span>pmp-template <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>mkdir </span>build <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span>cd </span>build <span>&amp;&amp;</span> cmake .. <span>&amp;&amp;</span> make
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Run the viewer:</p>  <p>During this tutorial, I’ll define a few functions to generate the different shapes. It’s easiest to add those functions to the <code>MyViewer</code> class and call them on a keyboard shortcut. Here’s how to do this:</p> <ul> <li>Find the <code>MyViewer::keyboard()</code> function in your favorite IDE</li> <li>Add a new case label such as <code>GLFW_KEY_G</code> to the <code>switch</code> statement</li> <li>Add the function you want to call</li> <li>Add a call to <code>update_mesh()</code> to update the viewer</li> <li>Re-compile and run <code>./myviewer</code>
</li> </ul> <p>That’s all you need to get started, so let’s go!</p> <h2 id="the-five-platonic-solids">The Five Platonic Solids</h2> <p>The Platonic solids are a set of well-known convex <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedron">polyhedra</a> with particular properties, e.g., all faces are of the same type, the faces are regular (all angles and sides are the same), and the same number of faces are incident to each vertex. In 3D space, there are only five polyhedra satisfying these criteria: The tetrahedron, hexahedron, octahedron, dodecahedron, and the icosahedron. Here they are, from left to right:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/platonic_solids.png" alt="The five Platonic solids"></p> <p>The Platonic solids date back to the time of the ancient Greeks, if not earlier. They played a key role in Plato’s philosophy, hence the name. If you are interested, see the Wikipedia <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platonic_solid">article</a> for more information.</p> <h2 id="the-tetrahedron">The Tetrahedron</h2> <p>Let’s begin with the simplest Platonic solid, the tetrahedron. Four vertices and four triangular faces, that’s all. Here’s the code:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>SurfaceMesh</span> <span>tetrahedron</span><span>()</span>

</code></pre></div></div> <p>The next shape in the series is the octahedron. You could do exactly the same as above and manually specify all vertex coordinates and face indices. However, this becomes tedious rather quickly.</p> <p>Instead, you can do something slightly more intelligent and exploit the fact that every convex polyhedron has a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_polyhedron">dual polyhedron</a>.</p> <h2 id="interlude-computing-the-dual-polyhedron">Interlude: Computing the Dual Polyhedron</h2> <p>The dual polyhedron is a bit like a twin—or maybe it is more like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde">Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde</a>? I’ll leave it up to you. Here’s the slightly more formal definition: For each convex polyhedron, there is a <em>dual polyhedron</em> with a face for each vertex and a vertex for each face of the original polyhedron. Here’s an illustration of the concept of duality:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/dual_w_zoom.png" alt="Illustration of the concept of a dual mesh."></p> <p>The original mesh is a triangle mesh of a sphere, edges shown in dark gray. The edges of the dual mesh are highlighted in teal. Each vertex of the dual mesh corresponds to a face in the original mesh; each vertex of the original mesh corresponds to a polygonal face in the dual mesh. Note that computing the dual also is a practical way to convert a triangle mesh into an general polygon mesh. Here is how you can compute the dual:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>dual</span><span>(</span><span>SurfaceMesh</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>mesh</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>

  <span>// swap old and new meshes, don't copy properties</span>
  <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>assign</span><span>(</span><span>tmp</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Admittedly, this code is a little more specific to the PMP library. I’m using the <code>centroid()</code> function to compute the center of a face. Here’s the definition:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>Point</span> <span>centroid</span><span>(</span><span>const</span> <span>SurfaceMesh</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>mesh</span><span>,</span> <span>Face</span> <span>f</span><span>)</span>

    <span>++</span><span>n</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
  <span>c</span> <span>/=</span> <span>n</span><span>;</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>c</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>I am also using the built-in property mechanism to attach data to mesh entities (<code>mesh.add_face_property...</code>). Here, I’m storing and retrieving the vertices added to the dual mesh. If you want to keep it simple, you can also use a <code>std::vector</code> for managing this information.</p> <p>I’m also using two frequently used operations when working with meshes:</p> <ol> <li>I’m using <em>iterators</em> to go through all mesh entities (faces, vertices)</li> <li>I’m using a <em>circulator</em> to traverse all faces <em>incident</em> to a vertex.</li> </ol> <p>The circulator is in the <code>for (auto f : mesh.faces(v))</code> part. If you are using a different data structure, you need to figure out how to do this for yourself. Check the API documentation of your library. Or just switch to PMP! <img title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"></p> <h2 id="the-octahedron">The Octahedron</h2> <p>With the new function to compute the dual mesh in place, we have all it takes to generate another Platonic solid. The octahedron is the dual polyhedron of the hexahedron, which we can already generate using the <code>hexahedron()</code> function. All that’s left is to combine the two:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>SurfaceMesh</span> <span>octahedron</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>auto</span> <span>mesh</span> <span>=</span> <span>hexahedron</span><span>();</span>
  <span>dual</span><span>(</span><span>mesh</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>mesh</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now that’s a function to my liking: Create something, do something, and return the result. As simple and clear as it gets. Comparing the original hexahedron and the dual octahedron shows that there is an issue, though: The dual mesh is much smaller and inside the original hexahedron.</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/oct_in_hex_300.png" alt="The dual octahedron contained in the original hexahedron"></p> <h2 id="normalizing-positions-on-the-unit-sphere">Normalizing Positions on the Unit Sphere</h2> <p>For the functions defined so far, I took care to compute the vertex coordinates in such a way that they are on the unit sphere. It would be nice to have the same property for the dual meshes as well. A simple solution is to project the vertices of the dual mesh back to the unit sphere. Here’s a function for doing exactly that:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>void</span> <span>project_to_unit_sphere</span><span>(</span><span>SurfaceMesh</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>mesh</span><span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span><span>auto</span> <span>v</span> <span>:</span> <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>vertices</span><span>())</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>p</span> <span>=</span> <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>);</span>
    <span>auto</span> <span>n</span> <span>=</span> <span>norm</span><span>(</span><span>p</span><span>);</span>
    <span>mesh</span><span>.</span><span>position</span><span>(</span><span>v</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>1.0</span> <span>/</span> <span>n</span><span>)</span> <span>*</span> <span>p</span><span>;</span>
  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Now let’s use this in our function generating the octahedron:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>SurfaceMesh</span> <span>octahedron</span><span>()</span>
<span>{</span>
  <span>auto</span> <span>mesh</span> <span>=</span> <span>hexahedron</span><span>();</span>
  <span>dual</span><span>(</span><span>mesh</span><span>);</span>
  <span>project_to_unit_sphere</span><span>(</span><span>mesh</span><span>);</span>
  <span>return</span> <span>mesh</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>And this is what the result looks like:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/oct_hex_sphere.png" alt="Octahedron and hexahedron within a sphere"></p> <p>Much better. The two shapes have all their points nicely aligned on the unit sphere, just as we want them to be.</p> <h2 id="icosahedron-and-dodecahedron">Icosahedron and Dodecahedron</h2> <p>Finally, let’s tackle the remaining two polyhedra, icosahedron and dodecahedron. The two are dual to another, so we only need to generate one of them by hand and then compute the other one using the <code>dual()</code> function. I’m choosing the icosahedron for the manual implementation:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>SurfaceMesh</span> <span>icosahedron</span><span>()</span>

Megaprojects and marketplaces.]</p> <p><strong>The Internet is a galaxy of networks.</strong> Airbnb, Wish, Doordash, Uber, and others are all just networks. Networks have existed for a very long time (from the East India Trading Company to UPS), and the Internet is the latest platform for them.</p> <p>Networks are often started by a particular mercantile energy. Think of your typical souk operator: a swashbuckling, extroverted shop owner. Not an introverted technologist.</p> <p><strong>The introvert builds, the extravert operates</strong>. The personality of the platform inventor (trains, airplanes, ethernet, satellites) is different from the operator: The Wright Brothers are very different people from Michael O’Leary.</p> <p>In the early days, operating companies are hybrid cultures as only people who know how to operate on platforms are the locals. Early operators of railroads were friendly with the Vanderbilts; early creators of Internet platforms hail from Silicon Valley.</p> <p><strong>California was a psychometric hybrid</strong>. Networks are chaotic, have aggressive performance-driven cultures, suffer tension with employee activism (with Rockefeller it was unions; with Zuckerberg it’s social justice), and are very competitive. Travis Kalanick is a prototypical network-operator, but Uber was a hybrid culture with too much of the California gene that didn’t tolerate his Viking leadership.</p> <p>Silicon Valley created the latest network-platform, but it might not have the perfect culture to operate it.</p> <p>Maybe things split:</p> <p><strong>1. Operator Cultures: Miami (London/NY/Berlin/etc)</strong>. Miami is a very extroverted city. It attracts extroverts. Many think that this energy, combined with ludicrous amounts of partying, mean it won’t spawn serious startups. While I don’t think Miami will spawn the next TCP/IP, someone might start the next Uber there. The company won’t write much code, will not become known for technical excellence, and that’s fine! Once the railroad is built you don’t need to understand locomotion to become an oil baron.</p> <p>It’s like Hollywood: LA has the actors, but the pipes are built in Los Gatos by Netflix.</p> <p><strong>2. Infrastructure Culture: California</strong>. Silicon Valley’s culture is a kind of spiritual religion – one of technological progress. Founders often don’t start their company for money; they start it because it seems cool. Because it seems like a neat idea. From UNIX to ibuprofen, the dreamy pursuit of odd ideas with no immediate financial focus has lead to our greatest scientific discoveries and human achievement. This is the power of California.[1]</p> <p>While Miami can be the city of network operators, California (and Texas) feel like the home of Megaprojects. Where the next platforms are built. The Internet, VR, satellites, space elevators, rockets, etc. These are things you build for the spirit. Not because it’ll make a quick buck.</p> <p><strong>San Francisco</strong>. San Francisco might never return. While the Bay Area is incredible, SF is a deteriorating product. Like a bad gym, Covid expired the credit card, and customers are realizing – heck – it’s not worth renewing my membership.</p> <p>In 2021 and beyond, I imagine people will diffuse to the Bay Area. Just like things were in 2008. Palo Alto, Mountain View, Sonoma, etc. The decade-long mismanagement of SF may be viewed as one of the most squandered opportunities of the modern era.</p> <p><strong>In closing,</strong> I imagine California will remain home for the Megaprojects and other cities like Miami can become generators of new networks. Both highly lucrative – Google and Uber are fine companies.</p> <hr> <p>[1] I’ve always wondered if feelings of spirituality and connection to Earth tend to form in societies with high-contrast scenery and altitude. Miami has none of this and California is abundant in it.</p> </article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This technique is a human modification of the Conboys' mouse experiments.</p><div>
																
								
								
<p>We interviewed <a href="https://rlegroup.net/rle_about">a group of Russian biohackers</a> who performed a plasma dilution experiment on themselves<b>.</b> This experiment, the first of its kind, was based on previous mouse studies by Drs. Irina and Michael Conboy.</p>
<p>Some molecules, while essential for various body functions, can be harmful when overproduced. Inflammatory cytokines, such as transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF-ß1), interleukin 6 (IL6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) are good examples. The concentration of these cytokines in our blood rises with age, provoking inflammaging, the chronic inflammation that is associated with aging. It has been long speculated that reducing the harmful molecules in circulation can attenuate aging.</p>

<p>Back in 2005, Drs. <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/profile/irina-conboy/">Irina</a> and Michael Conboy created a furor with their research on parabiosis, which links two vascular systems together. The Conboys connected the vascular systems of young and old mice and showed that as a result of the blood exchange, old mice became younger and vice versa [1]. This discovery spurred a flurry of research activity; for instance, earlier this year,<a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/blood-factors-reverse-epigenetic-age-by-half-in-rats/"> we reported on some highly promising results</a> of adding a cocktail of young blood factors to the bloodstreams of aging mice. However, the Conboys have always maintained that it is what we take out of the bloodstream that matters more. A few months ago, they showed that mere dilution of blood plasma with saline can produce a considerable rejuvenating effect (read<a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/diluting-blood-plasma-rejuvenates-old-mice/"> our June interview with them</a>). Later, in November, <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/diluting-aged-blood-rejuvenates-old-brains/">they published another paper</a> that demonstrated restoration of cognitive functions following plasma dilution.</p>
<p>However, all this research has been done on mice, which led a small group of Russian biohackers to take matters in their own hands. Biohacking is a form of citizen science: do-it-yourself biology experiments. For biohackers focused on longevity, this includes performing experimental treatments (often on themselves) or repurposing existing treatments to improve health and, hopefully, wind back biological age.</p>
<p>The group’s scientific advisor, <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/profile/alexander-fedintsev/">Alexander Fedintsev</a> (<a href="https://www.lifespan.io/news/a-new-hallmark-of-aging-proposed/">read our interview with him</a>) devised a protocol for plasma dilution in humans and a panel of biomarkers to watch. Then, following some logistical wizardry, the procedure was performed on two volunteers. Though not a scientific study per se, this experiment produced interesting, overall positive, results that can potentially influence and guide further research. Our interviewees think that biohacking, when done right, may become an important factor in the longevity field.</p>
<p><b>Alexander Fedintsev (scientific advisor)</b><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.lifespan.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Alexander-Fedintsev_avatar-225x225-1.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="225" srcset="https://www.lifespan.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Alexander-Fedintsev_avatar-225x225-1.jpg 225w, https://www.lifespan.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Alexander-Fedintsev_avatar-225x225-1-150x150.jpg 150w, https://www.lifespan.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Alexander-Fedintsev_avatar-225x225-1-45x45.jpg 45w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px"></p>
<p><b>How did your group first get interested in the idea of plasma dilution? I understand that Irina Conboy’s work had a certain influence?</b></p>

<p>Not just influence. It played a central role. The Conboys’ study was published in May. It showed that simple plasma dilution can recapitulate most of the benefits of parabiosis. The original parabiosis results hinted on the existence of certain systemic factors of aging and at the possibility of its reversal. This recent study made the procedure easier and eliminated ethical controversies. The procedure is almost similar to donating blood plasma. Only the liquid fraction is drawn. It does not contain blood cells, such as erythrocytes, leukocytes, and thrombocytes – just the liquid part with signaling molecules dissolved in it. So, the Conboys drew half of the plasma from their mice and replaced it with normal saline and some albumin. Albumin is an important transport protein, and they probably thought that extracting that much albumin from the bloodstream can be harmful, so they wanted to replenish it. This simple procedure yielded some interesting results: it triggered muscle regeneration in mice, liver regeneration in older animals, and improved neurogenesis. Recently, in late November, I think, another study was published that showed some real cognitive improvement following this procedure. So, now we have some serious proof that blood contains signaling molecules that harm the organism, but there is no data on whether this procedure actually prolongs lifespan. I think there is a reason for it. It is highly unlikely that this procedure results in any meaningful life extension. I think most of the effect is on healthspan rather than on lifespan. It is still good news, since we currently have very few ways to extend healthspan.</p>
<p><b>Why did you decide to participate in this small-scale experiment on humans?</b></p>
<p>Our team has existed for some time now. It is a small community of biohackers. It seemed like a great way to quickly test this intervention, get some results fast, and tell people about it.</p>
<p><b>What was your role?</b></p>
<p>I designed the experiment, developed the biomarker panel that we used, and worked on the logistics on how to make it all happen considering our modest means. We could not just follow the Conboys’ mouse study protocol, so we found a way to adapt it to a human experiment in order to do something very close to what the Conboys did.</p>
<p><b>What kind of problems did you encounter while working on the protocol?</b></p>
<p>The first problem that made us delay the experiment for six months was the pandemic. We could have done it sooner, the experiment being so simple. The second problem was that current medical protocols for plasma dilution in humans limit the amount of plasma that can be drawn, so it had to be done in several sittings. We had to calculate how many times we needed to draw plasma so that, in total, about half of the plasma would be replaced. Then, we had to figure out how to inject albumin. The medics who drew the plasma refused to do it, so albumin had to be injected immediately after the plasma donation by a different doctor. Then, there was the development of the biomarker panel – we had to figure out what to look at and at which day since the experiment.</p>
<p><b>How did you choose the tests for the panel?</b></p>
<p>It would have been interesting to look at cognitive and muscular markers, but both our participants were too young: 50-60 years old. They probably do not have sarcopenia or cognitive decline yet, so there was no way for us to measure it. We chose different biomarkers, such as liver function – both of our participants had had some abnormalities in their liver biomarkers. We wanted to check kidney function because it declines with age. We checked the immune system, because as we age, the number of naïve T cells declines, and these are indispensable for fighting new infections. Immunosenescence is a hot topic in times of COVID. Hematopoietic cell aging is characterized by a shift towards myeloid progenitors. We looked at the ratio of neutrophils and lymphocytes, how it changed. Cholesterol is another important marker in the lipid profile of blood. We did a very comprehensive lipid profile that included a rare biomarker that many labs do not check for – oxidized low-density lipoproteins (Ox-LDL). I can say that this marker plummeted all the way down to its normal level in one participant that had it elevated prior to the procedure. We also checked for various hormones, including insulin-like growth factor (IGF), that are related to aging and lifespan, and many other markers, including biochemical ones, such as urea and uric acid, along with oxidative stress markers, such as lipid peroxidation products and glutathione. Contrary to epigenetic clocks, these markers can be clinically interpreted.</p>
<p><b>Do you plan to publish the results, maybe as a case study?</b></p>

<p>We have all the data published as a Google spreadsheet on our website so that researchers can see it. We do not plan to publish an article. First, I am convinced that soon we will have full-scale clinical trials of this method, maybe by the Conboys, and there is something in the works here in Russia as well. I do not know how valuable our data is, considering our sample size was just two people. We just wanted to see whether it was possible to arrange such an intervention in humans using the means we had at our disposal, and whether it would do any good. Now we know it actually did some good, in terms of the number of naïve T-cells, levels of oxidized LDL. The drop in Ox-LDL levels was probably due not simply to dilution but to some deeper processes, because in one participant, these levels declined, while in the other they went up from an originally low level. So, in both participants, LDL levels normalized and stayed normal for at least two weeks. Liver markers improved by a lot, and the myelocyte/lymphocyte ratio improved. There were some controversial results, such as one participant having insulin levels decline four-fold but not the other one.</p>
<p><b>Seems like we are looking at an optimization of certain parameters rather than just up- or downregulation.</b></p>
<p>Yes, the shift sometimes happened in opposite directions. It contradicts the hypothesis that all this procedure does is plasma dilution. It is important to add that we included some inflammation markers, such as C-reactive protein and IL-6. Most of these markers went down in both participants, which points to a decline in systemic inflammation. These markers are very important from the standpoint of aging.</p>
<p><b>Which results were unexpected?</b></p>
<p>For instance, cholesterol went up in one of the volunteers. We expected it to go down in both participants because of the dilution. Probably, cholesterol levels can go back to normal faster than we thought. Also, the insulin levels. We also did not quite anticipate the 40% surge in the number of naïve T cells. The ratio between naïve T-cells and memory T-cells went up too – by as much as 30%.</p>
<p><b>Do you have an explanation for it?</b></p>
<p>Not yet, and I would wait for more data before hypothesizing. We only had two participants, it could be random.</p>
<p><b>Do you plan to expand the project? Maybe recruiting new participants?</b></p>
<p>We would like to have more people tested, but we do not plan to turn it into a large study. …</p></div></div>

            <p>While paragraphs are usually represented in visual media by blocks of text that are physically separated from adjacent blocks through blank lines, a style sheet or user agent would be equally justified in presenting paragraph breaks in a different manner, for instance using inline pilcrows.</p>

            <!-- The main element -->
            <p>The main element must not appear as a descendant of the section element. It cannot appear here so it has been moved to wrap all the content.</p>

            <!-- The div element -->
            <p>The <code>div</code> element has no special meaning at all. It represents its children. It can be used with the <code>class</code>, <code>lang</code>, and <code>title</code> attributes to mark up semantics common to a group of consecutive elements. It can also be used in a <code>dl</code> element, wrapping groups of <code>dt</code> and <code>dd</code> elements.</p>

<h3><em>Contrary to earlier concerns, a UNIGE study has shown that people who met their partners on dating applications have often stronger long-term relationship goals, and that these new ways of meeting people encourage socio-educational and geographical mixing.</em></h3>

<div><p><strong>Mobile apps have revolutionised the way people meet in Switzerland and elsewhere in recent years. Unlike traditional dating sites, these apps do not feature detailed user profiles but are largely based on rating photos using a swipe review system. As dating apps escalated in popularity, so has criticism about them encouraging casual dating only, threatening the existence of long-term commitment, and possibly damaging the quality of intimacy. There is no scientific evidence, however, to validate these claims. A study by the University of Geneva (UNIGE), Switzerland, provides a wealth of information about couples who met through dating apps, drawing on data from a 2018 Swiss survey. The results, published in the journal <em>PLOS ONE</em>, indicate that app-formed couples have stronger cohabitation intentions than couples who meet in a non-digital environment. What is more, women who found their partner through a dating app have stronger desires and intentions to have children than those who found their partner offline. Despite fears concerning a deterioration in the quality of relationships, partners who met on dating apps express the same level of satisfaction about their relationship as others. Last but not least, the study shows that these apps play an important role in modifying the composition of couples by allowing for more educationally diverse and geographically distant couples.</strong></p><p>The meteoric rise of romantic encounters on the internet is on its way of becoming the leading place where couples are formed in Switzerland, on a par with meeting via friends. “The Internet is profoundly transforming the dynamics of how people meet,” confirms Gina Potarca, a researcher at the Institute of Demography and Socioeconomics in UNIGE’s Faculty of Social Sciences, and holder of an Ambizione research grant awarded by the Swiss National Science Foundation to study the effects of digital ways of communicating on marriage formation and sorting. “It provides an unprecedented abundance of meeting opportunities, and involves minimal effort and no third-party intervention.” These new dating technologies include the smartphone apps like Tinder or Grindr, where users select partners by browsing and swiping on pictures. These apps, however, have raised fears: “Large parts of the media claim they have a negative impact on the quality of relationships since they render people incapable of investing in an exclusive or long-term relationship. Up to now, though, there has been no evidence to prove this is the case,” continues Dr Potarca.</p></div>
<p><br><strong>Facilitated encounters</strong></p>
<p>The Geneva-based researcher decided to investigate couples’ intentions to start a family, their relationship satisfaction and individual well-being, as well as to assess couple composition. Dr Potarca used a 2018 family survey by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office. The analysis presented in this study looks at a sub-sample of 3,235 people over the age of 18 who were in a relationship and who had met their partner in the last decade. <br>Dr Potarca found that dating websites – the digital tools for meeting partners that preceded apps – mainly attracted people over the age of 40 and / or divorcees who are looking for romance. “By eliminating lengthy questionnaires, self-descriptions, and personality tests that users of dating websites typically need to fill in to create a profile, dating apps are much easier to use. This normalized the act of dating online, and opened up use among younger categories of the population.”</p>
<p><br><strong>Searching for a lasting relationship</strong></p>
<p>Dr Potarca sought to find out whether couples who met on dating apps had different intentions to form a family. The results show that couples that formed after meeting on an app were more motivated by the idea of cohabiting than others. “The study doesn’t say whether their final intention was to live together for the long- or short-term, but given that there’s no difference in the intention to marry, and that marriage is still a central institution in Switzerland, some of these couples likely see cohabitation as a trial period prior to marriage. It’s a pragmatic approach in a country where the divorce rate is consistently around 40%.” In addition, women in couples that formed through dating apps mentioned wanting and planning to have a child in the near future, more so than with any other way of meeting.</p>
<p>But what do couples who met in this way think about the quality of their relationship? The study shows that, regardless of meeting context, couples are equally satisfied with their lives and the quality of their relationship.</p>
<p><br><strong>Couples with a diverse socio-educational profile</strong></p>
<div><p>The study highlights a final aspect. Dating apps encourage a mixing of different levels of education, especially between high-educated women and lower educated men. Partners having more diversified socio-educational profiles “may have to do with selection methods that focus mainly on the visual,” says the researcher. Since users can easily connect with partners in their immediate region (but also in other spaces as they move around), the apps make it easier to meet people more than 30 minutes away – leading to an increase in long-distance relationships. <br>“Knowing that dating apps have likely become even more popular during this year’s periods of lockdown and social distancing, it is reassuring to dismiss alarming concerns about the long-term effects of using these tools,” concludes Dr Potarca. </p></div>							<span> December 30, 2020</span>

        <h2 id="the-paradox">The paradox</h2>

<p>Stein’s paradox is among the most surprising results in statistics.  The basic
idea is easily stated, but it is difficult to understand how it could possibly
be true.  The premise is this: suppose that I have a Gaussian distribution with
a variance of unity and some mean which I don’t tell you.  I then draw a single
sample from this distribution, give it to you, and ask you to guess the mean.
What do you do?  Well, you don’t have a lot of information to go on here, so
you just guess that the mean is the number I gave you.  This is a good guess!
(We will make the notion of a “good guess” a little more precise later on.)</p>

<p>No big surprise there.  Now we play again, but this time, my distribution is a
<em>two</em>-dimensional Gaussian.  The covariance is the identity matrix (so this is
equivalent to sampling from two independent one-dimensional Gaussians).  But
again I have not told you the mean (which is now a two-dimensional vector).
Once more I draw a single sample from the distribution, hand it over to you,
and ask you to guess the mean.  You simply guess that the mean is the sample I
have given you.  Once more you have guessed well!</p>

<p>Now we do the same thing in three dimensions.  I draw a single sample, hand it
over to you, and ask you to guess the mean.  Just as before, you guess that the
mean is the sample I gave you.  But this is no longer a good guess!  Stein’s
paradox is that if we play this game in three dimensions or more, a better
guess is to say that the mean is this:</p>

\[\hat{\mu} = \textrm{ReLU} \left(1 - \frac{D - 2}{|\mathbf{x}|^2} \right)
\mathbf{x},\]

<p>where \(D\) is the dimensionality of the Gaussian, and \(\mathbf{x}\) is the
sample drawn from the distribution.  This is the so-called “James-Stein
estimator.”</p>

<p>Who would have thought!  What is going on here?</p>

<h2 id="what-makes-a-guess-good">What makes a guess good?</h2>

<p>Before we go on, we should clarify exactly what we mean by a “good guess.”  We
are trying to do what is called “parameter estimation” in statistics — based
on a sample from a distribution, we want to infer some underlying parameter (or
parameters) of the distribution.  (In this case the parameter we are interested
in is the mean.)  In order to quantify how good or bad our estimate is we
choose a function called a “loss function.”  There is some freedom in choosing
a loss function, but the mean squared error is a common choice and has a lot of
valuable properties.  Stein’s paradox assumes that we are using the mean
squared error.  So if we guess that the mean is \(\hat{\mu}\) and the true
value of the mean is \(\mu\), then the loss is</p>

\[\mathcal{L} = |\hat{\mu} - \mu|^2.\]

<p>Now, of course, we need some rule to go from the sample \(\mathbf{x}\) to the
estimate \(\hat{\mu}\).  This rule is just a function of some kind, say,
\(f(\mathbf{x})\).  This function has the special name of an “estimator.”  We
can choose whatever function we want here.  Our original guess was to just use
\(f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x}\).  But another choice here is to say
\(f(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{x} + 7\), or \(f(\mathbf{x}) = \sin(\mathbf{x}) /
\mathbf{x}^{71}\), or even just \(f(\mathbf{x}) = 31\).  It doesn’t take much
imagination to see that there are an infinite number of possible choices.  But
presumably some of these choices are better than others.  How do we know which
ones are good?</p>

<p>Statisticians use the concept of <em>risk</em> for this purpose.  Risk is simply the
expected value of your loss function.  One thing that can be a little confusing
is that the risk is a function of <em>both</em> your choice of estimator <em>and</em> the
true value of the parameter itself.  So in the original game where you’re
guessing the mean of a one-dimensional Gaussian, the risk will be a function of
whatever rule you decide to use and the actual, unknown value of the mean.</p>

<p>The fact that the risk is a function of the true value of the parameter makes
things a little tricky.  If you’re trying to decide between two estimators, you
might find that one estimator works better for certain values that the
parameter can take, and the other works better for others.  As a dumb example,
let’s go back to guessing the mean of a one-dimensional Gaussian.  Our original
estimator was \(\hat{\mu} = x\).  But another, perfectly valid, estimator is
\(\hat{\mu} = 7\).  In other words we ignore the sample entirely and say that
the mean is 7 no matter what.  Generally this doesn’t seem like a smart thing
to do.  But if the mean turns out to actually be pretty close to 7, on average
this will be the better guess!  Specifically, the risk of our initial estimator
is</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{R}_{x} &amp; = &amp; \mathbb{E} \left[ \left(x - \mu \right)^2 \right] \\
&amp; = &amp; \int (x - \mu)^2 e^{-(x-\mu)^2 / 2} \, dx \\
&amp; = &amp; 1.
\end{eqnarray}\]

<p>And the risk on our second, dumb estimator is</p>

\[\begin{eqnarray}
\mathcal{R}_{\textrm{dumb}} &amp; = &amp; \mathbb{E} \left[ \left(7 - \mu\right)^2 
\right] \\
&amp; = &amp; \int (7 - \mu)^2 e^{-(x - \mu)^2 / 2} \, dx \\
&amp; = &amp; (7 - \mu)^2.
\end{eqnarray}\]

<p>As long as the true mean, \(\mu\), happens to be between 6 and 8, the dumb
estimator of just saying 7 actually has lower risk!</p>

<p>Based on this example it might seem that we’re stuck.  Since we don’t know the
true value of the mean, we can’t generally say if one estimator is better than
another.  And indeed this is often the case.  But there are certain situations
where this is not true.  If we have two estimators and one of them has a lower
risk <em>for any possible value the parameter can take</em>, we can say that one is
definitively better than the other.  In statistical parlance, we say that the
worse estimator is “inadmissable.”</p>

<p>In more precise terms, Stein’s paradox states that in three dimensions or more,
the naive estimator (just guessing that the mean is \(\mathbf{x}\)) is
inadmissable because the risk of the James-Stein estimator is lower for any
possible mean I could choose.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-james-stein-estimator-doing">What is the James-Stein estimator doing?</h2>

<p>Before we can understand <em>why</em> the James-Stein estimator gives you a better
guess than the naive estimator \(\textbf{x}\), we should understand <em>what</em>
exactly it’s doing.  The idea is that we take the naive guess \(\textbf{x}\)
and then we scale it towards the origin by some amount.  The factor by which we
scale it is:</p>

\[\textrm{ReLU}\left(1 - \frac{D - 2}{| \textbf{x}|^2} \right).\]

<p>The ReLU function simply takes the maximum of its argument and zero, so this
scale factor will be either positive or zero.  Let’s suppose that it’s
positive.  In this case we scale it towards the origin more if the magnitude of
the sample is smaller and less if it is lower.  In the limit of \(|\textbf{x}|
\to \infty\) we don’t change it at all and our guess reduces to the naive
estimator \(\textbf{x}\).</p>

<p>In the other limit, if \(|\textbf{x}|\) is very small, then the ReLU function
will kick in and just set the scale factor to zero.  Hence anytime we get a
sufficiently small sample we throw it out and just guess that the mean is zero
instead.  And all else being equal we will shrink our estimate more in higher
dimensional spaces than in lower dimensional spaces.</p>

<p>So that is what the James-Stein estimator is doing.  Why does it work?  Before
we can answer that we need to take a quick detour.</p>

<h2 id="samples-in-high-dimensional-spaces">Samples in high dimensional spaces</h2>

<p>High dimensional spaces are counterintuitive.  One of the counteruintitive
properties of high dimensional distributions is this: a sample from a symmetric
high dimensional distirbution is highly likely to be further from the origin
than the mean.  Specifically, for an isotropic \(D\)-dimensional Gaussian, the
difference between the average distance to a sample and the distance to the
mean grows as \(\sim\)\(\sqrt{D}\).</p>

<p>It’s a little strange to put it this way, but isn’t so surprising with a little
bit of thought.  Even in two dimensions we can see that this is the case just
by drawing it:</p>

<p><img src="https://joe-antognini.github.io/assets/posts/steins-paradox/circle-origin.png"></p>

<p>The shaded area of the circle is less than half the area, so we are less likely
to choose a sample closer to the origin than the mean.  What perhaps makes this
counterintuitive is that in two dimensions a fairly large fraction of the
circle is still shaded.  But as the dimensionality increases, this fraction
decreases exponentially.  Once the dimensionality is even moderately large we
are highly unlikely to sample a point in this shaded region.</p>

<p>One caveat here is that this effect decreases the larger the mean is.  You can
imagine that as we move the circle further away from the origin, the shaded
fraction gets closer and closer to ½.  So long as the mean is sufficiently
large, the probability of sampling a point closer to the origin than the mean
can be close to ½ even in high dimensional spaces; it just requires a very
large mean.  We can start to see here the connection to the James-Stein
estimator, which also gets very close to the naive estimator \(\mathbf{x}\) as
the mean (and hence \(|\mathbf{x}|\)) gets very large.</p>

<p>What we are doing by shrinking the estimate towards the origin is correcting
for the tendency of the typical sample to be slightly further away from the
origin than the mean.  This correction allows us to reduce the overall risk of
the estimate. [<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6">1</a></sup>]</p>

<h2 id="how-arbitrary-is-the-origin-really">How arbitrary is the origin, really?</h2>

<p>Stein’s paradox is particularly strange because there are actually two
counterintuitive things going on:</p>

<ol>
  <li>The origin is arbitrary, so why does moving your estimate towards the origin
help?</li>
  <li>Why does this not work in one or two dimensions?</li>
</ol>

<p>Let’s take a look at the first of these.  A central principle in physics is
that of relativity — coordinate systems are arbitrary, so the laws of physics
must be valid in all of them.  Surely this is also true in statistics as well.
We can choose the origin to be wherever we like, so it cannot contain any
information.  But this sensible assertion is false.  Statistics is not physics.</p>

<p>If we truly had no information about the mean, what value would the sample
have?  If it could really be <em>anything</em> then presumably its value would …</p></article></section></div></div>

<p>This Christmas, a family member sent me a <span>URL</span> to a family Zoom call. However, they didn’t send me a direct link to Zoom. Instead, they sent me a<span></span> <span>“</span>tinyurl.com” link.</p>
<p>When I clicked on the link, my <span>URL</span> bar flashed an intermediate domain that was neither Zoom nor TinyURL. Later, I used cURL to see where this <span>URL</span> was really going.</p>
<pre><code>$ curl -v https://tinyurl.com/examplezoom

<p>
<em>(all <span>HTTP</span> responses abridged for clarity)</em>
</p>
<p>Sure enough, the redirect wasn’t clean at all. TinyURL was first sending me to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VigLink" target="_blank">VigLink</a><a href="#footnote-1WA7" id="ref-1WA7"><sup>1</sup></a>. VigLink is an advertising (tracking) company that specializes in affiliate marketing.</p>
<p>Following the redirect in cURL reveals another unsavory fact. VigLink <em>sets cookies</em> before they send me to the intended destination on Zoom.</p>

<p>These cookies give them the ability<a href="#footnote-2WA7" id="ref-2WA7"><sup>2</sup></a> to track me across every other site that uses their advertising tech. Who knows what VigLink is doing with my data, but I personally wouldn’t trust an advertising company to keep my browsing history to themselves.</p>

<p>2.3x faster than reference counting, unoptimized!</p>

<p>
<b>Generational references</b> are a new memory management technique that's easy, deterministic, and <i>very</i> fast.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
This technique is the first ingredient in Vale's final <a href="https://vale.dev/blog/hybrid-generational-memory">hybrid-generational memory</a> design, which is even faster. Our eventual goal is to be as fast as Rust, and perhaps even as fast as C++.
</p>
<p>
This article explains how generational references work, how they compare to reference counting, and what makes it all so fast. <a href="#note0" data-noteid="0">0</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="built-on-single-ownership">
 Built on Single Ownership</h2>
<p>
Recall that in Vale, an object is freed when its <b>owning reference</b> goes out of scope. An object always has exactly one owning reference pointing to it. <a href="#note1" data-noteid="1">1</a>
</p>
<p>
We can have as many <b>non-owning</b> references as we want.
</p>
<p>
Our goal here is to make it so when we dereference a non-owning reference, the program safely halts (or does something else <a href="#note2" data-noteid="2">2</a>) instead of triggering memory unsafety. <a href="#note3" data-noteid="3">3</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
To keep the language simple and the learning curve easy, we explicitly don't want to force a borrow checker on the user. However, we'd like an approach that has as little <a href="https://vale.dev/blog/hybrid-generational-memory#afterword-how-might-it-compare-to-rust">run-time overhead</a> as the borrow checker.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h2 id="generational-malloc-and-the-sacred-integer">
 Generational Malloc and the Sacred Integer</h2>
<p>
Generational references use <b>generational malloc</b>, which is like regular malloc, except at the top of every allocation is a <b>generation number</b>, which tracks how many objects have previously been at this memory location.
</p>
<p>
One could also think of it as describing "I am the <b>n</b>th inhabitant of this memory location".
</p>
<p>
Freeing an object will increment its generation number. Nobody else ever modifies it.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Later on, we use this number to see if a particular object is still alive, explained further below.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational malloc would normally be an adjustment to mimalloc or jemalloc, but we can simulate it with our own <span>genMalloc</span> and <span>genFree</span> functions:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<span>genFree</span> increments the generation number, and instead of calling <span>free</span> <a href="#note4" data-noteid="4">4</a><a href="#note5" data-noteid="5">5</a>, remembers the allocation in a free-list. There's a free-list for every size class (16b, 24b, 32b, &lt;=48b, &lt;=64b, &lt;=128b, etc).
</li>
<li>
<span>genMalloc</span> pulls from a free-list if possible. If it's empty, it calls <span>malloc</span> and initializes the generation number to 1.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can find our experimental implementation in <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a>.

 Vale has three release modes:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Resilient mode, which is fast and memory safe; it will halt the program when we try to dereference a freed object.
</li>
<li>
Assist mode, for development, to detect potential problems even earlier.
</li>
<li>
Unsafe mode, which turns off all safety.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Resilient mode uses hybrid-generational memory.
</p>

 Our experimental implementation doesn't release memory back to the OS until exit, but when a page is empty, the final version will release the page back to the operating system and map its virtual memory to a read-only page containing all 0xFF.

 Generational Reference: More than just a pointer!</h2>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Vale's references are <b>generational references</b>. A generational reference has two things:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
A pointer to the object.
</li>
<li>
A "target generation" integer.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
To create a reference to an object, we get its allocation's generation number, and include it in the reference.
</p>

<h3 id="dereferencing">
 Dereferencing</h3>

</section>
<section>
<p>
To dereference a generational reference, we do a "liveness check" to see whether the allocation's generation number <b>still matches</b> our reference's target generation. <a href="#note6" data-noteid="6">6</a>
</p>
<p>
This prevents use-after-free problems, and makes Vale completely memory safe.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
It's as if the reference is saying:
</p>
<p><b>"Hello! I'm looking for the 11th inhabitant of this house, are they still around?"</b>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
and the person who opens the door says:
</p>
<p><b>"No, sorry, I'm the 12th inhabitant of this house, the 11th inhabitant is no more."</b> <a href="#note7" data-noteid="7">7</a>
</p>

</p>
<p><b>"Yes! That is me. Which of my fields would you like to access?"</b>

Generational references are only the first steps towards hybrid-generational memory, but we decided to run some early experiments to see how it compares to existing memory models.
</p>
<p>
For this experiment, we benchmarked <a href="#note8" data-noteid="8">8</a> <a href="#note9" data-noteid="9">9</a> three flavors of Vale:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Unsafe</b>, with no memory safety, the equivalent of C++ (minus caveats, see below!)
</li>
<li>
<b>RC</b>, where we use naive reference counting for all our objects.
</li>
<li>
<b>GM</b>, which uses generational references.
</li>
</ul>

 Here, we benchmarked against other flavors of Vale, to isolate the differences between unsafe, reference-counting, and generational references.
</p>
<p>
Once we implement full hybrid-generational memory, we'll be benchmarking against C++ and Rust, stay tuned!

<p>
Generational references have only 10.84% overhead, <b>less than half the cost of reference counting!</b> These are very promising results, and suggest that full hybrid-generational memory could be incredibly fast.

Try it out! In the Vale release, you can find a benchmark folder with scripts to run the benchmarks. You can find the source code for the various approaches <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/tree/master/Midas/src/c-compiler/region">here</a> (feel free to swing by the <a href="https://discord.gg/SNB8yGH">discord server</a> and we can point you to the right files).

<b>Note these caveats!</b> To isolate the difference between generational references and the other approaches:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
In all flavors, we only allocate objects on the heap, except for primitives. Future versions will add stack allocations.
</li>
<li>
We used <a href="https://github.com/ValeLang/Vale/blob/master/Midas/src/builtins/genHeap.c">genHeap.c</a> for all versions, though only GM ever touches the generation number, the other versions ignore it. Future versions will integrate generational malloc into jemalloc or mimalloc directly.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Once we address these limitations, we can get more precise benchmarks against the other approaches.

<h2 id="why-is-this-so-fast">
 Why is this so fast?</h2>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational references are much easier for the CPU to handle than reference-counted references, because:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Generational references have no aliasing/dealiasing overhead, just on dereference.
</li>
<li>
Generational references cause less cache misses.
</li>
<li>
Liveness checks' branching is easier to predict than RC decrements' branching.
</li>
</ul>

</section>
<section>
<p>
We explain these two differences more below.
</p>

      <div>
  
<section>
<h3 id="no-aliasing-costs">
 No Aliasing Costs</h3>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Reference counting is costly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Whenever we "alias" (make a new reference to an object), we have to dereference the object to increment its counter.
</li>
<li>
Whenever we "dealias" (throw away a reference), we have to:
</li>
<ul>
<li>
Dereference the object to decrement its counter,
</li>
<li>
If the counter is zero, deallocate it.
</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<p>
For example:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>launchShip</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>, <span><span><span>armada</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>List</span>&lt;<span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>)</span> <span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<br>    <p>  <span><span>armada</span><span>.</span><span>add</span>(<span>ship</span>)</span>;</p><p>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  
<p>
As you can see, reference counting incurs a cost whenever we alias or dealias. <b>Generational references don't have that cost.</b> The above snippet would have zero overhead if it used generational references.
</p>

</section>

      </div>
  


    </div>
    <div>
      <div>
  
<section>
<p>
Instead, generational references incur a cost whenever we dereference an object:
</p>

    <div>
      
      <p><span><span>fn <span>getShipName</span><span>(<span><span><span>ships</span></span> <span>&amp;<span><span>Map</span>&lt;<span>int</span>, <span>&amp;<span>Spaceship</span></span>&gt;</span></span></span>, <span><span><span>id</span></span> <span>int</span></span>)</span> <span><span>str</span> </span><span>{<br>  <span><span><span><span>ship</span></span></span> = <span><span>ships</span><span>.</span><span>get</span>(<span>id</span>)</span></span>;<p>  <br>  <br>  <span>ret <span><span>ship</span><span>.</span><span>name</span></span>;</span><br>}</p></span></span></span></p>
    </div>
  

</section>
<section>
<p>
This is cheaper because <b>programs dereference less than they alias and dealias:</b> our sample program had 4.7 million counter adjustments, but only 1.3 million liveness checks. <a href="#note10" data-noteid="10">10</a> <a href="#note11" data-noteid="11">11</a>
</p>

</section>
<section>
<h3 id="more-cache-friendly">
 More Cache Friendly</h3>
<p>
Reference counting is not very "cache friendly". Adding and subtracting integers is basically free on modern CPUs, but the real bottleneck in modern programs is how <i>far</i> those integers are: if it's been recently accessed, it's in the nearby cache, and only takes a few CPU cycles to fetch. Otherwise the CPU will "cache miss" and have to bring it in all the way from RAM, which could take <b>hundreds</b> of cycles. <a href="#note12" data-noteid="12">12</a>
</p>
<p>
In our reference-counted <span>launchShip</span> example, the <span>ship.__ref_count++</span> could take a few cycles if <span>ship</span> is already in the cache, or hundreds of cycles if it's not.
</p>

</section>
<section>
<p>
Generational references are more cache friendly:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
When a generational reference goes away, we don't need to reach into memory (unlike RC, where we have to decrement a counter).
</li>
<li>
We don't need to increment when aliasing (see previous section); we don't need to reach into memory to increment.
</li>
</ul>

</section>

      </div>
  
<div>

      <div>
        <div>
    
<div id="note10" data-noteid="10">
<p><span>10</span></p><section>
<p>
 Half of these are aliasings and half are dealiasings. Aliasing happens whenever we access a member (e.g. <span>person.name</span>) or make a new reference (e.g. <span>&amp;person</span>).
</p>

</section>
</div>
<div id="note11" data-noteid="11">
<p><span>11</span></p><section>
<p>
 Many languages are able to skip a lot of the adjustments, using static analysis. For example, Lobster can remove up to 95%. Our experiment doesn't have those optimizations; it compares naive RC to naive generational references.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>‍</p><div><p>I have an internal bias towards most meetings, one perhaps that isn't all that original but it goes something like this. </p><p><strong>Email &gt; Slack &gt;&nbsp;Phone Call &gt; Text Message &gt; Written Letter &gt;&nbsp;Morse Code&nbsp;&gt;&nbsp;Smoke Signal &gt;&nbsp;Guttural Screaming &gt; "<em>Meeting</em>".</strong></p></div><p>‍</p><p>Even in this all to frequentness and easy era of zoom calls and google meets I still find many if not most meetings that I'm called into to be not exactly pointless but lets say misguided and most certainly a pseudo-criminal waste of time. This has been something i've been passionate about for a few years and made particularly poignant after transferring over from start-up land to more traditional commercial business. Thats not to say that all meetings are bad, !true, some are absolutely necessary, enjoyable and useful (<em>Good</em> Scums, Retrospectives, Big Decisions) but many meetings suffer from a lack of structure or a specific emphasis that lead them into the land of arbitrary updates and non-specific conversation that aren't all that productive and like the good saying goes: "Could be handled over an email". So like any new year i've decided to set a goal, more of a personal optimization really, which goes something like this: </p><p>‍</p><blockquote>‍<br>Have meetings, only when necessary, mostly one-on-one.<br>‍</blockquote><p>‍</p><p>‍<br>There are <strong>a lot </strong>of perspectives about meetings. These are some of the results from a quick internet&nbsp;search:&nbsp;</p><ul role="list"><li><a href="https://freakonomics.com//2009/07/28/read-this-if-you-hate-meetings/">Read this if you hate meetings</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/meetings-where-work-goes-to-die/" target="_blank">Meetings: where work goes to die </a></li><li><a href="https://forge.medium.com/walking-meetings-will-change-the-way-you-work-dce8b61f9e04">Why walking meetings work </a></li><li><a href="https://timharford.com/2019/08/what-we-get-wrong-about-meetings-and-how-to-make-them-worth-attending/" target="_blank">What we got wrong about meetings and how to make them work</a></li><li><a href="https://blog.valuemotive.com/are-daily-scrum-meetings-worth-it-6c6fb915bec4?gi=7f787159ed1e">Are daily scrum meetings worth it?</a></li><li><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/20130701022638-22330283-a-simple-rule-to-eliminate-useless-meetings">Simple rule for eliminating useless meetings </a></li><li><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43809674">Elons: Walk out of meetings when you're not adding value</a></li><li><a href="https://www.thinkbusiness.ie/articles/jeff-bezos-rules-productive-meetings-amazon/">Jeffs: Start with silence, write it down, keep it small<br>‍</a>‍</li></ul><p>Obviously one could go on but I think it's a fair assessment to say there seems to be in some organizations cultural issues with meetings. Reading through these articles I was able to abstract little tidbits of advice about meetings, how to hold them, when to have them, how to structure them, what to do once you're in them, etc. but the resounding undertone of most was "There are a lot of bad meetings out there, here's what you can do to try fix them, good luck". So instead of regurgitating the various types of meeting participants (<a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">Managers vs Makers, Essential Paul Graham</a>)&nbsp;or to write hyperbole on the super stars of techs most prominent practices (<a href="https://www.inc.com/justin-bariso/jeff-bezos-knows-how-to-run-a-meeting-here-are-his-three-simple-rules.html">Jeff Bezos</a>, <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/productivity-rules-elon-musk-says-every-effective-leader-should-embrace.html">Elon Musk</a>, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/twitter-square-ceo-jack-dorsey-meetings-2015-12">Jack Dorsey</a>, Etc.). I'll simply stick with what I&nbsp;intend to adopt for this new year. </p><h3>Have Meetings</h3><p>Working with people is unavoidable, you need to do it to do virtually any job in any workplace, they cant be absolutely avoided nor should they. In product management they are a very real functional requirement of the role, work with the teams to get the product out the door and work with the customers to make it what they want. In development "meetings" are a different thing all together often times they're more like active collaborations or jazzing through a problem they're personal, in-depth, and require attention to numerous details. </p><p>Regardless of what function you play in any organization you need to have meetings. Personally I recommend having a set agenda for manager style meetings with specific outcomes (decisions)&nbsp;that you hold the group to. If you don't need to be in a meeting don't be afraid to say it and if you're asked to explain yourself, explain yourself. If you find a meeting has reached a plateau or natural end, don't hesitate to wrap it up, your time and everyone else's is more valuable than bitcoin. If you want to have a meeting about blue sky opportunities, growth, collaborations go for a walk or get lunch (with masks if you're comfortable) those moments are special and deserve the relaxed enhancement of food and activity. Finally if you find yourself leading a meeting hold yourself directly and personally responsible for the quality and outcomes of those meetings even if it's with the CEO, it is 100% your job to make the meeting work. </p><p>‍</p><h3>Only When Necessary</h3><p>We live in the golden era of personal communication, use it.</p><p>If you find a meeting that is regularly scheduled is ineffective or pointless move it to a weekly update over email. If you have someone asking for a meeting, quite literally ask them if they can write it out or handle the conversation of slack, iMessage, chat. Very many a meeting can more effectively be handled over written word and should be. </p><p>‍<br>Typed english is far less ambiguous and requires far more thought than top-of-mind spoken word. </p><p>‍</p><h3>Mostly One-on-One</h3><div><p>Information exchange is tricky. Humans can transmit huge amounts of information through nuance, tone, body language, word, etc. In large groups much of that nuance gets turned from signal into noise. If you're going to have a meeting, try to have a meeting directly with one person at a time. Its where information <strong>exchange</strong> is at it's highest and flows the best. </p><p>If you're meeting in a group (Stand-Ups, Scrums, Whatever) contribute where you need to contribute, be there if necessary, and focus to the best of your ability on making that time as valuable as possible. If you find yourself in one of these "pointless" group meetings do a quick calculation on the dollar cost of this time and ask yourself what can be done to fix it or make it better. </p></div><p>‍</p><p>‍</p><p>At the end of the day, theres no specific solution for the all the potential meetings problems. Like everything, each group has unique situations that lead to how these interactions are handled. Whatever you end up doing, just remember your time is valuable and so is everyone else's, treat it like such.</p><p>‍</p><p>Also shout out to<a href="https://www.brandonsmith.ninja/blog/write-code-not-too-much-mostly-functions"> Brandon Smith for his recent post on coding</a>, it gave me the idea for this blog. </p></div></div>]]>

They'll need to contain their deadly contents in perpetuity. But facilities fail. Monuments crumble. Language drifts. Context changes. Governments don't last. The future may be riddled with climate disaster, corrupted data, coup, regime change and war. How can our warnings survive this chaos? How can we even imagine the deep future when Homo sapiens have only been around for two hundred thousand years?</p>  <p>Perhaps the answer isn't in design or technology, but in us. We are the message – the signal. And so will our kids be. And their kids. And theirs. Over generations that signal can fade to static. It'll need amplification. Resources. Mandates. Budgets. Protective legislation. Encoding in popular culture.</p>  <p>The Giant Mine is on the territory of the <strong><a href="http://ykdene.com/">Yellowknives Dene First Nation</a></strong>, who've been passing information down the generations since time immemorial. <strong>Johanne Black</strong>, Director of Lands Management, said her nation was the first watchdog. "It was just one impact after another. We're still living in the same place right across from the Giant Mine, and we're still watching the operations." Black said "the Dene way of communicating is to pass on oral history" and that her nation won't forget what happened at&nbsp;the Giant Mine.</p>  <p><strong>Guests in this episode:</strong></p>  <ul>   <li><strong>Joan Kuyek</strong> is a lifetime community organizer, mining analyst and author.<br> &nbsp;</li>   <li><strong>​Johanne Black</strong> is Director of Lands Management, Yellowknives Dene First Nation.<br> &nbsp;</li>   <li><strong>Arn Keeling</strong> is a professor of geography at Memorial University with a focus on mining and environmental history in Northern Canada.<br> &nbsp;</li>   <li><strong>John Sandlos</strong> is a professor of history at Memorial University, studying the impact of northern mining and toxins on Indigenous communities.&nbsp;<br> &nbsp;</li>   <li><strong>David Searle</strong> was a mine worker in the 1950s, later a lawyer and an NWT MLA in the 1970s.<br> &nbsp;</li>   <li><strong>Natalie Plato</strong> is the Deputy Project Director for the Giant Mine Remediation Project.<br> &nbsp;</li>  </ul>  <p><strong>Further reading:&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>  <ul>   <li><em>Mining and Communities in Northern Canada</em>, Editors: Arn Keeling and John Sandlos, University of Calgary Press, 2015,&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://press.ucalgary.ca/books/9781552388044" target="_blank">available from the&nbsp;publisher as a free e-book</a></strong>.<br> &nbsp;</li>   <li><em><strong><a href="http://www.iiirm.org/publications/Articles%20Reports%20Papers/Environmental%20Restoration/resolve.htm" target="_blank">Taking Control: Opportunities for and Impediments to the Use of Socio-Cultural Controls for Long-Term Stewardship of U.S. Department of Energy Legacy Waste Sites</a></strong></em>,&nbsp;a report by the International Institute for Indigenous Resource Management.

<p>What’s concept creep? It’s pretty much what it sounds like. Concept creep occurs when a concept that originally meant something very specific later comes to encompass a much broader set of unrelated, or only loosely related, phenomena.</p>
<p>Psychology has been particularly plagued by concept creep. <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1047840X.2016.1082418?journalCode=hpli20&amp;">According to Nick Haslam</a>, who is credited with coining the phrase:</p>
<p>Many of psychology’s concepts have undergone semantic shifts in recent years. These conceptual changes follow a consistent trend.&nbsp; Concepts that refer to the negative aspects of human experience and behavior have expanded their meanings so that they now encompass a much broader range of phenomena than before. This expansion takes “horizontal” and “vertical” forms: concepts extend outward to capture qualitatively new phenomena and downward to capture quantitatively less extreme phenomena…In each case, the concept’s boundary has stretched and its meaning has dilated.&nbsp;Although conceptual change is inevitable and often well motivated, concept creep runs the risk of pathologizing everyday experience and encouraging a sense of virtuous but impotent victimhood.</p>
<h2>Codependency, Narcissism, and Emotional Labor Are Very Specific Things</h2>
<p>Many concepts have fallen prey to this effect. One notable example is&nbsp;<a href="https://poly.land/2018/04/13/polyamory-helped-ditch-codependence-find-healthy-interdependence/">codependency,</a>&nbsp;which had a very specific meaning when it was first coined in substance abuse circles (the state of another person being co-addicted to substances by proxy, owing to their close relationship with an addict) but now is used by the general population to describe an entire array of behaviors that have nothing to do with the original concept and aren’t necessarily even pathological depending on the particular context (thinner than average boundaries, people pleasing, dependence in general, etc.).</p>
<p>A similar fate has befallen&nbsp;<em>narcissism.&nbsp;</em>There are actually pretty specific criteria for narcissistic traits, behavior, and of course the full blown personality disorder. However, it’s fashionable now for lay folks to label anyone that behaves like a jerk a “narcissist,” where many times the person in question is actually showing a pattern of behavior more consistent with other cluster B disorders (i.e., antisocial, borderline, histrionic). Or they’re just being kind of jerky and inconsiderate — but in a way that’s divorced from anything that’s really beyond the diagnostic pale. Because just because someone’s annoying or acting in a hurtful way, it doesn’t make them disordered.</p>
<p>It’s happening virtually everywhere you look. The Atlantic ran a piece recently on how <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2018/11/arlie-hochschild-housework-isnt-emotional-labor/576637/?fbclid=IwAR02EtM3N1RaZiq3fF48-uz32pWWoJ0iCxM-Tab6N7WPHV7-np4Vxl406zM">emotional labor has suffered concept creep</a>, an article which features an interview with the sociologist who originally coined the term.</p>
<h2>Not All Psychological or Emotional Invalidation Is Gaslighting.</h2>
<p>However, I would have to say that in my own work these days, I’m most frequently dealing with concept creep in regards to gaslighting.</p>
<p>The term <em>gaslighting</em> originally referred to a very specific form of psychological manipulation. Its origins stem from a play from the 1930s called&nbsp;<em>Gaslight</em>, in which a man tries to make his wife and other people think she’s insane by messing with small aspects of her environment and then telling her she’s wrong and possibly insane when she later points it out to him. In one instance, this literally involves <em>dimming gaslight</em>s in the house while he’s up to some shenanigans (he’s not a nice dude and also killed another lady and is rooting around looking for the dead woman’s jewels), thus the name.</p>
<p>So the term gaslighting informally came to describe an effort to manipulate someone’s perception of reality in a way that can make someone else feel crazy and doubt their own sanity. Where classically this process was dependent on a person messing with physical objects in one’s external environment, it’s also come to be understood that it’s possible to gaslight someone through less concrete methods: Lying, misdirection, denial, etc.</p>
<p>This is fine and a fairly minor extension of the original more literal use.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> a problem, however, is that people have started to use it refer not just to this specific form of manipulation but instead to refer to <em>any</em> form of psychological invalidation.</p>
<p>One common misapplication I’ve seen many times in my travels is the following: In situations in which your partner disagrees with you about a subject that’s actually quite ambiguous and you get hurt by it, people are quite eager to jump in and say that the partner is gaslighting you. But that’s not what gaslighting is. Not every hurtful interpersonal conflict is (in fact, while gaslighting certainly happens, it’s relatively rare compared to other more common forms of maladaptive relating).</p>
<h2>Emotional Invalidation Versus Gaslighting</h2>
<p>However, it’s trendy so people are using the word&nbsp;<em>a lot —&nbsp;</em>whether they really&nbsp;<em>should&nbsp;</em>or not. Often what’s being mistakenly described as gaslighting these days is at best an honest disagreement over something ambiguous — or at worst, it’s an instance of emotional invalidation.</p>
<p>What’s emotional invalidation? It’s when someone else tells you that your emotions or thoughts aren’t valid. This can happen in a number of ways. Someone can simply ignore them and go about their merry way without considering them. Or they can outright judge you for them (“that’s a stupid way to feel”). They can even reject your own assessment of your emotional state by telling you, “Oh that’s not how you really feel.”</p>
<p>Is emotional invalidation hurtful? Absolutely.</p>
<p>Is emotional invalidation gaslighting? Nope, not really.</p>
<p>A better example of gaslighting would be if someone told you that they never had conversations with you that you know you did and tell you that you must be crazy or overworked if you think that actually happened. Or if they’re hiding things on you and telling you that you must be mistaken about those items getting lost (especially if they put them back in their original place later, causing you to doubt your sanity).</p>
<h2>But What Does It All Mean, Basil?</h2>
<p>Okay, so <a href="https://poly.land/2018/11/02/that-doesnt-need-to-be-a-word-is-an-incredibly-boring-stance/">language is evolving</a>. Whoop de freaking doo. That’s what language does, right? Maybe it’s annoying to prescriptivists (like a lot of other things), but what’s the big deal?</p>
<p>Well, concept creep has consequences.</p>
<p>In addition to Nick Haslam’s concerns above about pathologizing the everyday, I also find myself frustrated by the difficulty concept creep poses to communication. Where those terms once held some utility in talking with others, I find more often than not that when I’m attempting to problem-solve relationship issues with an individual that I absolutely cannot take any of that at face value. If they say that their partner is gaslighting them or they tell me that their ex was a narcissist, that ends up being <em>incredibly</em> low-yield information. Instead of learning anything important from those descriptors, I find myself expending considerable energy in followup questions, uncovering exactly what they think those words mean. What happened? What behaviors are we talking about?</p>
<p>Where several years ago, I was much more likely to have the individual describe the actual behavior at default, it’s more likely these days for people to start using labels instead as a shortcut. And ones they are often not applying correctly.</p>
<p>To be fair, there’s always going to be a place for that kind of followup in the helping professions. And people are generally unreliable narrators, incredibly biased and subjective sources of information, something you basically always have to keep in mind when you’re working with them and talking over complex social issues with them.</p>
<p>But concept creep really does seem to have gotten worse in recent years.</p>

<p>Any person who is seriously considering to become an ethical hacker should be aware of the challenges they might face. If you think that you will get to the expert level in a few weeks or months, then I’m sorry to bring you the bad news: It won’t be easy. In fact, it will take you years to reach a level that will allow you to seriously challenge real-world systems and finally monetize your hacking skills (Legally, of course). </p>



<p>Therefore, if you are not ready to put in the time and effort, then this might not be the right place for you.</p>



<p>With this introduction, I am not trying to discourage you. I am simply trying to make sure that you have enough motivation and willpower to achieve this goal.</p>



<p>So, with all this being said, you have given it some thought and now you’ve decided that you’re ready to give it all it takes to become an ethical hacker?</p>



<p>Well, that’s good. By taking this decision, you’ve already made the first step.</p>



<p>There is only one problem: Where should you start?</p>



<p>Well don’t worry about that, you’ve come to the right place. In this post, I provide a step-by-step guide on how to become an ethical hacker. I have also added links to resources that can help you at each step of your way. </p>



<p>All tutorials and learning materials that I have included here are completely free. This way, you don’t have to spend your money on expensive courses.</p>



<p>So, if you’re ready to become an ethical hacker, let’s go ahead and get started with the first step.</p><div><figure><img src="https://patchthenet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/cyber-security-cybersecurity-computer-security-3480163-1024x682.jpg" alt="how to become an ethical hacker"></figure></div><h2>1. Learn the fundamentals</h2>



<p>Before you can learn about hacking and security, you should first have a solid foundation of computer skills. This is a very important step, one that you should not skip. </p>



<p>If you lack an understanding of how underlying computer systems work, then you will always rely on tools developed by other hackers. People who do that are called <strong>script kiddies</strong>, and, believe me, you do not want to be called that.</p>



<p>So, for this first step, here is what you should learn</p>



<h3>Computer networks</h3>



<p>Computer networks are everywhere. Even now, you are connected to one. It is almost impossible to find a computer system not connected to a network.</p>



<p>Computer networks can be connected to the Internet, or they can be completely isolated. Either way, knowing how these networks operate is necessary if you want to find out what vulnerabilities they might have.</p>



<p>There are plenty of resources on the web that provides tutorials and courses about computer networks. <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QKfk7YFILws" target="_blank">The Bits and Bytes of Computer Networking</a> is a great course made by Google for beginners. Another useful resource is <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.professormesser.com/network-plus/n10-007/n10-007-training-course/" target="_blank">The Network+ Training Course</a> by Professor Messer. You can also check our computer networking tutorials for beginners on <a href="https://patchthenet.com/computer-networking/">Patchthenet</a>.</p>



<h3>Linux</h3>



<p>I have nothing against Windows, but when it comes to hacking, I cannot help but swear by Linux. I mean, what’s not to like? It is an open-source, freely available operating system that you can customize however you wish.</p>



<p>Hackers and pen-testers use Linux because it provides tons of open-source tools that they can use and change as they wish. In fact, there are distributions of Linux, like Kali and Parrot, that are designed specifically for pen-testing. It would therefore be wise to learn Linux if you want to benefit from all these advantages.</p>



<p>Websites like <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/" target="_blank">ryanstutorials</a> or <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://linuxjourney.com/" target="_blank">linuxjourney</a> are good resources that can help you get started with Linux.</p>



<h3>Programming languages</h3>



<p>Learning a programming language will allow you to code your own tools and scripts. You can, for example, automate tasks like scanning for certain types of vulnerabilities, or you can code your own exploits.</p>



<p>If you do not know how to code, then you will be forced to use tools developed by other hackers and you won’t be able to modify them and adjust them to your needs. This will severely limit your possibilities.</p>



<p>If you’re new to programming, Python can be a good start. It is a powerful scripting tool. You would be surprised at what you can make using this simple language. It is also a very popular language, so you won’t have any problem finding the support you need from the Python community. </p>



<p>As a first step, you can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uQrJ0TkZlc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Python for Beginners</a> course by Mosh on Youtube. After that, you can practice your coding skills on <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hacker Rank</a>.</p>



<h2>2. Learn Ethical Hacking</h2>



<p>Once you’re feeling confident you’ve mastered the fundamentals, you can start learning about hacking. But this is not as simple as it sounds.</p>



<p>Hacking is a very wide subject. It spans many fields. You can pursue only one or two specific fields or you can follow a rather general approach and take in the entire hacking spectrum.</p>



<p>A third option, one that I personally recommend, is to learn at first all domains at a high-level without diving too deep into each of them. This will provide you a general understanding which will allow you to choose one field that you might find yourself leaning toward. Then, once you’ve made up your mind, you can work your way to become more proficient in your chosen field. </p>



<p>I discuss here some of the fields that you can follow if you want to become an ethical hacker.</p>



<h3>Web Application Security</h3>



<p>Almost every organization has a presence on the web. Websites have become an essential thing to have for any organization that wants to attract customers, reach out to partners, or simply communicate with the public.</p>



<p>Securing web applications is therefore a priority for many organizations, especially those that rely on their web content to bring in revenue. A lot of these organizations are paying for hackers to perform penetration testing on their web applications in order to help secure them against malicious hackers.</p>



<p>Performing penetration testing on web applications demands a certain level of proficiency in web programming languages such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK_JCtrrv-c" target="_blank">PHP</a> and <a href="https://javascript.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Javascript</a>. You should be able to review the source code and scan it for vulnerabilities. </p>



<p>You should also learn about the most common web application vulnerabilities. The best source for this is <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The OWASP Top Ten</a>.</p>



<p>After that, you can read the <a href="https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OWASP Web Security Testing Guide</a>, which is considered by many to be the best reference for web application pen-testers.</p>



<h3>Reverse Engineering</h3>



<p>Reverse engineering is a powerful skill that you want to have under your belt. It allows you to understand the architecture and the inner design of a hardware or software system.</p>



<p>In the case of software, developers rely on reverse engineering tools to duplicate or add new functionalities to a product even if they do not have access to the source code. While this might not necessarily be illegal, attackers have found another, less honest way, to use them. They can reveal the inner design and expose vulnerabilities in the system, like ways to bypass controls or getting access to confidential information.</p>



<p><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iyAyN3GFM7A&amp;list=PLhixgUqwRTjxglIswKp9mpkfPNfHkzyeN" target="_blank">LiveOverflow </a>is a great channel that provides good tutorials and videos about binary exploitation, cracking and software reverse engineering. </p>



<h3>Network security</h3>



<p>Networks are often the entry point for attackers that wish to gain access to a system. This is all the more true when the attacker has physical access to the target network, like for example through an accessible public Wi-Fi.</p>



<p>Securing a network is not an easy task. There is a large attack surface that presents a risk and so many things that can go wrong. For instance, you can have the most secure configuration on your network devices, but if your switch room is not as highly protected, then an attacker that manages to gain access to the room will easily compromise your network and make all your work pointless.</p>



<p>If you want to simulate how attackers might gain access to a network, you should learn how to look for these security weaknesses. Make sure to examine every facet of your target: Physical location of network devices, compromised endpoints, weak configurations, accessible wireless networks, and so on.</p>



<p>You can watch the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Kq1MIfTWCE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Network Penetration Testing</a> course by Heath Adams on Youtube. It is a full course that will help you make the first steps in network hacking. </p>



<h3>Cryptography</h3>



<p>Since ancient times, cryptography has been a tool used to protect communications between allies from intercepting enemies. For a long time, simple algorithms were enough. However, in recent decades, and with the fast-growing processing power of modern computers, we got used to newer algorithms being developed and then cracked years afterwards. This trend appears to be continuing for years to come, especially with the advent of quantum computing which will render most of the currently strong algorithms insecure.</p>



<p>I should note, however, that cracking current algorithms is not a task for us mere mortals. Secure algorithms like AES-256 are practically impossible to hack.</p>



<p>Still, while cracking the algorithm itself is not feasible, it is completely realistic to hack its implementation.</p>



<p>There is a <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2aHkqB2-46k&amp;list=PL419GdFFJL5V5nSp380lP9o9kTC_My3u8&amp;index=1" target="_blank">24-lecture series</a> on Youtube by Christof Paar that I highly recommend if you are serious about learning cryptography.</p>



<h3>Active Directory</h3>



<p>Almost every company in the world uses Active Directory. It is the one tool that administrators use to manage permissions and access to network resources, and so you shouldn’t be surprised if I tell you that it represents a constant target for malicious hackers. </p>



<p>You should be knowledgeable of the vulnerabilities and weaknesses that exist in AD. You should also learn how they can be exploited so you can help secure them against attackers. </p>



<p><a href="https://adsecurity.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Adsecurity</a> is a good website that provides great tips and attack methods related to active directory. Another resource is the “<a href="https://www.varonis.com/blog/pen-testing-active-directory-environments-part-introduction-crackmapexec-powerview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pen Testing Active Directory Environments</a>” by Varonis.</p>



<h2>3. Practice</h2>



<p>The only thing that can make you an ethical hacker is hacking. You can read every book ever written about this subject, but reading on its own does not make you skilled. Only experience does. </p>



<p>Fortunately, you do not have …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>

  		<p>At around this time last year, I was being flooded with various articles on new year's resolutions and yearly summaries - as is typical in early January. I was trying to decide whether there is anything I hoped to change in my life. One of the big points on my 'roadmap to becoming a better human' google doc (everyone has one, right?) was being more aware of what happens with my time (what do I spend it on? am I sure I'm making <em>most</em> of it?). This sounded like an actionable new year's resolution, so I decided to give it a try. However, I tend to get a bit intense sometimes and so I kind of logged all my activities at 15-minute intervals for the whole year.</p>
<h4>You did what!?</h4>
<p>I logged my activities at 15-minute intervals for the whole year.</p>
<p>Here, check out this screenshot from my google sheet (btw, the spreadsheet title is just "Life"):</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/spreadsheet_banner.png" alt="A screenshot of a google sheet I used to track my data with different activities coloured differently" title="Life"></p>
<h3>Why would you do this!?</h3>
<p>I wanted to see what happens with my time. I knew I was spending quite a lot of it on social media, but I wasn't sure how much exactly. I also knew I was working quite a lot and wanted to quantify exactly how much (spoiler alert: not that much). I hoped that keeping track of what I do would help me to identify chunks of time that were being wasted and to turn them into <em>quality</em> time.</p>
<p>It was also a purely scientific curiosity - there were many less important questions that I was curious to find answers to: do I get less sleep while at uni? How much time do I spend with people vs on my own? What are the effects of drinking alcohol? and many others.</p>
<h3>Ok, sure, whatever. How much effort did this take?</h3>
<p>Not that much actually!</p>
<p>When I started, I was fully expecting to get bored with the whole thing and stop after maybe a month or so. Surprisingly, logging what I do turned out to be quite easy. As you might have noticed, I get quite excited about data so seeing my spreadsheet getting bigger and more colourful was enough of an incentive to keep me going. In the few instances, when I came close to stopping, a strong FOMD (fear of missing data) would always get me back on it.</p>
<h4>Technicalities</h4>
<p><a href="#data">I don't care, I want to see the data.</a></p>
<ul>
<li>I decided to log my activities in 15-minute intervals - I wanted to be able to catch shorter activities (especially procrastination) but didn't want it to be too crazy (though I might have lost the right to decide what is crazy when I started the whole project)</li>
<li>I was using google sheets to log my data. I liked them because are online by default allowing me to log my data both on my laptop and my phone, the drag-to-copy cell content function makes it easy to log longer activities and the conditional formatting makes the spreadsheet nice and colourful providing instant gratification. You can access my template <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XBUFCJGVL73kFvD0yO5e63fLfRuebemcqhnQoafXad4/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.</li>
<li>I divided my activities into broad categories to make noting them down easier. Some categories were divided further into subcategories.
For me, the categories were:
<ul>
<li><strong>sleeping:</strong></li>
<li><strong>focused work</strong> - what I really understand as productivity:
<ul>
<li><strong>uni</strong> - university (until June) and PhD (since October)</li>
<li><strong>self-improvement</strong> - job applications, but also working on my personal projects (like writing code to analyse my data, or learning to draw)</li>
<li><strong>admin</strong> - answering emails, filling forms etc (btw filling my time tracking spreadsheet was in this category)</li>
<li><strong>organising</strong> - things like organising events for a society, conferences and other extracurricular things</li>
<li><strong>German</strong> - to track language learning</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>low-focus work</strong> - same subcategories as in focused work. Low-focus work included activities that were more mechanical and didn't require too much brain power. For example, admin or organising my notes would be low-focus, while reading papers or writing essays would be focused work.</li>
<li><strong>socialising</strong></li>
<li><strong>culture</strong> (with subcategories: <strong>books</strong>, <strong>films</strong>, <strong>documentaries</strong>, <strong>TV shows</strong>, and <strong>other</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>human function</strong> - the boring stuff I need to do to stay alive (showering, making food, eating and things like that. On trips also setting tents etc)</li>
<li><strong>other quality time</strong> - things that didn't really fit into the other categories. Subcategories: <strong>blogs</strong>, <strong>podcasts</strong>, <strong>news</strong>, <strong>games</strong>, <strong>YouTube</strong>, <strong>chilling</strong> (for the times when I needed to just lie down or stare at the wall), and <strong>other</strong>)</li>
<li><strong>travelling</strong> - time spent in buses/cars/planes etc</li>
<li><strong>exercising</strong> - deliberate exercise - running, cycling, exercise routines</li>
<li><strong>exercising (lower intensity)</strong> - mostly walking/slow cycling, but also stretching</li>
<li><strong>procrastinating</strong> - mostly social media</li>
<li><strong>idle</strong> - waiting in queues etc</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>The data</h2>
<p>Alright, so now that I hopefully managed to calm you down, let's use the data I have to answer a few questions:</p>
<h4>What did I do in 2020?</h4>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/year_props.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time in total I spent on different activities"></p>
<p>Turns out my top three activities of the year are sleeping (7h 45min on average per day and I'm very proud of this), working (6h 20 min on average per day) and socialising (3h 25 min on average per day). It is mostly what I would expect except that it always scares me how much time we actually spend unconscious. I can't decide whether 1h 20 min spent on human function (eating and showering etc) is a lot or not (a downside of a small sample size, I guess). On one hand, I could probably use that time to do more fun things but on the other hand maybe I should just chill.
The procrastination time (on average 10 mins per day) is definitely less than it actually is - I will talk more about it in the productivity section below.</p>
<p>Another cool feature of the way I was logging my data was that I could log more than one activity into a single time slot (walking and listening to a podcast is a classic). This means that the total time spent on all activities sums up to more than 365 days - you can see this as 'extra days' on the plot above. Turns out that this year, I had 395 surplus hours or 16.5 surplus days. I hope I didn't spend them on human function.</p>
<p>Some of the categories from the plot above were divided into more helpful subcategories:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/High_intensity_work.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within focused work">
<img src="https://samplesize.one/img/Low_intensity_work.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within low-focus work"></p>
<p>By far, most of my work was towards uni and PhD - 51 days in total. After excluding the time from June to September, when I had holidays, this gives around 5hrs of work per day. While this includes weekends, this does not seem like a lot, especially that weekends are not really well respected at uni.</p>
<p>Finding out how little focused work I do, even on the days that feel productive, was one of the biggest surprises of analysing my data. It turns out that a typical working day (9-17) would usually only give around 5-6 hours of actual work, while the rest of time would dissolve on low-focus work, chatting to people, coffee breaks and other little distractions. While there were days when I would reach 8 hours of focused work (for focused uni work I had 32 such days this year), they required either spending the whole day (9-22) working or a <em>lot</em> of effort to stay focused. Both were quite tiring and unsustainable in the long run. I guess the lesson here is that when it comes to focused work, the 8-hour working day is an unattainable target and should not be used as a benchmark.</p>
<p>I also do a lot of admin - nearly half of all the time I spend on culture. This is fairly sad and a potential action point for the future.</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/culture.png" alt="A calendar showing how much time I spent on different subcategories within culture"></p>
<p>I spent a fair amount of time reading books - nearly 1.5h per day on average! I'm quite happy with this since this is a habit I consciously worked to develop this year. During this time, I have read 35 books (12,715 pages according to Goodreads<sup id="fnref1">
<a href="#fn1" rel="footnote">1</a> </sup>
). If you want some recommendations, my top three would be: A Gentleman in Moscow, The Places in Between, and Little Fires Everywhere. On the other hand, I can't really find films or TV shows that I would really get into, so if you have any that you love, let me know! Also a bonus: the 'documentaries' are really just Louis Theroux and I don't regret a single minute.</p>

<h4>How did the time spent on different activities change over the months?</h4>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/hrs_per_month_timeline.png" alt="A stacked plot showing how the average daily hours spent on different activities changed throughout the months"></p>
<p>As above, the hours sum to more than 24 because of logging two activities in a single time slot if I was doing them simultaneously.</p>
<p>You can quite clearly identify the 'hard lockdown' times - April+May and November. In both periods, there is a noticeable increase in working hours, reduction in socialising and increase in culture. In the spring I was finishing my Master's thesis and revising for my exams so I would expect the increase in productivity regardless of lockdown. However, seeing the same pattern in November (when we were discouraged from coming to office) seems to suggests that I am actually working more when working from home. This is probably due to both fewer distractions but also to the lack of alternatives. Normally, I would often stop working to meet friends. During the lockdown, when this is not an option, I often just continue working.</p>
<p>I would love to talk about all the other categories, but the post is getting quite lengthy so you can explore them here (another bonus: look for my binge of playing Zoo Planet):</p>

<h4>Hacking my monkey brain to increase productivity</h4>
<p>As I was analysing at my data throughout the year, I was quite disappointed in how little I worked and was looking for a way to increase it.
Inspired by <a href="https://putanumonit.com/2017/05/09/time-well-spent/">this post</a> I decided to gamify my productivity by giving myself points for activities I wanted to do more of.
I was hoping that they would act as sources of instantenous pleasure for my monkey brain (which wants fun <em>now</em> and doesn't really care about future me) to make it do things that might be less fun but beneficial in the long run.
Given that I already had data on my activities throughout the day, assigning points was pretty straightforward.</p>
<p>I would get:</p>
<ul>
<li>4 points per hour for the most productive activities (focused work towards uni &amp; self-improvement and exercising)</li>
<li>3 points for reading books</li>
<li>2 points for reading blogs, listening to podcasts, lower intensity work etc</li>
<li>0 points for things that are important but I do them anyway (socialising, sleep etc)</li>
<li>-4 points for procrastination</li>
</ul>
<p>And here are my points for this year:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/points.png" alt="A calendar with days coloured according to the amounts of points I got on a given day"></p>
<p>and their distributions throughout the months:</p>
<p><img src="https://samplesize.one/img/points_per_month.png" alt="A plot of the distributions of points throughout the months"></p>
<p>Turns out my monkey brain is <text><strong>crazy</strong> </text> about points. The moment I started, every day became an exercise in optimisation. You can see that from April, …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>I am switching from Mac to Linux.</p>
<p>This is how the adventure started to find the best linux distro, with a seemless user experience and minimum maintenance.</p>
<p>In the past months I experimented with various distros:</p>
<ul>
<li>bare debian</li>
<li>Pop!_OS</li>
<li>Ubuntu</li>
<li>Elementary OS</li>
</ul>
<p>I didn’t even want to get my hands dirty with Arch. To each their own, right?</p>
<p>Read below to read my experience and to which distro I settled using.</p>
<h2>Experience recap</h2>
<h3>with bare debian</h3>
<p>Driver support for WiFi and Bluetooth were absent out of the box.</p>
<p>Still too much to adjust and tweak to get a decent user experience.</p>
<p>Not for me.</p>
<h3>with Pop!_OS</h3>
<p>Seemed like a fresh approach to the linux distro landscape, but I had major hiccups when it comes to display drivers.</p>
<p>Weird issues like blank screen after switching to HDMI external display. Troublesome boots when display was attached.</p>
<p>Weird glitches and graphical artifacts when resizing windows.</p>
<p>No issues with drivers.</p>
<p>I bet it works great on System76 machines though.</p>
<h3>with Ubuntu</h3>
<p>Glitches when working with external monitors.</p>
<p>Blank screen after booting connected via HDMI.</p>
<p>Weird behaviour when putting laptop in clamshell mode. Either not turning on, or shortly showing the login screen and then going to sleep.</p>
<p>No issues with drivers.</p>
<p>Recurrent issues with the confusing Software center versions not compatible with the applications on it.</p>
<p>Amazon EKS keeped popping up as a “promoted” application, without the possibility to remove it.</p>
<p>Bye Ubuntu.</p>
<h3>Elementary OS</h3>
<p>No issues with drivers.</p>
<p>No issues with external monitor. Wake and sleep with HDMI works like expected.</p>
<p>No blank screen when booting from external monitor.</p>
<p>Decent software center (with donations built in), also using snap was great.</p>
<p>Slight issues when disconnecting the external monitor and using the laptop, works after a few tries.</p>
<p>So far so good.</p>
<h2>Elementary OS is good enough for me</h2>
<p>The user experience is stunningly similar to what I was used to with a Mac.</p>
<p>Switching windows is intuitive.</p>
<p>If you forget a shortcut, just press <code>&lt;SUPER&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>With <code>snap</code> it almost feels like using <code>brew</code> and <code>brew cask</code>.</p>
<p>Using it in clamshell mode works like a charm.</p>
<p>The system even wakes up from sleep using a Bluetooh logitech keyboard with mouse (namely the Logitech k400 I think).</p>
<p><s>Still need to find a better Terminal emulator, because I’m not really fond of the one built-in. Perhaps time to try Alacritty?</s></p>
<p><a href="https://dottorblaster.it/2020/12/back-to-linux/">dottorblaster.it</a> suggested <a href="https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/">Tilix</a>, and I can relate: it’s pretty awesome and provides a similar experience to iTerm.</p>
<p>This is how I am writing this very blog post.</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/mac-linux/elementary-os-preview.png" alt="elementary os preview"></p>
<h2>Applications</h2>
<h3>Terminal</h3>
<p><a href="https://gnunn1.github.io/tilix-web/">Tilix</a> with ZSH (coming from iTerm and fish shell)</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/mac-linux/tilix.png" alt="tilix"></p>
<h2>Browser</h2>
<p>Brave (coming from Firefox + Brave)</p>
<p><img src="https://cri.dev/assets/images/posts/mac-linux/brave.png" alt="brave"></p>
<h2>Editor</h2>
<p>VSCode + vim</p>
<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ideogram for emoji picking (that’s important nowadays)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>snap</code> + <code>apt</code> (perhaps flatpak in the future if I feel the need)</p>

        <p>This paper is endorsed by the <a href="https://willing.com/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Willing.com</a> Legal Advisory Board, whose members include Daniel L. Mosley, Robert H. Sitkoff, and John H. Langbein.</p>
<p><strong>A Note from Willing:</strong></p>
<p>Since launching in 2015, we heard from a lot of customers who struggled with the requirements for creating a will. They wanted to know: Can’t I just sign online, electronically? Can I store my will online with Willing?” In each case, the answer was no, unfortunately not — wills still live in the physical, pen-and-ink world, and their execution calls for the physical presence of witnesses and a notary.</p>
<p>We learned that the execution requirements were causing some people to procrastinate indefinitely when it came to making a will, or to make mistakes when signing that meant they hadn’t created a valid will when they thought they had. We wanted to come up with a solution. So, we worked with our Legal Advisory Board and other experts to examine the law in depth and think about how it could be updated to leverage technology while preserving its important functions. The result was this paper, which provided the foundation for our efforts to pass the Electronic Wills Act in a number of states.</p>
<p>As the legislation has moved along, we’ve heard both strong support and strong opposition. Naturally — and rightly — folks who practice in this area care a lot about getting it right. We also care a lot about getting it right, and to that end we welcome any and all input. We want nothing more than to have a constructive relationship with all interested parties, because we know it’ll make for better laws. If you’d like to engage with us, please do so by reaching out to <a href="mailto:ewills@willing.com">ewills@willing.com</a>.</p>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>To make a valid will, all American states require a person to comply with a set of formalities that trace back to a pair of statutes enacted by Parliament centuries before the invention of the light bulb. These formalities generally require a will to be in writing, signed by the testator, and witnessed by at least two people. There are good reasons for requiring formalities to make a will. Nevertheless, the traditional will formalities have not adapted to an evolving technological context in which nearly all transactions—including massive end-of-life transfers under pension plans, brokerage accounts, life insurance policies, and the like—can be made electronically. Accordingly, this paper argues in favor of legislation authorizing electronic wills made in compliance with a set of electronic formalities suited to the modern age. These reforms would improve access to will-making while facilitating the integration of wills with the many other methods of deathtime transfer that operate outside the law of wills.</p>
<h2>I. INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>Technology is everywhere in modern American life. Using computers, smartphones and tablets, people can purchase almost any conceivable item and communicate instantaneously with others around the world. At the same time, businesses have used technology to become more efficient and profitable, and governments have employed technology to serve their citizens more quickly, conveniently and effectively.<sup><a id="fnref1" href="#fn1">[1]</a></sup></p>
<p>The law has made these advances possible by actively fostering the use of technology in commerce. Statutes such as the Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (“E-SIGN”), which Congress enacted in 2000, and the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act (“UETA”), which the Uniform Law Commission promulgated in 1999 and which has been enacted in nearly every state, have firmly established the principle that electronic documents and signatures should be given the same legal effect as paper and ink.<sup><a id="fnref2" href="#fn2">[2]</a></sup> Modern commercial life would be impossible without these statutes—they make it possible for people to do their banking online, purchase a book on <a href="http://amazon.com/">Amazon.com</a> and order an Uber car to pick them up.</p>
<p>The law governing the execution of wills is a notable exception to the technological and legal progress that has improved people’s lives in recent decades.<sup><a id="fnref3" href="#fn3">[3]</a></sup> In order to make a valid will, most American states require a person making a will (the “testator”) to satisfy three core “will formalities”: (1) <em>writing</em>—the will must be in the form of a writing;<sup><a id="fnref4" href="#fn4">[4]</a></sup> (2) <em>signature</em>—the will must be signed by the testator; and (3)&nbsp;<em>attestation</em>—the will must be signed by at least two witnesses, who attest to the testator’s signature.<sup><a id="fnref5" href="#fn5">[5]</a></sup> These three core formalities predate the invention of the light bulb—across the country, they have remained largely unchanged for hundreds of years and, as we will see, are not generally thought to apply to electronic media.</p>
<p>At the same time, a system parallel to the law of wills allows individuals to pass property at death without going through probate court or complying with the will formalities. “Nonprobate” modes of transfer, such as inter vivos trusts, life insurance, and transfer-on-death bank, brokerage and pension accounts contain the majority of Americans’ wealth,<sup><a id="fnref6" href="#fn6">[6]</a></sup> but are governed by other bodies of law, and thus are not subject to the will formalities.<sup><a id="fnref7" href="#fn7">[7]</a></sup> Because these other bodies of law have embraced technology to a greater extent than the law of wills—and in fact are subject to both E-SIGN and UETA, which validate electronic documents and signatures—electronic media are already familiar, and even sanctioned, in the context of the most common deathtime transfers. <sup><a id="fnref8" href="#fn8">[8]</a></sup></p>
<p>Yet there are good reasons for the will formalities. As we discuss below, the formalities are intended to provide evidence of the testator’s intent, caution him as to the significance of making a will and protect him from fraud and duress. They have endured in part because “[w]hen the court is asked to implement the testator’s intention, he will inevitably be dead and unable to authenticate or clarify his declarations.”<sup><a id="fnref9" href="#fn9">[9]</a></sup> In the technological age, however, when many other significant transactions (including nonprobate wealth transfers) can be made electronically, the question arises whether the formalities should adapt to accommodate digital execution.</p>
<p>We believe that the process of making and validating a will can be effectively translated into an electronic format that preserves the functions of the original formalities. This would bring the advantages of technology to bear on end‑of‑life planning, allowing more people to provide for a thoughtful disposition of their property at death. Accordingly, this paper will argue for laws expressly permitting electronic wills by way of a digital writing, signature and attestation (and, where applicable, electronic notarization) using well-established technologies already recognized in commercial contexts, including in the nonprobate system. In making this argument, we both (a)&nbsp;acknowledge the value of the formalities and their present inseparability from many states’ law of wills; and (b)&nbsp;endorse the sound policy of Congress, and of nearly every American state, that electronic documents and signatures should be treated exactly the same as paper documents and ink signatures—and we urge the application of that policy to the law of wills.</p>
<p>In Part&nbsp;II below, we discuss the ways property can be transferred at death, including the uses and benefits of wills. We continue in Part&nbsp;III to survey the history and policy basis of the will formalities. In Part&nbsp;IV, we identify trends in statutory and case law that suggest that jurisdictions in America and abroad are already moving toward the policies we endorse in this paper. We also discuss the prominent role of technology in the nonprobate system. We conclude in Part&nbsp;V by explaining how the will formalities can be adapted to the modern age and noting the many benefits of modernization.</p>
<h2>MODES OF PROPERTY SUCCESSION</h2>
<p>There are two main ways that property is transferred at death: (a)&nbsp;through the “probate system”, which is governed by the law of wills (or in the absence of a will, by the laws of “intestacy” discussed below), and (b)&nbsp;the “nonprobate system”, which is not governed by the laws of wills <em>or</em> intestacy, but rather by the law governing the mode of transfer at issue. As we will see, the nonprobate system has assumed a far greater importance in the last 50&nbsp;years—today, Americans are able to pass (and in many cases, <em>do</em> pass) virtually all of their property outside the probate system, without being required to comply with the safeguards of the will formalities. This “nonprobate revolution” points toward the legal and practical basis for the modernization of the will formalities that we endorse in this paper.</p>
<h3>Wills and the Probate System</h3>
<p>Under American law, “[p]roperty owners have the nearly unrestricted right to dispose of their property as they please”,<sup><a id="fnref10" href="#fn10">[10]</a></sup> both during their lives and at their deaths. This policy of “freedom of disposition” is the “organizing principle of the American law of succession”,<sup><a id="fnref11" href="#fn11">[11]</a></sup> and has been recognized by the U.S. Supreme Court as a Constitutionally protected property right.<sup><a id="fnref12" href="#fn12">[12]</a></sup> As the American Law Institute has stated, “American law does not grant courts any general authority to question the wisdom, fairness, or reasonableness of the donor’s decisions about how to allocate his property. The main function of the law of wills is to <em>facilitate</em> rather than <em>regulate</em>.”<sup><a id="fnref13" href="#fn13">[13]</a></sup> As Harvard Law School Professor Robert H. Sitkoff has described it:</p>
<p>“The American law of succession embraces freedom of disposition, authorizing dead hand control, to an extent that is unique among modern legal systems. Within the American legal tradition, a property owner may exclude his or her blood relations and subject his or her dispositions to ongoing conditions&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;The right of a property owner to dispose of his or her property on terms that he or she chooses has come to be recognized as a separate stick in the bundle of rights called property.”<sup><a id="fnref14" href="#fn14">[14]</a></sup></p>
<p>A will is the traditional legal tool that allows an individual to exercise his freedom of disposition. By making a will, a person can choose what happens to his property following his death—in other words, a will says <em>who</em> …</p></div></div>

source code on laptops. Development happens strictly on workstations inside
their private networks, with some using their text editor’s support for
remote file editing and others running editors on those machines via SSH.</p><p>Adapting to this situation has indirectly led me into a bit of a rabbit
hole, forcing me to acknowledge my core values, better understand the
relation between progress and human flourishing, and ponder about the
question: why technology?</p><p><em>(Chapters are mostly self-contained.)</em></p><h3 id="the-computing-experience">The computing experience</h3><p>One of the oldest pieces of software still in use was recently described as</p><blockquote><p>A sort of hybrid between Windows Notepad, a monolithic-kernel operating
system, and the International Space Station.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, they were talking about Emacs. And yes, it is kinda true.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/tron.jpg"></figure><p>I’ve been using Emacs for a while and had opportunities to use it to work
on projects in remote machines. There are a few quirks, but after changing
a setting here and there, <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/tramp/Quick-Start-Guide.html">Tramp</a> is mostly usable. Tramp makes it possible
to transparently treat remote directories, files, commands, and more, <em>as if
they were local</em>. Opening a remote buffer via <code>M-x find-file /ssh:user@remote-host:/some/project</code> and having tools like Magit and Eshell
work out of the box feels like magic.</p><p>I'm not aware of similar functionality in Vim, but VSCode users recently
got
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/remote-overview">something pretty close</a>.</p><p>Emacs runs either as a standalone graphical application (GUI) or in a
terminal emulator (TUI). In terms of features, GUI Emacs can be seen as a
superset of TUI Emacs. Among many other things, it makes it possible to
display:</p><ul><li>images, PDFs, rendered web pages (even YouTube!)</li><li>graphical popups (with code documentation, linting tips, compilation
errors, completion candidates, etc.)</li><li>heterogeneous fonts (distinct sizes, families, emphases, etc.)</li></ul><p>TUI Emacs has the terminal emulator (and also commonly tmux) limiting
and conflicting with the clipboard, keybindings, colors, and more. None of
these limitations are present in GUI Emacs.</p><p>For these and other reasons I use GUI Emacs and Tramp to work on remote
projects instead of TUI Emacs via SSH. Some do the opposite, and that’s
fine too! Even with the limitations shown above, TUI Emacs is very
powerful, and its performance in an SSH session is still superior to Tramp.</p><p>Even so, one might think displaying images in Emacs is not a big deal. Just
<code>open image.png</code> and get an actual image viewer application to render it,
right? Things get interesting in a remote Tramp buffer: <code>M-x find-file image.png</code> will display the <em>remote</em> image right there in your <em>local</em> Emacs
instance. Or in case you’re in a remote <em>dired</em> buffer, pressing <code>RET</code> on an
image file will do the same. It’s a non-disruptive workflow that allows one
to remain in the comfort of Emacs.</p><p>dired is a built-in file manager.</p><p>If you’re not an Emacs user, chances are the previous sentence doesn’t carry
much weight. <em>What’s good about staying inside Emacs</em>?</p><p>It is safe to assume that most of your <em>development</em>, or more broadly, your
<em>computing environment</em> is represented below:</p><ul><li>operating system (macOS, GNU/Linux distribution, Windows, etc.)</li><li>window manager (the one provided by your OS, i3, Openbox, XMonad, etc.)</li><li>terminal emulator (iTerm2, xterm, rxvt, alacritty, etc.)</li><li>shell (bash, zsh, fish, etc.)</li><li>terminal multiplexer (tmux, GNU Screen, etc.)</li><li>text editor or IDE (Vim, VSCode, Xcode, IntelliJ IDEA, etc.)</li><li>email, web browsing, multimedia, and communications</li></ul><p>Each item above is a discrete computer program. They’re extensible in
disconnected ways, and to varying degrees. They’re <em>islands</em>. Most of the
time integrating them is an uphill battle, and commonly just plain
impractical. Having used a computing environment centered around TUI Vim
and tmux for a decade, I know the pain of trying to make the shell, the
terminal, and every command line application running in it have the same
look, feel, and behavior of being inside Vim. It is impossible.</p><p>The emergence of the web browser as a software platform is in part an answer
to this disconnectedness.</p><p>In contrast, Emacs unifies and equalizes the computing experience as much
as one desires, so that it happens—and is extended—in a single,
cohesive environment.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/alt_tab_small.jpg" alt="Figure 3: My computing environment."><figcaption><p>Figure 3: My computing environment.</p></figcaption></figure><p>People commonly <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/jjxatm/whats%5Fyour%5Fjob%5Fwhats%5Fyour%5Fdaily%5Femacs%5Fworkflow/">use Emacs</a> to process their email inbox, communicate in
chat, navigate the web, write code, and prose. At their core, these
activities are one and the same: text-editing. Being able to perform them
using the same keybindings and functionality for movement, search, text
manipulation, completion, undo-redo, copy-paste, is already a big deal, but
it’s not all: their integration into a single environment unlocks pleasant
and efficient workflows that would be much less convenient elsewhere.</p><p>Creating a to-do item for something your partner just asked you (while you
were concentrated on a task) that will show up automatically on your agenda
tomorrow? Just a few keystrokes and you’re back to the task. Converting
some text notes you quickly scribbled down into a beautiful PDF via LaTeX,
uploading it to S3, and referencing the URL in a reworded existing git
commit message? If you’re an experienced Emacs user, chances are you can
<em>visualize</em> effortlessly and efficiently executing these actions without ever
leaving Emacs.</p><p>This interconnectedness is part of the value of computing environments like
the one provided by Emacs. The whole becomes greater than the sum of its
parts.</p><p>Programmability gives it a further dimension of value: parts can be
combined as you see fit, in arbitrary and possibly unforeseen ways.</p><p>Now, back to the <em>displaying an image from a remote host</em> use case. For that,
I can think of some alternatives:</p><ul><li><code>scp</code> the image file between hosts and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li>Mount the remote filesystem and <code>open</code> it locally</li><li><code>ssh</code> into the remote host from a modern terminal emulator capable of
rendering images and use a program like <a href="https://sw.kovidgoyal.net/kitty/kittens/icat.html">icat</a></li></ul><p>In Emacs, you just press enter.</p><h3 id="opening-a-file">Opening a file</h3><p>At work I contribute to a moderately-sized monorepo at 70 thousand files,
8-digit lines of code and hundreds of PRs merged every day. One day I
opened a remote buffer at that repository and ran <code>M-x find-file</code>.</p><p><code>find-file</code> is an interactive function that shows a narrowed list
of files in the current directory, prompts the user to filter and scroll
through candidates, and for a file to open.</p><p>Emacs froze for <em>5 seconds</em> before showing me the <code>find-file</code> prompt. Which
isn’t great, because when writing software, opening files is actually
something one needs to do all the time.</p><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>Luckily, Emacs is “the extensible, customizable, self-documenting real-time
display editor”, and comes with profiling capabilities: <code>M-x profiler-start</code>
starts a profile and <code>M-x profiler-report</code> displays a call tree showing how
much CPU cycles are spent in each function call after starting the profile.
Starting a profile and running <code>M-x find-file</code> showed that all time was being
spent in a function called <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>, which was being
called by <code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>, an <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html%5Fnode/emacs/Hooks.html#:~:text=A%20few%20hooks%20are%20abnormal,are%20used%20in%20some%20way.">abnormal hook</a> run when <code>find-file</code>
is called.</p><p>If you're familiar with Vim you can think of Emacs <i>hooks</i> as
Vim <i>autocommands</i>, only with much better ergonomics.</p><p>I checked the documentation for <code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> with <code>M-x describe-function ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code> and it didn’t seem
to be something essential, so I removed the hook by running <code>M-x eval-expression</code>, writing the form below, and pressing <code>RET</code>.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>remove-hook</span> <span>'file-name-at-point-functions</span> <span>'ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</span>)
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>This solved the immediate problem of Emacs blocking for 5 seconds every
time I ran <code>find-file</code>, with no noticeable drawbacks.</p><div><p>As I write this I attempt to reproduce the issue by re-adding
<code>ffap-guess-file-name-at-point</code>
to
<code>file-name-at-point-functions</code>.
I can't reproduce it anymore. The initial issue might have been</p><ul><li>caused by having manually mutated the Emacs environment via ad-hoc code
evaluation (drifting from the state defined in configuration)</li><li>caused by settings or packages that aren't in my configuration anymore</li><li>fixed by settings or packages that were recently added to my
configuration</li><li>fixed by some recent package upgrade</li></ul><p>Or some combination of the above. I have no idea exactly what.
Which is to say: maintaining Emacs configurations is complicated.</p></div><h3 id="searching-files">Searching files</h3><p>I could now navigate around and open files. The next thing I tried in this
remote git repository was searching through project files. The great
<em>projectile</em> package provides the <code>projectile-find-file</code> function for that,
but I had previously given up making projectile perform well with remote
buffers; given how things are currently implemented it seems to be
<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=projectile+tramp">impractical</a>. So I installed the <em>find-file-in-project</em> package for use on
remote projects exclusively: <code>M-x package-install find-file-in-project</code>.</p><p>Most Emacs commands are accessible via key combinations, with defaults
that can be customized to be anything you want. I'll stick to referencing
command names themselves instead of their default keybindings.</p><p>Both <code>projectile-find-file</code> and <code>find-file-in-project</code> (aliased as <code>ffip</code>):</p><ul><li>show a narrowed list of all project files in the minibuffer</li><li>prompt the user to filter and scroll through candidates</li><li>open a file when <code>RET</code> is pressed on a candidate.</li></ul><figure><img src="https://www.murilopereira.com/projectile_find_file_linux.png"></figure><p>To disable projectile on remote buffers I had the following form in my
configuration.</p><div><div><table><tbody><tr><td><pre><code><span>1
</span><span>2
</span></code></pre></td><td><pre><code data-lang="emacs-lisp">(<span>defadvice</span> <span>projectile-project-root</span> (<span>around</span> <span>ignore-remote</span> <span>first</span> <span>activate</span>)
  (<span>unless</span> (<span>file-remote-p</span> <span>default-directory</span> <span>'no-identification</span>) <span>ad-do-it</span>))
</code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table></div></div><p>Which causes the <code>projectile-project-root</code> function to not run its usual
implementation on remote buffers, but instead return <code>nil</code> unconditionally.
<code>projectile-project-root</code> is used as a way to either get the project root
for a given buffer (remote or not), or as a boolean predicate to test if
the buffer is in a project (e.g., a git repository directory). Having it
return <code>nil</code> on remote buffers effectively disables projectile on remote
buffers.</p><p>Emacs</p></div></div>

Maybe it’s a compulsion or a personality quirk. I actually have to make a point sometimes of focusing on the present. I’m older now and have more experiences under me – and I must say ever-expanding worries! – but at the same time, if the present becomes too much, there’s always the consolation that things will not stay this way. Times are troubling, and we can assume something’s out of whack, but it’s an encouraging thought that all unbalanced systems will try to right themselves. You knock a glass of water and the water will swish up the side of the glass, then swish up the other side, until natural processes bring it to rest.</p>

Dystopian stories about the future are usually about things going wrong, a dismal failure, yet with hope. I have dabbled with dystopia, but to be really plausible, things can’t be going wrong for everyone – unless we’re talking about a cataclysm. Otherwise, there’s a lot of room between utopia and dystopia. They’re both unlikely.</p>
<p>Over time there will be mind-blowing innovations that never see full production or use because they interfere too much with the social systems in place. Do we want to serve our innovations or do we want to improve our lives? If there’s a highly fuel-efficient and reliable engine design patent with fewer movable parts in a black-box style case capable of disrupting a large segment of the working economy, which has fought and worked hard for its position, well, expect the patent to be bought and shelved. The product will never see the light of day. Though this may sound like a conspiracy theory, it’s already happened. But I want to say that you don’t need coordinated actors to get this kind of result. Usually, it’s a confluence of compatible drives toward an outcome that brings about great movements. Unrelated efforts may seem to have a single guiding hand, but sometimes streams just flow together and gouge out a river. They don’t have to intend to be a river to become one.</p>

Sometimes people lose faith in whatever beliefs hold them together, when their social systems stop being meaningful to them anymore – nobody knows why the Maya wandered away from their great cities, but I’ve heard this stated as one of the possibilities. When people walk off, they reassemble somewhere else in some other stylized fashion, reflective of the old ways but not the same. Keeping all this in mind, I may end up describing a future that appears simultaneously advanced and regressive. Cyberpunk, as a style, features technological advances with social disintegration. When I envision a future, I imagine it’ll be both technologically and socially more advanced and regressed. I expect we’ll make good and bad decisions. People will enjoy innovations and mostly integrate them, but not entirely. Sometimes the old ways will appeal more, particularly if the new ones are out of sync with basic human needs. We are a form of animal. We aren’t above nature. We’re a part of nature, and nature craves stability. We’ll sense imbalance, and sooner or later, we’ll correct for it. This is the strange dichotomy of cyberpunk, to my mind. But you could slice and dice less cleanly in a near-future tale.</p>
<p>If this looks like my side of a discussion I’ve already had with somebody, it’s because it is. My partner in the discussion was not wrong to suggest a “science-y” item I’d portrayed in a story was “retro” – it was, though the story also included other future technology on which the plot depended. This dichotomy was deliberate: I had to imagine a future where innovation had gone beyond where we are now, beyond where we expect to be, and still further, beyond a point where society would have taken a step back. The best quick real example I can come up with is the likely transformations facing social media, for in their current manipulative form they’re making people somewhat sick. All over the world, dangerously anxious. It’s like some sort of Harlow experiment (infant monkeys raised by wire cages) – there will likely be long-term ramifications because we won’t “check” the process in time. A rise and fall and then another rise. But I have no doubt that they are unsustainable as they are.</p>
<p>Like other authors, I take inspiration from works I’ve loved and apply some plain-old observations of human nature. Like myths, patterns will carry through. But I want to add to the discussion, if I can – to use other people’s imaginings as a launching pad, an intimation, an influence, or an aspect. Technologically and culturally, let’s say there’ll always be three steps forward and one or two back – setbacks, disruptions like war or even greater innovations too hard to assimilate but it takes us a minute to figure it out. Meanwhile “emergent” stuff’s going on! Emergence: that’s the most thrilling to me. It might be fair to say that my stories are about emergence. Something is born, a change. That’s the sort of futurist I am. Bad and good leads to good and bad, ad infinitum. Well, at least for some time. Barring cataclysm. It’s all about how and where to slice.</p>
<hr>
<p>As a side note, I’ve been able to pursue the venerable art of storytelling because my husband and I live somewhat cheaply. How did we learn to live so cheap? <em>The Great Recession</em>. See? Good can come from bad, even an experience as painful as that one was. (Of course, 2020 says, “Hold my beer….”) A positive mental outlook makes a tremendous difference, and we’ve been happy living lives that make sense to us. Out here on the fringe, perhaps. So, it amuses me to no end that we will likely continue thus humbly until one of my book darlings, my spiders, my own precious “children of time,” gets out there and earns me a decent living. Please and thank you!</p>
<p>I feel so Dickensian, saying that. Patience, patience.</p>
<p>Anyway, these are my thoughts – a little short and abstract, I know, but hopefully of interest. This is about as involved as I can handle at the moment, for politics and the state of the world have grown rather heavy to me and my brain does not want to let go. To try to write about those issues right now would be too depressing for both me and you, I think. I certainly don’t want to do that to you. Take care! And very importantly, be kind to yourself. I keep saying that, but I really mean it. If we can send magic (wink, wink) through the internet, then consider this a benediction, or a prayer.</p>

January 3, 2021 | https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint.html | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint.html">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="header2">
	<div>
<p>
<i>
In the <a href="https://skyalt.com/blog/repl.html">last article</a>, I wrote about the new IDE and programming language. It's just a prototype(not easy to read C code and many important features are missing), so the next logical move is to re-write it to the production-ready product.
</i></p><p><i>

Coincidentally, <a href="https://www.startupschool.org/">Startup school</a> is announcing YC Build Sprint, starting on August 24. My goal of the Sprint is to rewrite and launch SkyAlt. Can I build IDE in 4 weeks? Hell no, but maybe 8. Let's find out.
</i></p><p><i>

I will program in different fields. From rendering/UI, over network/cryptography, to parser/interpreter. Let the hacking begin!
</i></p></div>



	<h2>Week 1</h2>
	<div><p>
The first thing I wanna build is the ability to run SkyAlt on the server(run apps) and connect from a remote client(rendering, keyboard, mouse). For rendering, I chose SDL, mainly because it supports many operation systems. Network connections are TCP/IP handled by SDL_Net with simple custom protocol. Connections are encrypted. For that, I'm using functions from the OpenSSL library. The client needs a valid key to log-in.
</p><p>

The Protocol synchronize communication so the Client tells the server when it's ready for the next frame data. Also If the frame takes more time to finish, then Server tells the Client how much work on the frame was done and the Client shows the progress. The bottom-left conner shows FPS(frames per seconds) and bandwidth.
</p><p>

Rendering is bases on SDL2, SDL_image, SDL_ttf(fonts). It can draw rectangles, images, texts. The server sends only UTF-8 text, so fonts are on Client only. Every letter of the text is handled by my code(left, right, center align, ...). If apps include images(icons, ...), they are on the server, which sends (as files) them to the client's cache, where they are decompressed and converted into texture.
</p><p>

Also, I have one source code, but thanks to #define I can compile it like a Server(run apps) or a Client(remote, only rendering, mouse, keys) or a ClientServer(all inside).
</p><p>

By end of the week, I optimize the protocol cache for images and texts. Also, I clean up the code a little bit.
</p><p>

The video shows Client-Server where Server is sending commands(there are no apps, yet) what to draw to Client(window). Looks awful, but there is a lot of engineering behind it.

	</video> 



	<h2>Week 2</h2>
	<div><p>
The week starts with working on the dictionary. SkyAlt is dynamically-typed(static typing will be optional later, something like Javascript -&gt; Typescript) and the memory model is an associative array(dictionary data structure, every record has value and sub-records and so on). I chose this model because I care a lot about developer's experience and If you think about it, in statically typed language you have to start with designing data structures and if you run the program it does nothing because there are no algorithms and that's frustrating. I want SkyAlt users to start with algorithms right away and <b>thanks to REPL and preview they can see what they are making from the beginning</b>. Overall time to build an app is the same, but the experience is different.
</p><p>

The next day, I write and run a few extra tests for the dictionary and slowly pivot my focus into integrating the dictionary to the SkyAlt memory model(record - sub-records). I constantly think about performance vs memory footprint for the dictionary.
</p><p>

Then I write .json importer and exporter.
</p><p>


I start working on Parser for the SkyAlt language. I try to parse some simple source codes, fixing a few bugs and it seems to work. So for the next few days, I work on the Interpreter and improving parser as well. I run more and more advanced tests.
</p><p>

There was a problem with the order of parsing assets(files), when one app uses multiple assets and that assets use other assets and there can be cycles, but around an hour later I solve it.
</p><p>

The video shows allocating 10M records and creating 5 sub-records for everyone. Then it's computing summary of one sub-record: The first 'sum' is for pure implementation in C, the second 'sum' is for search sub-record through the dictionary. Then It's just deallocating memory.

	<h2>Week 3</h2>
	<div><p>
I start the week with implementing catching pressed keys, mouse buttons &amp; position on Client and sending them on Server. The great thing about SDL is that everything is UTF-8(across different OSs).
</p><p>

Then I try to compile code on Linux. I fixed a lot of bugs and many warnings(GCC is more aggressive than MSVC). I also optimized a few places in code so there is less (de)alloc every frame. FPS goes up. This is probably the worst day working on this project so far. So many things were broken.
</p><p>

The next day I focus on the UI layout system. Early on working on project I set that <b>content is more important than design</b>(layout, shapes, colors). So when you work with SkyAlt language, It's super easy to create GUI and define layouts under them, but of course there are tradeoffs. There is only one layout(grid layout), but it can expand/stretch(different screen sizes). I end up the day with a system where you can set column/row size and optional maximum size. Also, It's super easy for developers to change column/row size.
</p><p>

Implementing scrolling(mouse wheel, arrows, home/end/pageUp/pageDown) was quick since most of the parts already exist, so I only connect them together.
</p><p>

I start working on a Single-line editbox - text selection, copy/paste.
</p><p>


I finish the week by fixing bugs, few performance issues and cleaning the code. I'm not really making aggressive optimizations, because <b>I need to see the big picture first</b>. I also avoid multi-threading.
</p><p>

Sorry, I didn't make a video.
	</p></div>



	<h2>Week 4</h2>
	<div><p>
Ok, 4th week, here we come.
</p><p>

I had to rewrite code that handling layouts. It's using less memory, hopefully, bug-free and cleaner code.
</p><p>

I fixed text-align, working with keys and implemented dialogs(center screen or like a context menu). Also, You can change GUI theme colors.
</p><p>

The Info panel on the client shows server FPS. This is not the real number of frames computed, because it computes only frames which the client needs(max. 60), but it's a number of frames which the server is possible to compute.
</p><p>

I start working on the Multi-line editbox - text selection, copy/paste. You can also scroll text! Uff;)
</p><p>

The video shows work in progress Settings app, where you will be able to change language, theme, etc. You can also change the row size. That was just for testing purposes, I've removed it after capturing video.
	</p></div>
	<video controls="" poster="https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint/26.png">
	<source src="https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint/26.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video> 



	<h2>Week 5</h2>
	<div><p>
When you work hard for a few weeks, why not work harder?
</p><p>

When you change language, all assets are automatically re-parse. Also, You can put an image(file) into an asset folder and App can render it.
</p><p>

I've finished the Settings app from the previous week and make the Menu app(New/Open project, Settings, About, etc.). You can switch between Windowed / Fullscreen mode and save app(code, data, translations). Also I make the Translation app, where you can translate apps to different languages.
</p><p>

I rewrite how URL works: checking for cycles, safely removing records and better language syntax. I hope, I will not have to touch it again.
</p><p>

I implement Context help - when you move the mouse over the button, edit-box, etc. the description shows up with little delay.
</p><p>

I try making a more advanced version of multi-line edit-box to use it as a code editor. So I add line numbers, syntax highlighting, showing warnings/errors in code. I add auto-break lines that are longer than a view into Multi-line. Also work on selections: 2 clicks for selecting a word and 3 clicks for the line.
</p><p>

The next day I start implementing Folding. When you call a function in source-code, you can "expand" it and It will show you the body of the function.
</p><p>

I spend some time putting down CPU usage when the user is not active. When the user stops moving the mouse and pressing keys, it will go to 0%(no drawing) and every 5seconds it will go 0.2%(drawing one frame, so the user can see possible new/changed data) =&gt; minimum CPU clock speed. On another side, When the user is active, then it renders 60 frames per second and has a maximum CPU clock speed. That's how ImGui works. I will try to deal with that later.
</p><p>

I finally trace one stupid memory-leak which I knew of for over a week. I fixed save() when record(text) has quote character inside.
</p><p>

For the first time, my TODO list starts to become shorter.
</p><p>

The video shows basic code editor with (un)folding capability. There is a small bug which I fixed after making this video: when I unfold function, it unfolds all function with the same name.
	</p></div>

	<source src="https://skyalt.com/blog/sprint/41.mp4" type="video/mp4">
	</video> 



	<h2>Week 6</h2>
	<div><p>
Still motivated, I'm not slowing down!
</p><p>

I start with the cleaning code from the previous week. I compile it for Linux and discover some new warnings in code and few bugs.
</p><p>

I implement accounts. You can log-in with a username and 128bits key. Also, the Client window remembers position and size when it's closed and opened again.
</p><p>

I work on REPL. You can Alt+click into code and it will execute code up to that line and show you in preview. You can also Alt+click into app preview and it will unfold code to the line which draws the part of the app. It works well and it's quick. Although it doesn't work very well when an app has more than one layer(context menu, dialogs). I'll back into that later.
</p><p>

I also fix not-precise syntax/error highlights and change syntax highlight colors. Also, I fix the saving/reading json file. This is quite normal, I change code in one part and in some cases, I will have to change some other parts of the code as well. That's why I optimize code only when it hurts because optimize code is harder to rewrite.
</p><p>

The video shows simple IDE, where you can edit code(left) and see a preview of the app(right). You can also see folding and REPL in action.

	<h2>Week 7</h2>
	<div><p>
On Monday, I noticed that If the code in SkyAlt language had errors, the Interpreter would still execute it. So I quickly fix that.
I also implement key shortcuts(copy, cut, paste, etc.) and text selection with arrows. Also, the parser will not run when you are …</p></div></div></div>

  <p><time datetime="2021-01-02 00:00:00 +0000">January 02, 2021</time>
    
  </p>

  
  

  <p>I recently got a question whether it’s possible to configure <a href="https://vlaaad.github.io/vlaaad.github.io/reveal/">Reveal</a> in such a way that it works across 3 machines:</p>
<ul>
  <li>machine A runs editor;</li>
  <li>machine B runs only Reveal;</li>
  <li>machine C runs target server.</li>
</ul>

<p>It also reminded me of <a href="https://suvratapte.com/nREPL-middleware/">an article</a> I read awhile ago about nREPL middlewares that gives a good overview of how those work, but unfortunately contains a mistake in a section where it discusses Clojure REPL, where it states that:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>there is no easy way to start this REPL on a socket. So if you are using this REPL, you cannot connect to it from remote machines. So the default REPL clearly cannot be used as your daily development REPL. That is where the need for other types of REPLs comes in.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I enjoy using simple tooling, and REPL is a wonderful example of such a concept (it’s not a single tool really) that enables a variety of non-trivial use-cases. In this post I’ll try to explain what makes it special as well as give an example of using the configurability of REPL.</p>

<h2 id="what-repl-is-what-nrepl-isnt">What REPL is, what nREPL isn’t</h2>

<p>REPL is Read-Eval-Print Loop, a programming environment that enables you to interact with a running Clojure program and modify it by evaluating one code expression at a time. An important characteristic of REPL is that every part of REP is independent and thus swappable:</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Read</em> is a protocol on character streams — one of the most widely available and simple transports. You can swap Read easily: consume from standart input, consume from network, consume from pre-recorded REPL interaction to replay it etc;</li>
  <li><em>Eval</em> is the full power of Clojure, and you can augment it when necessary by e.g. starting new REPLs with <a href="https://github.com/TristeFigure/lexikon/blob/master/src/lexikon/core.clj#L129-L148">lexical scope</a> which might be seen as a break point on steroids;</li>
  <li><em>Print</em> is a way to show the output of code evaluation to the user, by default it transforms values to text, but you can do much more than that with a tool like <a href="https://vlaaad.github.io/vlaaad.github.io/reveal/">Reveal</a> that acts as a REPL output panel that enables inspection and visualization super powers;</li>
</ul>

<p>nREPL, despite its name, is not a REPL, it’s a eval RPC server. It does not have independent Read Eval and Print concepts, instead its main building blocks are <a href="https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.8/design/handlers.html">handlers</a>, <a href="https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.8/design/transports.html">transport</a> and <a href="https://nrepl.org/nrepl/0.8/design/middleware.html">middlewares</a>. It’s a different model that, like REPL, gives some powers and takes some powers away. I personally find REPL model simpler, more powerful and more approachable, so I use it, but YMMV.</p>

<h2 id="starting-repl-socket-server">Starting REPL socket server</h2>

<p>It is trivial to start a REPL that can be reached from a remote machine, you won’t even need any external dependencies, it’s all there in <a href="https://clojure.github.io/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core.server/start-server">clojure.core.server</a> namespace. The easiest way to start it is to specify a JVM property that <a href="https://clojure.org/reference/repl_and_main#_launching_a_socket_server">starts socket server</a> automatically on the JVM startup, but for simplicity we will call it directly as a function:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>clj <span>\</span>
<span>-X</span> clojure.core.server/start-server <span>\</span>
:name <span>'"repl"'</span> <span>\</span>
:port 5555 <span>\</span>
:accept clojure.core.server/repl <span>\</span>
:server-daemon <span>false</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>This <a href="https://insideclojure.org/2020/09/04/clj-exec/">clj-exec</a> invocation supplies all required args to <code>clojure.core.server/start-server</code> fn:</p>
<ul>
  <li><code>:name</code> is a server identifier that can be used to stop the server;</li>
  <li><code>:port</code> is a socket REPL port;</li>
  <li><code>:accept</code> is a symbol indicating a repl function.</li>
</ul>

<p>Remaining <code>:server-daemon</code> argument is needed to keep the JVM running while REPL server is active, you won’t need this argument if you are using <code>start-server</code> from the REPL.</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with clj-exec, this invocation is analogous to a following clojure form:</p>
<div><div><pre><code><span>(</span><span>clojure.core.server/start-server</span><span>
  </span><span>'</span><span>{</span><span>:name</span><span> </span><span>"repl"</span><span>
    </span><span>:port</span><span> </span><span>5555</span><span>
    </span><span>:accept</span><span> </span><span>clojure.core.server/repl</span><span>
    </span><span>:server-daemon</span><span> </span><span>false</span><span>})</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="connecting-to-remote-socket-repl">Connecting to remote socket REPL</h2>

<p>You can connect to it using <code>nc</code> and start sending forms:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>nc localhost 5555
user=&gt; (+ 1 2 3)
6
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>How about nesting REPLs to connect to this REPL server from another clojure REPL? There is no built-in way to do it, but the implementation of <a href="https://github.com/vlaaad/remote-repl">REPL client</a> is less than 50 lines of code, thanks to the simplicity of REPL concept. Let’s try it out:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>clj \
-Sdeps '{:deps {vlaaad/remote-repl {:mvn/version "1.1"}}}'
Clojure 1.10.1
user=&gt; (require '[vlaaad.remote-repl :as rr])
nil
user=&gt; (rr/repl :port 5555)
;; at this point, forms sent to the repl are evaluated in the remote process
user=&gt; clojure.core.server/*session*
{:server repl, :client "1"}
user=&gt; :repl/quit
;; now we are back to evaluating in our local process.
nil
user=&gt; 
</code></pre></div></div>



<p>How about using Reveal to connect to this server? Reveal is a tool that needs structured REPL output to process it properly, it can’t really work on REPL prompts like <code>user=&gt;</code>. There is <a href="https://oli.me.uk/clojure-socket-prepl-cookbook/">prepl</a> (programmable REPL), which is a socket REPL with output structured as edn maps — bread and butter of Clojure. To connect Reveal to remote socket REPL server it needs to be a prepl, like that:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>clj <span>\</span>
<span>-X</span> clojure.core.server/start-server <span>\</span>
:name <span>'"repl"'</span> <span>\</span>
:port 5555 <span>\</span>
:accept clojure.core.server/io-prepl <span>\</span>
:server-daemon <span>false</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>If you are curious how this REPL’s output looks like, here is an example at the command line:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>clj <span>\</span>
<span>-Sdeps</span> <span>'{:deps {vlaaad/remote-repl {:mvn/version "1.1"}}}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-X</span> vlaaad.remote-repl/repl <span>\</span>
:port 5555

<span>(</span>+ 1 2 3<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>:tag :ret, :val <span>"6"</span>, :ns <span>"user"</span>, :ms 9, :form <span>"(+ 1 2 3)"</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Reveal can talk to this prepl server out of the box with its <a href="https://vlaaad.github.io/reveal/#remote-prepl">remote-prepl</a>:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>clj <span>\</span>
<span>-Sdeps</span> <span>'{:deps {vlaaad/reveal {:mvn/version "1.2.182"}}}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-X</span> vlaaad.reveal/remote-prepl <span>\</span>
:port 5555

<span>(</span>+ 1 2 3<span>)</span>
<span>{</span>:tag :ret, :val 6, :ns <span>"user"</span>, :ms 2, :form <span>"(+ 1 2 3)"</span><span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Console output is the same, but there is now a Reveal window that shows evaluations results:</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/2021-01-02/remote-prepl.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="reveal-clients-clients">Reveal client’s clients</h2>

<p>Now, lets get back to the original question of having REPL configuration where editor is on machine A, Reveal on machine B and target process on machine C. We already have most of the pieces laid out, the only missing part is how to setup reveal to run as a server that is itself a client, and that part is <code>:args</code> — additional arguments to a repl function specified by <code>:accept</code> symbol.</p>

<p>Lets setup it piece by piece. I’ll use everything on the same machine because I’m lazy, but the real world example will differ only in having to specify <code>:host</code> in addition to <code>:port</code> in clients. Here is machine C with ClojureScript prepl just for fun:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>clj <span>\</span>
<span>-Sdeps</span> <span>'{:deps {org.clojure/clojurescript {:mvn/version "1.10.764"}}}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-X</span> clojure.core.server/start-server <span>\</span>
:name <span>'"cljs"'</span> <span>\</span>
:accept cljs.server.browser/prepl <span>\</span>
:port 5555 <span>\</span>
:server-daemon <span>false</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Machine B, that uses Reveal to connect to C while acting as a REPL server:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>clj <span>\</span>
<span>-Sdeps</span> <span>'{:deps {vlaaad/reveal {:mvn/version "1.2.182"}}}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-X</span> clojure.core.server/start-server <span>\</span>
:name <span>'"reveal"'</span> <span>\</span>
:accept vlaaad.reveal/remote-prepl <span>\</span>
:args <span>'[:port 5555]'</span> <span>\</span>
:port 6666 <span>\</span>
:server-daemon <span>false</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we can connect from machine A to machine B on port <code>6666</code>, and that will make it open a Reveal window with connection to machine C:</p>
<div><div><pre><code>clj <span>\</span>
<span>-Sdeps</span> <span>'{:deps {vlaaad/remote-repl {:mvn/version "1.1"}}}'</span> <span>\</span>
<span>-X</span> vlaaad.remote-repl/repl <span>\</span>
:port 6666
</code></pre></div></div>
<p>Evaluating code like <code>js/window</code> on machine A will make ClojureScript evaluate code in the browser on machine C and send it to machine B where Reveal will show the output:</p>

<p><img src="https://vlaaad.github.io/assets/2021-01-02/cljs-prepl.png" alt=""></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Once I’ve got the simplicity of REPL, I’ve got a lot more power at my disposal, with a significantly smaller cognitive footprint and improved understanding of underlying stack (e.g. Clojure evaluation semantics). If you don’t know it, you don’t know it; if you know it, you enjoy it.</p>

<p>What do you think?</p>

We just need to focus on the scope of the function, the inputs, and the outputs. We don't need to worry about prior state.</p><p>The first thing you will notice in Clojure is how many parens there are and how dense the code is. It takes some getting used to, but the parens have a lot of benefits.</p><p>We can always rewrite syntax repetition with macros and there are plenty of techniques for reducing the number of parens including "threading" operators like <code>-&gt;&gt;</code>. The following is equivalent to the header.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>-&gt;&gt;</span> but<br>     there<br>     are<br>     so<br>     many<br>     parens<span>)</span></code></pre><p>Function calls are different in Clojure than most languages. It is represented by a list where the first element is the function and the rest are the arguments to that function.</p><pre><code><br><span>(</span><span>defn</span> my-function<br>  <span>[</span>arg1 arg2<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>str</span> arg1 arg2<span>)</span><span>)</span><p><span>(</span>my-function <span>"first"</span> <span>"second"</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>The syntax is extremely regular. It's natural to wrap a function in another function.</p><pre><code><span>(</span>my-function <span>(</span>my-function <span>"first"</span> <span>"second"</span><span>)</span> <span>"third"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Since all functions including built in functions are called the same way, it's easy to swap any function out with another, including built-ins.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>42</span><span>)</span> <span>"True"</span> <span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span>my-if <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>42</span> <span>42</span><span>)</span> <span>"True"</span> <span>"False"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>The parens replace a lot of the curly brace notation in other languages.</p><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>myFunction</span><span>(</span><span>arg1<span>,</span> arg2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>if</span> <span>(</span>arg1<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>return</span> arg1<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>return</span> arg2<span>;</span><br>  <span>}</span><br><span>}</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span> my-function<br>  <span>[</span>arg1 arg2<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>if</span> <span>(</span><span>not</span> <span>(</span>blank? arg1<span>)</span><span>)</span><br>     arg1<br>     arg2<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Go has support for asynchronous "go channels" due to special syntax baked into the language. Clojure added the same features and syntax as a third party library. In Javascript you have to wait for syntax to be adopted or use a transpiler but in Clojure it could by implemented by anyone as a library.</p><pre><code>messages <span>:=</span> <span>make</span><span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>string</span><span>)</span><br><span>go</span> <span>func</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> messages <span>&lt;-</span> <span>"ping"</span> <span>}</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>msg <span>:=</span> <span>&lt;-</span>messages<br>fmt<span>.</span><span>Println</span><span>(</span>msg<span>)</span></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span>def c <span>(</span><span>chan</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>go</span> <span>(</span><span>&gt;</span><span>!</span> c <span>"hello"</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>println</span> <span>(</span><span>&lt;</span><span>!</span><span>!</span> c<span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Clojure is really good at extracting data from maps and sequences. It is a really good for "data programs", that are mostly calling an API, transforming a sequence, and calling another API.</p><h2>Positional Destructuring</h2><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> large-list '<span>(</span><span>1</span> <span>2</span> <span>3</span> <span>4</span> <span>5</span> <span>6</span> <span>7</span> <span>8</span> <span>9</span> <span>10</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><br><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span><span>[</span><span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>]</span> large-list<span>]</span><br>  <span>(</span><span>str</span> <span>a</span> <span>b</span> <span>c</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></code></pre><h2>Destructuring with named optional parameters and defaults</h2><pre><code><span>(</span><span>defn</span> configure <span>[</span><span>val</span> options<span>]</span><br><span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>[</span><span>{</span><span>:keys</span> <span>[</span>debug verbose<span>]</span><br>       <span>:or</span> <span>{</span>debug <span>false</span><span>,</span> verbose <span>false</span><span>}</span><span>}</span> options<span>]</span><br><span>(</span><span>str</span> <span>"val="</span> <span>val</span> <span>" debug="</span>debug <span>" verbose="</span>verbose<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><p><span>(</span>configure <span>"foo!"</span> <span>{</span><span>:debug</span> <span>true</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>Having a fast feedback loop is crucial to be productive. When I first started programming I would write some code, compile, then manually test my changes, maybe with a debugger. Then I discovered TDD with an auto test runner, which gave me a faster feedback loop, since I could be reasonably confident my program worked without having to recompile for every change. The fastest feedback loop I've discovered so far is the Clojure REPL with editor integration. With Emacs and CIDER I can execute code in my editor as I write it. Having a fast feedback loop for exploratory coding before writing tests helps me be a lot more productive and write higher quality code. Other languages also have REPLs but I feel Clojure is uniquely well suited to this workflow because of its immutable functional nature.</p><p>Testing is simpler when most things are maps and pure functions. This is an example from the "Gilded Rose Kata".</p><pre><code>    <span>@Test</span> <span>public</span> <span>void</span><br>        <span>BackstagePassQualityControl</span> qualityControl <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>BackstagePassQualityControl</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p>    <span>shouldNeverIncreaseQualityToMoreThanFifty</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br><span>Item</span> backstagePass <span>=</span> <span>anItem</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>                <span>.</span><span>withName</span><span>(</span>BACKSTAGE_PASS_ITEM_NAME<span>)</span><br>                <span>.</span><span>build</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><br>        backstagePass<span>.</span><span>setSellIn</span><span>(</span>FIVE_DAYS<span>)</span><span>;</span><br>        backstagePass<span>.</span><span>setQuality</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p>        qualityControl<span>.</span><span>updateQualityFor</span><span>(</span>backstagePass<span>)</span><span>;</span></p><p>        <span>assertThat</span><span>(</span>backstagePass<span>.</span><span>getQuality</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>,</span> <span>is</span><span>(</span><span>50</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span></p></code></pre><pre><code><span>(</span><span>def</span> max-quality-pass<br>  <span>{</span><span>:quality</span> <span>50</span><br>   <span>:sell-in</span> <span>5</span><span>}</span><span>)</span><p> <span>(</span>deftest test-backstage-pass-peak<br>  <span>(</span>testing <span>"Quality never goes over 50"</span><br>    <span>(</span>is <span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>50</span> <span>(</span><span>:quality</span> <span>(</span>i/update-item max-quality-pass<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span></p></code></pre><p>Clojure has good interop with the worlds most popular languages. You can tap into the Java ecosystem for foundational libraries like the AWS SDK or database clients. Clojurescript has an excellent wrapper around React called Reagent. You can write your entire stack in Clojure, meaning a single person can be extremely productive. The interop story isn't perfect though: although it works technically, the difference between the programming models does have some friction. This can usually be solved by writing a wrapper.</p><pre><code><span>(</span>System/getProperty <span>"java.vm.version"</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>Now that Moore's Law is ending, we can't rely on speed increases of a single core anymore. We need to write code that can take advantage of multiple cores and that can correctly run in parallel. I don't feel good about using some languages like Python or Javascript that are single inherently single threaded. Languages like Java or C++, which weren't designed with concurrency in mind are hard to use correctly. Clojure's data structures are thread safe by default and it has numerous concurrency primitives. The language design de-emphasis the us of state and emphasizes the use of values instead.</p><p>I initially disliked clojure coming from my semi strongly typed Java and C++. If you use types you have to consider their downsides and the cost of the coupling introduced by type information flowing through your program. After using Clojure, I find things like the "builder pattern" contrived. There is usually only a few types of true "data" and the rest of the program are subsets and combinations of the data, which don't always deserve an explicit name or type. I feel using languages that encourage classes encourages you to make abstractions too early, and making the wrong abstraction is much worse than repetition. A lot of the "bugs" you catch at compile time are often self inflicted bookeeping mistakes due to the increased complexity. I think testing is a much stronger form of software validation and will catch the errors that types would have.</p><p>The design choices and tradeoffs in Clojure were made deliberately. There are much fewer sharp edges and historical accidents in Clojure than any other language I've used. Clojure is opinionated on the way you write software but if you buy into that opinion, using pure functions and immutable data structures, the experience is very streamlined.</p><p>I remember having to learn the difference between comparing primitives and objects in Java. Code like this feels unintuitive.</p><h2>Equality</h2><pre><code><span>Integer</span> a <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Integer</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><br><span>Integer</span> b <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>Integer</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><p><span>if</span> <span>(</span>a <span>==</span> b<span>)</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>if</span> <span>(</span>a<span>.</span><span>equals</span><span>(</span>b<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"True"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>System</span><span>.</span>out<span>.</span><span>println</span><span>(</span><span>"False"</span><span>)</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre><p>Comparing object equality is almost never what I want to do and I don't think it's a good default behavior.</p><pre><code><br><span>(</span><span>{</span>foo<span>:</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span> <span>===</span> <span>{</span>foo<span>:</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>This does what I expect, and I don't need to know the difference between <code>=</code>, <code>equals</code>, <code>==</code>, <code>===</code>, <code>deepEqual</code>, and <code>deepStrictEqual</code>.</p><pre><code><span>(</span><span>=</span> <span>{</span><span>:foo</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span> <span>{</span><span>:foo</span> <span>"bar"</span><span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre><p>There is only <code>=</code> for structural equality and no assignment operator. The only <code>false</code> value is <code>nil</code> and everything else is <code>true</code>.</p><h2>Polymorphism without classes</h2><p>Clojure is described as having "polymorphism a la carte", which means it has the benefits of inheritance and interface without being forced to use it and without many of the downsides.</p><p>In Java, we could do something like this to represent a shape that can be extended in other areas of the program.</p><pre><code><span>abstract</span> <span>class</span> <span>Shape</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>public</span> <span>double</span> <span>area</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>        <span>return</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span><br><span>}</span><p><span>class</span> <span>Rectangle</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Shape</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>protected</span> <span>int</span> width<span>,</span> height<span>;</span></p><p>    <span>public</span> <span>Rectangle</span><span>(</span><span>int</span> width<span>,</span> <span>int</span> height<span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>        <span>this</span><span>.</span>width <span>=</span> width<span>;</span> <span>this</span><span>.</span>height <span>=</span> height<span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span></p><p>    <span>public</span> <span>double</span> <span>area</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>        <span>return</span> width <span>*</span> height<span>;</span><br>    <span>}</span><br><span>}</span></p><p><span>class</span> <span>Triangle</span> <span>extends</span> <span>Shape</span> <span>{</span><br>    <span>protected</span> <span>int</span> a<span>,</span> b<span>,</span> c<span>;</span></p><p>    <span>public</span> <span>Triangle</span><span>(</span><span>in…</span></p></code></pre></div></section></main></div></div>

Even if we’re unsatisfied with the current state of things, we can see our future brighter. Even if we’re fat and currently eating the 5th donut, we can feel somehow good about ourselves because we’re planning to stop doing this after a certain date.</p><p>The problem with resolutions is that we overestimate our abilities and time available in the future. We think that in the future we'll have much more time than right now. We make this mistake because we think about our future plans only in vague and unclear terms, but we’ll be probably just as busy as we are now.</p><p>We also think that our willpower will be much stronger than now. We think we won’t give up this time. It will be different.</p><p>This lets us get away with being lazy now and not trying. We basically throw all the effort on our future selves. However, when the date arrives and it’s time to change, most of us can’t do it.</p><p>Even if the previous paragraphs might sound discouraging, we still think that New Year’s resolutions can work. Drawing a thick line behind your past is helpful in changing yourself.</p><p>However, you need to think about New Year’s resolutions differently.</p><h2>How to make New Year’s resolutions work</h2><h3>1. Don’t say what the hell</h3><p><a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-start-working-after-you-procrastinated-the-whole-day">As we’ve covered here</a>, when people screw up something (like their diet) they say&nbsp;<em>what the hell</em>&nbsp;and binge eat everything.</p><p>This is the common reason why New Year’s resolutions fail. Once people fail at doing their new chosen behavior, they start thinking that it doesn’t matter now, and stop trying (or resume their bad habits again).</p><p>For example, people create a complicated “perfect” morning routine: Wake up at 6 am, do yoga for 15 minutes, write in a diary, take a cold shower... A few days in, they don’t wake up on time and they say:&nbsp;<em>I failed to wake up on time, my routine can’t be perfect anymore,</em>&nbsp;and they don’t do anything else. But it doesn’t have to be that way.</p><p>Let’s say you decide you finally want to start publishing your blog posts and you commit to writing for 30 minutes every day. You’re two weeks in and you forgot to write yesterday. Most people will be really mad about not writing yesterday and many will say:&nbsp;<em>I screwed up, I didn’t follow the plan</em>, and then they don’t write that day or the next day, and then stop writing altogether.</p><p><strong>However, you don’t need to be perfect. That wasn’t the goal. The goal was to publish on your blog. You can still do that. Missing one day doesn’t mean anything in the long run.</strong></p><p>If you fail, forgive yourself and instead of saying&nbsp;<em>what the hell</em>, resume right now or the next day.</p><p>At this point in time, you might also not feel like you want to get after the original goal anymore. In this case, examine why you wanted to achieve the goal in the first place. Weak or impersonal reasons often lead to abandoning it rather quickly.</p><p>That’s why you should only choose to change the most painful things or pursue the things you want the most. Reasons like I heard it’s good for my career, my family wants me to do it, or it’s good to know multiple languages won’t cut it. Your reasons for changing should be strong and personal.</p><p>When you have strong reasons for why you wanted to change, you realize that doing anything at all is better than doing nothing. You understand that you don’t have to say&nbsp;<em>what the hell</em>&nbsp;because the goal wasn’t to be perfect, but better.</p><h3>2. Know that difficult times will come</h3><p><a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/how-to-change-yourself">As we’ve covered in How to change yourself</a>, the first wave of inspiration and motivation runs out eventually. This is when the real progress happens.</p><p>In the beginning, when everything is going great, we start wearing rose tinted glasses that make us overestimate our ability to control and change ourselves.</p><p>We think that we know it all.</p><p>The bad news is that after the first thrill runs out (usually takes a week or two), it gets more difficult. This is also when most people fail.</p><p>When it gets more difficult, that’s when you need to use your discipline to stick through with the behavior.</p><p>We tell you this not to discourage you, but to help you stay realistic. When you know that there will be some hard days, you won’t be surprised. Many people quit because they think everything will go smoothly and then they hit an obstacle and bail.</p><p>The good news is, if you stick with your new behavior for 3-4 weeks, it will become significantly easier later on.</p><p>Expect that you’ll need to use your willpower to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/blog/3-tricks-to-start-working-despite-not-feeling-like-it">act despite not feeling motivated.</a></p><h3>3. Mindset shift: Start thinking about helping your future self</h3><p>When the difficult times come, we often get into a mindset of despising the endeavors we’ve decided to pursue. We feel like we&nbsp;<em>have to</em>&nbsp;do them and we don’t want to. We would rather do something easy like watching Netflix, playing video games, or checking social media.</p><p>You already know that you should remind yourself why you wanted to make a change in the first place. However, sometimes even this doesn’t help. Certain activities that are beneficial for you in the long term don’t feel great in the moment.</p><p>There is a simple mindset shift that can make hard things easier to do:&nbsp;<strong>You’re helping your future self.</strong></p><p>When you start thinking about helping your future self, instead of thinking about just suffering now with no payoff, everything gets easier.</p><p>Think about it in this way: Whenever you procrastinate, you make things harder for your future self. There isn’t a way to escape responsibilities forever. On the other hand, if you start working consistently, you make it easier for your future self. Additionally, your future self will eventually become your present self. It’s still you after all.</p><p>Everything you are or have is the result of the choices your past self made for you.</p><p>Eating healthy so you’re not fat?&nbsp;<em>Thank your past self for that.</em></p><p>Learned a valuable skill and can get a job easily?&nbsp;<em>Thanks, past me, I can buy nice things.</em></p><p>Finished a task ahead of deadline?&nbsp;<em>Great, I can now enjoy free time.</em></p><p>Next time, you feel like you don’t feel like working, remind yourself that every task you do successfully will help your future self. And when you get to that point in the future, you'll feel proud of the choices you made.</p><h3>4. Become accountable to someone</h3><p>One of the easiest ways to stick with a behavior is by becoming accountable to someone else.</p><p>We think we can hold ourselves accountable, but that often fails in reality. We’re great at coming up with rationalizations for why we ate that cake, skipped that workout, or checked social media in the middle of our workday.</p><p>I didn’t do it because ____________. We can always come up with good reasons for why we didn’t do something. We do this to protect our conscience because we don’t like to face the truth.</p><p>When you become accountable to someone else, however, rationalizations become way more difficult. The other person can easily tell whether you’re bullsh*ting or not.</p><p>Here are some ways to use accountability to your advantage.</p><h4>1. Take on a new habit with a friend</h4><p>One frequent use of this is the "gym buddy system." It can be hard to get ourselves to do a hard activity like working out, and commit to it.</p><p>However, if we make a pact with a friend to show up every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday after work and do a workout, we add a bit of extra pressure that helps us actually show up. We don't want to disappoint our friend, do we?</p><p>Do you have a friend who wants to do something you also want to do? Working out, journalling, studying...?</p><p>Make an agreement, set a time, and hold each other accountable!</p><h4>2. Make a bet</h4><p>Another way to motivate yourself can be making a bet.</p><p>You can also do this with friends or you can use a service like&nbsp;<a href="https://www.stickk.com/">StickK</a>or&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beeminder.com/">Beeminder.com</a>.</p><p>Both services allow you to place a financial bet - if I don't do X, I will lose X money.</p><p>Beeminder gets data from a variety of sources - you can set a goal of writing a certain number of words every day or running X miles and connect it to Google docs or Strava, and if you don't honor your commitment, you'll lose money.</p><p>Sometimes pressure is productive. Want to heighten the stakes? Make a bet.</p><h4>3. Join Deschool program</h4><p>If you want to get serious about this,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.deprocrastination.co/program">join our Deprocrastination Deschool.</a>&nbsp;We'll hold you accountable and help you make the changes you need to make.</p><p>We’re launching the next run on the 4th of January.</p><p>First, we will help you figure out why you procrastinate.</p><p>Then each week, we'll help you find 1-2 changes that you can make to improve your productivity and procrastinate less.

<p><em>Dec 31, 2020</em></p>
<p>Got a web app responding too slowly because of a database query?
The query plan is what you'd want to look at.
Let's look at the execution plan that Postgres shows you when you
use the EXPLAIN statement and see how to interpret that.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/using-explain.html">Postgres documentation on using EXPLAIN</a>
is excellent, but I thought writing a concise version will serve as a note to my future self.
To start off, let's run with a simple schema of three tables: (a) Users,
(b) Articles, and (c) Orders.</p>
<pre><code>users:
 id |      email
----+------------------
  1 | jon@example.com
  2 | Jane@example.com
</code></pre>

<pre><code>articles:
 id |    name
----+-------------
  1 | Playstation
  2 | Xbox
</code></pre>

<pre><code>orders:
 id | user_id | article_id | qty
----+---------+------------+-----
  1 |       1 |          1 |   2
  2 |       1 |          2 |   1
  3 |       2 |          1 |   4
  4 |       2 |          2 |   3
</code></pre>

<p>Suppose we want to query the <code>users</code> table by the email address, the plan that
postgres generates is:</p>
<pre><code>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='jon@example.com';
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Index Scan using users_email_index on users  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=1 width=222)
   Index Cond: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
</code></pre>

<p>Since we have an index on the email column, postgres has decided to use that
to search the users table. If we didn't have that index, it would do a sequential
scan over the entire table:</p>
<pre><code>EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM users WHERE email='jon@example.com';
----------------------------------------------------------
 Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..14.00 rows=2 width=222)
   Filter: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
</code></pre>

<p>To get all the orders of a user, the query plan is:</p>
<pre><code> EXPLAIN SELECT *
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN users
        ON orders.user_id=users.id
    WHERE users.email='jon@example.com';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=0.30..40.57 rows=6 width=238)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using users_email_index on users  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=1 width=222)
         Index Cond: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using orders_userid_index on orders  (cost=0.15..32.31 rows=9 width=16)
         Index Cond: (user_id = users.id)
</code></pre>

<p>What's going on here? First, postgres is using the index on the email column
to search the users table for users for email jon@example.com.
For each matching row (we expect a single matching row in this example),
an index scan is performed over the orders table get all orders for that user id.
Translated to pseudocode:</p>
<pre><code>for user in users.filter(email='jon@example.com'): # uses the email index
    for order in orders.filter(user_id=user.id): # uses the userid index
        yield (user, order)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's try joining all the three tables to get the full details of all the orders of a user:</p>
<pre><code>EXPLAIN SELECT *
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN users
        ON orders.user_id=users.id
    INNER JOIN articles
        ON orders.article_id=articles.id
    WHERE users.email='jon@example.com';
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=0.45..41.71 rows=6 width=460)
   -&gt;  Nested Loop  (cost=0.30..40.57 rows=6 width=238)
         -&gt;  Index Scan using users_email_index on users  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=1 width=222)
               Index Cond: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
         -&gt;  Index Scan using orders_userid_index on orders  (cost=0.15..32.31 rows=9 width=16)
               Index Cond: (user_id = users.id)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using articles_pkey on articles  (cost=0.15..0.19 rows=1 width=222)
         Index Cond: (id = orders.article_id)
</code></pre>

<p>This is similar to joining the two tables, but we have another loop to join the third table.
In pseudocode, this is what's going on:</p>
<pre><code>for user in users.filter(email='jon@example.com'): # uses the email index
    for order in orders.filter(user_id=user.id): # uses the userid index
        for article in articles.filter(id=order.article_id): # uses article_id primary key
            yield (user, order, article)
</code></pre>

<p>Instead of an index scan, you might come across a bitmap heap scan like this:</p>
<pre><code> EXPLAIN SELECT *
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN users
        ON orders.user_id=users.id
    WHERE users.email='jon@example.com';
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Nested Loop  (cost=4.37..23.02 rows=6 width=238)
   -&gt;  Index Scan using users_email_index on users  (cost=0.15..8.17 rows=1 width=222)
         Index Cond: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
   -&gt;  Bitmap Heap Scan on orders  (cost=4.22..14.76 rows=9 width=16)
         Recheck Cond: (user_id = users.id)
         -&gt;  Bitmap Index Scan on orders_userid_index  (cost=0.00..4.22 rows=9 width=0)
               Index Cond: (user_id = users.id)
</code></pre>

<p>In a plain index scan, postgres fetches a row pointer from the index and immediately
fetches that row from the table. But with a bitmap index scan, all the tuple pointers
that match the filtering condition are gathered and an in-memory bitmap data structure
is created. From this, the actual tuples in the table are visited in physical location order.
This improves locality of accesses to the table and matters a lot for spinning rust HDDs but
can also help with SSDs too. What's that "recheck condition"? If the bitmap gets large,
postgres converts it to a lossy bitmap that stores only physical pages instead of individual
tuples. So when the tuples are read from the physical pages, postgres has to recheck which
tuples in that page match the filtering condition. Bitmap scans also do well when there
are multiple filtering conditions using ORs and ANDs since the bitmap data structure supports
these operations efficiently.</p>
<p>Postgres collects statistics about the content of the tables. If it expects very few rows
to match the filtering condition, an index scan is preferred. If many rows are expected to
satisfy the filtering condition, a bitmap scan is preferred. If a substantial portion of the table
is likely to be fetched, the sequential scan wins. One of the authors of Postgres, Tom Lane, has
an email thread on <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/12553.1135634231@sss.pgh.pa.us">this topic</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/49024533">three types of joins</a> you're likely to come across in a
query plan are: (a) Nested loop join, (b) Hash join, and (c) Merge join. For example, here is a hash join:</p>
<pre><code> EXPLAIN SELECT *
    FROM orders
    INNER JOIN users
        ON orders.user_id=users.id
    WHERE users.email='jon@example.com';
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 Hash Join  (cost=14.03..47.45 rows=12 width=238)
   Hash Cond: (orders.user_id = users.id)
   -&gt;  Seq Scan on orders  (cost=0.00..28.50 rows=1850 width=16)
   -&gt;  Hash  (cost=14.00..14.00 rows=2 width=222)
         -&gt;  Seq Scan on users  (cost=0.00..14.00 rows=2 width=222)
               Filter: ((email)::text = 'jon@example.com'::text)
</code></pre>

<p>The hash join can be used only when the join condition is the equality operator.
Postgres constructs an in-memory hash table of the filtered users and scans the
orders table and retains those tuples which have a matching user id in the
constructed hash table.</p>
<p>The nested loop is the preferred option when at least one side of the join has very
few matching tuples. Hash join is used when both sides of the join have a large number of tuples.
Merge join is preferred when both sides of the join are large but can be sorted on the joining
condition using an index.</p>

              <p>I often see people believe in their solution and think theirs are better than the others'. They defend their cases without having an exact reason. These situations often create long and meaningless discussions that go nowhere. Often they result in conflicts and people being offended by others' behavior.</p><p>Some people take action and implement their idea. Act fast, fail fast, and learn quicker. But this doesn't work when two or more people discuss how to implement a change or use new hyped technology. When people only talk a bit and implement a new hype, it often ends up with resentment. When we act and embrace failing that fast, we cannot keep someone accountable.</p><p>On the other hand, some people try to get everyone's confirmation to implement something that affects a large group. This strategy doesn't work either. Because it's impossible to get everyone on the same page, each person has a different opinion. When we try convincing everyone, we cannot implement anything at all. We just talk, and decisions come later than we need.</p><p>That's why we need to balance both taking action and asking people to present their opinion on a topic. This balance is achievable with an excellent process. I helped build this balanced process in an organization where we aimed to solve another problem - the lack of feedback. We introduced a process called <strong>Request For Comments (RFC). </strong>It is a common feedback mechanism in the software world presented by the Internet Society (ISOC) and used currently in the Rust language.</p><p>The RFC process uses a document written by someone about their proposal on a topic. It has <strong>a specific timeframe</strong> and <strong>everyone can give feedback</strong> on it. The RFC and feedbacks are posted <strong>publicly</strong>. Everyone can join the discussion. The goal is to include as many people as possible to access more points of view and spread the knowledge simultaneously. The good thing is that people focus on the proposed idea and give their feedback based on facts instead of only beliefs. On the other hand, it has a way bigger effect.</p><p>While the initial goal of the RFC is collecting feedback, I think it achieves a way more significant benefit by only <strong>writing the document itself</strong>. Writing shapes thoughts. Everyone has an opinion on any topic. But people who write their ideas form them into great content that is based on the facts.</p><p>Writing helps to clear the mind. When we write on any topic, we separate our proposal from ourselves. It's still part of us. But since we plan to present it to the public and leave it there forever, we start being careful. And most of the time, we are not starting with blank white paper.</p><p>The RFC processes use either a template or follow one standard style in documents. The aim is to help the authors to explain their plan in a structured way and, at the same time, make giving feedback easier. Each section of the document has its own goal, which helps separate the intent from the idea in a certain way.</p><p>We used <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/educ303x/wiki-old/uploads/Main/SRI_NABC.doc">the NABC model from Stanford</a>. The model starts with defining the <em><strong>N</strong></em>eed, followed by <em><strong>A</strong></em>pproach, <em><strong>B</strong></em>enefits, and lastly, <em><strong>C</strong></em>ompetitors. Separating the Need from the Approach is very smart. While writing the need, the authors have to understand it very well. The approach and benefits sections are pretty straightforward, where authors define their strategy and list down the advantages. Since most people focus on them when they talk about ideas, it's also easy to write. Then the competition section comes. It is the part the authors have to consider competitors of their proposal. Thinking about an alternative solution instead of their suggestion requires people to focus on the problem instead of blindly loving and defending their solutions. With these four parts, the NABC is a pretty good model. But it's not the only one.</p><p>Everyone has different needs. Therefore the formats might differ. Our manager at work also came up with a way more straightforward structure with only four questions to answer. It was only for our team, while the engineering department had the RFC process for a wider audience.</p><p>The RFCs have another effect on the organization. The process seeks a <strong>consent-based </strong>environment,<strong> not a consensus-based </strong>one. If some people care about a topic a lot and come up with a written document that explains many things in detail, everyone can (and should) trust them. The authors shouldn't wait for everyone's confirmation of their proposal. When they get enough feedback, they should be able to continue further with or abandon the idea. It's their decision. Since they prepared the doc and collected many comments on it, they can have a better judgment.</p><p>The process brings <strong>accountability</strong>, as well. Whoever writes the proposal should be kept accountable. When people know that they will be accountable, they tend to approach more carefully and consider different aspects seriously. Holding someone accountable doesn't mean that there will be a blame in case of failure. It only means that they have to follow up on their proposals, make sure it results in some way, and answer questions on the way. Also, most of the time, the RFC process is separated from the implementation process. While the author is accountable for the RFC itself, the implementation can be done by different people, and the RFC author might not be involved in it at all.</p><p>These hidden gems of writing the idea in a structured way and asking people for comments afterward prevents many endless debates. The culture changes with it as well. Instead of endless debates, we create discussions and solutions based on facts. The process prevents people from talking and doing nothing. Even though the RFC process might not be perfect itself, writing is enough to halt the endless and meaningless discussions. It also helps build trust in the community. So, if you are new to the RFC system, start with writing down your proposal. I'm pretty sure that the result will be way better than expected.</p><hr><p>Check out the comments on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25622149">HackerNews</a>.</p><hr><p><em>Cover Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@30daysreplay">30daysreplay Marketingberatung</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/">Unsplash</a></em></p>

<p><span>How many times have I drafted this obituary in my head? Sydney had been dying for years, or so it felt. If you’ve ever seen a dog age, you’ll know: Their death comes too slowly and entirely too fast, all at once.</span></p>
<p><span>The memorials I penned were full of humor and frankness. They captured Sydney’s essence perfectly: her aloofness that later turned to irritability, her tenacity of spirit, her stubborn-yet-sweet refusal to do anything other than what she wanted, to be anything other than what she was.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>They were the words of someone whose dog died a good death, surrounded by loved ones, a hard but correct choice at the end of a gradual decline.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In writing, I would feel a sense of sadness, yes, but also one of relief. I would be ready and, more importantly, so would Sydney. Ending her life would be the humane choice, the only choice, and I would feel at peace with that decision.</span></p>
<p><span>I know death well. We’ve met before, many times. Both of my biological parents, all my grandparents, a cousin, a friend, a mentor, an editor; once, almost, myself.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I know death.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>It doesn’t matter.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>None of my familiarity has ever once lessened the pain of death — no matter how much I prepare, how many times I experience it, whether I see it coming or not. It’s as if I’d been watching a giant bird circle closer in the sky, only to have it pluck me right off the ground.</span></p>
<p><span>I have seen so many of life’s cruelties up close, but death remains the most painful, the most absurd, the most mundane and the cruelest thing to ever happen to me. In all my preparing and rationalizing and sincere belief that death is but a part of life, I seem to forget one simple truth: Life </span><i><span>hurts</span></i><span>.</span></p>

<p><strong>I.</strong></p>
<p><span>There are platitudes people always offer when a pet dies. “She was a good dog” is the first.</span></p>
<p><span>Sydney wasn’t, not really. Sure, she was quiet, and a neat eater and drinker. She didn’t jump all over people when they came in the house, which I appreciated. She never chewed anything she shouldn’t or licked my face excessively. She traveled well. She was calm and gracious with children.</span></p>
<p><span>But the things you think of when you conjure the image of a dog? Sydney wasn’t those things.</span></p>
<p><span>Playful? Nope. She didn’t fetch, she wasn’t interested in toys.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>A happy, wagging tail? Not really. It was a beautiful, classic German Shepherd tail, held high in what a trainer once told me was dominance, not joy.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Constantly by my side? Yes, but not in the puppy-trailing-after-you sort of way. “Stalked” is the most appropriate word for what Sydney did, following me through every room in the house. I always sensed she was plotting a coup, waiting her chance to usurp my authority.</span></p>
<p><span>As for her attitude toward other dogs? </span><span>As L.M. Montgomery wrote (with necessary adjustments), her “paw was against every (dog) and every (dog’s) paw against” her.</span></p>
<p><span>Living with my housemate’s pup taught me how “bitch” evolved its current popular meaning. We went to the vet no fewer than a half dozen times to clean wounds they left on each other. I had to have abscesses drained, punctures patched. They both bore scars of their pitched battles.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Sydney was the fun police. If ever a fellow canine were enjoying itself too much, she would swoop in and put a stop to it. One of my many nicknames for her was Sydvicious.</span></p>
<p><span>She had a particular hatred for the old and weak, a true four-legged social Darwinian. The last time I ever took Sydney to the dog park, she kept eyes on an old, yellow-white fluffball the entire time she sniffed the perimeter of the park. When she had grown bored of the area’s olfactory offerings, she turned her full attention to this luckless creature, hiding under a picnic table. The dog shifted; that was all the provocation Sydney needed: She pounced. The rest of the dogs at the park circled up, yapping the canine version of that old schoolyard chant “Fight! Fight! Fight!” Fur was flying everywhere; Sydney could not be contained. She’d tasted the flesh of her enemy and gone mad with bloodlust.</span></p>
<p><span>My companion, a bar guest of mine, scooped her up in his arms, where she writhed and frothed. Shocked dog guardians stared at us as we beat a hasty retreat under their withering glare, Sydney struggling for freedom the entire way.</span></p>
<p><span>(The other dog was OK, in case you’re wondering, aside from a few chunks of missing fur.) We never went back.</span></p>
<p><span>Sydney did not reserve her aggression for her fellow canines. She bit numerous humans as well, including my late, elderly mother (who was very much alive at the time of the bite) and, once, a jogger’s prominent left ass cheek, mid-stride.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>“Bite” is a strong word — Sydney was a shepherd; she had a herding instinct. Nothing and no one could move in our house without Sydney attempting to corral it using sharp nips at the heels. She terrorized five successive roommates, all meek and quiet females. (Proving she was no woman-hater, Sydney once barred an HVAC man in my very small laundry room and refused to let him move. I drove home from work to free him.)</span></p>
<p><span>As she grew older, Sydney turned her teeth to other, softer and more accessible parts of the body: hands, arms, calves. She began chomping my housemate, whom she had known for 8 years, and, eventually, me. Truly, she raged against the dying of the light.</span></p>
<p><span>It wasn’t biting in the best sense of the word. She never clamped down — she snapped, her way of letting you know she was displeased with whatever was happening.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>When I took her home this year to my dad’s house, my nephews were deeply disappointed. They love dogs, but Sydney did not want to be pet. She did not want to play. She wanted two things: Your food, and to be left alone.</span></p>
<p><span>This was not a dog, my younger nephew moaned, it was a coyote.</span></p>
<p><span>I respected Sydney for her clear communication and boundary-setting. I never took it personally, as others seemed to. Her affection was hard-won, yes, but not nonexistent. It waned with age, but what can you expect from someone who is mostly deaf, partially blind, barely mobile and losing a slow war to skin cancer?&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span>The other thing people say when a pet dies is, “She had a good life.” But did she?</span></p>
<p><span>I was not a great mom to Sydney. I was in my early 20s when I brought her home, a bartender in a tourist town before the recession. I had money to burn, and I burned it mostly on boozy nights out with friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In my quest to never be lonely, I left her alone far too often, for far too long.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I hadn’t yet dealt with the trauma of my youth. I was angry, a lot. I yelled too much and pet her too little — particularly after I moved from humid Florida to arid Colorado and developed an allergy to dogs. I couldn’t risk snuggles without hives, red eyes and a runny nose, though I often did.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I had selected Sydney for two reasons: One, I wanted an older dog and felt that I should therefore take whatever name it came with. I loved Australia during my time there, so Sydney it was.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>What really sealed it is that I saw myself in her. She showed signs of being mistreated, flinching at sudden movements. The shelter staff told me it was likely she was abused. Her kennel card — which I still have — said the couple who turned her in found her wandering on the street. She was surrendered because she jumped fences, they wrote, but I suspect it was because she did not get along with their other dogs: they wanted to spare her the almost certain death attached to a label of aggressive or dangerous.</span></p>
<p><span>When I went to greet her, Sydney was in the cage with a young, lively pit bull. Every time I extended my hand to touch her, it would jump in the way. After a few attempts, she gave up, took a couple steps back and looked at me from the tops of her eyes, almost rolling them, as if to say, “Do you see what I have to deal with here?”</span></p>
<p><span>From that moment, she was mine.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>I was still naive enough to be looking for symbols, signs from the universe that I would be OK, that I could escape my very-much-present past and become a whole person. I convinced myself we could heal together, Sydney and me. That if she could get better, I could, too.</span></p>
<p><span>It took me a few years to figure out I could not wait on anyone to prove to me that I could heal. The only thing I could do was try. Sydney was <a href="https://tv.getyarn.io/yarn-clip/57aa6637-85ef-4c3b-87bd-288a306cfcc1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a dog, not an oracle</a>. She was limited in her capacities.</span></p>
<p><span>I did get better, eventually. Sydney did not, not really, which I will forever believe is my fault. Dogs are intensely in-tune animals, reflecting the personalities of their owners; I can see for myself how my housemate’s pup mirrors his own anxiety.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>So what does it say about me that my dog was, to put it bluntly, kind of a bitch? Never trusting, always on alert, reserving her sweetness for a select few. With another owner, what could she have become? Would they have gotten a proper trainer to overcome her aggression? Would she have stopped cowering at raised hands and voices and started chasing Frisbees in the park? Would she have been that loveable, happy dog that everyone wants, a dog that would have delighted my nephews? </span></p>
<p><span>I can’t help but feel that the answer, at least to some extent, is yes. That far from helping her realize her potential, I prevented her from reaching it.</span></p>
<p><span>Still, her life wasn’t exactly bad. She got three walks a day and two meals. She once rolled in a maggoty shark on the beach and seemed to enjoy it. She took road trips, ate cheeseburgers and ice cream. She got steak on her birthday, turkey on Thanksgiving and a full stocking on Christmas. She stole all sorts of food from my roommates over the years, most recently an entire buttered English muffin and a plate of roasted grapes in sausage grease, having finally figured out at 14 how to climb onto the dining room table.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>She had a warm bed to sleep in every night, patches of sunlight in which to nap. She climbed mountains.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For a one-time street dog from Orlando, I suppose it could have been worse.</span></p>

I am a survivor of the Cambodian holocaust. That's who I am.”</p><p>“I believe what the old monk taught me. And everything he said came true, only in reverse. My family was unhappy, my village was unhappy, and so was the country. And now I look back on it all and think about the connections, and wonder whether I myself was partly to blame.”</p><p>“And when I saw their false pride, I felt I finally understood what war is about. Men fight for glory or ideals, but the result is not glorious or idealistic. The main result, besides the suffering, is that civilization is set back many years.”</p><p>“If I didn’t worry about the Khmer Rouge, it was because I didn’t believe they could be any worse than the Lon Nol regime… It surprises me now, but most of us pretended that life was almost normal. We made ourselves believe that Phnom Penh was a little island of peace and it was going to stay that way.”</p><p>“We had not been in favor of the revolution. We had not been against it. We didn’t even care about politics much. But now that the revolution had come, we had been bulldozed by it, reduced to the same level as the other exiles around us. And there was no new society building. Just the rubble of the old one.”</p><p>“To avoid our own deaths people like me were doing things we knew were wrong. And as we scrambled to protect ourselves, or sought to gain favor with the new powers, the old relationships were torn apart.”</p><p>“What made it worse, what made it more appalling was that somehow it was ordinary. You put one foot in front of the other and you kept on walking. You heard the cries of the weak but you didn’t pay much attention, because you were concentrating on yourself and your own survival. We had all seen death before.”</p><p>“How fast man changes! How fast he sheds his outer humanity and becomes the animal inside! … Children left their parents to die, wives abandoned their husbands and the stronger kept on moving. The Khmer Rouge had taken away everything that held our culture together, and the result was this: a parade of the selfish and the dying, Society was falling apart.”</p><p>“They knew that a small lie can be caught and that a big lie is easier to get away with.”</p><p>“There were no laws under the Khmer Rouge except the law of silence. There were no courts except Angka Leu. Maybe the prisoners hadn’t worked hard enough. Or they stole food. Or a chhlop, a spy, overheard them making remarks about Angka. People disappeared. That is all we knew. And I knew that someday I would be one of them.”</p><h4><a href="https://amzn.to/2KSRnZu">Confessions: An Innocent Life in Communist China</a></h4><p><em>Kang Zhengguo, translated by Susan Wilf</em></p><p>“‘Behavior’ meant putting on a deliberate show of allegiance to the authorities. When the teachers and school leadership evaluated your ‘behavior,’ they were referring to your politics, and you had to play the game right if you wanted a rating of ‘well behaved.’ Behavior ratings were as important as tests and grades since they affected one’s class rank, admission to select groups, and future prospects in general.”</p><p>“As I was browsing the big-character posters on the street on a winter day in 1966, it dawned on me that people everywhere were jumping onto the Cultural Revolution bandwagon to try to better their own lots, and I sensed their pent-up rage spilling out like water roiling over a dam… After paying lip service to Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, which conveniently proclaimed the right to rebel, the aggrieved parties blamed all their problems indiscriminately on the bourgeois reactionary line. Now that leaders had been pronounced fair game, nobody was afraid to lash out at them anymore.”</p><p>“Instead of telling me why I was being detained or charging me with a specific crime and asking me to confess, he told me to make my deposition first. As if the reason for my arrest were a riddle to which only he knew the answer, he had turned the interrogation into a guessing game.”</p><p>“It was my first experience with such poverty, and I was learning some new lessons about human nature. Apparently, people could coexist only if everyone was equally destitute, and a stroke of good luck could be a nuisance in disguise.”</p><p>“Broaching the forbidden was tantamount to “advocating” or “appreciating” it; that was the prevailing logic.”</p><p>“Even if I had been duped, I had no reason to regret having performed a good deed.”</p><h4><a href="https://amzn.to/3aZ95Fu">Blood Red Sunset: A Memoir of the Chinese Cultural Revolution</a></h4><p><em>Ma Bo, translated by Howard Goldblatt</em></p><p>“It was my background. My mother sealed my fate the day she became a writer. People from literary families were among society’s foulest outcasts… Revolutionary soldiers hate cultured people, writers especially, so they had no use for me.”</p><p>“‘Ma Bo, the masses have complained about your behavior during these denunciation meetings… Just because you weren’t permanently labeled doesn’t mean there isn’t a label with your name on it. Labels are in the hands of the masses, who can stick them on you anytime they want!’”</p><p>“But getting angry wouldn’t do any good… I was a counterrevolutionary mirror that reflected people’s true souls. When they looked into it they discovered they weren’t as attractive as they’d thought. That made them unhappy, so they blamed the mirror.”</p><p>“Experience told me that Jin Gang’s sympathy for me was tied to his own interests. If I were drowning, he would be the last person to come to my rescue. But I also knew that if I made my way back to the shore, his outstretched hand would be there for me.”</p><p>“Skeins of tangled emotion spilled …</p></div></div>

    <p>Over the past few years, I’ve noticed certain skills in people I admire, from Paul Graham, Vitalik Buterin, to Ender Wiggin.</p>

<p>Most normal people like me don’t realise these are skills. This makes the skills powerful - not everyone can see them, and very few people have mastered them.</p>

<p>However, I aim to change that. What follows below are 10 skills sourced from admirable people that I want to develop this decade.</p>

<p>Powerful life skills make powerful people.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-take-compounding-seriously">Learn to take compounding seriously</h2>

<p>It’s not just your wealth that compounds, but life experience and knowledge, too.</p>

<p>So, learn the most basic, most useful skills first. The longer you wait to learn skills like these, the less time there is for compounding magic. That’s what this entire list is about: powerful skills to learn and use for the rest of your life.</p>

<p>And even though you’ve heard about compounding, this item is first on the list, because <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/taking-ideas-seriously.html">taking ideas seriously is hard</a>.</p>

<p>A good way to figure out what compounds is <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/year-in-review-2019.html#compounding-is-powerful-building-intuition-for-compounding-even-more-so">to figure out what’s a platform</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-develop-taste">Learn to develop taste</h2>

<p>Despite prevalent beliefs, taste isn’t subjective.</p>

<p>While it may seem like it on the outside, when you say “I just love this painting” or “I just love this coffee machine” - all it means is that the defining characteristics are illegible to you. And noticing this is the first step.</p>

<p>Let’s take a specific example. Say you’re designing a high quality clay pot - and you’ve never done this before.</p>

<p>What’s a good way to develop taste for quality here?</p>

<p>If you’ve heard this claypot parable, you know the answer: start by making lots of crap pots.</p>

<blockquote>
  <div><p>The ceramics teacher announced on opening day that he was dividing the class into two groups. All those on the left side of the studio, he said, would be graded solely on the quantity of work they produced, all those on the right solely on its quality. His procedure was simple: on the final day of class he would bring in his bathroom scales and weigh the work of the “quantity” group: fifty pound of pots rated an “A,” forty pounds a “B,” and so on. Those being graded on “quality,” however, needed to produce only one pot—albeit a perfect one—to get an “A.”</p><p>

Well, came grading time and a curious fact emerged: the works of highest quality were all produced by the group being graded for quantity. It seems that while the “quantity” group was busily churning out piles of work—and learning from their mistakes—the “quality” group had sat theorizing about perfection, and in the end had little more to show for their efforts than grandiose theories and a pile of dead clay. - <a href="https://amzn.to/3o9o17A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art and Fear</a><sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2">1</a></sup></p></div>
</blockquote>

<p>Let others tell you what you’ve made is crap. Learn why. Notice when they tell you something is great. Figure out why.</p>

<p>This transfers to writing as well: Popular advice to get better is to write a lot of junk, do it a 100 times, and pay particular attention to what is received well. Here’s <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/taste.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">another example - developing taste for design</a>.</p>

<p>In effect, you bootstrap good taste by first learning what others consider good. Then, <a href="#learn-to-see-systems">you see the system behind it</a>. Then you break the rules and still manage to awe.</p>

<p>Then you’ve developed taste.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-sequence-things-well">Learn to sequence things well</h2>

<p>Waking up when others are asleep and getting lots done is a super power. It’s born out of a system of <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/sequencing-things-in-the-right-order.html">learning to sequence things well</a>.</p>

<p>It means choosing the right time for that Netflix binge.</p>

<p>It means being prepared before the meeting, not scrambling to get things done after.</p>

<p>It means reading the coursebook before the lecture, not after.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-see-what-others-see">Learn to see what others see</h2>

<p>How well can you understand other people? Can you sense their desires, their concerns, and what events lead to those desires and concerns?</p>

<p>If you can do this, you can understand them. But not before.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the moment when I truly understand my enemy, understand him well enough to defeat him, then in that very moment I also love him. I think it’s impossible to really understand somebody, what they want, what they believe, and not love them the way they love themselves. - <a href="https://amzn.to/2KKe8Px" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ender’s Game</a><sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1">2</a></sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s worth going this far because understanding is powerful. It helps you empathise. It helps you negotiate. It helps you figure out why you don’t have product-market fit. It helps you learn quickly: you can switch through personas and see what will and won’t work.</p>

<p>How do you do learn to see? I know no better way than to practice. Try it a 100 times. <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/subscribe">Come back next year</a>, and maybe I’ll have a better way once I’ve done it a 100 times.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-make-and-execute-decisions-quickly">Learn to make and execute decisions quickly</h2>

<p>Most people have a bias towards analysis-paralysis versus getting shit done.</p>

<p>When decisions are reversible - and they mostly are - speed is a super power. Cultivating a habit of making decisions quickly, and then executing them is better than just thinking about it.</p>

<p>Training this skill begins as easily as deciding what to eat on a huge menu. It’s a small step, but over time, <a href="#learn-to-take-compounding-seriously">even the smallest steps compound</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Hesitation is always easy, rarely useful” - Prof. Quirrel alterego, <a href="http://www.hpmor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HPMOR</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here’s an <a href="https://firstround.com/review/speed-as-a-habit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">example in the context of business</a>. And a <a href="https://twitter.com/sama/status/1345140364995227648" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweet from Sam Altman</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-spot-a-convex-or-concave-world">Learn to spot a convex or concave world</h2>

<p>In the world of viral infections, a 50% lockdown is worse than a 0% and a 100% lockdown, both. The virus isn’t contained, and businesses have to shut down, too.</p>

<p>In the world of immigration policies, letting some specific people in is better than letting no one or everyone in. The middle ground is better than the extremes.</p>

<p>When the best of both worlds is great, you’re in a concave disposition.</p>

<p>When the best of both worlds is worse than either, you’re in a convex disposition.</p>

<p>The world is sometimes concave, and sometimes convex. Knowing your topology can help you make better decisions.</p>

<p>I first noted this when <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/11/08/concave.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vitalik Buterin explained it</a>. Read it for more concrete examples.</p>

<!-- ## Learn to do obvious things -->

<h2 id="learn-to-tell-stories">Learn to tell stories</h2>

<p>People donate more to charity when they know a single victim’s story, versus statistics of a thousand deaths. It’s called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiable_victim_effect" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Identifiable Victim Effect</a>, but it’s the power of stories over facts. The right framing gets you further than all the facts combined.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“A single death is a tragedy; a million deaths is a statistic.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ideas &amp; facts contextualised by stories are more powerful than either alone.</p>

There’s lots to unpack here, and this is the first skill I’ve been working on for the past few months. Watch out for a long blogpost in 2 weeks!</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-dive-into-the-source-code-when-documentation-isnt-enough">Learn to dive into the source code when documentation isn’t enough</h2>

<p>Sometimes, there’s no precedent for what you want to do. Or the people who did it before didn’t write a manual.</p>

<p>In cases like these, figuring things out for yourself is powerful. Research papers and obscure books aren’t just for scientists. They’re freely available on the internet* for all of humanity to use. Learn to use it. Learn about resources like <a href="https://sci-hub.do/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SciHub</a>, <a href="https://libgen.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LibGen</a>, and hiring researchers. You’re allowed to hire people (specially graduate students!) to satisfy your research concerns.</p>

<p>… and when you’re done, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/things-I-learned-to-become-a-senior-software-engineer.html#writing-code">preserve context for future you</a>.</p>

<p>It’s a lot like trying to use an API that has no documentation. Would’ve been easy if there was documentation, but there isn’t. So you got to do it the hard way: read the source code and figure out what you need to make things work.</p>

<p>It’s also like <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/A-framework-for-First-Principles-Thinking.html">figuring out what you need to build rockets yourself</a> when existing ones are too expensive.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-be-specific">Learn to be specific</h2>

<p>Every time I gave an example above, I was training my specificity muscles.</p>

<p>Most of the time, most people don’t know what they’re talking about. Not being specific is a sign of that. The more abstract the word, the harder it is to pin down a meaning.</p>

<p>For example, “negative ramifications” doesn’t tell you what exactly happened, while “the sonic boom from the new supersonic jet destroyed windows in a 100m radius” is a lot more specific.</p>

<p>Learn to be specific, and learn to spot when others aren’t. <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NgtYDP3ZtLJaM248W/sotw-be-specific" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here’s how</a>.</p>

<h2 id="learn-to-see-systems">Learn to see systems</h2>

<p>There’s two kinds of people.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bob, who will see this list, find some skills very interesting, and then go about honing those skills</li>
  <li>Alice, who will see this list, and wonder how I came up with these
<!-- - The Inspiration-Junkie, who will lurk and move on to the next inspiring post without changing anything -->
</li>
</ul>

<p>Alice would then try to understand the system that generated these ideas. Then, she’ll adopt the system, and come up with skills possibly more relevant to herself.</p>

<p>Having the option to do both is powerful. Since Bob is the default, <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/How-to-see-Systems-in-everyday-life.html">learn to be like Alice</a>. Choose <a href="https://neilkakkar.com/understanding-systems.html">systems when things are important</a> to you. Choose hacks when you need a quickfix.</p>

<p>Many of us use container images from day to day, maybe also in many various architectures. For example on your Raspberry PI (aarch64), do you really know how it works in detail?</p>



<p>I have worked with container images more or less since 2015 but during an <a href="https://www.openshift.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OpenShift</a> 4 air-gapped installation and mirroring of images into a registry, I hit the wall quite hard and have to realize I didn’t know all the details very well.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are not familiar with OpenShift 4 air-gapped installation, the installation is divided into two parts: first <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-restricted-networks-bare-metal.html" target="_blank">OpenShift 4 Core </a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-restricted-networks-bare-metal.html" target="_blank">i</a><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/installing/installing_bare_metal/installing-restricted-networks-bare-metal.html" target="_blank">nstallation</a> and second the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/operators/admin/olm-restricted-networks.html" target="_blank">cluster add-ons via OperatorHub/Operator Lifecycle Manager</a>. The second part is optional but brings a lot of value into OpenShift.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Today I am excited to share my learnings with you.</p>



<p><strong>Let’s start off with some basics around container images</strong></p>



<p>A container image is a static immutable packaging and shipping format. It contains everything you need to start a container, the actual software packages and information on how to start it at your container runtime. A container image is distributed via a container registry like <a href="https://quay.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quay.io</a> or <a href="https://hub.docker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Docker Hub</a>.</p>



<p>All the important format definitions for distribution and runtime of a container image are specified in the open container initiative (OCI) – <a href="https://opencontainers.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://opencontainers.org/</a>.</p>



<p>The container workflow from build to run is:</p>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>First</td><td>You build your<strong> container image</strong> via OpenShift, <a href="https://podman.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">podman</a>, <a href="https://buildah.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buildah</a> or the container <strong>build</strong> tool of your choice.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" data-align="center"><strong>Push</strong> your container image into your container registry.</td></tr><tr><td>Second</td><td>You ship/distribute your container image via&nbsp; quay.io or the <strong>container registry</strong> of your choice.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2" data-align="center"><strong>Pull</strong> your container image into your container registry.</td></tr><tr><td>Third</td><td>You run your container image at runtime using OpenShift/CRI-O or your runtime of your choice.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p><strong>Building a container&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>There are various blog posts and articles about how to build containers. All you have to know for now is that you need a&nbsp; Containerfile (formally known as Dockerfile) and with podman, buildah or docker you build your container from it.&nbsp;</p>



<div data-carousel-extra="{&quot;blog_id&quot;:1,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.opensourcerers.org\/2020\/11\/16\/container-images-multi-architecture-manifests-ids-digests-whats-behind\/&quot;}"><figure><img data-attachment-id="2698" data-permalink="https://www.opensourcerers.org/2020/11/16/container-images-multi-architecture-manifests-ids-digests-whats-behind/opensourcers-container-images-manifests-id-digest-and-multi-arch-1/" data-orig-file="https://www.opensourcerers.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Opensourcers-Container-images-manifests-id-digest-and-multi-arch-1.png" data-orig-size="283,195" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="Opensourcers-Container-images-manifests-id-digest-and-multi-arch-1" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://www.opensourcerers.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Opensourcers-Container-images-manifests-id-digest-and-multi-arch-1.png" data-large-file="https://www.opensourcerers.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Opensourcers-Container-images-manifests-id-digest-and-multi-arch-1.png" loading="lazy" width="283" height="195" src="https://www.opensourcerers.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Opensourcers-Container-images-manifests-id-digest-and-multi-arch-1.png" alt=""></figure><p>During the build process, it creates a bunch of file system layers including the container configuration (how to run, port, volume details). The file system layers contain all the software components, operating system libraries, of your software – basically all you need to run your software inside the container.</p></div>



<p>Depending on the build environment it also creates a temporary Manifest. The Manifest itself will become important later during the container image distribution.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>At this point, we have a container image that is made to run in the architecture it is built for.</strong> For example x86 on an x86 host or aarch64 on aarch64 host. At the end of the build you also get the Image ID of your container image.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here are the key details taken from the <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/config.md#imageid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Image ID specification</a>:<br><em>Each image’s ID is given by the SHA256 hash of its configuration JSON. It is represented as a hexadecimal encoding of 256 bits, e.g., sha256:a9561eb1b190625c9adb5a9513e72c4dedafc1cb2d4c5236c9a6957ec7dfd5a9. Since the configuration JSON that gets hashed references hashes of each layer in the image, this formulation of the ImageID makes images content-addressable.</em></p>



<p>After the build on the build machine, the final container image digest will not be available as the digest. The digests will be created during the push into the container registry.</p>



<p>The container image configuration is specified here:</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/config.md" target="_blank">application/vnd.oci.image.config.v1+json</a></li></ul>



<p>For FileSystem layers, their are different types / specifications available:</p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/layer.md" target="_blank">application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/layer.md#gzip-media-types" target="_blank">application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar+gzip</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/layer.md#gzip-media-types" target="_blank">application/vnd.oci.image.layer.v1.tar+zstd</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/layer.md#non-distributable-layers" target="_blank">application/vnd.oci.image.layer.nondistributable.v1.tar</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/layer.md#non-distributable-layers" target="_blank">application/vnd.oci.image.layer.nondistributable.v1.tar+gzip</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/layer.md#non-distributable-layers" target="_blank">application/vnd.oci.image.layer.nondistributable.v1.tar+zstd</a></li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/docker/docker/blob/master/image/spec/v1.md#creating-an-image-filesystem-changeset" target="_blank">application/vnd.docker.image.rootfs.diff.tar.gzip</a></li></ul>



<p>In case you miss the first version: <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/moby/moby/tree/master/image/spec" target="_blank">application/vnd.docker.container.image.v1+json</a>: Docker Image Specification v1 Image JSON has still been widely used and officially adopted in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md" target="_blank">V2 manifest</a> and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec" target="_blank">OCI Image Format Specification</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Push – image distribution and a little bit of container registry&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>After an image build, you typically distribute your container image to a container image registry.&nbsp; At this point the manifest comes into play. Container registries can support different manifest types: </p>



<ul><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/manifest.md" target="_blank">application/vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json</a> (oci)</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-1.md" target="_blank">application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v1+json </a>– broadly called as schema1 (v2s1)</li><li><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/spec/manifest-v2-2.md" target="_blank">application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json</a> – broadly called as schema2 (v2s2)</li></ul>



<p>All major registries support schema2. If you want to know how quay.io – the first private registry – can grow from v1 to v2.2 (schema2)&nbsp; then I recommend the following video:</p>



<figure><p data-carousel-extra="{&quot;blog_id&quot;:1,&quot;permalink&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.opensourcerers.org\/2020\/11\/16\/container-images-multi-architecture-manifests-ids-digests-whats-behind\/&quot;}">

<p>Have a look at the following snippet, which shows an example of a schema2 manifest:</p>

<p>The container image digest SHA256 hash (not to be confused with the SHA256 hash in the manifest layers) is calculated and created by hashing the manifest output shown above during the push. The container image digest hash will of course change if you change anything in the manifest like schemeVersion(schema1 vs schema2) or mediaType.&nbsp;</p>



<p>IMPORTANT:&nbsp; if you pull, tag, and push an image, the image digest can change in cases where the image layer compression changes and/or the manifest version has been converted. The only secure way is to use skopeo copy!&nbsp;</p>



<p>Usually, images are pushed to a registry via a tag. You can consider a tag as a reference to a specific container image digest, which can be rewritten to another container image (digest).&nbsp; If you want to run a specific version of a container image you can use the container image digest. If something changes on the container image: configuration, filesystem layer the container image digest will change too.</p>



<p>Here an example of the different formats:</p>


<pre><p><code>quay.io/openshift-examples/multi-arch:x86_64
quay.io/openshift-examples/multi-arch:@sha256:6e7f0459dc4c93970c8207f0640ebf0f85a5be180e0981a8a20426dd456f16c7</code></p></pre>


<p>You may discover image tags and digests via curl as outlined in the&nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/distribution-spec/blob/master/spec.md">Open Container Initiative Distribution Specification </a>. Here is an example:</p>



<p>Get the list of tags:</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p>As I reflect back on 2020, a year that was tough on human civilisation
as a whole, I am nevertheless grateful for the many positive experiences
of this year. This post is not a ‘humblebrag’ or a denial of the many
negative things of 2020<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>, but rather a brief recipe and reminder to
my future self to&nbsp;(further) develop and maintain an attitude of
gratitude. This post is written in the form of questions that I used to
ask myself, as well as the current set of answers I came up with. It is
my hope that readers will find some wisdom here.</p>
<p><strong>Why should I be grateful?</strong> Because, fundamentally, your life is not
about you. At least, it is not <em>just</em> about you. You are interacting<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>
with so many other people and doing a lot of things on a daily basis.
You take all of this for granted—until it is not available any more.
So why not make an effort to be cognisant of their positive impact in
your life?</p>
<p><strong>Can I <em>choose</em> to be grateful?</strong> Yes, you can&nbsp;(see below for more
concrete tips). It is not built into most of us—and as the last year
mercilessly demonstrated, we often take things for granted, until they
are gone, and only <em>then</em> do we start bemoaning their loss.</p>
<p><strong>But is focusing on the positive not a denial of the negative?</strong> Our
brains are—at best—capable of producing medium-fidelity
representations of events in our lives, told from our perspective. While
some parts of our memory are more reliable than others, we are still
plagued by ‘bugs’ such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation_effect">misinformation effect</a>.
Hence, why not make use of this and deliberately store the positive
things? In my experience, negative events, such as the loss of a loved
on or a severe illness, do not need additional reinforcement to be
remembered. But the small stuff, such as receiving a nice ‘Thank you’
note, will probably fall through the cracks. So, without denying that
bad things happen, why not pay attention to the positive ones?</p>
<p><strong>Will gratitude not stymie my efforts?</strong> This is a though one that
I admittedly wrestled with for a long time. If I am grateful for what
I already <em>have</em>, will I not stop wanting to be <em>more</em>? Setting aside
the question of whether it is useful to want ‘more’, I realised that
gratitude also brings a certain amount of clarity with it. For example,
I realised how grateful I was for the interactions with my colleagues
and students this year. This gave me a good idea of how large I want
my future research group to be—so in this sense, I now know that
I do not necessarily require a larger group, but this does not stifle my
application efforts or my research efforts in the slightest. On the
contrary: it makes me appreciate the time I can spend on these things
even more! I think that it is possible to be grateful for what you have,
and still aspire to improve your skills, your life situation, your
relationships, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>How to be grateful and remain it?</strong> Living on the command-line and in
<a href="https://www.vim.org/"><code>vim</code></a> for many of my working and waking hours,
the easiest solution for me is to have a file in which I can journal
things I am grateful for. This could be anything, from having a nice cup
of coffee while reading a well-written paper in the garden to receiving
a nice e-mail about my research or blog, thus reminding me that this is
not a solipsist adventure<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>. Put everything in there whenever you are
moved to do so, and after a few months, you can go back and re-read the
list—I promise you that you will be positively surprised!</p>
<p>As a parting thought, I can also encourage you to be included in other
people’s gratitude files: do not hesitate to express your gratitude to
those that helped you, inspired you, and went out of their way to
support you in any way<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup> With that, I wish you a blessed 2021. May of
all you find lots of things to be grateful about. Until next time!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section itemprop="text">
        
          
        
        <h2 id="what-does-varlink-provide">What does varlink provide?</h2>

<p>Everybody understands it. Varlink uses a simple human and machine readable <a href="https://varlink.org/#interface">text file</a> to
describe an interface with all its data types, method calls and errors. The text file, in its simplicity,
does not require any specific knowledge to join a discussion about design, development, and
maintenance of an API.</p>

<p>It documents itself, in the sources and on the wire. Varlink interfaces describe themselves readable to
humans and reliably consumable by machines. Varlink services are introspectable at runtime. Varlink
interfaces provide their documentation along with the interface description.</p>

<p>Everything is readable. Varlink uses plain text messages, has no magic numbers, no unnamed values, is
easily debuggable with things like
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace">strace</a>,
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netcat">netcat</a>,
<a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>.</p>

<p>Varlink itself is simpler than the service that uses it. Varlink uses direct connections, has no
central message handling component, it is easily debugged, secured, isolated, tested.</p>

<h2 id="which-transports-can-be-used-to-speak-varlink">Which transports can be used to speak varlink?</h2>

<p>Varlink can be implemented on any connection-oriented transport.The most common example are streaming
sockets, but it can also be implemented on kernel special files like device nodes or encapsulated in
other protocols, like HTTP, GSS-API or SASL.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-monitor-changes-or-subscribe-to-signals">How can I monitor changes or subscribe to signals?</h2>

<p>Varlink connections can be turned into monitor connections, they are soft-negotiated between the
client and the service. The client asks the server to possibly reply with more than one reply, the
server replies and indicates that it might have more replies and the client should wait for them.</p>

<p>To avoid race conditions between the reading of the current state and subscribing to updates, a
typical varlink monitor method call first returns the current state and then sends changes in
subsequent replies to the same request on the same connection.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-sequence-numbers-in-calls-and-replies">Why are there no sequence numbers in calls and replies?</h2>

<p>Varlink operates on connections, all messages are strictly in order on the same connection and always
received in the order they are sent. Connections support message pipelining, but not multiplexing.
Complex interfaces can use multiple connections at the same time.</p>



<p>The varlink message <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">header</a> can be extended by vendors if needed. Added keys should use
the reverse-domain notation including the vendor’s name. The concept is similar to the X-prefix used for
HTTP headers, but neither they nor naked keywords should be added by vendors, since they may clash with
other vendors or future varlink protocol specifications.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-records-separated-by-a-nul-character-and-do-not-specify-a-length">Why are records separated by a NUL character and do not specify a length?</h2>

<p>The simplest possible transport of varlink messages is a raw streaming socket, which forwards JSON
records separated by a NUL character. Conceptually the NUL character belongs to the transport not to
the varlink message. If varlink messages are encapsulated in HTTP, HTTP will specify the record length
and not use a NUL byte.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-unsigned-integers-and-why-are-there-no-integer-sizes-specified">Why are there no unsigned integers, and why are there no integer sizes specified?</h2>

<p>Like JSON, varlink is intentionally underspecified in this regard. The implementation should use
integers large enough to carry the signed integer value, and return an error if it cannot handle the
received number.</p>

<h2 id="the-varlink-type-system-specifies-features-which-do-not-directly-map-to-json-how-are-they-serialized">The varlink type system specifies features which do not directly map to JSON, how are they serialized?</h2>

<p><a href="https://varlink.org/Interface-Definition#type">Enums</a> are serialized as a JSON name/value pair, with the enum value as a
string. <a href="https://varlink.org/Interface-Definition#type">Maps</a> are serialized as JSON objects, every map element is
represented as a name/value pair.</p>

<h2 id="can-i-transmit-file-descriptors">Can I transmit file descriptors?</h2>

<p>Varlink intentionally does not support features or side-effects specific to transports. Encapsulating
varlink messages in other protocols, passing them over proxies is a requirement of varlink.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-reference-a-file">How can I reference a file?</h2>

<p>Varlink should be remotable, therefore you should not point a remote service to a file, which is local
to the client. Just send the content and an identifier/name of the file.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-transfer-larger-amounts-or-foreign-data">How can I transfer larger amounts or foreign data?</h2>

<p>You can either send the data as a string, or use the “upgraded” connection feature, where you opt-out
of the varlink protocol after calling a method with the <code>upgrade</code> <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">header</a> field set
to <code>true</code>. After sending this message the connection is yours for sending whatever you want. To
speak the varlink protocol to the service again, you need to open a new connection. Upgraded varlink
connections are similar to the websocket concept.</p>

<h2 id="when-is-a-oneway-request-useful">When is a <code>oneway</code> request useful?</h2>

<p>Setting <code>oneway</code> in a <a href="https://varlink.org/Method-Call">method call</a> means that the service will not send a reply. This
might be useful when many messages are sent as part of one transaction, and only one single reply is
needed to confirm the transaction. It might also be useful for non-critical data like a debugging
interface, to minimize round-trip handling.</p>

<p>The most important reason to add this feature right from the start is, that it could not be added to
the protocol at a later time, because all implementations need to support it right away to correctly
handle the strict message ordering requirement.</p>

<h2 id="why-are-there-no-error-numbers-or-human-readable-messages-in-errors">Why are there no error numbers or human readable messages in errors?</h2>

<p>Varlink errors are interface-specific and identified by a string. If required, Interfaces could add a
<code>message</code> field to the error parameters which contain human readable text. The primary focus of
varlink errors is machine consumption, in most cases a carefully chosen descriptive CamelCase error
sufficiently describes the error to humans.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-find-the-service-which-implements-a-local-interface">How do I find the service which implements a local interface?</h2>

<p>On systems with the <code>org.varlink.resolver</code> interface reachable on a defined varlink URI, the
client can call the <code>method org.varlink.resolver.Resolve(interface: string) -&gt; (address: string)</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-are-varlink-services-accessed-from-a-remote-machine">How are varlink services accessed from a remote machine?</h2>

<p>The varlink command line tool, as well as some varlink language bindings offer the possibility to
connect to a service via a <code>bridge</code>.</p>


<ul>
  <li>Python:
<a href="https://varlink.org/python/#varlink.Client.new_with_bridge">varlink.Client.new_with_bridge()</a></li>
  <li>Rust:
<a href="https://docs.rs/varlink/4.0.0/varlink/struct.Connection.html#method.with_bridge">Connection::with_bridge()</a></li>
</ul>

<p>The bridge command normally is <code>ssh &lt;host&gt; varlink bridge</code>, calling <code>varlink bridge</code> on the
remote host. The <code>varlink bridge</code> command parses all method calls on stdin, queries the
<code>org.varlink.resolver</code> on the remote system for the interface address, connects to this address
and forwards all method calls matching the interface name to the local service on the remote machine.
It reads the replies and passes them back to stdout. Instead of <code>ssh</code> any other connection command
 could be used. Instead of <code>varlink bridge</code> any other utility, which offers an equal
 functionality, could be used.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-get-the-version-number-of-an-interface">How can I get the version number of an interface?</h2>

<p>Varlink interfaces do not have a version number, they only have a feature set described in detail by
the interface definition, which is part of the wire protocol.</p>

<p>If your interface has users, you should not break the interface, only extend it, never remove or
incompatibly change things which might be already in use. Clients can fully introspect a service and
figure out which features the interface supports; this is more expressive than any simple numbering
scheme. If you break the API or remove stuff, just release it with a new name, commonly done by adding
a number to the interface name, like <code>org.example.interface2</code>.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-extend-an-interface-in-a-backwards-compatible-way">How do I extend an interface in a backwards compatible way?</h2>

<p>Varlink does not use positional parameters or fixed-size objects in its interface definition or on the
 wire, all parameters are identified by their name and can be extended later.</p>

<p>Things like this are not needed:</p>
<pre><code>typedef struct {
       /* … */
       /*
        * Reserved space to allow possible future extensions without
        * breaking the ABI. You should not touch these, because the
        * names of these variables may change.
        */
       uint32_t reserved_int1;
       uint32_t reserved_int2;
       uint32_t reserved_int3;
       uint32_t reserved_int4;
} my_service_struct_foo;
</code></pre>

<p>Extending existing structures should be done via optional fields (nullable type, maybe). The result of
the methods, when passed parameters without the optional fields should be the same as in older
versions. Method parameters can be extended the same way. The expected behavior for omitted
fields/parameters should be documented. Removing fields, types, errors or methods are not backward
compatible and should be avoided.</p>

<h2 id="how-does-socket-activation-work">How does socket activation work?</h2>

<p>Varlink language bindings commonly implement the systemd socket activation protocol. The environment
of the started service will be augmented with the variables LISTEN_FDS, LISTEN_NAMES, LISTEN_PID.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/sd_listen_fds.html">Read more</a></p>

<h2 id="how-do-i-implement-exit-on-idle-for-my-service">How do I implement exit-on-idle for my service?</h2>

<p>Services can be started on-demand with socket activation. When there is no background task running and
no clients connected to the service, the service can decide to close the listening socket and exit. A
new connection from a client will activate the service again. Because varlink is strictly
point-to-point, there is no buffering involved and the service activator will queue all incoming
messages, exit-on-idle can be implemented in a race-free manner.</p>

<h2 id="how-can-i-restrict-the-access-to-my-service">How can I restrict the access to my service?</h2>

<p>The most commonly used method is to rely on the permissions of a UNIX socket in the file system.
Services which need a more fine-grained access control can check the connection credentials of a unix
socket and decide per call if they want to act on behalf of the client.
If varlink would be wrapped in GSS-API, e.g. kerberos tickets could be used for more fine grained
access control.</p>

<p>In this chapter we will introduce simple but useful basic widgets and explain the
widgets which we introduced earlier in more detail. All these widgets are really easy
to use. We have constructor functions with names which starts with "new" like
newButton(), we can add these widgets to containers, and connect them directly to
signals or map them to GActions. You should also study the C API documentation of
these simple widgets to learn about all the other functionality that is also
available, like provided functions, available signals or widget properties.  Remember
that GTK widgets build a class hierarchy so functionality may be provided by parent
classes.  For example the GtkCheckButton is a subclass of GtkToggleButton and both
are of course widgets, so you may have to consult all that API documentation to find
functions or properties that you may desire. Also consider using the devhelp tool to
navigate the C API docs. For the more advanced and complicated widgets like
GtkTreeView, GtkListView and GtkDrawingArea we will give only minimal examples in
this chapter to give you a basic feeling what they are and how they can be used.
GtkTreeView and GtkListView are powerfull widgets to display larger textual and other
data sets. And the GtkDrawingArea is a widget where we can draw arbitrary two
dimensional graphics by using drawing functions of the cairo graphics library. We can
use the GtkDrawingArea for pure display purpose, or we can combine it with user input
activities to create advanced CAD tools. One more advanced GTK widget is the
GtkGLArea which can be used to display three-dimensional OpenGL graphics.  But as
creating graphics with OpenGL is a wide area for which many whole books have been
written, we will not try to cover that topic in this book.</p>
<p>The GTK widgets can be grouped into container widgets which arrange other widgets
like GtkBox or GtkGrid, into mostly passive widgets for displaying data like the
GtkLabel, and into the active widgets which accept user input like GtkEntry. For an
overview you may visit the widget gallery page:</p>

<div>
<h3 id="_label">Label</h3>
<p>The GtkLabel is a simple widget that can display some text. The text can have
multiple lines when desired, can wrap automatically and can support style attributes
like italic or boldface. The label widget is mostly used to label other widgets or to
display some textual messages to the user.  GtkButtons use a label widgets to display
its text.  For the actual text display the pango library is used, which supports many
advanced text renderings like right to left text and many attributes like
strike-though, underline, overline (since pango v 1.46) and many more.  GtkLabels
like all GTK widgets support utf8 unicode text which allows display of glyphs of
exotic languages as well as a large range of symbols.</p>
<p>The GtkLabel is one of the simplest GTK widgets and the C API documentation should be
easy to understand and can be used in Nim straight forward:</p>

<div>
<h4 id="_properties">Properties</h4>
<p>GTK uses the concept of properties to set or modify the internal state of GTK widgets
or other entities.  For most properties GTK offers setter and getter functions which
we use when available, so we have not to deal with properties that often. But in some
cases it is necessary, so we will introduce the basics at this point already. GTK
properties have textual names like "wrap" or "gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" and
a typed state like boolean true/false, integer states or states of other types. In C
code most often the function g_object_set() is used to set one or multiple
properties. That function uses multiple untyped arguments. As it is not type safe it
is not provided by gobject-introspection and is not available in most high level GTK
bindings including Nim. Instead we use g_object_set_property() called just
setProperty() to set single properties in Nim.  Unfortunately that procedure needs a
GValue as third parameter which makes it use a bit complicated.</p>
<p>The following example program defines a helper procedure called toBoolVal() to create
a GValue with matching type and content from a Nim bool value. We use the resulting
GValue to set the wrap property of our label and the
"gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" property of our whole application. Both
properties expects a boolean GValue.</p>

<p>In our toBoolVal() proc we have to create a GType variable first. For this we can use
the typeFromName() proc to which we have to pass the correct GTK type name, or with
recent gintro versions we could use getType() procs like gBooleanGetType() directly.
Guessing the right name is not always easy — for string types we would have to use
gStringGetType() or typeFromName("gchararray"). With that GType we can first init() a
GValue variable and then set its value. GValues are used a lot in gtkListView and
GtkThreeView widgets, we will learn more about GTypes the GValue variables later when
we explain these widgets.  In the above example program we use the function
setProperty() two times. First we set the property
"gtk-application-prefer-dark-theme" for our whole application to true. To do that we
query the default settings with a call of getDefaultSettings() and then set that
boolean value. The result is that our whole app uses a dark color scheme when
available. The second use of setProperty(), again for a boolean variable, is to set
the "wrap" property of one of our label widgets. For this the label class provides
the function setWrap() which we generally would use. We used a GtkBox to arrange our
two labels vertically in our window. We will learn more details about the GtkBox
containers in the next section.</p>
<p>While GtkLabels are most of the time passive entities, they provide some signals like
"activate-link" and "move-cursor".  By default label text can not be copied to the
clipboard, but we can call setSelectable() on a label widget to make it selectable.
Then we can click with the mouse on the text, we can select all or part of the text
and the label widget will get a popup menu which pops up when we press the right
mouse button allowing to select and copy the label text to the clipboard. This can be
useful when a label displays messages which we may want to copy elsewhere.  One of
the many useful functions offered by labels is setEllipsize() which determines how
text not fitting into the available are is handled. That function is often used in
conjunction with setMaxWidhChars() or setWidhChars().  Our second example program
below displays some chess pieces using utf8 unicode glyphs, and an ordinary text
which is displayed in a small font and which is shortened by showing ellipsis when
the enclosing window is small. The label widget with the chess pieces is made
selectable, so you can copy the content into another window, maybe into an instance
of the the gedit text editor.</p>

<p>In both label texts we use html tags like &lt;big&gt; or &lt;small&gt; to modify the text
display. Currently we have to additional call setUseMarkup() on the label to tell it
that html tags should be used. We may expect that for the case that we use
setMarkup() that should be not necessary — maybe it is a bug of early GTK&nbsp;4
release? Modifying the label display with enclosed tags directly is convenient, but
restricted to only a few attributes. In the next section we will lean how we can use
XML UI files to do more advanced text customization.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h4 id="_gtklabels_and_xml_ui_files">GtkLabels and XML UI files</h4>
<p>Earlier in this book we used already XML files to describe the structure of popup
menus.  And we said at the beginning of the book that GTK allows to declare the whole
GUI or parts of it with XML UI files which is then loaded by the GTK builder. Below
you can see such an XML UI file which describes a label and two buttons, which are
arranged into a GtkGrid widget.</p>

							<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p><span>As Kubernetes has become the foundational building block for enterprises to go cloud-native, the last couple of years have seen many solutions that have simplified the cluster creation process. But the Day-2 operations around Kubernetes still remains a complex endeavor, slowing down adoption and increasing the operational costs. Kubernetes’ complexity and skills gaps still remain the biggest factors that are in the way of Enterprise’s adoption of Kubernetes.</span></p>
<p><span>Many of the Day-2 operations use cases include requirements for the central platform team to deliver secure and compliant environments to developers as efficiently as possible with necessary services and best practices preconfigured. Some examples of such use cases include configuring environments with Kubernetes best practices like resource quotas, network policy and pod security. This requires tools that can assess the environments as they are created and then configure them in compliance with the standard defined by the central platform team.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Kyverno: A Flexible Ops Tool for K8s</strong></h2>
<p><span>Kubernetes provides powerful constructs like admission control webhooks that can be leveraged for the purposes of validating and mutating resources. Nirmata’s </span><a href="https://kyverno.io/"><span>Kyverno</span></a><span> was designed specifically to address these types of use cases using the declarative paradigm. Kyverno is an open-source policy engine that was designed for Kubernetes, It provides users with familiar constructs to write custom rules and easily implement to validate, mutate, and generate new resources as needed.</span></p>
<p><span>Managing Kubernetes at scales requires the following best practices and applying standardization across configurations. One such pattern is to use Kubernetes labels. In Kubernetes, every resource can have one or more labels and Kubernetes makes it easy to find and manage the resources using labels.</span></p>
<p><span>A very common use case for Day-2 operations is managing labels across namespaces and pods so that use cases like certificate updates, self-service logging/monitoring, backups etc. can be easily implemented by other Kubernetes controllers and operators.</span></p>
<h2><strong>Auto-Labeling Namespaces</strong></h2>
<p><span>Below is an example of how to implement namespace labeling upon creation in a Kubernetes cluster using Kyverno.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Install Kyverno in your cluster:</span></p>
<div>
<pre data-lang="Bash"><code>kubectl create -f https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno/raw/master/definitions/install.yaml</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span>Detailed installation instructions are available </span><a href="https://kyverno.io/docs/installation/"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Here is a sample Kyverno policy that adds labels to namespaces&nbsp; –&nbsp;</span></p>
<div>
<pre data-lang="YAML"><code>apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata: 
  name: add-labels
spec: 
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: add-ns-label
    match:
      resources:
        kinds: 
        - Namespace
    exclude:
      clusterroles: ["cluster-admin"]
    mutate: 
      patchStrategicMerge:
        metadata:
          labels:
            kyverno/user: "{{ request.userInfo.username }}"
            +(kyverno/network): "default"</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span>The policy inserts a label `</span><span>kyverno/user`</span><span>with the value of the user making the API request to create the namespace. The policy also inserts a label `</span><span>kyverno/network</span><span>`, but only if one is not already specified by the user. This simple policy demonstrates some powerful features in Kyverno like </span><a href="https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/writing-policies-variables/"><span>variable substitution</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kyverno.io/docs/writing-policies/writing-policies-validate/"><span>conditional anchors</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>Once the policy is configured in your cluster, create a new namespace and verify the labels have been added to the namespace automatically.</span></p>
<p>Create a new namespace:</p>

<p>View the namespace:</p>
<div>
<pre data-lang="Bash"><code><span>kubectl get ns test -o yaml</span></code></pre>
</div>
<p>This should show a namespace similar to:</p>
<div>
<pre data-lang="YAML"><code>apiVersion: v1
kind: Namespace
metadata:
  labels:
    kyverno/network: default
    kyverno/user: docker-for-desktop</code></pre>
</div>
<p><span>Now, what if you want to make sure that users cannot update a specific label?</span></p>
<p>Kyverno makes that easy to do as well! <span>Here is a policy that prevents the update of the `</span><span>kyverno/network</span><span>` label:</span></p>
<div>
<pre data-lang="YAML"><code>apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: protect-label
spec:
  validationFailureAction: enforce
  background: false
  rules:
  - name: block-updates-for-label
    match:
      resources:
        kinds:
           - Namespace
  validate:
    message: Updating label `kyverno/network` is not allowed
    deny:
    - key: "{{ request.operation }}"
      operator: "EQUALS"
      value: UPDATE</code></pre>
</div>
<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>
<p><span>Managing Kubernetes configurations can be complex, and policy engines provide standardization, automated validation, and the ability to mutate and generate configurations.</span></p>
<p><span>Kyverno is an open-source policy engine designed for Kubernetes. It has a minimal learning curve and provides tremendous flexibility for Kubernetes administrators to solve Day-2 operations challenges using Kubernetes’ powerful declarative management capabilities and native tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
  <p>One of the hard problems in language implementation research is benchmarking.
Some people argue, we should benchmark only applications that actually matter
to people. Though, this has various issues. Often, such applications are embedded in
larger systems, and it’s hard to isolate the relevant parts. In many cases,
these applications can also not be made available to other researchers.
And, of course, things change over time, which means
maintaining projects like <a href="http://dacapobench.org/">DaCapo</a>, <a href="https://renaissance.dev/">Renaissance</a>,
or <a href="https://browserbench.org/JetStream/">Jet Stream</a> is a huge effort.</p>

<p>Which brought me to the perhaps futile question of how we could have more realistic
synthetic benchmarks. <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2491894.2464161">ACDC</a>
and <a href="https://research.google/pubs/pub43216/">ACDC-JS</a> are synthetic garbage collection benchmarks.
While they don’t seem to be widely used, they seemed to have been a useful
tool for specific tasks. Based on observing metrics for a range of relevant
programs, these synthetic benchmarks were constructed to be configurable
and allow us to measure a range of realistic behaviors.</p>

<p>I am currently interested in the startup, warmup, and cold-code performance
of virtual machines, and want to study their performance issues.
To me it seems that I need to look at large programs to get interesting and relevant results. With large, I mean millions of lines of code, because that’s where our systems currently struggle.
So, how could we go about to create a synthetic benchmark for huge code bases?</p>

<h2 id="generating-random-code-that-looks-real">Generating Random Code that Looks Real</h2>

<p>In my last two blog posts [<a href="https://stefan-marr.de/2020/12/shape-of-large-source-code/">1</a>, <a href="https://stefan-marr.de/2020/12/shape-of-large-source-code-ruby/">2</a>],
I looked at the shape of large code bases in Pharo and Ruby to obtain data
for a new kind of synthetic benchmark. I want to try to generate random code
that looks “real”. And by looking real I mean for the moment that it is shaped
in a way that is similar to real code. This means, methods have realistic
length, number of local variables, and arguments. For classes, they should have
a realistic number of methods and instance variables.
In the last two blog posts, I looked at the corresponding static code metrics
to get an idea of how large code bases actually look like.</p>

<p>In this post, I am setting out to use the data to get a random number generator
that can be used to generate “realistic looking” code bases.
Of course, this doesn’t mean that the code does do anything realistic.</p>

<p>Small steps… One at a time… 👨🏼‍🔬</p>

<p>So, let’s get started by looking at how the length of methods looks like in
large code bases.</p>

<p>Before we get started, just one more simplification: I will only consider
methods that have 1 to 30 lines (of code).
Setting an upper bound will make some of the steps here simpler,
and plots more legible.</p>

<p>And a perhaps little silly, but nonetheless an issue, it will avoid me having to change
one of the language implementations I am interested in, which is unfortunately
limited to 128 bytecodes and 128 literals (constants, method names, etc.),
which in practice translates to something like 30 lines of code.
While this could be fixed, let’s assume 30 lines of code per method
ought to be enough for anybody…</p>

<h2 id="length-of-methods">Length of Methods</h2>

<p>When it comes to measuring the length of methods,
there are plenty of possibly ways to go about.
Pharo counts the non-empty lines.
And for Ruby, I counted either all lines, or the lines that are not just empty
and not just comments.</p>

<p>The histogram below shows the results for methods with 1-30 lines.</p>

<figure><img src="https://stefan-marr.de/assets/2021/01/towards-a-synthetic-vm-startup-cold-code-benchmark/loc-per-methods-1.png"><figcaption>Distribution of the length of methods.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Despite difference in languages and metrics, we see a pretty similar shape.
Perhaps with the exception of the methods with 1-3 lines.</p>

<h2 id="generating-realistic-method-length-from-uniform-random-numbers">Generating Realistic Method Length from Uniform Random Numbers</h2>

<p>Before actually generating method length randomly, let’s define the goal a bit
more clearly.</p>

<p>In the end, I do want to be able to generate a code base where
the length of methods has a distribution very similar to what we see
for Ruby and Pharo.</p>

<p>Though, the random number generators we have in most systems generate numbers
in a uniform distribution typically in the range from 0 to 1.
This means, each number between 0 and 1 is going to be equally likely to be
picked.
To get other kinds of distributions,
for instance the normal distribution,
we can use what is called the <em>inverted cumulative distribution function</em>.
When we throw our uniformly distributed numbers into this function,
we should end up with random numbers that are distributed according to the
distribution that we want.</p>

<p>One of the options to do this would be:</p>

<ol>
  <li>determine the cumulative distribution of the method length</li>
  <li>approximate a function to represent the cumulative distribution</li>
  <li>and invert the function</li>
</ol>

<p>I found this <a href="https://blog.demofox.org/2017/08/05/generating-random-numbers-from-a-specific-distribution-by-inverting-the-cdf/">post here helpful</a>.
Though, I struggled defining a good enough function to get results I liked.</p>

<p>So, instead, let’s do it the pedestrian way:</p>

<ol>
  <li>calculate the cumulative sum for the method length (cumulative distribution)</li>
  <li>normalize it to the sum of all lengths</li>
  <li>use the result to look up the desired method length for a uniform random number</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="determining-the-cumulative-distribution">Determining the Cumulative Distribution</h3>

<p>Ok, so, the first step is to determine the cumulative distribution.
Since we have the three different cases for Pharo, Ruby with all lines and lines of code,
this is slightly more interesting.</p>

<figure><img src="https://stefan-marr.de/assets/2021/01/towards-a-synthetic-vm-startup-cold-code-benchmark/cum-dist-method-length-1.png"><figcaption>Percentage of methods with a specific length in lines or LOC.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The plot above shows the percentage of methods that have a length
smaller or equal to a specific size.</p>

<p>So, the next question is, which metrics should I choose?
Since the data is a bit noisy, especially for small methods,
let’s try and see what the different types of means give us.</p>

<figure><img src="https://stefan-marr.de/assets/2021/01/towards-a-synthetic-vm-startup-cold-code-benchmark/cum-dist-means-1.png"><figcaption>Different means applied to the cumulative percentage of methods for a given length.</figcaption></figure>

<p>From the above plot, the geometric mean seems a good option.
Mostly because I don’t want to have a too high and too low number of methods
with a single line.</p>

<p>Using the geometric mean, gives us the following partial cumulative distribution
table:</p>

<table>
 <thead>
  <tr>
   <th> length </th>
   <th> cum.perc </th>
  </tr>
 </thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
   <td> 1 </td>
   <td> 0.0520631 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td> 2 </td>
   <td> 0.2647386 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td> 3 </td>
   <td> 0.5137505 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td> 4 </td>
   <td> 0.6068893 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td> 5 </td>
   <td> 0.6851248 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td> 6 </td>
   <td> 0.7377313 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td> 7 </td>
   <td> 0.7861208 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td> 8 </td>
   <td> 0.8200427 </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td> 9 </td>
   <td> 0.8490800 </td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>In R, the language I use for these blog posts,
I can then use something like the following to take a uniform random number
from the range of 0-1 to determine the desired method length in the range
of 1-30 lines (<code>u</code> being here the random number):</p>

<div><div><pre><code>loc_from_u &lt;- function (u) {
  Position(function (e) { u &lt; e }, cumulative_distribution_tbl)
}
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>There are probably more efficient ways of going about it.
I suppose a binary search would be a good option, too.</p>

<p>The general idea is that with our random number <code>u</code>,
we find the last position in our array with the cumulative distribution,
where <code>u</code> is smaller than the value in the array at that position.
The position then corresponds to the desired length of a method.</p>

<figure><img src="https://stefan-marr.de/assets/2021/01/towards-a-synthetic-vm-startup-cold-code-benchmark/result-with-test-1.png"><figcaption>Three examples of methods generated, for 100, 1,000, or 100,000 methods.</figcaption></figure>

<p>As a test, the three plots above are generated from 100, 1,000, and 100,000
uniformly distributed random numbers, and it looks pretty good.
Comparing to the very first set of plots in this post, this seems like a workable
and relatively straightforward approach.</p>

<p>To use these results and generate methods of realistic sizes in other languages,
the full cumulative
distribution is as follows: [0.0520631241473676, 0.264738601144803, 0.51375051909561, 0.606889305644881, 0.685124787391578, 0.737731315373305, 0.786120782303596, 0.820042695503066, 0.849080035429476, 0.872949669419948, 0.893437469528804, 0.909716501217452, 0.923766913966731, 0.935357118689879, 0.945074445934092, 0.953001059092301, 0.959743413722937, 0.965457396618992, 0.97072530951053, 0.975142363341172, 0.979105371695575, 0.982654867280203, 0.985723232507825, 0.988399223471247, 0.990960559703172, 0.993172997617124, 0.9951015059492, 0.996855138214434, 0.998541672752458, 1].</p>

<h2 id="method-arguments-and-local-variables">Method Arguments and Local Variables</h2>

<p>With the basics down, we can look at the number of arguments and local variables
of methods. One thing I haven’t really thought about in the previous posts
is that there’s a connection between the various metrics. They are not independent of each other.</p>

<p>Perhaps this is most intuitive for the number of local variables a method has.
We wouldn’t expect a method with a single line of code to have many local
variables, while longer methods may tent to have more local variables, too.</p>

<h3 id="number-of-method-arguments">Number of Method Arguments</h3>

<p>Let’s start out by looking at how method length and number of arguments relate
to each other.</p>

<p>I’ll use the cumulative distribution for these plots, since that’s what I am
looking for in the end.</p>

<figure><img src="https://stefan-marr.de/assets/2021/01/towards-a-synthetic-vm-startup-cold-code-benchmark/cum-dist-num-args-1.png"><figcaption>Percentage of methods with a specific number of arguments.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The two plots above show for each method length from 1-30 a line
(so, this is where limiting the method length becomes actually handy).
Though, because there are many, I highlight only every third length,
including length 1 methods.
The bluest blue is length 1, and the red is length 30.</p>

<p>We can see here differences between the languages.
For instance, for methods with only 1 line in Pharo, only ≈45% of them
have no argument. While for Ruby methods, that’s perhaps around 70%.</p>

<p>The other interesting bit that is clearly visible is that the number
of arguments doesn’t have a simple direct relationship to length.
Indeed, longer methods seem to have more likely fewer arguments.
While medium length methods are more likely to have a few more arguments,
at least for the Ruby data this seems to be the case.</p>

<p>So, from these plots, I conclude that I actually need a different cumulative
distribution table for each method length. Since we saw how they look for
method length, I won’t include the details. Though, of course happy to share
the data if anyone wants it.</p>

<h3 id="number-of-methods-locals">Number of Methods Locals</h3>

<p>Next up, let’s look at the number of locals.</p>

<figure><img src="https://stefan-marr.de/assets/2021/01/towards-a-synthetic-vm-startup-cold-code-benchmark/cum-dist-num-locals-1.png"><figcaption>Percentage of methods with a specific number of local variables.</figcaption></figure>

<p>For the Pharo data, it’s not super readable, but basically 100% of methods
of length 1 have zero local variables.
Compared to the plot on arguments, we also see a pretty direct relationship
to length, because the blue-to-red gradient comes out nicely in the plot.</p>

<p>In the case of Ruby, this seems to …</p></div></div>

    <div><p>A colleague of mine has repeatedly called for some of the controllers in our project to be refactored. He says they're messy, but what I think he means is that they're hard to understand. At first glance they do seem complex yes but upon closer inspection:</p><ul>
<li>There are step-by-step instructions in the comments explaining what's going on.</li>
<li>Variable and method names are descriptive but not overly verbose.</li>
<li>The code is spaced, formatted and indented correctly.</li>
</ul><p>I can see why my colleague might see the code this way; it does have multiple concerns, but it came to be this way iteratively over the course of two years. Everything it does relates to a previously-defined requirement i.e. it does what it's supposed to. We also haven't made any changes to it for several months because it hasn't caused any bugs nor are there any major performance bottlenecks.</p><p>One common developer bias is that old code is bad. You've never heard anyone say the phrase "legacy code" without contempt in their tone. I <i>can</i> appreciate that sometimes old code doesn't conform to newer practices agreed on by a team. For example, legacy PHP code might use the now-deprecated PSR-2 standard, but the tech lead might want everyone to write PSR-12. But is this really a good enough reason to potentially jeopardise a piece of working functionality?</p><p>I think the reason old code is often seen this way is because it takes longer to remember.

<p>Even when we talk about code, when we're able to recall previous conversations/decisions/motivations quickly, we can talk about it confidently and convey to others that we understand it well. Unfortunately saying, "I need five to ten minutes to refresh my memory of this" doesn't convey the same sense of confidence. Always prepare.</p><p>Part of the solution to reducing this "time to recall" is through better internal documentation. We use a tool like <a href="https://www.codestream.com/" target="_blank">Codestream</a> but I'll admit that context is not always captured; sometimes it's the "why" not the "what" that's relevant. In my opinion, good old-fashioned comments work best; I try to write mine like a numbered set of instructions. Of course you can also convey meaning with your git commit message.</p><p>The other part of the solution is to agree as a team under what circumstances code should be refactored. If your team collectively agrees that stable, well-documented code should be refactored, run.<br></p></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
    
<p>Compression is a trick that can be used to solve a load of problems. Often, your
tools will compress content transparently: most modern browsers ask for gzipped
HTTP payload, and some filesystems can be configured to compress blocks without
the user ever asking.</p>

<p>Outside of well known use cases, there are a variety of opportunities to improve
efficiency or save a load of money by leveraging compression. It’s useful to be
aware of common use cases, so you can take these opportunities when they arise.</p>



<p>As a recent example, my team were migrating logs from one Elasticsearch cluster
to another. While not quite Big Data™, this cluster had 10 billion log entries,
or some 60TB of raw JSON.</p>

<p>Having experience tackling long-running, large-scale migrations like this, you
want to build a process that allows you to ‘save game’ as frequently as
possible. This means you can build and run an export process, handling whatever
issues will occur (they will, I promise!), then move cleanly on-to the import
process. As with exports, your import process will also screw up: so it, too,
should be easily re-runnable.</p>

<p>As it is used across a load of GoCardless systems, <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub">Google
Pub/Sub</a> is a natural fit for this problem.
Google’s marketing tagline even sounds like it was written to describe our
ideal, decoupled process:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Pub/Sub is an asynchronous messaging service that decouples services that
produce events from services that process events.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In Pub/Sub, you <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/publisher">publish messages to topics</a>. Each topic can
have many subscriptions, which <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/subscriber">consumers can pull messages
from</a>. In the most simple terms, the migration would:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Export logs from the origin cluster into a (per-index) Pub/Sub topic</li>
  <li>Configure the Pub/Sub subscriptions to retain events (set
<code>retain_acked_messages</code>, see: <a href="https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/docs/replay-overview">Replaying and purging messages</a>)
so that we may replay them, if our import goes wrong</li>
  <li>Import logs by pulling messages from the topic subscriptions</li>
</ol>

<p>So, what’s this got to do with compression? Like most Cloud services, Pub/Sub
charges on usage, which means we’ll incur fees proportional to the data we’ll
push through the service.</p>

<p>These charges are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>$40 per TiB delivered, applied to publish and subscribe</li>
  <li>Google Compute Engine network rates (we’ll ignore these, as they get complicated)</li>
  <li>Seek-related message storage, to retain our messages, at $0.27 per GiB-month</li>
</ul>

<p>In the best case where we import/export successfully on the first attempt (this
won’t, and did not happen), we’ll be charged <strong>2 x $40 x 60TB = $4,800 for
message delivery</strong>, as it will apply to both publish and subscribe. If we retain
our messages for 2 weeks while the migration is on-going, we’ll be charged <strong>0.5
x $0.27 x 60,000GB = $8,100 for message storage</strong>.</p>

<p>This leaves a <strong>lower-bound of $12,900 to perform the migration</strong>.</p>

<p>Now, GoCardless isn’t poor. And as a rule of thumb, you normally want to
optimise for engineering hours over infrastructure cost.</p>

<p>But if you can reduce cost with a minimal amount of effort, you should.</p>



<p>To this end, we made a small change to our migration tool (<code>elastic-toolbox</code>) to
support compression of the messages we published to Pub/Sub.</p>

<p>With error handling removed, this is the publish method, where we apply
compression after serialisation:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// Publish takes a message and publishes it to the Pub/Sub topic. If</span>
<span>// compression is enabled, the message payload is compressed, and the</span>

    <span>return</span> <span>nil</span>

<p>As our savings will be proportional to our compression ratio (compressed /
original bytes), we care a lot about how compressible our data is.</p>

<p>JSON logs are likely to be very compressible as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Logs share many of the JSON keys, which can be de-duplicated (<code>kubernetes.pod_name</code>)</li>
  <li>Values of common log fields might occur very often (<code>kubernetes.labels.namespace</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>Using the modified <code>elastic-toolbox</code> to run an concurrent export of three
different indices, we can use the
<code>elastic_toolbox_export_pubsub_write_compression_ratio</code> Prometheus metric (see
the <code>compress</code> method above) to build a heatmap of compression ratios:</p>

<figure>
  <a href="https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/gHTtGvZh2hK67q03kIU4uJM3q4Sqek8p?orgId=2" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/compress-everything-ratio-heatmap.png" alt="Compressed bytes divided by original bytes, always less than 30%">
  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Compressed bytes / original bytes, always &lt;30%
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This heatmap shows that all messages compressed to <strong>at most 30% the original
size</strong>. When measured over our entire corpus of logs, we average at a <strong>~12%
compression ratio, meaning 1GiB of logs becomes just 120MiB.</strong></p>

<p>Our original bill of $12,900 has become 12% x $12,900 = $1,548.</p>

<p>This means <strong>we’ve saved about $11,500.</strong></p>

<p>Explore the data for yourself at this <a href="https://snapshot.raintank.io/dashboard/snapshot/gHTtGvZh2hK67q03kIU4uJM3q4Sqek8p?orgId=2" target="_blank">Raintank Snapshot: elastic-toolbox compression</a>.</p>



<p>The most obvious next step was to apply this to our logging pipeline all the
time. Given we ship container logs straight into Pub/Sub, pulling them out of a
subscription into Elasticsearch, we can easily write a
<a href="https://www.fluentd.org/">fluentd</a> filter that applies the same compression
strategy.</p>

<p>My colleague Ben put together an awesome dashboard to track how much we save,
which works out to be <strong>several thousand a month</strong>:</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://blog.lawrencejones.dev/assets/images/compress-everything-headline-figures.png" alt="Savings from compressing logs as they enter the logging pipeline, several thousand dollars a month">
  <figcaption>

</figure>



<p>If you work in a Cloud environment, there are so many opportunities to save
money by compressing your data.</p>

<p>Beyond logs, another GoCardless example is a tool called
<a href="https://github.com/gocardless/draupnir">draupnir</a>. This service hosts copies of
our production databases for load testing and forensic analysis (query plan
prediction, etc). Google SSD storage costs $187 per TiB/month, which means every
copy of our <strong>5TB Postgres costs $1,000/month</strong>.</p>

<p>Draupnir might host several copies at a time, depending on the use cases. We can
save a load of money by enabling <a href="https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Compression">btrfs
compression</a> to
transparently compress the filesystem blocks, allowing us to use <strong>~70% less SSD
capacity</strong> than we may otherwise.</p>

<p>And if you thought compression was limited to cost savings, you’d be wrong!
Having suffered from occasional micro-outages when people ran large backfills or
built new database indexes, we solved the problem by enabling Postgres WAL
compression (see <a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/postgresql-underused-features-wal-compression/">Postgres Underused Features: WAL Compression</a>,
or the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/runtime-config-wal.html">Postgres Write Ahead Log docs</a>).</p>

<p>The outages were caused by database operations creating a large amount of WAL
churn, where the replica would stall while writing the WAL to disk. By
compressing the WAL stream, we <strong>significantly reduced the IO spikes, allowing
the replica to handle the stream without issue</strong>.</p>

<p>There are more examples, but I think this paints a good picture.</p>



<p>Compression is a trade-off, a decision we make to trade CPU for another resource
that might be more expensive or less available. The value assigned to CPU,
memory, or network bandwidth continually changes, and you’ll need to make this
calculation on a case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>This post aimed to cover a scenario where the cost of compression, in both
compute resource and time-to-build, was significantly outweighed by the savings
it would make. Not all situations will have the same economics, but it takes a
few minutes of napkin maths to decide either way.</p>

<p>I hope this case study prompts consideration of compression outside of standard,
boring use-cases, and helps to find opportunities where you can apply it to your
own systems.</p>

<p>I will tell you a word, and you think of the first image that comes to your mind. Are you ready? Leader!</p>



<p>If you have thought of a white man, dressed in a perfectly fitting suit, you have thought about what most people think when they hear that word. But is that all there is for this word? Apart from the unconscious bias of race and gender, does it define leaders’ characteristics?</p>



<p>If we check the word ‘leader’ in the dictionary, we find:&nbsp;<em>“a person who guides or directs a group”.&nbsp;</em>That definition is so straightforward and clear that we often don’t question what makes a great technical leader. This article will dive deep into the requirements to become a great technical leader. We will understand the similarities and differences to non-tech leadership, and I hope this can guide you in your career.</p>



<h2>The first pillar: Teamwork</h2>

<p><span>Technical leadership doesn’t exist isolated; some other type of leadership always accompanies it.</span></p>



<p>An abundance of developers thinks their managers are obsolete dinosaurs who don’t know how to write a single code line. Yes, they may be right in some cases, but that doesn’t mean their managers cannot execute the tasks at hand. Let me explain!</p>



<p><span>The most important organizational factor for a company is to make sure they never lose sight of strategic decisions.</span> The bigger the company, the more substantial the term ‘strategy’ becomes. Enterprise strategy is the only way companies can guarantee employees are walking in the same direction and working for the same goals. Once the top management team decides which will be their primary goals, they are passed down to every team hierarchically, ensuring it reaches every single soul.</p>



<p>Managers are responsible for making sure their segment of the company is under control strategically, but not tactically, and there is where technical leadership shines. The fundamental responsibility of tech leadership roles is to make sure the manager’s strategic definitions are going in the right direction and that projects are executed correctly without hurting any of the premises defined by the board of directors.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>The quintessence of technical leadership success is to work with your business partners as if you were a single entity in this universe. If you don’t do that, you will be doomed, I promise.</span></p>



<h2><strong>The second pillar: Knowledge</strong></h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/matthew-feeney-Nwkh-n6l25w-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/matthew-feeney-Nwkh-n6l25w-unsplash.jpg 640w, https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/matthew-feeney-Nwkh-n6l25w-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>You have become a technical leader. Congratulations! This promotion means you are a ‘knowledge reference’ to your peers. While this may seem counter-intuitive, <span>it means you now have way more pressure to keep yourself updated on computer science’s latest trends.</span></p>



<p>Let’s be sincere and frank here: people become more suspicious of you when you cannot clarify their doubts and help them solve their difficulties. There will be times where you will be challenged by developers both directly and indirectly, as they will try to check your boundaries and understand if you’re ready for that position. If you can answer those provocations politely and with strong fundamentals, you succeed at gaining developers’ trust.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Answer challenges appropriately and remember that if you respond in a non-polite way, you fail. You fail both because you have misbehaved and because you are there to support people. It is OK not to know things, make sure you write it down and be ready for answering the question the next day. Never say phrases such as: “Oh, you don’t know that? What a shame! Let me show you how to do that right”, that is typical of lousy knowledge leadership.</p>



<p><span>Never doubt your authority, but make sure you recognize your ignorance. Keep working on what you don’t know in a planned and organized fashion. Technology evolves fast, and without study planning, you will get obsolete fast too.</span></p>



<p>Another critical point is that <span>technical leadership implies that you will have to coach and help your peers think about problems in new ways.</span> But to delve into how to do that, we need to talk about the next pillar: communication.</p>



<h2><strong>The third pillar: Communication</strong></h2>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pavan-trikutam-71CjSSB83Wo-unsplash.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pavan-trikutam-71CjSSB83Wo-unsplash.jpg 640w, https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/pavan-trikutam-71CjSSB83Wo-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure>



<p>Just like non-technical leaders, you will be responsible for communicating your ideas, and your action plans to execute each one of them. You will receive several invitations to present ideas to various people, such as clients, managers, developers, boards of directors, etc. But what differs from the regular communication of business leads? Well, a lot!</p>



<p>The first thing you have to understand is that the higher you go in your leadership career, the fewer people will understand the words you use. The more you know, the greater your vocabulary and the attention you will give to the definitions you use; hence you can’t talk as you normally would. You have to put a lot of effort to talk using less technical vocabulary.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>I think this exercise applies well to this case, which helps techies explain challenging concepts in a very accessible format:&nbsp;<em><u>“How would you explain X to five years old with the fewer words possible?”</u></em>.&nbsp;</span></p>



<p>From my personal experience, I can tell you that developers live a very pressuring moment where technology novelties emerge every day. The learning pace they need to maintain in their careers is hard, which gives origin to the famous imposter syndrome.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>The most important lesson I’ve learnt is that to motivate developers, the most efficient method is to help them learn new concepts and abilities</span>.&nbsp;That stern necessity to continually learn new things is the most significant pain in their lives. When you allow them to ease that pain, you start a genuine mentorship relationship that is exceptional for them and augment their loyalty and desire to work.</p>



<p><span>To create a safe learning environment for developers, you need to want that: genuinely!</span>&nbsp;Otherwise, you will cause questions and ideas to become threats. Developers will start to judge each others’ words, and you will create an oppressive environment.</p>



<p>It is harder for technical leaders to think of people first, but the truth is that no matter where you work, the labour output will always be produced directly or indirectly by people. But how can we excel at guiding a group of people?</p>



<p>First, you have to understand that almost every company oscillates into more relaxed and more challenging moments. The lower you go into the company’s hierarchy, the more difficulty you will find to maintain resiliency.&nbsp;</p>



<p><span>Be positive! The world is a constant duality of good and bad aspects of everything. Always choose to see the positive elements of every situation!</span>&nbsp;You have the choice to look at things as opportunities, no matter how hard they are, it means people will learn new things in the process. Doing that is key to developing an inspirational communication style that motivates your followers and allows them to ease their uncertainties.</p>



<p>Remember that on the other side of all communication media, there are people. Demonstrate consideration and understand that everyone has feelings and personal lives, ambitions and dreams. It never hurts to acknowledge their achievements or ideas to improve work quality. Remember to compliment others when they do outstanding work, and teach them the lessons you’ve learnt to become a technological leader. They might want that too.</p>



<p><span>The most important concept here is: Be real! You are not a technological machine. When you act genuinely, you will perform accordingly: People first, then comes technology.</span></p>



<h2><strong>The fourth pillar: Vision</strong></h2>



<figure><ul><li><figure><img loading="lazy" width="640" height="427" src="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karsten-wurth-rafblRbne3o-unsplash.jpg" alt="An image of a road suggesting long-term vision" data-id="791" data-full-url="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karsten-wurth-rafblRbne3o-unsplash.jpg" data-link="https://douglasrocha.me/?attachment_id=791" srcset="https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karsten-wurth-rafblRbne3o-unsplash.jpg 640w, https://douglasrocha.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/karsten-wurth-rafblRbne3o-unsplash-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></figure></li></ul></figure>



<p>The last, but not least important pillar for a great technical leader is vision. It is expected from you to understand the direction that the company is going in the short and long-term (5+ years). This pillar is only possible when you accomplish all the previous steps to become a great technical leader.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you don’t have excellent&nbsp;communication&nbsp;with the&nbsp;business leads,&nbsp;you will never understand the company’s&nbsp;strategical direction. If you have poor contact with the developers, either because you&nbsp;lack knowledge&nbsp;or&nbsp;treat them poorly, you won’t have support to execute your projects. <span>This paragraph shows how important it is to build the previous steps before you go into this one</span>, so let’s dive into what we mean by vision.</p>



<p>As we said before, the higher you go into the company’s hierarchy, the more critical the word strategy becomes. An understanding of the long-term plan is the only way you can excel in technical leadership roles. To suggest new features and products, you have to communicate with business leaders, and unless you talk the same language as them, you won’t be able to sell your ideas.</p>



<p><span>It doesn’t mean that you cannot criticize the strategical plan of the company!</span>&nbsp;Remember you are a technical person, if business leaders make decisions that go against technology’s core principles, you have to express your opinions, so don’t be afraid to do that.&nbsp;<span>Make sure you are polite and build your arguments with analytically profound details.</span> The larger the amount numbers, graphs, and projections, the easier it will be to explain your criticisms.</p>



<p><span>When you achieve the enlightenment of where the company is going, you become the technical glue.</span> When managers fail to explain the vision, you will be responsible for guaranteeing the tactical execution of projects is going in the right direction, so you must pass on the vision to the technical team.&nbsp;<span>The big picture is essential because it allows us to create a sense of unity and progress</span>, enabling creating a healthy development team culture.</p>

<h4 id="the-main-problems-that-occur-in-data-validation-libraries">The main problems that occur in data validation libraries</h4>
<p><strong>Problem #1.</strong> Many validators check only those data for which the validation rules are described. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is important for us that any user input that is not explicitly allowed is ignored. That is, the validator must cut out all data for which the validation rules are not described. This is simply a fundamental requirement.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem #2.</strong> Procedural description of validation rules.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not want to think about the validation algorithm every time, we just want to describe declaratively how the correct data should look. In fact, we want to specify a data schema (<a href="https://livr-spec.org/introduction/core-concepts.html#why-not-json-schema">why not "JSON Schema"</a>).</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem #3.</strong> Description of validation rules in the form of code. </p>
<blockquote>
<p>It would seem that this is not so terrible, but this immediately nullifies all attempts to serialize the validation rules and use the same validation rules on the backend and frontend.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem #4.</strong> Validation stops at the first field with an error.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This approach does not allow you to highlight all the error / required fields in the form.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem #5.</strong> Non-standardized error messages.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, "Field name is required". I can not show such a mistake to the user for a number of reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The field in the interface can be called quite differently</li>
<li>interface may not be in English</li>
<li>you need to distinguish between the type of error. For example, show errors on an empty value in a special way</li>
</ul>
<p>That is, you need to return not an error message, but standardized error codes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem #6.</strong> Numerical error codes.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It's just inconvenient to use. I want the error codes to be intuitive. Agree that the error code "REQUIRED" is more understandable than the code "27". The logic is similar to working with exception classes.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem #7.</strong> There is no way to check hierarchical data structures.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Today, in the days of different JSON APIs, this can not be avoided. In addition to the validation of hierarchical data, it is necessary to provide and return error codes for each field.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem #8.</strong> Limited rule set.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are always not enough standard rules. The validator must be extensible and allow adding rules of any complexity to it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem #9.</strong> Too much responsibility.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The validator should not generate forms, should not generate code, should not do anything other than validation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Problem #10.</strong> Inability to perform additional data processing.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Almost always, where there is validation, there is a need for some additional (often preliminary) data processing: cut out prohibited characters, bring them to lowercase, remove unnecessary spaces. Especially important is the removal of spaces at the beginning and end of the line. In 99% of cases they are not needed there. I know that before that I said that the validator should not do anything except validation.</p>
</blockquote>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><h5>December 31, 2020</h5><h2 id="intro">Intro
<a href="#intro">#</a></h2><p>My previous post <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline">Object Detection at 1840 FPS</a> made some readers wonder who would need to detect anything at 1840 FPS, but my good friend and “performance geek” <a href="https://tanelpoder.com/">Tanel Põder</a> had a different response:</p><blockquote><p>Nice article, I wonder if you could get to 2000 FPS?</p></blockquote><p>Challenge accepted.</p><p>This article is a deep dive into the techniques needed to get there. We will rewrite Pytorch model code, perform <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/master/tools/onnx-graphsurgeon">ONNX graph surgery</a>, optimize <a href="https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT/tree/master/plugin/batchedNMSPlugin">a TensorRT plugin</a> and finally we’ll quantize the model to bits (to 8 bit precision, that is). We will also keep track of divergence from full-precision accuracy with the COCO2017 validation dataset.</p><p>Code supporting this article can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/pbridger/tensorrt-ssd300-8bit-quantized">github.com/pbridger/tensorrt-ssd300-8bit-quantized</a>.</p><p>A quick preview of the final results:</p><div><p>
<label for="tabs-Preview-0">FP32 TensorRT</label></p><p><img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/tensorrt-object-detection-quantized/files/ssd300.fp32.b16.k256.trt.svg"></p><p>
<label for="tabs-Preview-1">FP16 TensorRT</label></p><p><img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/tensorrt-object-detection-quantized/files/ssd300.fp16.b16.k256.trt.svg"></p><p>

<label for="tabs-Preview-3">All Results</label></p></div><p>So how do we get to 2000 FPS? My previous post already brought the big guns — a <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline">TensorRT-optimized DeepStream pipeline</a> was needed to hit 1840 FPS running on 2x Nvidia 2080Ti cards. This time we will abandon TorchScript and <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/deepstream-sdk">DeepStream</a>, and we’ll put in the work to fully embrace TensorRT model compilation and execution.</p><h3 id="on-optimizing-arbitrary-numbers">On Optimizing Arbitrary Numbers
<a href="#on-optimizing-arbitrary-numbers">#</a></h3><p>1840 FPS, 2000 FPS, 2530 FPS — there is nothing special about any of these numbers, they are all hardware, resolution and model dependent. These optimization articles are about the practical usage of cutting-edge tools and techniques to achieve ambitious project goals or unlock cost savings.</p><p>Tuning a pipeline for throughput maximizes hardware utilization and efficiency in the datacenter, and it allows us to deploy larger models or more complex systems in compute-limited contexts (think IoT, embedded and mobile). It’s also just fun to explore the limits of powerful tools!</p><p>Let’s get started with a baseline from the <a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/video-analytics-deepstream-pipeline">previous article</a>.</p><h2 id="stage-0-deepstream-baseline">Stage 0: DeepStream Baseline
<a href="#stage-0-deepstream-baseline">#</a></h2><p>To recap, we got peak throughput with the DeepStream pipeline by using a hybrid model — a TensorRT-optimized SSD300 front-end with postprocessing code running in TorchScript in the libtorch runtime. All processing on GPU, of course. Here’s a reminder of some of the throughput milestones from the last article:</p><p>Why did we need TorchScript? Several common object-detection postprocessing operations — including thresholding and non-max-suppression (NMS) — can’t be seamlessly exported from Pytorch to ONNX and compiled with TensorRT. Leaving these operations in TorchScript allowed us to get great performance without rewriting any model code or creating TensorRT plugins.</p><p>Looking at the performance trace from Nsight Systems, we can see the TorchScript postprocessing comes in just under 10 ms. When we compiled the inference step with TensorRT we saw around 43 ms of TorchScript turn into about 16 ms equivalent processing — so anything executing in TorchScript seems ripe for optimization.</p><p>Here’s what it looked like in Nsight Systems:</p><a href="https://paulbridger.com/posts/tensorrt-object-detection-quantized/images/ds_80pc_tensorrt_hacked_ds_two_batch.png"><figure><img src="https://paulbridger.com/posts/tensorrt-object-detection-quantized/images/ds_80pc_tensorrt_hacked_ds_two_batch_hudc758a7e69d7157937e6a1d7caab6946_489589_896x520_fill_box_top_2.png" width="896" height="520"><figcaption><small></small></figcaption></figure></a><p>Let’s eliminate the TorchScript postprocessing and get the entire model running end-to-end in TensorRT.</p><h2 id="stage-1-end-to-end-tensorrt">Stage 1: End-to-End TensorRT
<a href="#stage-1-end-to-end-tensorrt">#</a></h2><p>The baseline Pytorch SSD300 model (including postprocessing) cannot be easily compiled with TensorRT for several reasons, all of which involve missing (or impossible) support for tensor operations:</p><ul><li><p>Subscripted tensor assignment results in <code>ScatterND</code> (indexed assignment) nodes in ONNX.</p></li><li><p>Score thresholding uses a mask operation, which cannot be expressed in the fixed-dimension world of TensorRT.</p></li><li><p>Torchvision’s batched non-max suppression (NMS) operation has no exact equivalent in TensorRT.</p></li></ul><p>We can fix the first by tweaking model code and re-exporting to ONNX, but to fix the other issues we’ll have to modify the ONNX computational graph — replacing these operations with a TensorRT plugin.</p><h3 id="11-rewriting-subscripted-tensor-assignment">1.1 Rewriting Subscripted Tensor Assignment

<p>We use the output of the smaller LSTM to computer $z_h^{i,f,g,o}$, $z_x^{i,f,g,o}$ and
$z_b^{i,f,g,o}$ using linear transformations.
We calculate $d_h^{i,f,g,o}(z_h^{i,f,g,o})$, $d_x^{i,f,g,o}(z_x^{i,f,g,o})$, and
$d_b^{i,f,g,o}(z_b^{i,f,g,o})$ from these again using linear transformations.
These are then used to scale the rows of weight and bias tensors of the main LSTM.</p>

these can be combined into a single linear transformation.

<p>I have always worked on computer vision applications. Honestly, transformers and attention-based methods were always the fancy things that I never spent the time to study. You know, maybe later and etc. Now they managed to reach state-of-the-art performance in ImageNet [3].</p>

<p>In NLP, transformers and attention have been utilized successfully in a plethora of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, word completion, and others.</p>

<p>After a lot of reading and searching, I realized that <strong>it is crucial to understand how attention emerged from NLP and machine translation</strong>. This is what this article is all about. After this article, we will inspect the transformer model like a boss. I give you my word.</p>

<p>Let’s start from the beginning: What is attention? Glad you asked!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Attention is <strong>memory through time</strong>. ~ Alex Graves 2020 [1]</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Always keep this in the back of your mind.</p>

<p>The attention mechanism emerged naturally from problems that deal with <strong>time-varying data (sequences)</strong>. So, since we are dealing with “sequences”, let’s formulate the problem in terms of machine learning first. Attention became popular in the general task of dealing with sequences.</p>

<h2 id="sequence-to-sequence-learning">Sequence to sequence learning</h2>

<p>Before attention and transformers, Sequence to Sequence (<strong>Seq2Seq</strong>) worked pretty much like this:</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/attention/seq2seq.png" alt="seq2seq"></p>

<p>The elements of the sequence \(x_1, x_2\), etc. are usually called <strong>tokens</strong>. They can be literally anything. For instance, text representations, pixels, or even images in the case of videos.</p>

<p>OK. So why do we use such models?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The goal is to transform an input sequence (source) to a new one (target).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The two sequences can be of the same or arbitrary length.</p>

<p>In case you are wondering, recurrent neural networks (<strong>RNNs</strong>) dominated this category of tasks. The reason is simple: <strong>we liked to treat sequences sequentially</strong>. Sounds obvious and optimal? <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=r24KwW5qbBo&amp;mid=40328&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flecture%2Fattention-models-in-nlp%2Ftransformer-decoder-rDLol" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Transformers</a> proved us it’s not!</p>

<h2 id="a-high-level-view-of-encoder-and-decoder">A high-level view of encoder and decoder</h2>

<p>The <strong>encoder</strong> and <strong>decoder</strong> are nothing more than stacked RNN layers, such as <a href="https://theaisummer.com/understanding-lstm/" target="_blank">LSTM’s</a>. The encoder processes the input and produces one <strong>compact representation</strong>, called <strong>z</strong>, from all the input timesteps. It can be regarded as a compressed format of the input.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/attention/encoder.png" alt="encoder"></p>

<p>On the other hand, the decoder receives the context vector <strong>z</strong> and generates the output sequence. The most common application of Seq2seq is language translation. We can think of the input sequence as the representation of a sentence in English and the output as the same sentence in French.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/attention/decoder.png" alt="decoder"></p>

<p>In fact, RNN-based architectures used to work very well especially with <a href="https://theaisummer.com/understanding-lstm/" target="_blank">LSTM</a> and <a href="https://theaisummer.com/gru/" target="_blank">GRU</a> components.</p>

<p>The problem? <strong>Only for small sequences</strong> (&lt;20 timesteps). Visually:</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/attention/scope-per-senquence-length.png" alt="scope-per-senquence-length"></p>

<p>Let’s inspect some of the reasons why this holds true.</p>

<h2 id="the-limitations-of-rnns">The limitations of RNN’s</h2>

<p>The intermediate representation <strong>z</strong> cannot encode information from all the input timesteps. This is commonly known as the <strong>bottleneck problem</strong>. The vector z needs to capture all the information about the source sentence.</p>

<p>In theory, mathematics indicates that this is possible. However in practice, how far we can see in the past (the so-called reference window) is finite. RNN’s tend to <strong>forget information</strong> from timesteps that are far behind.</p>

<p>Let’s see a concrete example. Imagine a sentence of 97 words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“On offering to help the <strong>blind man</strong>, the man who then <strong>stole his car</strong>, had not, at that precise moment, had any evil intention, quite the contrary, what he did was nothing more than obey those feelings of generosity and altruism which, as everyone knows, are the two best traits of human nature and to be found in much more hardened criminals than this one, a simple <strong>car-thief</strong> without any hope of advancing in his profession, exploited by the real owners of this enterprise, for it is they who take advantage of the needs of the <strong>poor</strong>.” ~ Jose Saramago, “Blindness.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice anything wrong? Hmmm… The bold words that facilitate the understanding are quite far!</p>

<p>In most cases, the vector <strong>z</strong> will be unable to compress the information of the early words as well as the 97th word. Eventually, the system pays more attention to the last parts of the sequence. However, this is not usually the optimal way to approach a sequence task and it is not compatible with the way humans translate or even understand language.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the stacked RNN layer usually create the well-know <strong>vanishing gradient problem</strong>, as perfectly visualized in the <a href="https://distill.pub/2019/memorization-in-rnns/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">distill article</a> on RNN’s:</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/attention/memorization-rnns.png" alt="memorization-rnns">
<em>The stacked layers in RNN’s may result in the vanishing gradient problem. <a href="https://distill.pub/2019/memorization-in-rnns/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Source</a></em></p>

<p>Thus, let us move beyond the standard encoder-decoder RNN.</p>

<h2 id="attention-to-the-rescue">Attention to the rescue!</h2>

<p>Attention was born in order to address these two things on the Seq2seq model. But how?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The core idea is that the context vector \(z\) should have access to all parts of the input sequence instead of just the last one.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In other words, we need to form a <strong>direct connection</strong> with each timestamp.</p>

<p>This idea was originally proposed for computer vision. Larochelle and Hinton [5] proposed that by looking at different parts of the image (glimpses), we can learn to accumulate information about a shape and classify the image accordingly. The same principle was later extended to sequences.  We can look at all the different words at the same time and learn to “pay attention“ to the correct ones depending on the task at hand.</p>

<p>And behold. This is what we now call <strong>attention</strong>, which is simply a notion of <strong>memory through time</strong>.</p>

<p>It is crucial in my humble opinion to understand the generality of this concept. To this end, we will cover all the different types that one can divide attention mechanisms.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-attention-implicit-vs-explicit">Types of attention: implicit VS explicit</h2>

<p>Before we continue with a concrete example of how attention is used on machine translation, let’s clarify one thing:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Very deep neural networks <strong>already</strong> learn a form of <strong>implicit attention</strong> [6].</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Deep networks are very rich function approximators. So, without any further modification, they <strong>tend to ignore parts of the input and focus on others</strong>. For instance, when working on human pose estimation, the network will be more sensitive to the pixels of the human body. Here is an example of <a href="https://theaisummer.com/self-supervised-learning-videos/" target="_blank">self-supervised approaches to videos</a>:</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/attention/activations-focus-in-ssl%20.png" alt="activations-focus-in-ssl ">
<em>Where activations tend to focus when trained in a self-supervised way. Image from Misra et al. ECCV 2016. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08561" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Source</a></em></p>

<p>“Many activation units show a <strong>preference</strong> for human body parts and pose.” ~ <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.08561" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Misra et al. 2016</a></p>

<p>One way to visualize implicit attention is by looking at the partial derivatives with respect to the input. In math, this is the <a href="https://medium.com/unit8-machine-learning-publication/computing-the-jacobian-matrix-of-a-neural-network-in-python-4f162e5db180" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jacobian matrix</a>, but it’s out of the scope of this article.</p>

<p>However, we have many reasons to enforce this idea of implicit attention. Attention is quite intuitive and interpretable to the human mind. Thus, by asking the network to <strong>‘weigh’ its sensitivity to the input based on memory from previous inputs,</strong> we introduce <strong>explicit attention</strong>. From now on, we will refer to this as attention.</p>

<h2 id="types-of-attention-hard-vs-soft">Types of attention: hard VS soft</h2>

<p>Another distinction we tend to make is between hard and soft attention. In all the previous cases, we refer to attention that is parametrized by <strong>differentiable functions</strong>. For the record, this is termed as <strong>soft attention</strong> in the literature. Officially:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Soft</strong> attention means that the function varies smoothly over its domain and, as a result, it is differentiable.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Historically, we had another concept called <strong>hard attention</strong>.</p>

<p>An intuitive example: You can imagine a robot in a labyrinth that has to make a <strong>hard</strong> decision on which path to take, as indicated by the red dots.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/attention/labyrinth-hard-attention.png" alt="labyrinth-hard-attention">
<em>A decision in the labyrinth. <a href="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/99/c7/c4/99c7c42d36b436a553db92ace92a796d.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Source</a></em></p>

<p>In general, <strong>hard means that it can be described by discrete variables while soft attention is described by continuous variables</strong>. In other words, hard attention replaces a deterministic method with a stochastic sampling model.</p>

<p>In the next example, starting from a random location in the image tries to find the “important pixels” for classification. Roughly, the algorithm has to choose a direction to go inside the image, during training.</p>

<p><img src="https://theaisummer.com/assets/img/posts/attention/hard-attention.png" alt="hard-attention">
<em>An example of hard attention.<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.6247v1.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Source</a></em></p>

<p>Since hard attention is non-differentiable, we can’t use the standard gradient descent. That’s why we need to train them using Reinforcement Learning (<strong>RL</strong>) techniques such as <a href="https://theaisummer.com/Policy-Gradients/" target="_blank">policy gradients and the REINFORCE algorithm</a> [6].</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the major issue with the REINFORCE algorithm and similar RL methods is that they have a high variance. To summarize:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Hard attention</strong> can be regarded as a switch mechanism to determine whether to attend to a region or not, which means that the function has many abrupt changes over its domain.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ultimately, given that we already have all the sequence tokens available, we can relax the definition of <strong>hard</strong> attention. In this way, we have a smooth differentiable function that we can train end to end with our favorite backpropagation.</p>

<p>Let’s get back to our showcase to see it in action!</p>

<h2 id="attention-in-our-encoder-decoder-example">Attention in our encoder-decoder example</h2>

<p>In the encoder-decoder RNN case, given previous state in the decoder as \(y_{i-1}\) and the the hidden state \(\textbf{h} = {h1,h_2, h_{n} }\), we have something like this:</p><p>

\[\textbf{e}_{i}=\operatorname{attention_{net}}\left(y_{i-1}, \textbf{h} \right) \in R{^n}\]

</p><p>The index i indicates the prediction step. Essentially, we define a score between the hidden state of the decoder and all the hidden states of the encoder.</p>

<p>More specifically, for each hidden state (denoted by j) \(\textbf{h}_1,\textbf{h}_2,\textbf{h}_n\) we will calculate a scalar:</p><p>

Previous <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19590391/" target="_blank"><u>scientific studies</u></a> have shown that swearing can actually increase a person's pain tolerance. But in polite company, we may try and substitute those swears with a similar-sounding word.</p>  <p>Robertson and her colleagues at the Swear Lab at Keele University in the U.K. wanted to understand what it was about swear words that has this analgesic effect on our pain, and if those fake swears are convincing substitutes for our brains.</p>  <p>Their research is published in the journal <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.00723/full"><u>Frontiers in Psychology</u></a>.</p>  <h2>'Fouch' and 'twizpipe' just won't cut it</h2>  <p>To find out how swearing affects pain tolerance, Robertson and her colleague, psychologist <a href="https://www.keele.ac.uk/psychology/people/richardstephens/"><u>Richard Stephens</u></a>, invented two fake swear words, 'fouch' and 'twizpipe.'&nbsp;</p>  <p>"We hypothesized that perhaps 'fouch' might help in the same way that swear words help because it sounds very similar, it's got that 'FFF-CHH' sound at the end," said Robertson, a post doctoral research assistant&nbsp;in the department of experimental psychology at the University of Oxford.</p>  <p>She adds that 'twizpipe' was chosen because it represented another hypothesis about why swears work —&nbsp;because they&nbsp;sound&nbsp;funny.</p>  <p>"There was an idea that perhaps swear words help because they're hilarious, and they help distract you in that way."</p>  <p>Robertson and Stephens then had 92 participants immerse their hands in a tub of ice cold water for as long as they could — which is a harmless, but painful experience. These participants were told to randomly repeat one of four words every three seconds - either a conventional swear word (in this case, the familiar 'f-word'), a neutral word (the word 'solid') and the words 'fouch' and 'twizpipe.'

  <p><time datetime="2021-01-02T13:16:26+0100">Sat, Jan 2, 2021</time></p><p>I recently went down the rabbit hole of Spark unit testing. As it’s uncharted territory, you find a plethora of conflicting opinions. So I decided to hack my way through it.
This article is a summary of my thoughts and findings. I try to go into the process I went through to resolve the problems I faced during my Spark journey.</p>
<p>To escape the theory, I will be using concrete examples throughout the article. The data represent the number of flights <code>count</code>, from <code>origin</code> countries to <code>destination</code> countries. It has the following structure:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Destination</th>
<th>Origin</th>
<th>Count</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Morocco</td>
<td>Spain</td>
<td>3</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Morocco</td>
<td>Egypt</td>
<td>5</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>France</td>
<td>Germany</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>…</td>
<td>…</td>
<td>…</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>The structure is mindlessly inspired by the <a href="https://github.com/databricks/Spark-The-Definitive-Guide/tree/master/data/flight-data/csv">Spark: The Definitive Guide’s Code Repository</a>. You find my code <a href="https://github.com/AYBLBD/spark-unit-testing">here</a>.</p>
<p>Before going into the testing section, I want to lay down the tools I am using, the basics of my project structure, and those of a testable Spark job. First thing first, this is the structure of my project:</p>
<pre>+-- project
|   +-- build.properties
|   +-- plugins.sbt
+-- src
|   +-- main
|   +-- test
+-- .gitignore
+-- .scalafix.conf
+-- .scalafmt.conf
+-- LICENSE
+-- build.sbt
+-- README.md
</pre>
<h2 id="dependencies">Dependencies</h2>
<p>Let’s start with Spark dependencies:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>// build.sbt
</span><span></span>libraryDependencies <span>++=</span> <span>Seq</span><span>(</span>
  <span>"org.apache.spark"</span> <span>%%</span> <span>"spark-core"</span> <span>%</span> sparkVersion<span>,</span>

  <span>"org.apache.spark"</span> <span>%%</span> <span>"spark-hive"</span> <span>%</span> sparkVersion <span>%</span> provided
<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h3 id="loading-configuration">Loading configuration</h3>
<p>For configuration loading, I am using Config. But I am curious about using it along with <a href="https://github.com/codingwell/scala-guice">Guice</a>. But for now:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>// build.sbt
</span><span>// https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.typesafe/config
</span><span></span>libraryDependencies <span>+=</span> <span>"com.typesafe"</span> <span>%</span> <span>"config"</span> <span>%</span> <span>"1.4.1"</span>
</code></pre></div><p>To add a configuration file inside your project. Create a <code>/src/main/resources/reference.conf</code> with the following:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ini"><span># reference.conf</span>
<span>settings {</span>
  <span>database</span> <span>=</span> <span>"dev"</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Or any configuration you need. Then use Config to load it as follows:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>val</span> config <span>=</span> <span>ConfigFactory</span><span>.</span>load<span>()</span>
<span>val</span> db<span>:</span> <span>String</span> <span>=</span> config<span>.</span>getString<span>(</span><span>"settings.database"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>And you are ready to go! Check the <a href="https://github.com/lightbend/config">docs</a> to find out more.</p>
<h3 id="testing-tool">Testing tool</h3>
<p>For testing, we will be using:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>// build.sbt

</code></pre></div><p>Scalatest for creating unit tests, Spark-fast-tests for comparing DataFrames, and Sijon for creating dynamically typed JSON. Scalatest is a flexible testing tool. It is simple to get up and running. An example from the front page:</p>

  <span>"A Stack"</span> should <span>"pop values in last-in-first-out order"</span> in <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Now that we know our tools, let’s explore our structure.</p>
<h2 id="project-structure">Project structure</h2>
<p>This is the point of divergence. Each team will have its own structure adapted to its specific needs. Here are my suggestions:</p>
<pre>scala
+-- me.ayoublabiad
|   +-- common
|   |   +-- SparkSessionWrapper.scala
|   +-- io
|   |   +-- Read.scala
|   |   +-- Write.scala

|   |   |   +-- FlightsTransformation.scala
|   |   |   +-- FlightsJob.scala
|   |   +-- Job.scala
|   +-- Main.scala
</pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>common</strong>: Package for common classes between jobs. A <code>Utils</code> class with frequently used functions could be added here.</li>
<li><strong>io</strong>: Package for input and output functions. Something like:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="scala">  <span>def</span> readFromCsvFileWithSchema<span>(</span>location<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> schema<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>DataFrame</span> <span>=</span>

      <span>.</span>schema<span>(</span>schema<span>)</span>
      <span>.</span>csv<span>(</span>location<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>with <code>val schema = "destination STRING, origin STRING, count INT"</code>. And the output:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="scala">  <span>def</span> writeTohive<span>(</span>spark<span>:</span> <span>SparkSession</span><span>,</span> dataFrame<span>:</span> <span>DataFrame</span><span>,</span> database<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>,</span> tableName<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Unit</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>
<p><strong>job</strong>: Is where the magic happens. This package contains domain-specific subpackages. Inside each subpackage, we find the transformations and the job of each domain-specific use case. This is a personal preference. But I found that grouping transformations in one package and the jobs in another package is burdensome when dealing the code. Especially when the number of use cases grows.</p>
<ul>
<li>The transformation functions should have one of the following signatures:</li>
</ul>
<div><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> function1<span>(</span>dataFrame<span>:</span> <span>DataFrame</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>DataFrame</span>

</span><span></span><span>def</span> function3<span>(</span>columnName<span>:</span> <span>String</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>Column</span>
</code></pre></div><p>They could be used:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>val</span> transformedDf<span>:</span> <span>DataFrame</span> <span>=</span> function1<span>(</span>rawDataFrame<span>)</span>

<span>// or

rawDataFrame
  <span>.</span>withColumn<span>(</span><span>"newColumnName"</span><span>,</span> function3<span>(</span><span>"oldColumnName"</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><ul>
<li>The job is where we group the three phases: reading, transforming, and writing. In its simplest form, it should look something like this:</li>
</ul>

<li>
<p><strong>Job.scala</strong>: In a trait to bind the jobs implementations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Main.scala</strong>: The entry point of your job.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Inside the job package is your playground. Now that we’re all on the same page, let’s discuss the ideas behind testing Spark jobs.</p>
<h2 id="a-case-for-testing-spark-jobs">A case for testing Spark jobs</h2>
<p>I like to think about Spark jobs as three simple phases:</p>

  </picture>
  <figcaption>The three phases of a Spark job</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You read your data, build your DAG, then you trigger the whole thing by a powerful almighty action. Now we have to keep in mind that our goal is not to test Spark! You are testing your logic and business logic, which is condensed mainly in the <strong>transformations</strong> step. You are trying to answer the question: Does this code reflect what I am thinking? Proceeding, I don’t find a use for testing the IO of your job, that’s on Spark. So we will stick to finding if we need to test those transformations.</p>
<p>Let’s concretize those ideas: Based on the data that we have, what the total count of flights for each destination?</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> getDestinationsWithTotalCount<span>(</span>flights<span>:</span> <span>DataFrame</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>DataFrame</span> <span>=</span>
    flights
      <span>.</span>groupBy<span>(</span><span>"destination"</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span>agg<span>(</span>sum<span>(</span><span>"count"</span><span>).</span>alias<span>(</span><span>"total_count"</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>That’s simple enough. Let’s assume you need the <code>origin</code> country column to stay, and you are not a big fan of self-joins. The <em>natural</em> solution would be using a <code>Window</code> function:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="scala">  <span>def</span> addTotalCountColumn<span>(</span>flights<span>:</span> <span>DataFrame</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>DataFrame</span> <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span> winExpDestination <span>=</span> <span>Window</span><span>.</span>partitionBy<span>(</span><span>"destination"</span><span>)</span>

    flights
      <span>.</span>withColumn<span>(</span><span>"total_count"</span><span>,</span> count<span>(</span><span>"count"</span><span>).</span>over<span>(</span>winExpDestination<span>))</span>
  <span>}</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Is this function worthy of testing? Probably not if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You remember that the boundaries of <code>Window</code>  by defaut are <code>UnboundedPreceding</code> and <code>UnboundedFollowing</code>;</li>
<li>If you noticed that I am using <code>count</code> instead of using <code>sum</code>!</li>
<li>If you understand why we can’t <code>sum</code> the <code>total_count</code> to get the total of all flights for all destinations.</li>
</ul>
<p>While this is a simple example to illustrate an idea, you can scale it up to more complex use cases. I think that Raymond Hettinger talk about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UANN2Eu6ZnM">The Mental Game of Python</a> is relevant in this context. Unfortunately, we can only hold so much in our 7 slots brain.</p>
<p>Although I lied before to prove a point, the natural solution should be:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="scala"><span>def</span> getDestinationsWithTotalCount<span>(</span>flights<span>:</span> <span>DataFrame</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>DataFrame</span> <span>=</span>
    flights
      <span>.</span>groupBy<span>(</span><span>"destination"</span><span>)</span>
      <span>.</span>agg<span>(</span>
        collect_list<span>(</span><span>"origin"</span><span>).</span>alias<span>(</span><span>"origins"</span><span>),</span>
        sum<span>(</span><span>"count"</span><span>).</span>alias<span>(</span><span>"total_count"</span><span>))</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Or is it? But you get the idea.</p>
<p>Another example I want to look at, is having to retrieve a parameter stored in a table. Let’s look at the tests first:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="scala">  <span>"getParamFromTable"</span> should <span>"turn the param if it exists"</span> in <span>{</span>
    <span>val</span> input<span>:</span> <span>DataFrame</span> <span>=</span> createDataFrame<span>(</span>
      obj<span>(</span>
       …</code></pre></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content"><p>As we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/why-did-the-great-stagnation-end.html">could be ending</a>. Caleb sees <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/cracks-in-the-great-stagnation/">cracks</a>. Noah expresses <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-for-the-2020s">techno-optimism</a>. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation. Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s.</p><p>What would constitute an end to the Great Stagnation? Any precise cutoff will be arbitrary, but for the sake of discussion, let’s say sustained growth in <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/total-factor-productivity-tfp/">utilization-adjusted total factor productivity</a> of 2 percent per year. By comparison, mean utilization-adjusted TFP growth from 1947 through 1972 was 2.1 percent. Since 2005, it has been 0.17 percent. (Note: it is important to use the utilization-adjusted series, as this corrects for the business cycle.)</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a7a8a1d9e4c4d1050c2902966a316436559074f1/cd6b6/img/tfp.png" alt="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947" title="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947"></p><p>Whatever your cutoff for TFP growth, one of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling production.</p><p>With that caveat firmly in mind, what will the next decade bring in terms of meaningful technological change? Here’s what I’m watching.</p><h2 id="biotech-and-health">Biotech and health</h2><p>We are coming off a huge win: two new mRNA COVID vaccines, conceived and brought to market in less than a year. The ability to encode and deploy arbitrary mRNA in our bodies sure seems like a game changer—it allows us to essentially program our cells to make whatever proteins we want. In the case of the COVID vaccines, the vaccine payload instructs our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein, which our immune system then learns to attack. Bert Hubert has a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">fascinating write-up</a> of the “code” in the vaccine.</p><p>Bringing a brand new vaccine to market in less than a year—using a never-before-applied-in-humans-at-scale technology no less—is a world record, but it could have been even faster. As David Wallace-Wells <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">emphasizes</a>, Moderna’s vaccine was designed by January 13. We had it the whole time. Some delay was necessary to determine effective dosing. Some further regulatory delay may have been warranted to ensure the vaccine was safe and to ascertain its efficacy. But as Wallace-Wells indicates, the regulatory outcome was never really in doubt. “None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome,” he writes. “All said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along.”</p><p>What should we make of the fact that all of the scientists knew all along that Moderna’s vaccine would work? The question in my mind is: what other mRNA treatments do we have the whole time? What if I told you Moderna has an <a href="https://www.poz.com/article/experimental-hiv-vaccine-stimulates-production-neutralizing-antibodies">HIV vaccine candidate</a>? HIV lacks SARS-CoV-2’s telltale spike protein and thus may prove a more challenging foe—but don’t you wonder, if we treated the problem with real urgency, whether new mRNA technology could wipe out the AIDS epidemic this decade? I do.</p><p>And mRNA technology can be deployed against more than just viruses. Both Moderna and BioNTech have personalized vaccine candidates targeting cancer. Although called a “cancer vaccine,” the treatment is only administered once the subject has cancer—it isn’t preventative. The companies use an algorithm to analyze the genetic sequences of the tumor and the patient’s healthy cells and predict which molecules could be used to generate a strong immune response against the cancer. “I was actually witnessing the cancer cells shrinking before my eyes,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03072-8">said</a> Brad Kremer, a melanoma patient who received the BioNTech treatment. So let’s milk mRNA technology for all it’s worth this decade. It can save us from more than just a pandemic.</p><p>What about CRISPR? It is a great example of a technology that has not yet made a meaningful economic contribution. Although the technique for editing DNA was discovered in 2012—and a Nobel Prize was awarded to its two discoverers this year—no treatment using CRISPR has been approved outside of clinical trials. So far, its impact has been limited to making researchers more productive—not a bad thing, to be sure, but not close to CRISPR’s full potential. As trials progress, however, I do think some CRISPR treatments will come online in the next few years, especially those targeting genetic disorders that we have very limited means of otherwise treating.</p><p>DeepMind’s <a href="https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/deepminds-protein-folding-solution-what-just-happened-279d32e8d0f">protein-folding breakthrough</a> signals a promising decade for the science of proteomics. Most directly, being able to predict protein shapes will enable us to discover drugs more rapidly. Buuuut, because drug trials take many years, we might expect this technology not to really be felt by the general public until the 2030s.</p><p>What DeepMind’s achievement indicates to me the most is that machine learning is actually useful. This might seem obvious, but consider: most applications of machine learning so far—excluding autonomous vehicles, which have themselves not really arrived yet—are toys. I love watching AlphaZero crush Stockfish on YouTube, but chess is literally a game. GPT-3 produced some fun demos. AlphaFold heralds something different—non-toy superhuman performance is now here, and I am interested to see what else it can do. Aside from the aforementioned AVs, I expect it to be applied widely in other areas of biology. Again, it will take a long time for the breakthroughs to trickle down into products, but at least the 2030s should be sick. I mean, not sick. Healthy.</p><p>Let’s talk about life extension, one of my favorite biotech topics. 2020 was a big year for the Conboy Lab at Berkeley, which proved that all the weird past findings about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabiosis">young blood</a>” extending life were not actually due to any elixir in the blood of children (thank goodness). Rather, the rejuvenating aspects of young blood experiments were due to the dilution of harmful factors in old blood. By mechanically removing plasma and replacing it with saline and enough albumin to replace what was taken out, they diluted aged blood factors in both mice and humans and were able to <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/103418/text#fulltext">rejuvenate germ layer tissues</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-020-00297-8">improve cognition by reducing neuroinflammation</a>.</p><p>These findings are exciting not only because they represent a scientific advance in understanding aging, but also because they herald the first real anti-aging product that could come to market. Therapeutic plasma exchange is FDA-approved (not for aging, but for a bunch of other conditions). I imagine there remain prohibitions on advertising that it can add years to your life, but it is safe, and a doctor can prescribe it off label. It’s also cheap. An automated plasmapheresis machine—which lets you do treatment after treatment—can be bought online for under $3,000. That is less than the cost of a single transfusion of young blood sold by the startup <a href="https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com/">Ambrosia</a>. How long until someone opens a clinic offering plasma dilution? I bet someone tries it in 2021. If it works, people will get over the weirdness, and it could be commonplace by 2030.</p><p>Another longevity product that is about to get hot: aging clocks based on DNA methylation or proteomics. Do you want to know how biologically old you are? Today, for a few hundred dollars, you can get a test that will tell you. As these tests become better and cheaper, self-experimenters are going to have a field day. Doing before-and-after aging tests, anyone who can get their hands on human growth hormone could replicate the protocol used by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028">Fahy et al.</a> to rejuvenate the thymus. As the thymus is a critical element of the immune system, decline of which is a critical factor in aging, this is non-trivial rejuvenation. The Fahy study found that 12 months of treatment created about 2.5 years of epigenetic rejuvenation, with results accelerating in the last quarter of the trial.</p><p>There is a lot more in the <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a>—dozens of possible life-extending treatments are at various stages of development. There’s a good chance a few senolytic drugs will be approved by the end of the decade. As I noted <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/30/anti-aging-research-health-care-spending-biden/">yesterday at Fortune</a>, we spend less than 1% of the NIH budget on aging biology—we should raise that by a lot.</p><p>Unlike others, I am not-so-bullish on metformin. It does seem to reduce all-cause mortality in Americans, but it may do so because <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105">88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy</a>. If you are one of the 12%, and you should strive to be, I don’t think metformin will do much for you.</p><p>One final biotech observation: every year, the Apple Watch gets a new health-related sensor. This year it was blood oxygen, pretty good for detecting if you might have COVID! Fast forward to 2030 and wearables will have at least 10 more health-related sensors than they do today. Some no-brainers are body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose sensors. What will the other 7 be? At some point, it becomes possible to replace a lot of primary care with continuous monitoring. A few smart algorithms to provide simple medical advice could improve population-level health without much cost. More data could also yield faster, more accurate, and of course more remote diagnoses when you do have to see a doctor.</p><p>There is a lot in biotech that is promising right now, but in more than any other field, it is important not to be seduced by the sexy headlines showing rapid scientific progress. Don’t get complacent. Biology is proceeding faster than medical productivity because a lot of the wonderful discoveries are not being translated into approved treatments and products at a decent rate. Let’s salute and cheer for the discoveries, but spare many thoughts for the entrepreneurs trying to bring treatments to market.</p><h2 id="energy">Energy</h2><p>The 2010s were the …</p></article></div>

		My stack requires no maintenance, has perfect Lighthouse scores, will never have any security vulnerability, is based on open standards, is portable, has an instant dev loop, has no build step and… will outlive any other stack.
		</p>
		<p>
		It’s not LAMP, Wordpress, Rails, MEAN, Jamstack... I don’t do CSR (Client-side rendering), SSR (Server Side Rendering), SSG (Static Site Generation)...
		</p>
		<p>
		My stack is <b>HTML+CSS</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
		And because my sources are in git, pushed to GitHub, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is my host.
		</p>
		<p>
		Of course, I’m being a bit provocative here. I should rather say that, for some specific use cases, I concluded that to get top performances and to guatantee long term support, HTML+CSS was the best choice, instead on relying on technologies currently more popular. Because I’m done rewriting my site every couple of years.
		</p>

		<h3>Why HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		It all started with <a href="https://labs.steren.fr/">a blog</a>, that I was hosting on Wordpress.com (which is "Wordpress-as-a-Service", because the last thing I want to do is administer a Wordpress installation on my own server). I <strong>paid</strong> Wordpress.com to do one job: host my blog. And one day I looked at its sources and Lighthouse scores:
		</p>
		<figure>

			<figcaption>Sources of my Wordpress.com blog, what is all this?</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<figure>
			<img src="https://blog.steren.fr/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/wordpress-lighthouse.png" alt="Lighthouse scores of my Wordpress.com blog, showing 19/100 for Performance">
			<figcaption>Lighthouse score of my blog hosted on Wordpress.com</figcaption>
		</figure>
		<p>
		What have we done?
		</p>
		<p>
		Sure, these are the problems of one specific blogging platform. I’m pretty sure others are better, at least in terms of performance. But isn’t there something fundamentally wrong if displaying a short text with images takes seconds, loads countless render-blocking scripts, and has unreadable sources?
		</p>
		<p>
		My requirements were:
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>performance</li>
			<li>simplicity</li>
			<li>long long term support</li>
		</ol>
		<p>
		It was time to say goodbye to Wordpress. I didn’t need 99% of its features anyway. Other blogging platforms didn’t meet expectations either (I seriously have no idea why so many people publish on Medium… behind a login wall). I looked at static site generators like Jekyll, Hugo, 11ty, but all of these require tooling installed, have a build step and will ultimately need some updates or be abandonned by their maintainer. What if we also get rid of these?
		</p>
		<p>
		The best tool is no tool, the best build step is no build step, the best update is no update. HTML gives us all that, and more.
		</p>

		</figure>

		<h3>What is the HTML+CSS stack good for?</h3>
		<p>
		Let’s first differentiate between what I call a web <em>page</em> and a web <em>app</em>: The goal of a web <em>page</em> is to serve content, on the other hand, the goal of a web <em>app</em> is to enable the user to perform interactive tasks. Of course, there are in-betweens, often in the form of content that might need customization depending on the logged in user and content that might allow some interactions.
		</p>
		<p>
		HTML+CSS fits the web <em>page</em> use case. Wow, what a revelation! It might seem obvious, but it seems we’ve all forgotten this these days. HTML+CSS does not fit the web <em>app </em>use case, or any in between.
		</p>
		<p>
		We said a web <em>page</em> serves content, but let’s dive into more concrete use cases:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Product / Company / Business landing page and marketing sites</li>
			<li>Personal portfolio / bio</li>
			<li>Blog</li>
			<li>Documentation</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>How to develop for HTML+CSS?</h3>
		<p>
		Authoring a pure HTML+CSS site can be done in any text editor, in any environment (any desktop OS, any smartphone, or even directly using GitHub’s single file editor) and previewed by simply opening the file in any browser.
		</p>
		<p>
		Keep the HTML of every page minimal and semantic. First, because there is no need for countless of &lt;div&gt;, but then because it makes sources more readable and easier to edit. See for example the <a href="https://github.com/steren/blog/blob/master/2020/my-stack-will-outlive-yours/index.html">HTML sources of this page</a>: a total of 150 lines, 100 lines are for the content, the rest is metadata and page structure, nothing extra. 
		</p>
		<p>
		For consistency, all pages that need to share the same style can point to the same CSS file. This avoids  duplication when it comes to styling (but note that loading this file creates an extra HTTP request, which could be avoided if style was inlined).
		</p>
		<p>
		When not cluttered with unnecessary scripts, divs or classes, I have no issue writing HTML directly. Yes, the paragraph tags are a bit annoying and distracting, but proper indentation and syntax highlighting mitigate this.
		<br>
		Sometimes, for drafting long blog articles, I’m working in Google Docs, and when I’m happy, export the content to clean HTML using an add-on. Google Docs is awesome for collaboration, with powerful suggestions and commenting system. That’s ideal for the “draft” phase. 
		<br>
		Because all content is in git, final review and approval can be done via GitHub pull requests.
		</p>
		<p>
		When I publish a new page, I need to link to it manually from the index page. I’m OK with that. It’s done in one line. It also allows me to have more control over when I want the page to be “published”.
		</p>
		<p>
		I don't need to pay for custom themes, I have complete freedom in the style and layout of my site.
		I can embed anything I want without being restricted by the choice of the hosting platform: SVG images, 3D models, interactive JS experiences. 
		</p>
		<p>
		Creating a new page requires to clone an existing one.
		So... if I don’t use any templating system, how do I update my header, footer or nav? Well, simply by using the ”Replace in files” feature of any good text editor. They don’t need frequent updates anyway. The benefits of using a templating system is not worth the cost of introducing the tooling it requires.
		</p>
		
		<h3>In conclusion</h3>
		<p>
		You don’t need  Wordpress, or Hugo to put a blog online, or Angular, React or Next.js to put a web page online. Raw HTML and CSS do the job.
		</p>
		<p>
		That being said, you’ll need to pick up some tooling or framework if you want to build a web app or add more interactivity or customization to your web pages. And for that, I’m very glad to see that frameworks now seem to be prioritizing performance, notably by prioritizing serving the content first and leveraging caching whenever possible. The era of “download 5MB of JS first and then download content from athe REST API” seems to be over for content web pages. (I personally think it’s still OK to do so for web apps, as the user’s intent and expectations are different).
		</p>
		<p>
		Is the “HTML+CSS only” approach a bit extreme? A bit, it’s basically saying “all software is terrible, how can I minimize my dependencies on software”. Web standards are a model of backward compatibility. I’m pretty confident that my web pages written in raw HTML+CSS will have no issue being accessed and authored 10 years from now, without me having to do anything.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remote work is on the rise, the economy is on a decline and businesses are re-structuring themselves around what many consider the new normal. Increasingly more organisations are opening themselves up to the possibility of working remotely beyond just the temporary measure in the fight against COVID-19. Many begin to see remote work as not only a necessary consequence, but rather as a new opportunity to diversify their workforce, increase employee productivity and cut some cost. The biggest cost saving obviously comes from office space, and not just in terms of raw square footage but also in location. When previously companies had to boast huge HQs in expensive areas, now they can spread themselves thinner across more affordable cities. Another big cost saving can come from employee salaries. A more distributed workforce and more work from home opportunities will inevitably mean a bigger talent pool competing for the same open positions, effectively giving employers a bigger choice.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to existing employees' salaries the direction taken by big tech companies couldn't be of starker contrast. Companies like <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/21/zuckerberg-50percent-of-facebook-employees-could-be-working-remotely.html">Facebook or Twitter</a> have made it clear that employees who choose to relocate to more affordable cities can expect big cuts to their existing salary whereas companies like <a href="https://redditblog.com/2020/10/27/evolving-reddits-workforce/">Reddit announced that they won't reduce the salary of any of their 600 US workers</a> regardless of where they live.</p>
<p>These recent announcements have revived a <a href="https://www.helpscout.com/blog/remote-employee-compensation/">long standing debate</a> around the topic of <a href="https://www.nityesh.com/equal-pay-for-equal-work-at-a-remote-company/">equal pay for equal work</a>. Before COVID-19 <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/02/28/why-we-pay-local-rates/">GitLab has already sparked a lot of controversy</a> around the concept of "cost of living" adjusted salaries. At GitLab two engineers who perform the exact same work could get vastly differently compensated based on where they live. It doesn't require a lot of imagination to understand that such policies can alienate a lot of good people and further contribute to the perception of an ever growing inequality gap. Personally I find cost of living adjusted salaries very problematic as they deflect from the real market forces which come into play. Those should be a decent minimum living wage and the forces of demand &amp; supply. If someone is a professional in a niche market, a rare specialist in a scientific field or an exceptionally sought after engineer then cost of living should have no say in determining their pay. Those so called knowledge workers are often higher in demand than there is supply. A good indicator for the scarcity of one's profession is when their employer recruits talent from all across the world and advertises unique perks such as relocation bonuses, dental care or exceptional holiday packages. These benefits would not exist if there wasn't a fierce competition for a particular skill.</p>
<p>Regardless of the real economics at play, it still comes down to a good old negotiation where each person has to stand up for their own beliefs and reach an agreement on their pay. If you find yourself in a situation where your current salary might be at risk due to recent relocation then hopefully the following write-up can help you to negotiate equal pay for equal work. It is a curated list of relevant points to formulate a strong argument why one should receive the same or perhaps an even better pay for the same work carried out from a remote position.</p>
<h2 id="same-duties-same-pay">Same duties, same pay</h2>
<p>If you're reading this blog post then you're most likely not being paid for your time or place of work. You are being paid for your knowledge, your skills, your duties, the challenges which come with your work and most importantly the responsibilities of your role. Your professionalism and your personal commitment which you bring to your every day job will not diminish when you move into a new place. Whether you work remotely or not, you will still contemplate over that tough work problem in your spare time. You will still lose sleep over that big presentation the next day. You will still stay up late to meet an important deadline by the end of the month. You do it because you take pride in your work. You do it because of a sense of personal accountability to your team. It is those qualities which have earned you the trust of your manager over the years. It is those qualities which earned you a pay rise long ago. Changing postcodes doesn't take away your accomplishments from the past. Changing postcodes shouldn't take away the things which you have already earned before.</p>
<h2 id="same-value-same-pay">Same value, same pay</h2>
<p>The value of your contributions hasn't been compromised by moving house. Customers still pay the same price for the products which you have helped to build. Sales figures didn't drop when you went remote. Why should your employer reduce your pay when they are not passing that cost saving onto their customers by cutting their own price? Based on the same principle why your employer won't reduce their prices when downsizing office, you also shouldn't accept a lower salary after moving place. The concept is the same and you shouldn't accept one principle for them, but another for yourself. As you continue to deliver the same value and quality as before, you equally deserve the same compensation in return.</p>
<h2 id="your-savings-their-savings">Your savings, their savings</h2>
<p>Let's be clear, when you transitioned from office to home it's not like you're the only one who benefited from a lower cost of living as a result. Whatever savings you might have made on your rent, your employer does now too. Every person in an office requires an extra desk. Every additional person requires a fraction more of bathroom space. More people mean bigger kitchens, bigger break out areas, more meeting rooms, larger hallways, bigger stairways and more facilities to comply with fire safety regulations. There is more pressure on lifts to avoid bottle necks during peak times. There is more building maintenance work to be done and more frequent cleaning intervals required. A bigger workforce automatically means more individual needs. Extra bicycle storage rooms, canteens, car parks, private offices, outdoor spaces, a bigger selection of refreshments and a larger variety of office perks are just a few to name. Unless your employer is prepared to share their own operational saving directly with you, why should you share your personal operational saving with them? Fundamentally their savings are theirs, and your savings are yours.</p>
<h2 id="their-profit-your-profit">Their profit, your profit</h2>
<p>Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer re-structured themselves to benefit from lower tax? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer opened up a new factory in a less regulated place? Have you ever received a pay rise when your employer outsourced a call centre into a country without minimum wage? Probably not, because it was your employer and not you who took the risk. Guess what, when you are courageous enough to relocate to a different country, city or state, then any financial gains from your move are also only yours to claim. This shouldn't be a huge surprise as nothing comes without its own significant risk. Economic security, social safety nets, unemployment benefits, retirement support, access to public health services, cost of qualitative education or medical treatment are often some of the compromises which have to be taken into account. Simple things such as free playgrounds for children, access to public recreational grounds, well maintained parks, a good public transport system funded by tax or basic luxuries such as political stability or the ability to safely park a new car on a public road are many other cost calculations not to be dismissed. Of course this is not always the case, but those considerations are for you to make. Nobody else, particularly not your employer, who has a financial interest of dismissing or downplaying those issues should be making those calculations on your behalf. This is such a basic principle that it's almost offensive to suggest the opposite. Your employer should not decide what sort of lifestyle you deserve.</p>
<h2 id="higher-cost-higher-pay">Higher cost, higher pay</h2>
<p>Contrary to common belief, working from home is not cheap. First of all, working permanently from home requires an entire additional room. If your family lived in a three bedroom house before, now you need four.
Thanks to COVID-19 most will agree that working from a sofa is neither practical, nor sustainable or realistic by any means. A proper office desk and a good ergonomic chair are a necessity at the least. Those requirements alone make a legitimate home office significantly more expensive than many would like to admit. Throw in a couple of monitors, a qualitative web cam, microphone, printer, shredder, peripheral devices, a whiteboard, noise cancelling headphones, a mesh router and a backup laptop (assuming you'll get a work laptop provided) then the true cost of a home office begins to reach eye watering levels.</p>
<p>Some employers will try to provide you those supplies, but any seasoned remote worker will tell you to decline such an offer. After all you're still equipping your own personal home. You shouldn't have to pick from a selection of office desks which don't match your walls. You shouldn't have to settle on a chair which doesn't appeal to your eye. You shouldn't have to accept a black bezelled screen when all your other equipment is in space grey. Most importantly though, you want to treat those things as your own. You don't want to change your monitors when you change your job. You don't want to have to go through your employer to make a warranty claim. You don't want to ask for permission to replace a worn out chair. Instead you want to get a pay rise which allows you to set up your home office in the most productive way. If your employer is smart enough then they will not want to manage all of that inventory (which they never get to see) either.</p>
<p>Speaking of inventory, the true cost of working from home does not stop there yet. When working remotely nothing disrupts productivity more than a low bandwidth internet connection. One cannot …</p></div></div>

<p>The end of a year is the perfect time to review one’s life, goals, plans, and projects, as well as plan for the upcoming year. I’ve been fine-tuning my own review process for several years and thought others might be interested to know what I do and how.</p>
<p>So, I wrote up my general year review process in a short PDF guide titled “8,760 Hours”—a reference to the number of hours in a year. This is essentially the review process I use, minus a few details like <a href="http://alexvermeer.com/my-inbox-zero-system/">clearing out my inbox</a>.</p>
<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<p>The guide has six sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Introduction.</strong> Why plan at all? To get more out of life, to take responsibility for your time.</li>
<li><strong>Tools.</strong> All you really need is pen, paper, and some time. There’s also a very quick introduction to mind mapping and mind mapping software. I then present my fourteen life categories that I use for breaking down my life into its constituent parts and analyzing them.</li>
<li><strong>A snapshot of the past year.</strong> Using the fourteen categories, how are things going? What went well or poorly in the past year? What is the status of your goals and projects?</li>
<li><strong>The next 8,760 hours.</strong> First off, what is your “ideal you”? What do you want each area of your life to look like in an ideal world? Which areas need the most work? What are your major projects or goals to focus on in the upcoming year? Set some priorities.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize for success.</strong> Setting goals is necessary but not sufficient. Using what’s known about <a href="http://alexvermeer.com/getmotivated/">procrastination and motivation</a> we can optimize our chances of success. If you address uncertainties before they creep up, you’ll be better prepared for them. If you schedule regular reviews you’re more likely to stay on track.&nbsp;Squeeze it all into a one-page calendar to keep yourself motivated and remember the big picture.</li>
<li><strong>Additional Resources.</strong> A small collection of additional resources to help you implement the rest of the guide and for further reading.</li>

<p>A novel SARS-CoV-2 variant, VOC 202012/01, emerged in southeast England in November 2020 and appears to be rapidly spreading towards fixation. We fitted a two-strain mathematical model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission to observed COVID-19 hospital admissions, hospital and ICU bed occupancy, and deaths; SARS-CoV-2 PCR prevalence and seroprevalence; and the relative frequency of VOC 202012/01 in the three most heavily affected NHS England regions (South East, East of England, and London). We estimate that VOC 202012/01 is 56% more transmissible (95% credible interval across three regions 50-74%) than preexisting variants of SARS-CoV-2. We were unable to find clear evidence that VOC 202012/01 results in greater or lesser severity of disease than preexisting variants. Nevertheless, the increase in transmissibility is likely to lead to a large increase in incidence, with COVID-19 hospitalisations and deaths projected to reach higher levels in 2021 than were observed in 2020, even if regional tiered restrictions implemented before 19 December are maintained. Our estimates suggest that control measures of a similar stringency to the national lockdown implemented in England in November 2020 are unlikely to reduce the effective reproduction number Rt to less than 1, unless primary schools, secondary schools, and universities are also closed. We project that large resurgences of the virus are likely to occur following easing of control measures. It may be necessary to greatly accelerate vaccine roll-out to have an appreciable impact in suppressing the resulting disease burden.</p>

January 3, 2021 | https://www.vincentdelft.be/post/post_20210102 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.vincentdelft.be/post/post_20210102">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I'll list some of my tips and tricks around OpenBSD. <br>
I'm using OpenBSD as daily machine since +10 years now and I'm still amazed how simple and powerful this system is. </p>
<p>So most of the elements listed here under will match <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ksh">KSH</a> on OpenBSD. I'm using Openbox as window manager, xterm as terminal and neovim as editor. </p>
<p>If you want to re-use some of those ideas, you will have to adapt it to your own config. </p>

<p>On OpenBSD folder's organization is :</p>
<pre><code>- Base applications in /
- Packages in /usr/local
</code></pre>
<p>So I push all my own application is ~/.local</p>
<p>So, one of my first line in ~/.profile is the following</p>
<pre><code>PATH=$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH
</code></pre>
<p>An other important element for Windows Manager and xdg's tool (pkg_add xdg-utils)  is to find .desktop files in :</p>
<pre><code>~/.local/share/applications
</code></pre>

<p>I often have lot of xterm windows open. Generally they are split between the Openbox virtual desktops depending on the scope/activity. </p>
<p>But even that, I have lot of windows. So, I like to change their window title, in order to retrieve them more easily when doing a Alt-TAB or by checking the task bar. </p>
<p>To modify the window's title of xterm, here after a simple command I've added in my .profile:</p>
<pre><code>set_title()
{
    echo -n "\033]0;$1\007"
}
</code></pre>
<p>When you want to change the window's title, you just have to type in the window where you want a new title:</p>
<pre><code>set_title "dev branch xxx"
</code></pre>

<p>To avoid the monochrome of xterm, I'm using colorls (pkg_add colorls). </p>
<p>Then in .profile, I put:</p>
<pre><code>export LSCOLORS=gxfxcxdxbxegedabagacad
alias ls='colorls -GF'
</code></pre>
<p>The first line defines the color to use in the different situation. With colorls we have 11 different situations (directory, link, socket, pipe, exe, ...). For each of those 11, you must provide the foreground color and the background color. <br>
The second line is just to over-write the standard /bin/ls command. The -G is to use the defined colors, with -F colorls adds some visual characters to differentiate folders, executable, ... </p>

<p>As daily machine, I have a laptops, which travel a lot. So I need to know the exact state of the battery. This information is displayed on my status bar. But I do not look it so frequently. So, I prefer to have this information in my preferred shell. </p>
<p>I'm using the following script from my .profile file:</p>
<pre><code>battery()
{
    local bat=""
    local level=""
    local charg=""
    bat=$(apm -b 2&gt;/dev/null)
    if [ -n "$bat" -a "$bat" -lt "4" ]; then
        level=$(apm -l 2&gt;/dev/null)
        charg=$(apm -a 2&gt;/dev/null)
        if [ -n "$charg" -a "$charg" -eq "1" ]; then
            #charging
            print -- "\033[01;32m$level%\033[00m"
        else
            if [ "$level" -lt "20" ]; then
                #print red
                print -- "\033[01;31m$level%\033[00m"
            else 
                #print blue
                print -- "\033[01;34m$level%\033[00m"
            fi
        fi
    else
        #no battery
        print -- ""
    fi
}
</code></pre>
<p>It does report the battery status, if there is one, with 3 colors: green when the power cable is connected, blue when the battery is in good state, red when the battery is bellow 20%. </p>
<p>To have such information directly in my shell, I'm using it in PS1:</p>
<pre><code>export PS1='$(battery)\h:\w\$ '
</code></pre>
<p>By doing this, battery's usage is refreshed each time I press "enter". </p>
<p>The other parameters of PS1 does not provide colors, they display hostname "\h", folder "\w" and default prompt "\$". </p>
<p>Here after a print screen with colorls showing different type of files. Note that I've changed the window's title ;-)</p>
<p><img src="https://www.vincentdelft.be/static/post/post_20210102/color.png"></p>

<p>It's frustrating to type keywords completely, so I'm a big fan of the completion feature of KSH. </p>
<p>It's really easy to configure: just create an array with the elements you have to select. Then you just have to type TAB to have the relevant choice displayed in front of you. </p>
<p>I group them by command. </p>
<pre><code># ssh, scp
set -A SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS ~/.ssh/known_hosts
if [ -f /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts ]; then
 SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS="${SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS[@]} /etc/ssh/ssh_known_hosts"
fi
HOST_LIST=$(awk '{split($1,a,","); gsub("].*", "", a[1]); gsub("\[", "", a[1]); print a[1] " root@" a[1]}' $SSH_KNOWN_HOSTS | sort | uniq)
set -A complete_ssh -- $HOST_LIST
set -A complete_scp -- $HOST_LIST

set -A complete_ifconfig_1 -- $(ifconfig | grep ^[a-z] | cut -d: -f1)

set -A complete_signify_1 -- -C -G -S -V
set -A complete_signify_2 -- -q -p -x -c -m -t -z
set -A complete_signify_3 -- -p -x -c -m -t -z

set -A complete_sndioctl_1 -- $(sndioctl | cut -d= -f 1)

set -A complete_chown_1 -- $(users)

alias drcctl="doas rcctl"
set -A complete_drcctl_1 -- get getdef set check reload restart stop start disable enable order ls
set -A complete_drcctl_2 -- $(/bin/ls /etc/rc.d)
</code></pre>
<p>The first lines allow me to list all known hosts from known_hosts files. </p>
<p>The next group display possible interfaces on my machine for the <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/ifconfig">ifconfig</a> command. </p>
<p>The next group is to simplify the usage of signify, per type of command. </p>
<p>For sndioctl it display the possible parameters we can change. </p>
<p>for chwon's command, completion display the known users on my machine. </p>
<p>The last group of command concerns <a href="http://man.openbsd.org/rcctl">rcctl</a>. Since I'm never using "root", I've created a drcctl command in order to have the usual commands as 1st parameter, then the list of possible daemon available on my machine. </p>
<p>With such completion, I'm no more forced to type the full list of parameters. </p>
<p>For example, if I type:</p>
<pre><code>ifc "TAB" i "TAB" scan, I will execute the command
ifconfig iwm0 scan

drc "TAB" sta "TAB" pos "TAB", will become
doas rcctl start postgresql
</code></pre>

<p>Very simple tricks with facilitate the usage of a system like OpenBSD and KSH</p>
<p>In the same "laziness" I'm also a big fan if <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>. I'll describe how I'm using is in a next blog's post. </p>

<p>Today lets have a look what are the pros and cons of using a static site generator versus building a site with <a href="https://sschoebinger.github.io/posts/2020-12-24-pure-html-css">plain HTML and CSS</a>. As written in my previous blog post I wanted to try a static site generator due to the limitations of the plain HTML and CSS approach. I tried <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">11ty</a> due to its simplicity and because I'm familiar with the nodejs ecosystem.</p>
<p>The migration of my (simple) site from single page HTML to a static site (generated by 11ty) took me about 2h. I used the following <a href="https://www.filamentgroup.com/lab/build-a-blog/">tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>The 11ty structure of my site looks like this:</p>
<img src="https://sschoebinger.github.io/img/2021-01-02-structure.png" alt="structure of my site with 11ty" loading="lazy">

<p>I write my blog posts in markdown and put each blog post into one separate file.
Due to the fact that the final website need to be generated I was forces to add a build step. With github pages you can specify a branch that contains the content that should be published (previously that was the <em>main</em> branch, now I created a <em>gh-pages</em> branch for that). To avoid the manual effort of generating the website and copying it to the <em>gh-pages</em> branch, I used <a href="https://travis-ci.com/">travis-ci</a> to do that. If I push a change to the <em>main</em> branch of my repository, travis-ci will generate the website with 11ty and push the result to the <em>gh-pages</em> branch of my repository which will then be published with github pages. See <a href="https://github.com/sschoebinger/sschoebinger.github.io">that repo</a> for all details.</p>
<p>And yes, this is the cost that comes with the usage of a static site generator - <strong>the build step</strong>.</p>
<h2>The pros of building your site with plain HTML and CSS:</h2>
<p><strong>You learn and train the basics</strong></p>
<p>As there is no framework you have to do each and every detail on your own (style, navigation, content structuring, ...).
You, the maintainer of your site, knows how your site is build and you can change everything you want. Put content on your site on a regular basis and you will be familiar with changing HTML and CSS files by hand at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Deployment is as easy as possible</strong></p>
<p>As there is no build step you can deploy all the files from your project right to your webserver.
With <a href="https://pages.github.com/">github pages</a> that is zero effort, the only thing you have to do is activate it in your github repo.</p>
<p><strong>No dependency updates</strong></p>
<p>There is no dependency, there is no need for updates, there is no risk of breaking builds.</p>
<h2>The cons of building your site with plain HTML and CSS:</h2>
<p><strong>Content structuring</strong></p>
<p>If you want to structure your code in more than one file you need a templating mechanism or you have to copy the same HTML skeleton into each file.
Now if you want to change your layout you have to change it in each file which is error-prone.</p>
<p><strong>No support for other formats</strong></p>
<p>Writing blog posts in markdown is very comfortable, but of course there is no support for markdown or other formats if you only use plain HTML and CSS.</p>
<h2>The pros of building your site with a static site generator:</h2>
<p><strong>Content structuring</strong></p>
<p>As you can use templates, it is easy to structure your content. At build time you can do whatever you want. For example you can loop over all your blog posts and build a list of it (or only the previous 3 posts below each blog post).</p>
<p><strong>Templates</strong></p>
<p>You can clone a template (from someone else) and only change the configuration and the content to make it yours. You don't need deep knowledge of HTML and CSS.</p>
<h2>The cons of building your site with a static site generator:</h2>
<p><strong>You need a build step</strong></p>
<p>Deployment of your site gets a bit more complicated as you need a build step. If you automate it, the effort is reduced but there is the risk that due to incompatible dependencies the build will break and you have to fix it.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>From my point of view the advanced content structuring and support of markdown for writing my content is absolutely worth the cost of having a build step required to deploy my website. I'll go with the static site generator setup!</p>
<p>I'm curious to see how often my build will break, I set everything to lts tags/versions 🤞.</p>

January 3, 2021 | https://xania.org/202101/cpp-by-value-args | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://xania.org/202101/cpp-by-value-args">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <div>
        

        <p>I was recently responding to some <a href="https://github.com/mattgodbolt/xania/pull/252#discussion_r550894493">code review feedback</a>
 and it occurred to me I could write it up for this blog. Which also means I start 2021 with a blog post, not something
 I’ve done in ages.</p>
<p>The question was around why I passed an non-trivial object by value to a function. The recipient function was
 going to copy the object, and the short version is “clang tidy complains if you don’t pass by value and move”.</p>
<p>For the longer version, consider this super simple example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><code><span>#include</span> <span>&lt;string&gt;</span><span></span>

<span>struct</span> <span>Thing</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>std</span><span>:</span><span>string</span> <span>s_</span><span>;</span>
  <span>void</span> <span>set_s</span><span>(</span><span>std</span><span>::</span><span>string</span> <span>s</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span> <span>s_</span> <span>=</span> <span>std</span><span>::</span><span>move</span><span>(</span><span>s</span><span>);</span> <span>}</span>
<span>};</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Now consider what happens when we do something like <code>set_s("moo");</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>const char*</code> gets converted into a temporary <code>string</code> via the <code>string</code> constructor that takes a <code>const char*</code>.
  That does allocations<sup id="fnref:sso"><a href="#fn:sso">1</a></sup> etc and copies the <code>"moo"</code> into the new temporary <code>string</code> object.</li>
<li>That temporary is used to construct the parameter value <code>s</code> in the <code>set_s</code>. 
  The argument to the constructor of this <code>s</code> is a temporary – so it’s of type <code>string &amp;&amp;</code>. 
  The <code>string&amp;&amp;</code> constructor can “steal” the contents of the temporary string&amp;&amp; which makes it super cheap (no allocations, just swapping pointers).</li>
<li>The <code>s_ = std::move()</code> runs. The <code>s_</code>‘s <code>operator=(string &amp;&amp;)</code> is called (as the move turns the <code>string</code> into an r-value). This also does the steal-the-innards trick.</li>
<li>All the destructors for the temporaries run – the original <code>"moo"</code> temporary object and the pass-by-copy param <code>s</code>. They have no work to do as they’ve been “stolen” from.</li>
</ul>
<p>Short version: exactly one “real” string construction is done, and then there’s a bit of pointer movement, but nothing more expensive.</p>
<p>If, however, we change the parameter to a <code>const string &amp;</code> in <code>set_s</code>, and remove the <code>move</code> in <code>set_s()</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <code>const char *</code> gets converted into a temporary string as before.</li>
<li>It is passed by reference (very cheaply) to <code>set_s()</code> - no work done here at all.</li>
<li>In the <code>s_ = s;</code> we copy the <code>string</code> object. This is another allocation and copy, as we can’t “steal” anything from anyone.</li>
<li>We then destroy the temporary <code>string</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means we do the allocation twice, copy the string data twice, and do a deallocation once. This is more expensive!</p>
<p>You can see in <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/xr1bno">Compiler Explorer</a> that the <code>string::_M_create</code> method is called twice in
the second case, whereas for this small string it’s all inlined in the first case.</p>

<p>As you may know, back in 2007 I ressurected the development of <a href="http://grafx2.googlecode.com/">GrafX2</a>.
this old pixelart program, made only for DOS, was left out 6 years earlier by the authors, that had moved on to more modern computers.
Today, graFX2 is amongst the best tool for pixelling, particularly on Linux or other alternative operating systems.
Many people are using it daily to draw really nice pictures. The newer versions added a lot of features such as layers, and there's more to come.</p>

<p>This was possible only because the authors decided to release the source when the project stopped. The code wasn't perfectly clean; it was tied to ms-dos
with some optimized parts written directly in assembly language and accessing the video card hardware directly. Of course, getting an SDL-based version out of it
was not easy. But still, it took considerably less time than rewriting everything from scratch. Also, part of the userbase for the old GrafX2 upgraded to
the new one. For some of them it felt like getting back home after years of using suboptimal tools.</p>

<p>During the revival of GrafX2, I had to develop my web searching skills a lot. First, the original GrafX2 website was offline, and the sourcecode was
gone with it. Thanks to <a href="http://www.filewatcher.com/">filewatcher</a>, an ftpsearch engine, and <a href="http://www.archive.org/">the web archive</a>,
I was able to locate a copy on some russian FTP. Then, I wanted to get in touch with the authors to let them know their software finally found some use.</p>

<p>But grafX2 isn't the main purpose of this article. Last month, I downloaded APlayer, a music player for BeOS. After some hacking to get it working on Haiku
(which eventually led to uncovering and fixing a compatibility bug), I noticed that most musics from Burned Sounds, my preferred chiptune collection, didn't load.
The strange thing is that most of them were in formats supposed to be recognized by APlayer. But looking closer, it turned out they are packed using the Shrink
algorithm. This is a packing system from Amiga days, which can be unpacked only on amiga for lack of any sourcecode or format information. Well, that was until yesterday.
Using my high web searching skills, I found the author of Shrink and kindly asked him by mail if he was willing to release the sourcecode for hissoftware, the last version being from
1996.</p>

<p>He was a bit surprised to see there was some files using Shrink still around, but he had a linux version of the archiver. This version is now released as GPL sourcecode
at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/ashrink/">sourceforge</a>. This is an important step for me in getting more open source software available ; but also in preserving
old files packed in this format. I hope some other people will find it useful too.</p>

<p>I forgot to mention I also made possible the release of a whole lot of other BeOS software made by Arvid and Jonas Norberg. This include the sawteeth sound synthetizer, as
well as the backslash n demo, and also some other unfinished code.</p>

<p>The overall message is, for developpers : think about opensourcing your old projects. Even if the source is not as clean as it could be ; even if they are of no use for you ;
even if they only work on a dead since 10 years operating system : someone, somewhere, may find it useful. You can visit the <a href="http://www.unmaintained-free-software.org/wiki/Main_Page">
Unamintained Free Software</a> page to get some examples of how passing on a project to someone else may work. But not everything goes through this website.</p>

<p>For non-developpers, don't hesitate to get in touch with the devs, even for unmaintained apps, and ask for an open source release. If the software is dead, the author isn't going to get
anymoney for it, so why not release it so other people can improve it ? This is the fastest way to get more open source software. And don't be shy, developpers are, above all, normal people, and they
do like hearing from users.</p>

        This is an edition of the <a href="https://sirupsen.com/napkin/">Napkin Math newsletter</a>,
        a newsletter about using napkin math and first-principle thinking to
        estimate the performance of systems.
        You can <a href="https://sirupsen.com/napkin">subscribe through email.</a>
    </p>

    <p>A common problem you’ve almost certainly faced is to sync two datastores. This problem comes up in numerous shapes and forms: Receiving webhooks and writing them into your datastore, maintaining a materialized view, making sure a cache reflects reality, ensure documents make it from your source of truth to a search index, or your data from your transactional store to your data lake or column store.</p>
<p><img src="https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/8b99afab-9ae3-47cf-8703-f465aaec1473.png" alt=""></p>
<p>If you’ve built such a system, you’ve almost certainly seen B drift out of sync. Building a completely reliable syncing mechanism is difficult, but perhaps we can build a checksumming mechanism to check if the two datastores are equal in a few seconds?</p>
<p>In this issue of napkin math, we look at implementing a solution to <strong>check whether A and B are in sync for 100M records in a few seconds</strong>. The key idea is to checksum an indexed <code>updated_at</code> column and use a binary search to drill down to the mismatching records. All of this will be explained in great detail, read on!</p>
<h2 id="why-are-syncing-mechanisms-unreliable">Why are syncing mechanisms unreliable?</h2>
<p>If you are firing the events for your syncing mechanism after a transaction occurs, such as enqueuing a job, sending a webhook, or emit a Kafka event, you can’t guarantee that it <em>actually</em> gets sent after the transaction is committed. Almost certainly part of pipeline into database B is leaky due to bugs: perhaps there’s an exception you don’t handle, you drop events on the floor above a certain size, some early return, or deploys lose an event in a rare edge case.</p>
<p>But <em>even</em> if you’re doing something that’s theoretically bullet-proof, like using the database replication logs through <a href="https://debezium.io/">Debezium</a>, there’s still a good chance a bug somewhere in your syncing pipeline is causing you to lose occasional events. If theoretical guarantees were adequate, <a href="https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a> wouldn’t uncover much, would it? A team I worked with even wrote a TLA+ proof, but still found bugs with a solution like the one I describe here! In my experience, a checksumming system should be part of <em>any</em> syncing system.</p>
<p>It would seem to me that building reliable syncing mechanisms would be easier if databases had a standard, fast mechanism to answer the question: <em>“Does database A and B have all the same data? If not, what’s different?"</em> Over time, as you fix your bugs, it will of course happen more rarely, but being able to guarantee that they are in sync is a huge step forward.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this doesn’t exist as a user API in modern databases, but perhaps we can design such a mechanism <em>without</em> modifying the database?</p>
<p>This exploration will be fairly long. If you just want to see the final solution, scroll down to the end. This issue shows how to use napkin math to incrementally justify increasing complexity. While I’ve been thinking about this problem for a while, this is a fairly accurate representation of how I thought about the problem a few months ago when I started working on it. It’s also worth noting that when doing napkin math usually, I don’t write prototypes like this if I’m fairly confident in my understanding of the system underneath. I’m doing it here to make it more entertaining to read!</p>
<h2 id="assumptions">Assumptions</h2>
<p>Let’s start with some assumptions to plan out our ‘syncing checksum process’:</p>
<ul>
<li>100M records</li>
<li>1KiB per record (~100 GiB total)</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ll assume both ends are SQL-flavoured relational databases, but will address other datastores later, e.g. ElasticSearch.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-1-check-in-batches">Iteration 1: Check in Batches</h2>
<p>As usual, we will start by considering the simplest possible solution for checking whether two databases are in sync: a script that iterates through all records in batches to check if they’re the same. It’ll execute the SQL query below in a loop, iterating through the whole collection on both sides and report mismatches:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>`</span><span>table</span><span>`</span>
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> id <span>ASC</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>@</span><span>limit</span> <span>OFFSET</span> <span>@</span><span>offset</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Let’s try to figure out how long this would take: Let’s assume each loop is querying the two databases in parallel and our batches are 10,000 records (10 MiB total) large:</p>
<ul>
<li>In MySQL, reading 10 MiB off SSD at <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">200 us/MiB</a> will take ~2ms. We assume   this to be sequential-ish, <a href="http://yoshinorimatsunobu.blogspot.com/2013/10/making-full-table-scan-10x-faster-in.html">but this is not entirely true</a>.</li>
<li>Serializing and deserializing the MySQL protocol at <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">5 ms/MiB</a>, for a total   of ~2* 50ms = 100ms.</li>
<li>Network transfer at <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">10 ms/MiB</a>, for a total of ~100ms.</li>
</ul>
<p>We’d then expect each batch to take roughly ~200ms.  This would bring our theoretical grand total for this approach to <code>200 ms/batch * (100M / 10_000) batches ~= 30min</code>.</p>
<p>To test our hypothesis against reality, I implemented this to <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math/blob/master/newsletter/14-syncing/check.rb">run locally for the first 100 of the 10,000 batches</a>. In this local implementation, we won’t incur the network transfer overhead (we could’ve done this with <a href="https://github.com/shopify/toxiproxy">Toxiproxy</a>). Without the network overhead, we expect a query time in the 100ms ballpark. Running <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math/blob/master/newsletter/14-syncing/check.rb">the script</a>, I get the following plot:</p>
<p><img src="https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/dfef5830-f658-4268-b655-ec23e64ce90c.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Ugh. The real performance is pretty far from our napkin math lower bound estimate. What’s going on here?</p>
<p>There’s a fundamental problem with our napkin math. Only the <em>very</em> first batch will read only <code>~10 MB</code> off of the SSD in MySQL. <code>OFFSET</code> queries will read through the data <em>before</em> the offset, even if it only returns the data after the offset! Each batch takes 3-5ms more than the last, which lines up well with reading another 10 MiB per batch from the increasing offset.</p>
<p>This is the reason why OFFSET-based pagination causes so much trouble in production systems. If we take the area under the graph here and extend to the 10,000 batches we’d need for our 100M records, we get a <strong>~3 day runtime</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-2-outsmarting-the-optimizer">Iteration 2: Outsmarting the optimizer</h2>
<p>As <code>OFFSET</code> will scan through all these 1 KiB records, what if we scanned an index instead? It’ll be much smaller to skip 100,000s of records on an index where each record only occupies perhaps 64 bit. It’ll still grow linearly with the offset, but passing the previous batch’s 10,000 records is only 10 KiB which would only take a few hundred microseconds to read.</p>
<p>You’d think the optimizer would make this optimization itself, but it doesn’t. So we have to do it ourselves:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>`</span><span>table</span><span>`</span>
<span>WHERE</span> id <span>&gt;</span> (<span>SELECT</span> id <span>FROM</span> <span>table</span> <span>LIMIT</span> <span>1</span> <span>OFFSET</span> <span>@</span><span>offset</span>)
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> id <span>ASC</span> 
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10000</span>;
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/47a71e04-2c3d-48e6-a7de-c2240d1ac26f.png" alt=""></p>
<p>It’s better, but just not by enough. It just delays the inevitable scanning of lots of data to find these limits. If we interpolate how long this’d take for 10,000 batches to process our 100M records, we’re still talking on the <strong>order of 14 hours</strong>. The 128x speedup doesn’t carry through, because it only applies to the MySQL part. Network transfer is still a large portion of the total time!</p>
<p>Either way, if you have some OFFSET queries lying around in your codebase, you might want to consider this optimization.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-3-parallelization">Iteration 3: Parallelization</h2>
<p>This seems like an embarrassingly parallel problem: Can’t we just run 100 batches of 10,000 records in parallel? Can the database support that? Since we can pre-compute <em>all</em> the LIMITs and OFFSETs up front, let’s abuse that?</p>
<p>This seems kind of difficult to do the napkin math on. Typically when that’s the case, I try to solve the problem backwards: Fundamentally, the machine can <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">read sequential SSD at 4 GiB/s</a>, which would be an absolute lower bound for how fast the database can work. The dataset is 100 GiB, as we established in the beginning.</p>
<p>If we’re using our optimization from iteration 2, then our queries are on average processing <code>50M * 64 bit</code> for the sub-query, and the <code>10 MiB</code> of returned data on top. That’s a total of ~400 MiB. So for our 10,000 batches, that’s 4.2 TB of data we will need to munch through with this query. We can read 1 GiB from SSD in 200ms, so that’s 14 minutes in total. That would be the <em>absolute</em> lowest bound, assuming essentially zero overhead from MySQL and not taking into consideration serialization, network, etc.</p>
<p>This also assumes the MySQL instance is doing <em>nothing</em> but serving our query, which is unrealistic. In reality, we’d dedicate <em>maybe</em> 10% of capacity to these queries, which puts us at 2 hours. Still faster, but a far cry from our hope of seconds or minutes. Buuh.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-4-dropping-offset">Iteration 4: Dropping OFFSET</h2>
<p>It’s starting to seem like trouble to use these OFFSET queries, even as sub-queries. We held on to it for a while, because it’s nice and easy to reason about, and means the queries can be fired off in parallel. We also held on to it for a while to truly show how awful these types of queries are, so hopefully you think twice about using it in a production query again!</p>
<p>If we change our approach to maintain <code>max(id)</code> from the last batch, we can simply change our loop’s query to:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> <span>`</span><span>table</span><span>`</span>
<span>WHERE</span> id <span>&gt;</span> <span>@</span>max_id_from_last_batch
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> id <span>ASC</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10000</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>This curbed the linear growth!</p>
<p><img src="https://buttondown.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/images/6b0263d5-c59f-4127-a573-6b06d615c195.png" alt=""></p>
<p>Now MySQL can use its efficient primary key index to do <a href="https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=log%28100*10%5E6%29%2Flog%281024%2F3*2%2F%288%2B4%29%29+%2B+1++*https%3A%2F%2Fdev.mysql.com%2Fdoc%2Frefman%2F8.0%2Fen%2Festimating-performance.html*">~6 SSD seeks</a> on <code>id</code> and then scan forward. This means we only process and serialize 10 MiB, putting our napkin math consistently around 100ms per batch as in the original estimate in iteration 1. That means this solution should <strong>finish in about half an hour!</strong> However, we learned in the previous iteration that we are constrained by only taking 10% of the database’s capacity, so as calculated from iteration 3, we’re back at 2 hours..</p>
<p>We fundamentally need an approach that handles less data, as the serialization and network time is the primary reason why the integrity checking is now slow.</p>
<h2 id="iteration-5-checksumming">Iteration 5: Checksumming</h2>
<p>If we want to handle less data, we need to have some way to fingerprint or checksum each record. We could change our query to something along the lines of:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> MD5(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>table</span>
<span>WHERE</span> id <span>&gt;</span> <span>@</span>max_id_from_last_batch
<span>ORDER</span> <span>BY</span> id <span>ASC</span>
<span>LIMIT</span> <span>10000</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>If there’s a mismatch, we simply revert to iteration 4 and find the rows that mismatch, but we have to scan far less data as we can assume the majority of it lines up.</p>
<p>Before moving on, let’s see whether the napkin math works out:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading 10 MiB off SSD at <a href="https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math#numbers">200 us/MiB</a> will take ~2ms.</li>
<li>Has…</li></ul></div></div>

  <p>The early Research Edition Unix versions featured a program that would turn a stream of ASCII text into utterances that could be played by a voice synthesizer. The source code of this program was lost for years. Here's the story of how I brought it back to life.</p>
<h3 id="finding-the-lost-code">Finding the lost code</h3>
<p>The (early 1973) Third Research Edition of Unix <a href="https://dspinellis.github.io/unix-v3man/v3man.pdf#page=130">documented</a> a program that would receive as input ASCII text and convert it into phonemes that could then be played by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Votrax">Votrax</a> voice synthesizer made by the Vocal Interface Division of Federal Screw Works. The program was written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy">M. D. McIlroy</a>, who documented its operation in a detailed <a href="https://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~doug/speak.tar">technical report</a>.</p>
<p>Although the program appeared in the Unix manual pages up to the 1975 <a href="https://ia800600.us.archive.org/19/items/v6-manual/v6-manual.pdf#page=251">Sixth Research Edition</a>, its source code was missing from the archives that had survived. Even its author lacked a copy.</p>
<p>Fortunately, in 2011, Jonathan Gevaryahu <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140620170452/https://minnie.tuhs.org/pipermail/tuhs/2011-December/002538.html">found</a> most parts of the program's source code in unallocated space of a Sixth Research Edition disk dump. (This means that the code was once stored on disk, but was later deleted, and the parts where it resided were never allocated to other uses.) Even better, he could reconstruct a single block that was missing from the program's compiled version, which was also available. Based on these findings, I added the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/source/s2/speak.c">speak source code</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo/blob/Research-V6-Snapshot-Development/usr/source/s2/speak.v">speech rules</a> to the <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/unix-history-repo">GiHub repository of Unix history</a> I am maintaining.</p>
<h3 id="reviving-the-code">Reviving the code</h3>
<p>To see how the program was working, I experimented with making it run and compile. As the program was written in an ancient dialect of C and was also unlikely to be portable, I first tried to make it work on a Sixth Edition Unix running on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SIMH">SIMH</a> PDP-11 emulator. This attempt quickly failed, because the console wasn't reliable enough to allow me to transfer the code via copy-paste.</p>
<p>I then run the PDP-11 2.11 BSD Unix on the same emulator, which offers rudimentary internet connection capabilities. After configuring a <code>.rhosts</code> file to allow remote copying (to obtain remote access, you simply add your remote host and user name), I was able to move the code to that machine.</p>
<p>However, compiling the code wasn't immediately possible. To make it compile I</p>
<ul>
<li>changed the old <code>=+</code>, <code>=^</code> to the modern <code>+=</code>, <code>^=</code> operators,</li>
<li>added forward declarations for functions returning pointers,</li>
<li>inserted an assignment operator in initialized constants (<code>int tflag 0;</code> became <code>int tflag = 0;</code> — I didn't even know this form ever existed),</li>
<li>changed calls from <code>seek</code> to <code>lseek</code>, and</li>
<li>added a proper exit code to <code>exit</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>At that stage the program could compile, but was crashing when I tried to run it. Given that 2.11 BSD lacked <em>gdb</em> and was generally slow and difficult to use, I decided to port the program to modern Unix/Linux. I also added more declarations, including full function prototypes to find other problems. (In early versions of C you didn't need to declare a function before using it.) I then methodically removed all compiler warnings, which allowed me to pinpoint a variable that was declared as a pointer but used as an integer. By correcting its declaration I fixed the initial crash.</p>
<p>Now I had a program that compiled and run, but was still crashing in some cases, and also wasn't producing correct output. For this further changes were needed.</p>
<ul>
<li>I replaced writing to a string with a write to a <code>char</code> array.</li>
<li>I corrected the size of a structure that was assumed to be 4.</li>
<li>I documented some functions to be able to follow the program logic.</li>
<li>I fixed the assumption that integers occupied two bytes.</li>
<li>I replaced integers initialized as pairs of characters (e.g. <code>'u1'</code>) with a macro that initialized the value in an endian-neutral manner.</li>
</ul>
<p>After these changes the program was able to compile the rules file and produce <a href="https://www.tuhs.org/Archive/Distributions/Research/Dennis_v5/v5man.pdf#page=285">Votrax phoneme codes</a>.</p>
<h3 id="getting-voice-output">Getting voice output</h3>
<p>Votrax voice synthesizers and their descendant chips (which appear to use similar phoneme codes) <a href="http://www.redcedar.com/sc01.htm">are not longer marketed</a>. In order to listen to the generated voice I needed a workaround. My first attempt was to use samples from the <a href="https://github.com/sealj553/votrax-speak">votrax-speak GitHub repository</a>. Converting the phoneme Votrax codes into their mnemonic names, and passing the corresponding sample files as arguments to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoX">SoX</a>, allowed me to create a sound file consisting of the phonemes played together. However, the generated sound file was almost unintelligible. As I read later, a great advantage of Votrax synthesizers was how they merged together the phonemes into continuous speech, which was not the case with my approach.</p>
<p>My second attempt involved using the phoneme output functionality of the <a href="https://github.com/espeak-ng/espeak-ng">espeak-ng</a> program. For this I created <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/speak/blob/master/votrax-espeak.md">a map</a> between the Votrax phoneme codes and the corresponding <a href="http://espeak.sourceforge.net/phonemes.html">espeak phonemes</a>, which I then coded into a <em>sed</em> script that would feed <em>espeak</em> with the output of Unix <em>speak</em>. Through this method I was finally able to produce somewhat intelligible speech with a pipeline, such as the following.</p>
<div><pre><code><span>echo</span> Hello world <span>|</span>
<span>speak</span> speak.m <span>|</span>
<span>LC_ALL=</span>C <span>./votrax-espeak.sed</span> <span>|</span>
<span>espeak</span></code></pre></div>
<h3 id="code-availability">Code availability</h3>
<p>The revived source code is available in <a href="https://github.com/dspinellis/speak">this GiHub repository</a>.</p>

  <h2>
Description</h2>

<p>LoggedFS is a fuse-based filesystem which can log every operations that happens in it. </p>

<p>How does it work ?</p>

<p>Fuse does almost everything. LoggedFS only sends a message to syslog when called by fuse and then let the real filesystem do the rest of the job.</p>

<h2>
Installation</h2>

<p>If loggedfs is included in your distribution you can just install with your package manager.</p>

<h2>
Installation from source</h2>

<p>First you have to make sure that fuse is installed on your computer. 
If you have a recent distribution it should be. Fuse can be downloaded here : <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse">https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse</a>.
Then you should download the loggedfs archive and install it with the make command :</p>

<pre><code>
wget https://github.com/rflament/loggedfs/archive/loggedfs-0.9.tar.gz
tar xfz loggedfs-0.9.tar.gz
cd loggedfs-loggedfs-0.9
make
make install
</code></pre>

<p>LoggedFS has the following dependencies :</p>

<pre><code>fuse
pcre
libxml2
</code></pre>

<h2>
Configuration</h2>

<p>LoggedFS can use an XML configuration file if you want it to log operations only for certain files, for certain users, or for certain operations.</p>

<p>Here is a sample configuration file :</p>

<pre><code>&lt;?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?&gt;

&lt;loggedFS logEnabled="true" printProcessName="true"&gt;
  &lt;includes&gt;
    &lt;include extension=".*" uid="*" action=".*" retname=".*"/&gt;
  &lt;/includes&gt;
  &lt;excludes&gt;
    &lt;exclude extension=".*\.bak$" uid="*" action=".*" retname="SUCCESS"/&gt;
    &lt;exclude extension=".*" uid="1000" action=".*" retname="FAILURE"/&gt;
    &lt;exclude extension=".*" uid="*" action="getattr" retname=".*"/&gt;
  &lt;/excludes&gt;
&lt;/loggedFS&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This configuration can be used to log everything except it if concerns a *.bak file, or if the uid is 1000, or if the operation is getattr.</p>

<h2>
Launching LoggedFS</h2>

<p>If you just want to test LoggedFS you don't need any configuration file.</p>

<p>Just use that command :</p>

<pre><code>loggedfs -f -p /var
</code></pre>

<p>You should see logs like these :</p>

<pre><code>tail -f /var/log/syslog
17:29:34 (src/loggedfs.cpp:552) LoggedFS running as a public filesystem
17:29:34 (src/loggedfs.cpp:547) LoggedFS not running as a daemon
17:29:34 (src/loggedfs.cpp:666) LoggedFS starting at /var.
17:29:34 (src/loggedfs.cpp:691) chdir to /var
17:29:35 (src/loggedfs.cpp:136) getattr /var/ {SUCCESS} [ pid = 8700 kded [kdeinit] uid = 1000 ]
17:29:41 (src/loggedfs.cpp:136) getattr /var/ {SUCCESS} [ pid = 10923 ls uid = 1000 ]
17:29:41 (src/loggedfs.cpp:136) getattr /var/run {SUCCESS} [ pid = 10923 ls uid = 1000 ]
17:29:41 (src/loggedfs.cpp:136) getattr /var/run/nscd {FAILURE} [ pid = 10923 ls uid = 1000 ]
17:29:41 (src/loggedfs.cpp:136) readdir /var/ {SUCCESS} [ pid = 10923 ls uid = 1000 ]
17:29:41 (src/loggedfs.cpp:136) getattr /var/pouak {SUCCESS} [ pid = 10923 ls uid = 1000 ]
</code></pre>

<p>If you have a configuration file to use you should use this command :</p>

<pre><code>./loggedfs -c loggedfs.xml -p /var
</code></pre>

<p>If you want to log what other users do on your filesystem, you should use the -p option to allow them to see your mounted files. For a complete documentation see the manual page</p>

<p>I might take a lot of heat for writing this, but I’m going to write it anyway. If you’ve made life changing money in one or more of the high flying stocks this year, it’s time to lock in some gains.</p>
<p>When I read about investors making <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/investors-double-down-on-stocks-pushing-margin-debt-to-record-11609077600">millions on Tesla</a> in the Wall Street Journal, I get nervous. I am also insanely happy for their good fortune. There is no greater luck than winning the lottery. It is not supposed to be this easy to make money in the stock market. Preserve and grow capital yes, but outright make a fortune? No. Money made this easily can be lost in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Morgan Housel wrote this in his best selling book, <a href="https://amzn.to/3o0Aevd"><em>The Psychology of Money</em></a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>There are a million ways to get wealthy, and plenty of books on how to do so.</p>
<p>But there’s only one way to stay wealthy: some combination of frugality and paranoia.</p>
<p>And that’s a topic we don’t discuss enough.</p></blockquote>
<p>Morgan goes on to describe how Jesse Livermore, known as the greatest trader on Earth in the early 20th century, made and lost several billion dollar fortunes in his lifetime. He never locked in his gains, never diversified, never took money off the gambling table. Although he was once the wealthiest man in the world, Livermore eventually took his own life. He died in debt, worthless.</p>
<p>Whatever you think you know, that the rest of the world doesn’t know, about Tesla, Etsy, Nvidia, Paypal, or any of the other winners this year, it doesn’t matter. You’ve made the kind of return most investors will only dream about. Take some money off the table. It doesn’t matter if the stock keeps going up from here. You can still participate with less of your money at risk.&nbsp; Lock it in. Secure the win.</p>
<p>You may be worried about the regret you will feel watching the stock go higher after you sell. Believe me, the pain of watching your gains disappear is worse. You don’t need to top tick this winner because you’ve already won. Don’t get greedy, get nervous. You can still participate in the upside by keeping a smaller position. There’s no need to bet the house.</p>
<p>Now, let’s talk about what comes next. Like an addict chasing that first high, you are going to be underwhelmed by all of your future investments. You will, most likely, never repeat the success you’ve had this year. Gambling is fun when you win. Investing is boring all the time. The good news is that you can keep the fun alive in a small trading account. The trick is to keep your trading account small enough that a complete loss won’t change your lifestyle and large enough to keep you entertained.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you have beat the odds and made a fortune trading stocks. My greatest wish for you is that you will have the humility to realize how lucky you are and lock in those gains.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
						<p>If you started out writing one page, simple scripts in PHP like I did. You probably were not thinking about testing your code before you lumped it onto the server.</p>
<p>I mean, it worked right? You were probably pretty confident about it, as I was.</p>
<p>As you have progressed in your development journey and moved towards more complex structurings of your code, such as with frameworks and multiple folder systems, I’m sure the default level of confidence in your codebase, when untested, that you started with, has begun to go down a peg.</p>
<p>It sure did for me.</p>
<p>As I improved as a developer, I wanted my code to do the same, so I began to look for the ways that I could be sure that my code was ‘good code’ or at least, it behaved as I expect it to.</p>
<p>The most important and reliable way I found that this could be done was by testing it.</p>
<h2>Why Testing Code Is Important?</h2>
<p>As you develop your code, what you are doing is creating a complex structure. If you imagine that this structure is real, like a building for example. You would want to make sure that the integrity of the structure is good (ie. that there are no bugs) so that it would not surprise you at any point, such as by collapsing.</p>
<p>In the real-world building process, you ensure this by engaging in various checks, tests, and surveys of structural integrity, done throughout the building process. When coding, you test. Specifically, you <code>unit test</code>.</p>
<h3>What is ‘Unit Testing’?</h3>
<p>The word ‘unit’, within the context of code testing, refers to a block of code that will be tested.</p>
<p>Usually, this block is in the form of a class method, a function, or some other highly relevant, segmented block of code. Essentially it is a segment of code whose integrity and expected output we want to ensure.</p>
<p>As stated on the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PHPUnit" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PHPUnit Wikipedia</a>,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The goal of unit testing is to isolate each part of the program and show that the individual parts are correct. A unit test provides a strict, written contract that the piece of code must satisfy. As a result, unit tests find problems early in the development cycle.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>What Does ‘Testing Code’ Mean?</h3>
<p>Testing code in general is the process of identifying, breaking down, and then specifying the units of our code that we would like to test. We do this by outlining our expected outcome. And then once we’ve done that, running those units through tests, using testing software tools to see if our expected outcomes are what we get.</p>
<p>All programming languages, in their ecosystem, dispose of some kind of toolings used to unit test source codes. PHP is not of an exception. And we have tools like <strong>PHPUnit</strong>, <strong>Codeception</strong>, <strong>Behat</strong>, <strong>PHPSpec</strong>, <strong>Storyplayer</strong>, <strong>Peridot</strong>, and much more out there.</p>
<p>In this post, we will focus on how you can get started with PHPUnit.</p>
<h2>PHPUnit</h2>
<p>If you’ve been involved in the PHP community for some time now, you’ve most likely heard of PHPUnit. It’s not only one of the most popular unit testing frameworks in PHP but is also one of the easiest to use.</p>
<p>Testing our code with PHPUnit is simply a matter of placing and applying our units of code within tests. These units are tested by writing a unique ‘test cases’.</p>
<h3>How To Use PHPUnit - Step By Step</h3>
<p>The typical testing flow goes like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import the class method, function, or segment of code to test. The <code>unit</code> you want to test.</li>
<li>Give input to the function, method, or unit.</li>
<li>Define what to expect as the output of the unit.</li>
<li>Check if the function/method/unit produces the expected output.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Installing and using PHPUnit</h3>
<p>To get started testing with PHPUnit, we first need to start by installing it.
There are two ways of using PHPUnit.</p>
<p>1- As a local development-time dependency: Basically you will add PHPUnit with <a href="https://lancecourse.com/tutorials/back-end/composer-your-first-class/52">composer</a> as a development dependency. The advantage of using it that way is that you can easily migrate from one version to another, and you can use a different version for two distinct projects.</p>
<p>2- As an installed tool in your development machine. This allows you to have a globally installed tool that can be used throughout your machine regardless of the project.</p>
<p>You can refer to the official installation guide for more details on these two ways of installation. For the brevity of this post, we will focus only on the first method.</p>
<p>To do so, first, navigate to or create the folder within which our project will sit(<code>Example</code> in my case), and then we can download(add to our dependencies) PHPUnit with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>composer require --dev phpunit/phpunit</code></pre>
<h3>Creating Our Class (Which We Will Then Test)</h3>
<p>Once we’ve downloaded PHPUnit into our folder, we can now begin our testing process by first writing the class that we will be testing. Let’s create a simple ‘User’ class that sets a <code>$first_name</code> and a <code>$last_name</code> property. And then has a function that returns the combination of these two properties as a <code>full name</code>.</p>
<p>You can see an example of this below(<strong>User.php</strong>):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

final class User
{

    public $first_name;
    public $last_name;

    public function getFullName(): string
    {
        return $this-&gt;first_name . " " . $this-&gt;last_name;
    }

}</code></pre>
<h3>Creating The Test Folder &amp; phpunit.xml</h3>
<p>Once we have set up our ‘User’ class, let us now set up our ‘tests’ folder, where we will hold our tests.</p>
<p>We will also create our <code>phpunit.xml</code> file at the root of our project. We will reference the folder where our tests are held inside that file. We do this by placing the name of the folder in the directory element within our XML file.</p>
<p>Here is a minimal content one could have on your phpunit.xml file:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;phpunit bootstrap="vendor/autoload.php" colors="true"&gt;
    &lt;testsuites&gt;
        &lt;testsuite name="IntroPHPUnitTest"&gt;
            &lt;directory&gt;tests&lt;/directory&gt;
        &lt;/testsuite&gt;
    &lt;/testsuites&gt;
&lt;/phpunit&gt;</code></pre>
<h3>Writing Our First Test</h3>
<p>Now that we have created our tests/ folder, we may now move onto creating our first test. In this, we will be simply checking if our <code>getFullName()</code> class method above returns a string of <code>$first_nam</code>e and <code>$last_name</code> as we expect.</p>
<p>Our test will look like this(<strong>UserTest.php</strong>):</p>
<pre><code>&lt;?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

final class UserTest extends TestCase
{
    /* 
    Our first test method: testing if our 
    User class can return a full name 
     */
    public function testReturnsUserFullName()
    {

        // We need to bring in our User class
        // so that we can access its methods
        require_once './User.php';

        // Get an instance of the User class
        $user = new User;

        // Set the properties
        $user-&gt;first_name = 'Femy';
        $user-&gt;last_name = 'Babatunde';

        // Assert if the getFullName() can return the full name 'Femy Babatunde'
        $this-&gt;assertEquals('Femy Babatunde', $user-&gt;getFullName());
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Here we are including the ‘TestCase’ class from PHPUnit, which gives us the functionality that we need to run the test.</p>
<p>Then we creating our test class <code>UserTest</code> which extends the <code>TestCase</code> class from PHPUnit.</p>
<p>Bear in mind that the name of the file and should ideally have the name of the class that we are testing, ending with the ‘Test’.</p>
<p>The name of the test class should also be the same as the name of the class being tested, but should also end with <code>Test</code> Such as the above specified <code>UserTest</code> class definition.</p>
<p>The name of the method that we use to wrap our actual unit test should be as much as possible, a description of the test that we are attempting to run. In the above case, it is <code>testReturnsUserFullName</code>, which is what our test checks for.</p>
<p>Inside this method, we then load in and instantiate our original class, our data, and then attempt to run our test using the <code>assertEquals($expected, $actual)</code> method from PHPUnit. The method checks if its two arguments match. That is to set the full name, using our <code>$first_name</code> and <code>$last_name</code> properties that we defined within our constructor.</p>
<p>Once we have set up our test assertion, we are now ready to run our test.</p>
<h3>Running Our First Test</h3>
<h4>Overview of our project</h4>
<p>Once we have created our test, it is now time for us to run it. But, before we move on to testing our setup, let's have a look at how our project looks like.</p>
<p><img src="https://phpocean.com/assets/images/forum-uploads/f1ae214da762d1d534a0daf83d053af7.png" alt="Project Structure"></p>
<p>PHPUnit's framework in actually inside a subfolder named <code>bin</code> located in the <code>vendor</code> folder.</p>
<p>If you installed PHPUnit using our second method of installation above, you may do this by simply running the command <code>phpunit</code> in our command line, while within the folder directory where we have installed PHPUnit. But, in our case, we used the first method to install PHPUnit as a project-level dependency. So, to run your test type the following command while being in the root folder, <code>Example</code>:</p>
<pre><code>.\vendor\bin\phpunit</code></pre>
<p>The expected output of the above test case within the command line should let you know that the test passed. This is how it looks like in my case:</p>
<p><img src="https://phpocean.com/assets/images/forum-uploads/aed65b79e698104d84e11a12a70a22af.png" alt="Test Result"></p>
<p>With a “Passed” statement and no “Failed” statements, this means that our tests have passed and that our assumption for the test (or test cases) is validated.</p>
<h2>Wrapping It All Up</h2>
<p>This is what testing in PHP using PHPUnit looks like. This example used here is a very basic use case. You push further with more complex code. Please, refer to the official PHPUnit website for more on the subject.</p>
<p>In other languages, the general idea is also the same. Ultimately, all tests of code follow the same structure that we’ve outlined above.</p>
<p>I hope that this tutorial has given you enough information to get you started with unit testing in PHP and unit testing in general.</p>
<p>If you have anything to add to this article, please let me know in the comments section.</p>

					<p>Once upon a time, someone with the handle “entha_saava” posted this question on <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23791152">Hacker News</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Can someone knowledgeable explain how are lisp REPLs different from
Python / Ruby REPLs? What is the differentiating point of REPL
driven development?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The answer is that there is a <a href="http://mikelevins.github.io/2020/02/03/programming-as-teaching.html">particular kind of programming</a>
in which you build a program by <em>interacting</em> with it as it runs, and
there are certain languages and runtimes that are designed from the
ground up to support that kind of programming.</p>
<p>Python and Ruby are not examples of such languages.</p>
<p>Why not? That’s the crux of entha_saava’s question, right? What are
these <strong>repl-driven</strong> programming systems, and what makes them
different from Python and Ruby and every other language that offers a
repl?</p>
<p>For that matter, what’s a repl?</p>
<p>The word <strong>repl</strong> is an acronym that stands for <strong>read-eval-print
loop</strong>. The term comes from the history of Lisp. From the start, sixty
years ago, the standard way of working with a Lisp has been to start a
language processor, type expressions at its prompt, and wait for it to
evaluate the expressions and print their results, before prompting for
another expression. Read, eval, print. Loop.</p>
<p>Nowadays, repls are all the rage. Every language and its brother
offers a repl. There’s a website, <a href="https://repl.it/">repl.it</a>, whose
entire purpose is to provide all the repls.</p>
<p>It doesn’t actually provide <em>all</em> the repls, of course. What’s
particularly ironic is that it doesn’t provide either of the canonical
repl-driven development environments: Common Lisp and Smalltalk.</p>
<p>That brings us back to entha_saava’s question: if Common Lisp and
Smalltalk are repl-driven environments, and Python and Ruby are not,
what’s the difference? What do Lisp and Smalltalk have that Python and
Ruby don’t?</p>
<p>What they have is a language and runtime system that are designed from
the ground up with the assumption that you’re going to develop
programs by starting the language engine and talking to it, teaching
it how to be your program <em>interactively</em>, by changing it <em>while it
runs</em>.</p>
<p>I can hear the objections formulating already. I’ve seen them
before. Yes, every language with a repl can do some things in the
repl. Obviously that’s true; if it weren’t, then the repl would be
entirely useless.</p>
<p>Being able to do <em>some</em> things in the repl does not make an engine
into a repl-driven programming environment. What distinguishes
old-fashioned Lisp and Smalltalk environments is that you can do
<em>everything</em> in the repl. They place no gratuitous limitations on what
you can do; if the language and runtime can do it, then the repl can
do it.</p>
<p>For example, you can ask the current version of Clozure Common Lisp to
rebuild itself from scratch by evaluating the following expression at
the repl prompt:</p>
<pre><code>(rebuild-ccl :full t)
</code></pre>
<p>CCL responds by completely rebuilding itself from source.</p>
<p>The point is not that you would want to rebuild CCL this way all the
time. The point is that there are no artificial limitations on what
the repl can do. The full range of the development system’s
capabilities is accessible from the repl.</p>
<p>That’s one of the first things I notice when using newer, lesser
repls: I’m always running into things I can’t do from the repl.</p>
<p>It’s not just about freedom from restrictions, though. Proper support
for interactive programming means that the language and its runtime
have positive features that support changing your program <em>while it
runs</em>.</p>
<p>Try this in your favorite repl:</p>
<p>Define a function, <code>foo</code>, that calls some other function, <code>bar</code>, that
is not yet defined. Now call <code>foo</code>. What happens?</p>
<p>Obviously, the call to <code>foo</code> breaks, because <code>bar</code> is not defined. But
what happens when it breaks? What happens next?</p>
<p>If your favorite repl is Python’s or Ruby’s or any of a few dozen
other modern repls, the answer is most likely that it prints an error
message and returns to its prompt. In some cases, perhaps it crashes.</p>
<p>So what’s my point, right? What else could it do?</p>
<p>The answer to that question is the “differentiating point” of
repl-driven programming. In an old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk
environment, the break in <code>foo</code> drops you into a <strong>breakloop</strong>.</p>
<p>A <strong>breakloop</strong> is a full-featured repl, complete with all of the
tools of the main repl, but it exists inside the dynamic environment
of the broken function. From the breakloop you can roam up and down
the suspended call stack, examining all variables that are lexically
visible from each stack frame. In fact, you can inspect all live data
in the running program.</p>
<p>What’s more, you can <em>edit</em> all live data in the program. If you think
that a break was caused by a wrong value in some particular variable
or field, you can interactively change it and resume the suspended
function. If it now works correctly, then congratulations; you found
the problem!</p>
<p>Moreover, because the entire language and development system are
available, unrestricted, in the repl, you can define the missing
function <code>bar</code>, resume <code>foo</code>, and get a sensible result.</p>
<p>In fact, there’s a style of programming, well known in Lisp and
Smalltalk circles, in which you define a toplevel function with calls
to other functions that don’t yet exist, and then define those
functions as you go in the resulting breakloops. It’s a fast way to
implement a procedure when you already know how it should work.</p>
<p>If you’re a user of old-fashioned Lisp or Smalltalk systems then this
all sounds obvious to you, but that reaction is not common. Surprise
is much more common, or even suspicion: what’s the catch?</p>
<p>The catch is that the designers of your language system had to think
that facility through in the planning stages. You don’t get a decent
implementation of it by bolting it on after the fact. Breakloops need
<em>full</em> access to the <em>entire</em> development system, interactively, with
a computation and its call stack suspended in the breakloop’s
environment.</p>
<p>Let’s take another example of a facility designed to support
interactive programming. Once again, try this in your favorite repl:</p>
<p>Define a datatype. I mean a class, a struct, a record type–whatever
user-defined type your favorite language supports. Make some instances
of it. Write some functions (or methods, or procedures, or whatever)
to operate on them.</p>
<p>Now change the definition of the type. What happens?</p>
<p>Does your language runtime notice that the definition of the type has
changed? Does it realize that the existing instances have a new
definition? When something touches one of them, does it automatically
reinitialize it to conform to the new definition, or, if it doesn’t
know how to do that, does it start a breakloop and ask you what to do
about it?</p>
<p>If the answer is “yes,” then you’re probably using a Lisp or Smalltalk
system. If the answer is “no,” then you’re missing a crucial element
of repl-driven development.</p>
<p>Remember: the point is to support programming <em>interactively</em>. You
don’t want to have to kill your program and rebuild it from scratch
just because you changed a definition. That’s silly; adding and
changing definitions is most of what you do! If your development
environment is going to support interactive development, then it had
better know how to keep your program running when you change some
definitions.</p>
<p>Old-fashioned Lisp and Smalltalk system know how to do that. There are
also a few other kinds of systems, mostly older ones, that know how to
do it.</p>
<p>These are not eccentric new ideas out of left field. They’ve been
around for half a century. They contribute materially to productivity
in interactive development.</p>
<p>They’re what sets <strong>repl-driven development</strong> apart from mere
development with a repl.</p>
<p>Now, not every programmer prefers that kind of development. Some
programmers prefer to think of development as a process of designing,
planning, making blueprints, and assembling parts on a
workbench. There’s nothing wrong with that. Indeed, a
multibillion-dollar international industry has been built upon it.</p>
<p>But if you prefer interactive development, if it’s more natural to
you, then it can make you enormously more productive, not to mention
happier in your work.</p>
<p>Interactive development with a proper repl-driven environment is the
exception. Most programming is done in other ways.</p>
<p>As a consequence, there are a lot of programmers out there who’ve
never even heard of it, who have no idea that it exists. My intuition
is that some fraction of those programmers would prefer well-supported
interactive programming, and would benefit from it, if they just knew
what it was.</p>
<p>Maybe if enough programmers are exposed to that style of programming
then we’ll begin to see new tools that embrace it.</p>

<h3 id="superhuman">Superhuman</h3>

<p>Superhuman is an invite-only $30/month email client.<sup id="fnref:pricing" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:pricing">1</a></sup> People like it for its sleek design, responsive speed, and suite of keyboard shortcuts to improve a user’s email efficiency. People justify this purchase over free alternatives by the fact that they spend hours on email everyday. Part of Superhuman’s feature offering includes read statuses, which is useful for executives and sales people who like to keep a pulse on their conversations.</p>

<p><img src="http://www.growthalytics.com/images/2021-01-02-the-sublime-text-editor-of-x/superhuman.png" alt="Superhuman Product Screenshot"></p>

<p>Users love Superhuman. Take a quick peak on Twitter<sup id="fnref:twitter" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:twitter">2</a></sup> at the effusive praise the company gets. Andreessen Horowitz led the latest investment round in the company with a valuation of roughly $260 million.</p>

<p>Following in the tailwind of this prosumer email client that has taken Silicon Valley and Twitter by storm are a suite of companies claiming to be “Superhuman for x”.<sup id="fnref:superhumanofx" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:superhumanofx">3</a></sup></p>

<p>As identified by Todd Goldberg, the “Superhuman of X” has the following traits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Designed for speed.</li>
  <li>Built as an opinionated product experience for a specific use case and/or target audience.</li>
  <li>Driven primarily by keyboard shortcuts.</li>
  <li>Beautiful and thoughtfully designed.</li>
  <li><em>Optional</em>: Built as a modern alternative to a product that has legacy distribution effects</li>
  <li><em>Optional</em>: Positioned as a premium product vs. free alternatives.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="sublime-text">Sublime Text</h3>

<p>I present Sublime Text: a piece of software more than a decade older than Superhuman, that shares the above attributes. Sublime can be driven primarily by keyboard shortcuts. It’s as thoughtfully designed as I have been shamefully unwilling to purchase the non-trial version for 80 USD. The similarities lie much deeper than that. Sublime has two close-to-instant-speed search-bars: one for opening a file in your project [goto] and one for executing commands.</p>

<p>Sublime Text is also simultaneously opinionated but also configurable. It is simple enough for a programmer to install, open, and “hit the ground running” on a big project with a combination of GOTO (⌘+P) and project search (⌘+Shift+F).</p>

<h3 id="the-sublime-text-of-x">The “Sublime Text of X”</h3>

<p>Without futhur ado, I present a case study sampling of “Sublime Texts of X”.</p>

<p>The “Sublime Text of X” is software having the following traits:</p>

  <li><span><em>Not Optional</em>: &nbsp;Dark mode&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>

<p>I look forward to a <del>bright</del> dark future where everything can be done fast and efficiently through keyboard shortcuts. If there are other startups or products that give you Sublime Text vibes I would love to know!</p>

<h2>Detailed view</h2>
<p>There are four charts in the Expenses vs Envelope budgeting detailed view.</p>
<p>The first one shows you the percentage of expenses for the particular month:</p>
<div><p><img src="https://docs.prudent.me/img/ExpensesDistribution.PNG"></p></div>
<p>The second chart shows the sub-total of each expense: <br></p>
<div><p><img src="https://docs.prudent.me/img/ExpensesSubtotal.PNG"></p></div>
<p>The third chart shows the amount that is left in each envelop (budget) that you'd defined:</p>

<p>The above chart is based on the budget we defined in the example earlier. The budget we set for groceries was $800 and $770 was spent for groceries within the month, giving a balance in the envelope of $30 in the Groceries envelope. Petrol expenses exceeded the budget by $105 and is marked in red because of that.</p>
<p>The last chart shows the expense transactions that had occured for the month:</p>

<p>This chart is useful when setting budget, when viewed on a Year time scope (click on the Year button near the top-right):</p>
<div><p><img src="https://docs.prudent.me/img/YearToDateExpenses.PNG"></p></div>
<p>In the above chart, we see that expenses hovers around $700 for groceries and $480 for petrol. We can set our budget based on the average that we see here or any other trend (down or up) that the chart might show.</p>
<h2>Additional transaction examples</h2>
<p>The last expenses chart above can be reproduced with these additional transactions (on top of the other transactions shown above):</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I once worked in highly regulated environments and needed a way to recall dozens of complex passwords that changed frequently. I tried to use a password manager, but could not due to the burdens and insecurity of some common design flaws. I wrote a Deterministic Password Generator <a href="https://github.com/62726164/dpg">DPG</a> to address this.</p><p>If after reading this you still wish to use a traditional password manager, I suggest that you put your passwords into a plain text file and symmetrically encrypt it with <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> or use <a href="https://www.pwsafe.org/">Password Safe</a>. I have no relation with either.</p><p>Here are three common design flaws in password managers:</p><ol><li>Password storage</li><li>Reliance on remote systems</li><li>Web browser integration</li></ol><h2 id="password-storage">Password storage</h2><p>When passwords are stored, they must be encrypted and then retrieved later when needed. Storage, of any type, is a burden. Users are required to backup stored passwords, synchronize them across devices and implement measures to protect them.</p><p>Users must also devise a master password to unlock the encrypted passwords stored by the password manager. This is similar to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_keying">master key</a>. It is generally accepted that master keyed locks are less secure than non-master keyed locks. If the master password is exposed, then confidence (in all the passwords that it unlocks) is lost.</p><p>And, are we certain that the encryption used to store the passwords is implemented correctly? Has the encryption been externally validated? Some password managers are closed-source and proprietary and cannot be examined.</p><p>Encryption is hard. Even respected, expert developers with many years of experience (who seldom make mistakes) <a href="http://www.daemonology.net/blog/2011-01-18-tarsnap-critical-security-bug.html">do make mistakes</a> that render encryption weak or in some cases almost useless.</p><h2 id="reliance-on-remote-systems">Reliance on remote systems</h2><p>Ironically, password managers rely on remote systems largely because they store passwords. The first design flaw causes the second.</p><p>Remote systems are outside the user’s control. They are opaque and cannot be examined and should not be trusted with password management. These systems may not be available when needed. They may not be storing or transmitting passwords correctly.</p><p>Externally, the systems may seem correct (strong HTTPS, reasonable CSP) but behind the scenes, no one really knows what’s going on. How are the passwords being transmitted, generated and stored internally? Who has access to them?</p><p>Several popular cloud-based password managers have reported security breaches: <a href="https://www.darkreading.com/attacks-breaches/onelogin-breach-reignites-concerns-over-password-managers/d/d-id/1329034">1</a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2017/03/potent-lastpass-exploit-underscores-the-dark-side-of-password-managers/">2</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/2015/06/hack-brief-password-manager-lastpass-got-breached-hard/">3</a>.</p><h2 id="web-browser-integration">Web browser integration</h2><p>Web browsers today have “everything but the kitchen sink” capabilities built-in and are becoming more and more complex each year. They are turning into whole platforms that have browser plug-ins and extensions for every possible need known to humankind.</p><p>While many of these add-ons are handy and useful, we should not trust them with password management. Browsers are just too complex and have far too much going on.</p><h2 id="dpg">DPG</h2><p>I wrote DPG (The Deterministic Password Generator) around 2010 to address the design flaws described above. Here are its key concepts.</p><ol><li>Never store passwords. Rather, generate them as needed based on user input. The need to backup, synchronize and properly encrypt passwords is removed. There is no master password that immediately unlocks all of the other passwords. There is nothing to become lost, stolen or corrupt.</li><li>Only run locally on end-use devices. No reliance on remote systems or web browsers.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/62726164/dpg">DPG is open-source</a> and has several implementations. The passwords it generates can be verified and validated by external implementations in multiple programming languages.</li></ol><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p>DPG removes many of the flaws that I have experienced with traditional password managers over the years. Try it. You may like it. I hope you find it as useful as I have.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/passwords">passwords</a></li><li><a href="https://www.go350.com/tags/compliance">compliance</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<!-- Article: Content
================================================== -->
<section>
	<div>
	<p>Please write a short essay in response to each of the three essay topics below. There is a 100-word minimum and a 250-word maximum for each essay.
</p>		<p>First, let’s briefly get a sense of what 250 words means. It’s two average paragraphs, or three lean paragraphs. Also known as: not a ton of space! The burden is on you to think about the meatiest point you need to make, and then to build your surrounding elements strategically, so that they help you deliver that point with maximum impact, concisely. It’s not as easy as it may sound. For our analysis, we’re mostly going to dig into the “meat” aspect.</p>
<h3>Essay 1: The Stanford community is deeply curious and driven to learn in and out of the classroom. Reflect on an idea or experience that makes you genuinely excited about learning.</h3>
<p>Strangely, this one rides or dies on the PROOF that you’re actually, truly, genuinely excited about learning. What serves as proof? Action. The stuff YOU DO in response to the stuff you’re inspired by… that demonstrates it, and makes it real. Anyone can CLAIM to be super inspired by X Y and Z and talk about it. But if all they do is talk, does it really matter? Not exactly the world’s sexiest Zen koan, but you get the idea.</p>
<p>Something to consider here – something common to folks who are genuinely excited about learning – is an unusual comfort level with being WRONG. A thirst for learning is predicated on (1) acknowledging that you don’t know everything already, and (2) that the stuff you may THINK you know, is wrong or incomplete. Why mention this? Cuz it can help your case to give EVIDENCE of that. Have you ever been wrong about something, and were THRILLED to discover what ended up being a BETTER WAY OF LOOKING AT SOMETHING? Walk us through what it felt like, why it might have felt bad at some point, but why it felt GOOD eventually to have developed, improved, evolved. We need to really PROVE that you’re turned on by learning, and admitting that you’ve been wrong (and loved it), is an excellent way to do so.</p>
<p>Another way, alluded to earlier, is purely through action. Is there evidence of “tirelessness” when you’re attempting to learn something? We need to see ways in which you pursue this thing, especially when it’s INCONVENIENT to do so. In other words, if your pursuit is compelling, but kinda expected, it won’t weigh as much. If you decided you wanted to get some cereal, and then went out and bought yourself some cereal… um, okay? But if on the way, it started to rain, and a hurricane arrived, and the store closed, so you hitchhiked to another location, and that store was closed too, so you decided to call your friend you know who happened to have an extra box, but he wasn’t home, so you decided to……. [yada yada]…. You ended up with your box of Crispix. Now THAT GUY’s interest in “cereal” seems unimpeachable, no? Show us how, when pursuing something for the sake of learning, you’ve done it (1) when no one else was looking, or (2) when it became inconvenient to do so, but you still did it, or (3) when the risk of continuing to do it started to outweigh the benefits, or… you get the idea.</p>
<p>Most students will focus on THE THING they’re excited about, rather than proving their excitement through action. It’s that second group that ultimately wins, because we now have reason to believe that they have that forward-leaning trait which will carry them through college and beyond. (And that’s whole point of this question – to make sure you won’t drop out in freshman year when you take a class that’s harder than any class you’ve ever taken before.)</p>
<h3>Essay 2: Virtually all of Stanford’s undergraduates live on campus. Write a note to your future roommate that reveals something about you or that will help your roommate—and us—know you better.</h3>
<p>Classic Stanford undergrad question. The mistake we see 95% of the time on first drafts is the impulse to try to “slip in” resume highlights. As if this is a veiled attempt by Stanford to get those highlights, instead of, you know, just asking for them. The way to impress Stanford here is through honesty and charm. But mostly honesty.</p>
<p>Indulge us here and take two swings at this. On the first attempt, get it out of your system, whatever letter you want to write, just take a crack and then file it away for the time being.</p>
<p>On your second attempt, go with us on a little journey. Start by <strong>creating a roommate</strong>, leaving everything to chance (the same way it’ll more or less work out when you’re actually assigned a roommate in your freshman dorm). For starters, your roommate will almost certainly be the same gender. Now, generate a bunch of parameters, like ethnicity, height, weight, athletic/ musical/etc., liberal/conservative, east coast/southern/west-coast/etc., affable/surly, cool/not-so-cool, American/foreign-born/etc.…. Don’t spend too much time, because it doesn’t really matter much. Give this guy or gal a name. Again, don’t get stuck on this, the idea is to paint a vague picture. But once you have this picture, commit to it for a second. Imagine a real person on the other end.</p>
<p>Now, you’re gonna address a fresh new letter to this person. If the open-ended-ness of the Stanford prompt leaves you stuck, consider some of the following ideas. Write the letter using one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>What if your roommate just confided in you, and told you an incredible secret. Something that leaves your roommate in an extremely vulnerable emotional state having just put him/herself on the line. What might you reveal about YOURSELF in response? “Hey, so here’s something most people don’t know about ME…” (What might follow that up?)</li>
<li>Treat it as though it were a dating profile. What kinds of preferences would you reveal about yourself that might give the BEST clues about what you’re all about? Think about quirks and specificity here. If you were to say “I like Chinese food” it doesn’t say all that much since so many different types of people would fall under that same category. If, however, you were to say you absolutely HATE the HBO show “Game of Thrones” that would have the opposite effect since “most people are obsessed with that show (INCLUDING ALL OF US AT ADMISSIONADO, SO WATCH YOUR STEP!).” Can you stack up a few such preferences that, when summed, may help someone get a sense for what you’re all about, and even better, become more curious to get to know you better?</li>
<li>You know that classic question “if you were stuck on a desert island forever, what album would you bring?” … You can put a twist on it here. Name a few KEY possessions you’re gonna bring that’ll be essential to your comfort. Forget bland necessities like “a toothbrush” (since everyone will be packing one of those). More like, the “sounds of the rainforest” you use to lull yourself to sleep every night. Stuff like that. And possibly even suggest a few things you DON’T have that your roommate may bring to complete the set for total roommate symbiosis. You don’t need to follow this conceit exactly, but maybe this gives you an idea from which you can springboard to help show us something about who you are exactly, and what makes you … you.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Essay 3: Tell us about something that is meaningful to you, and why?</h3>
<p>Ha, in 250 words… you’re asked to grapple with one of life’s more challenging questions. A fitting test for a place like Stanford. Let’s start with what NOT to do.</p>
<p>Extinguish the desire to imagine what Stanford wants to hear. If you pen a response that you <strong>BELIEVE</strong> will put you in good stead because you think it shows maturity, or emotional intelligence, or whatever else… you are in for a crash landing. Or, tell you what, let’s a make a deal. Write that version, and keep it handy. Now write <strong>ANOTHER</strong> version that may never ever see the light of day. Think of this as a private diary entry. An exercise that may lead to something. But take the pressure away that someone might read it, so be more honest than you might want to be otherwise.</p>
<p>For this version, imagine you’re addressing a &nbsp;huge crowd (as if you are the Pope, or MLK), and it’s a crowd of people who… aren’t really contributing all that positively to society. Maybe they’re lazy. Maybe they’re irresponsible. Maybe they’re disaffected. Maybe they’re dangerous. Let’s just call them the folks who aren’t model citizens of the world.</p>
<p>What might you say to inspire these folks? Think about it. If you were to say something obvious, wouldn’t it run the risk of not having much of an impact? Make it less about you (just for a second), and instead think about what you might say to inspire this crowd. If you were to say “say no to drugs” or “do unto others…” or “cherish each day as though it were your last” … hasn’t everyone heard it already? If they haven’t internalized those ideas, they’re certainly not gonna do so just because <strong>YOU</strong> said it, right? But they might if they hear something <strong>NEW</strong>, something fresh about what matters, in a way that may cause them to re-evaluate things or see things through a new lens.</p>
<p>Obviously, you won’t want to write about something trivial, like “driving a nice car matters because the value of a smooth ride is more pleasing than a bumpy one.” Unless it’s a cracking metaphor, something like that might make your message seem like you didn’t give it a whole lot of thought, or, worse, you’re someone who’s so privileged that that type of material comfort is truly something that matters more than deeper, cooler things. So, it probably will have to do with human interaction, or a way of approaching things, or a state of being, or the like. Think about where others are going wrong. What are others <strong>MISSING</strong>, in a way that leads to irresponsible behavior, actions, attitudes, etc.? What matters to <strong>YOU</strong> that makes you feel like your compass is pointed in a better direction?</p>
<p>This conceit (of addressing a crowd) is meant to unlock ideas, not for you to embrace the idea too literally. You’re not proselytizing. So, if it helps, use your imagination of …</p></div></section></div></div>

<p>I’ve recently been thinking about why listening can be very difficult. One aspect that always comes to mind, a practice that is exceptionally difficult to give up, is the tendency to finish other’s thoughts. Here’s some similar scenarios to illustrate:</p>
<p>Meet Alice, a senior engineer on a team and Bob a recent addition on the team.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: Hey Alice. Got a sec?<br> Alice: Sure Bob. What’s up?<br> Bob: I was trying to use system X and I run into problem Y. I …<br> Alice: Oh, must be issue Z? That concurrency bug surfaces from time to time.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This can go one of 2 ways. Either, Alice is on the money and has helped Bob figure it quickly.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: Oh! Right! I hadn’t thought about that. Why is that?<br> Alice: My pleasure.<br> etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or alternatively, Alice is off the mark:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Bob: I don’t think so. I’m seeing more of issue A.<br> Alice: I see. Must be the installation ordering!<br> etc.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In both these cases, Alice quickly concludes what issue Bob might be facing. With her wealth of experience on the team and deep knowledge of the systems, she is able to usually have a good idea what the issue is. However, in both cases, Alice unintentionally doesn’t allow Bob to complete his thoughts. What else could Bob have said about the issue? He, for instance, could have elaborated on the steps he had taken so far, and how he went about trying to figure out the issue. All this information could have given Alice more context and a better opportunity to coach Bob as he ramps up on the team even better. It also could have fostered more relationship building between them. Unfortunately, this doesn’t happen.</p>
<p>Cases such as this are very common. Let’s look at Juan a manager and Neda, an engineer that reports to him:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Juan: Hey Neda! How’s the project going?<br> Neda: The project is coming along well. I do have some reservations on it’s value to the company. It…<br> Juan: What aspects are giving you reservations?<br> Neda: The project will take Y months and at best generate Z in revenue. <span>I…</span><br> Juan: That sounds pretty decent to me. This project has been a long time coming and will have impact around the company beyond revenue. It will…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Juan does a good job trying to understand the problem a bit better at the start asking a clarifying question. However, when he gets a whiff of what he thinks the issue is, he quickly jumps to address it, attempting to complete Neda’s thoughts.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it isn’t possible to truly know what another’s thoughts are. We simply cannot <strong>(yet)</strong> read each other’s minds. If we don’t let others finish their thought, we risk souring the conversation and/or relationship: whether that means the other person has to correct us and redirect the conversation or that the other person resorts to not voicing their opinions.</p>
<p>We all have busy schedules and want to be efficient in our conversations. As leaders, we often are having similar conversations with many different people. So much so, that we usually know what the person is<span></span> <span>“</span>getting at”; it is very tempting to make the connections! The crux though, is that when we guess wrong, it can be disastrous.</p>
<p>So the next time you have the urge, pressing as it may be, to complete someone’s thoughts, hold your tongue. Let them go over what they think even if you’ve heard it all before. Before you respond, ask yourself, have they finished their thought? Are you about to complete their thought because you think you know what they are getting at? Don’t respond until they finish. With all the context they give you, give them that great response! They will appreciate you for it. If you really must, and can’t fight the urge, count down for 5 seconds of silence or try asking a clarifying question instead.</p>

	<div>
		<article>
			<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seeing_Like_a_State"><em>Seeing Like a State</em></a>, James C. Scott defines “legibility” as something a state imposes on its people and resources.  It is a coercive abstraction, not only treating different people, places, and ways of life as if they were the same<sup id="fnref:abstraction"><a href="#fn:abstraction">1</a></sup>, but creating an environment which encourages people to forget those differences ever existed.</p>

<p>One of Scott’s first examples is land ownership in pre-modern rural villages, each of which had its own peculiar practices built over generations, describing the obligations between neighbors, the obligations between relatives, and the use of common pastures and forests.  These practices were perfectly legible within a given village, but a cacophonous mess to state officials trying to understand all of them at once.</p>

<p>And so the states sent in surveyors, who drew sharp boundaries on their maps.  A year later came the tax collectors, maps in hand.  If a family paid taxes on what was once common property, they had little motivation to let their neighbors continue to use it.  Instead, the villagers reshaped their lives to fit the maps.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Image_of_the_City"><em>The Image of the City</em></a>, Kevin Lynch defines “legibility” as something that a complex environment offers to its inhabitants, allowing them to easily navigate it.  It is a clarifying abstraction, making the world more than an endless deluge of minute details.</p>

<p>Lynch interviewed long-time residents of various cities, and asked them to describe how they’d navigate from one part of the city to another.  He created reference maps of shared elements from these journeys, representing how each city was understood by its people.</p>

<p>Some cities, such as Boston, were highly legible; its map was full of reference points, and its residents were confident in each step of their imagined journey.  Other cities were less so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[A]lmost anyone can, if attentive, learn to navigate in Jersey City, but only at the cost of some effort and uncertainty.  Moreover, the positive values of legible surroundings are missing: the emotional satisfaction, the framework for communication or conceptual organization, the new depths that it may bring to everyday experience.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The moral hazard described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em> exists in any field of design.  In software, for instance, anywhere one implementation cannot be easily exchanged for another, users are forced to bend themselves to the needs of their software.  This is trivially true of enterprise software, since the users are not the buyers, but given the increasingly <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero_to_One">monopolistic bent</a> of all software companies, it can be also true in the consumer space.</p>

<p>This is worrisome, not least because of the tech industry’s continuous attempts to resurrect <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_positivism">logical positivism</a>.  Someone who claims their design was conceived from first principles has almost always injected their own biases and incuriosity into those principles.  As coercive abstractions, these designs will preserve whatever is familiar to a small, homogeneous group, and allow everything else to wither away.</p>

<p>Scott offers prescriptions for avoiding the problems he describes, but they’re mostly process-oriented (“take small steps”, “favor reversibility”) and entirely focused on harm reduction.  For Scott, abstraction is always something done to people, never for people.</p>

<p>But this is just one side of the coin; to apply the insights in either book we must understand both kinds of legibility, and what separates them.  To get there, though, we must first explore two works of fiction.</p>

<hr>

<p>The Gnostics were a collection of early Christian sects which fused the gospels with Platonic dualism.<sup id="fnref:gnostics"><a href="#fn:gnostics">2</a></sup>  A true Creator was responsible for the world of ideal forms, while a lesser being, a <strong>demiurge</strong>, was responsible for the pale shadow of our physical world.  For the Gnostics, the work of the demiurge was a veil over our eyes, created out of malice or ineptitude, and their goal was to pierce that veil, to achieve <strong>gnosis</strong>.</p>

<p>Philip K. Dick had a lifelong fascination with the Gnostics, and their ideas appear constantly throughout his novels.  Nowhere is this more evident than in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Three_Stigmata_of_Palmer_Eldritch"><em>The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch</em></a>.</p>

<p>In the novel, the Earth has become uninhabitably hot, forcing everyone to take shelter in buildings or subterranean structures during the day.  People are being forcibly migrated to even more hardscrabble lives on nearby planets, which can only be escaped via Perky Pat layouts, effectively Barbie Dream Houses they can temporarily inhabit using Can-D, a drug illicitly distributed by the creators of Perky Pat.</p>

<p>Using the drug, users are transported to a single, perfect day in San Francisco, before the Earth became too hot, in the bodies of a wealthy, beautiful couple.  They can accessorize their escapism by purchasing “minned” items, which will appear full-size and functional within Perky Pat’s world.</p>

<p>This is a false gnosis, layering something simple and idealized atop the messiness of the physical world, rather than peeling it back.  False gnosis is a central theme in all of Dick’s writing, which makes him perhaps the only science-fiction author who truly anticipated our present day.  Like everyone else, he failed to predict the smartphone, but he alone seemed to understand how completely technology could intermediate our understanding of the world.<sup id="fnref:cyberspace"><a href="#fn:cyberspace">3</a></sup></p>

<p><em>Three Stigmata</em> begins with the return of Palmer Eldritch, an industrialist who had travelled to Proxima Centauri in search of new business opportunities.  He has brought with him a new drug, Chew-Z, which promises the same escape as Can-D without the need to buy any accessories.</p>

<p>Anyone taking Chew-Z can create their own world to inhabit, but every person in that world takes on aspects of Eldritch himself, sharing his prosthetic hand, eyes, and mouth.  Even as the drug seems to subside, Eldritch remains, making it impossible to know what’s real.</p>

<p>In time, it’s revealed that the returned Eldritch is not the businessman, but rather a dying demiurge who has assumed his form.  He toys with anyone who takes Chew-Z, creating escapist fantasies that prove to be every bit as flawed as their real lives.  By the end, Eldritch has begun to merge with humanity, even infecting people who never touched the drug.</p>

<p>Eldritch doesn’t offer gnosis, but neither does he offer pure escapism like Perky Pat.  He gives humanity an understanding of <em>himself</em>, of the nature of the veil over our eyes.  Even if it tells us nothing of what lays beyond, Dick seems to suggest it’s the most we can hope for.<sup id="fnref:exegesis"><a href="#fn:exegesis">4</a></sup></p>

<p>A different sort of demiurge is portrayed in Italo Calvino’s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invisible_Cities"><em>Invisible Cities</em></a>, in which Marco Polo tells Kublai Khan of all the cities he’s seen in his travels.  They sit in the Khan’s palace, at the center of an empire which has exceeded his grasp:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It is the desperate moment when we discover that this empire, which had seemed to us the sum of all wonders, is an endless, formless ruin, that corruption’s gangrene has spread too far to be healed by our scepter, that the triumph over enemy sovereigns has made us the heirs of their long undoing.  Only in Marco Polo’s accounts was Kublai Khan able to discern, through the walls and towers destined to crumble, the tracery of a pattern so subtle it could escape the termites’ gnawing.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>His descriptions of the cities, however, are narrow.  In one, he only describes a memory it evokes.  In another, he only describes the relationship between the city and its reflection in the surrounding water.  Sometimes the cities themselves are narrow; one such city has been reduced to freestanding pipes, with attached bathtubs and fountains, populated by nymphs and naiads.</p>

<p>These are pieces of cities, mixed and distilled from everything Polo has seen in his travels.  But at their core, they are facets of a city he never describes, the city he knows best, his birthplace:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>And Polo said: “Every time I describe a city I am saying something about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“When I ask you about other cities, I want to hear about them.  And about Venice, when I ask you about Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“To distinguish the other cities’ qualities, I must speak of a first city that remains implicit.  For me it is Venice.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Marco Polo is a worldly man, but he is not of the world; he is Venetian, and everything is understood and remembered through that lens.  What he has discovered, in the course of his travels, is that certain pieces of Venice are timeless.  These are what will survive the collapse of the Khan’s empire, what will constantly reoccur throughout time; always different in detail, but unmistakably the same.</p>

<p>And yet Polo, just like Eldritch, does not offer true gnosis.  Each city hides all but a tiny piece of Venice through omission and fantastic obfuscations like the nymphs and naiads.  Unlike Eldritch, however, he offers choice.  The set of cities he describes is neither minimal nor exhaustive; each can be considered or ignored in isolation.</p>

<p>These cities may obscure their underlying reality, but they don’t attempt to replace it.  Instead, they simply reveal a resonance, a commonality of experience we might otherwise have missed.</p>

<hr>

<p>The legibility described in <em>Seeing Like a State</em>, and imposed by Palmer Eldritch, is <strong>singular</strong>; It overrides our own experience, forcing us to live within the mind of its creator.  The legibility described in <em>Image of the City</em>, and offered by Marco Polo, is <strong>faceted</strong>; it complements our own experience, allowing us to apply it where we see fit.</p>

<p>Creating singular legibility is simple: find something that’s easy for you to understand, and force people to use it.  What’s hard is using it responsibly; to predict its full effect, you’d need to first have an exhaustive understanding of the environments in which it will be used.</p>

<p>Faceted legibility is more forgiving, allowing us to understand the world incrementally and collaboratively.  It’s not, however, something we can simply create on our own.  Instead, we can only lay the groundwork and hope it flourishes.</p>

<p>How do we lay the proper groundwork?  It depends on what you’re …</p></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
	
		<p>Writing in a thick notebook can be troublesome when you get close to the end of a page. If you're like most people you will encounter a zone where the palm, fingernails or wrist (which I will refer to collectively as "palm") of your writing hand have nowhere to rest, and you may find yourself trying to "float" your hand over the page. As a result, control of the pen-tip becomes enough of an effort to hamper the free-flow of thoughts from the brain through the nervous system to their final conversion to written word.</p>

<p>At best, you get your point across, but usually not without some effort, frustration, and sloppy penmanship.</p>

<p>I suppose one could simply turn to a fresh page before this becomes an issue. That would probably be ok with cheap notebooks, but if you are reading this, yours is probably not cheap, and you intend to wring out all of its value by using every bit of its space.</p>

<p>Thus, as your palm starts to drift off the bottom edge of the page, it needs somewhere to rest...two possible solutions come to mind...one is free, the other cheap:</p>

<p>1. The Smart Phone Trick (free)</p>
<p>2. The Writing Mat (cheap)</p>


<p><strong>The Smart Phone Trick</strong></p>

<p>Placing your smartphone at the bottom of the book at the right point serves as a rest for your palm. It feels like instant relief, at least compared to the alternative of doing nothing at all. It's as if your hand lost its balance at the edge of the page, and the phone is there to catch it.</p>

<p>A smart phone is also a very good thickness (about 10mm) for this purpose. At some point it will be lower than the page you are writing in, and at other points higher, but the differential will never be very great because you won't always need it.</p>

<p>A thin paperback also works well for this purpose, but it can't be too wide or long because it will use up a lot of desk space and may even dig into your forearm. And you'll have to always remember to have it on hand. So, a smartphone is nearly the perfect size....and it is very handy for many of us most of the time. It may take some trial-and-error to figure out exactly when and where you need to deploy the device, but once you do, you will once again find your thoughts freely flowing to any point on the page.</p>

<p>And, as a pen-and-paper person, you may gain some satisfaction from knowing that technology doesn't always exist just for its own sake.</p>


<p><strong>The Writing Mat</strong></p>

<p>Writing mats (sold on this site) are great for enhancing the pen-to-paper connection, and if while writing you press hard with fine points it will protect the lower pages from impressions.</p>

<p>They are also great as a lower extension of the page you are writing on. For that purpose the thin plastic mats seem to work better than the soft mats because they are stiffer and give more support to the palm. But the soft ones work fine too. As you get to that troublesome point on the page, you just keep moving the mat down as long as you need to, and it provides a gentle slope on which your palm can rest.</p>

<p>The mat should be at least the same size as the paper. It can be larger, but larger doesn't have any real advantage other than being able to work with more notebook sizes. They are also harder to carry around. But even if you have the perfect size mat, you have to remember to have it with you, so you may prefer the smart phone trick anyway.</p>


<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p>There are many folks that don't write in notebooks because of this very issue, but given these simple solutions it doesn't have to be hard at all. There is also a certain feeling of satisfaction, security and abundance when writing in a thick notebook, and anyone can deploy these or similar tactics in order to get the full experience.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><span><p>We hear a lot about APIs as financial institutions open up their services for public access, but webhooks can be just as useful for user experience in personal finance management.</p>
<p>APIs are more passive whereas webhooks are more pro-active.</p>
<p>This makes a difference from a programmatic point of view, which then affects user experience.</p>
<p>You can imagine this difference with e-mail for example.</p>
<p>Imagine a time before push notifications. Without push notification, the manifest practice is to "Check mail". Remember those quaint days when we used to push that Send/Receive button? That's API call for you.</p>
<p>While we can code applications in such a way as to check an API very often, it's not very bandwidth-compute-energy efficient.</p>
<p>Webhooks are much better. Like push notification, applications gets notified when a transaction happens and changes its state accordingly.</p>
<p>Along with the change of state, any other triggers or reactive components can then come alive, a much better pattern :)</p>

<!-- %h3 About -->
<p>"As Bitcoin surpasses previous price records and re-enters mainstream consciousness following several wilderness years, the twelve-year-old cryptocurrency appears to have “arrived” in the eyes of the market. The value proposition of an ungoverned, uncensorable digital means of value transfer is clear for all to see…but can humanity and Earth afford the thermodynamic price tag? </p>

<p>To maintain the integrity of the transaction record, the Bitcoin network creates a hard boundary to the outside through exacting validation requirements. However it does not possess any feedback mechanism or capacity to respond to the consequences of the thermoeconomic challenges it issues. This insensitivity of ‘mined’ cryptocurrencies to the energy sources used to secure them has led to criticism as to their inability to mitigate their ecological externalities."</p>

<p><em>by a literal banana</em></p>



<p>As a banana who lives among humans, I am naturally interested in humans, and in the social sciences they use to study themselves. This essay is my current response to the Thiel question: “What important truth do very few people agree with you on?” And my answer is that surveys are bullshit.</p>



<p>In the abstract, I think a lot of people would agree with me that surveys are bullshit. What I don’t think is widely known is how much “knowledge” is based on survey evidence, and what poor evidence it makes in the contexts in which it is used. The nutrition study that claims that eating hot chili peppers makes you live longer is based on surveys. The twin study about the heritability of joining a gang or carrying a gun is based on surveys of young people. The economics study claiming that long commutes reduce happiness is based on surveys, as are all studies of happiness, like the one that claims that people without a college degree are much less happy than they were in the 1970s. The study that claims that pornography is a substitute for marriage is based on surveys. That criminology statistic about domestic violence or sexual assault or drug use or the association of crime with personality factors is almost certainly based on surveys. (Violent crime studies and statistics are particularly likely to be based on extremely cursed instruments, especially the Conflict Tactics Scale, the Sexual Experiences Survey, and their descendants.) Medical studies of pain and fatigue rely on surveys. Almost every study of a psychiatric condition is based on surveys, even if an expert interviewer is taking the survey on the subject’s behalf (e.g. the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale). Many studies that purport to be about suicide are actually based on surveys of suicidal thoughts or behaviors. In the field of political science, election polls and elections themselves are surveys.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What I mean by “surveys” is standard written (or spoken) instruments, composed mostly of language, that are administered to subjects, who give responses, and whose responses are treated as quantitative information, which may then be subjected to statistical analysis. It is not the case that knowledge can never be obtained in this manner. But the idea that there exists some survey, and some survey conditions, that might plausibly produce the knowledge claimed, tends to lead to a mental process of filling in the blanks, of giving the benefit of the doubt to surveys in the ordinary case. But, I think, the ordinary survey, in its ordinary conditions, is of no evidentiary value for any important claim. Just because there exist rare conditions where survey responses tightly map to some condition measurable in other ways does not mean that the vast majority of surveys have any value.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Survey evidence seems to be a new phenomenon. Robert Groves (2011) argues that it is a 20th century phenomenon, arising in the 1930s, achieving a golden age from the 1960s to the 1990s, and then falling off in prestige and reliability after that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why is it important that surveys are new? I think it is important to remember that there is no ancestral practice equivalent to surveys. That is to say, there is no ancient human practice or context in which people anonymously tell the pure, innocent truth with language, in response to questioning, with no thought for the motives of the questioner or the effect of their answers. However, in the new, wholly invented ethnomethod of [doing a survey], it is imagined that subjects do tell the innocent truth, comprehending the underlying sense of the question but not answering with any motive or particularity of context. The anonymity of survey takers is given as proof that they feel free to tell the truth, rather than being perceived as a bar to asking them what they might have meant by their responses.</p>



<p>To get at the philosophical weirdness of the survey, it is necessary to dissect the phenomenon of survey-taking in detail. First I will consider the legal perspective, since that is an ancient domain of getting at truth through language in particular contexts.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>Surveys and Legal Evidence</strong></p>



<p>The vast majority of evidence in the legal context is and has always been testimonial. That is, a witness testifies in language to communicate some fact to the judge or jury, and the judge or jury then decides how much to believe it. This is true even for modern DNA evidence: the expert witness testifies about the alleged meaning of the laboratory findings, even if documents (also testimony of the writer or preparer) are also given to the trier of fact to examine. Good evidence and garbage evidence are both usually testimony.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the English common law tradition, the biggest rule about testimonial evidence is hearsay. To put it colloquially, the hearsay rule says that testimony has to come from the horse’s mouth. If you saw someone run a red light and crash into a fire truck, you could undergo the ritual of being put under oath (agreeing that negative legal consequences could befall you for untrue speech), and testify about what you saw in court. Then you would be subject to the further ritual of cross-examination, in which all the aspects of your testimony could be questioned: your vision, whether you had your glasses on, where you were positioned, what specifically you mean by “crashed,” your relationship with the driver, and perhaps even whether you had a past conviction for forgery, which might make you seem like a liar in general. Those responsible for deciding whether to believe your testimony would have the chance to look at your face and mannerisms while testifying, to look at your clothes and hair and grooming, to see whether your eyes are bloodshot, in order to judge your responses to questioning. This may seem superficial and unfortunate, but in conversation we make these judgments all the time. And a witness may lose credibility for appearing too slick as often as for appearing too tattered, as in ordinary life.</p>



<p>However, if you wanted to testify about what you heard <em>someone else</em> say, someone who isn’t present for ritual oath-taking and questioning, that would be hearsay, admissible only under a list of exceptions. The exceptions to the hearsay rule are generally contexts in which language evidence is considered particularly likely to be accurate and truthful, such as a record kept in the ordinary course of business, or an emotional shout just after the crash (the idea being that you wouldn’t have time to think up a lie).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Survey evidence, then, is plainly hearsay, since when we hear claims based on survey evidence, we get no opportunity to judge the credibility of the statements as we might in conversation (much less under oath). However, survey evidence is often admissible in legal proceedings, particularly under the much-abused “state of mind” exception. But I think the more common reasoning underlying admission of survey evidence is as stated by a legal scholar at the beginning of the golden age of surveys (Zeisel 1959): “[S]ince surveys provide the best, <strong>if not the only</strong>, evidence on certain issues, and since expert knowledge in the field has advanced sufficiently to protect the trier of the facts from error, the law may well lower its heavy guard” (bolded emphasis mine). In other words, survey evidence is admissible because there’s no other way to get at the underlying facts. Consider trademark confusion: how would one measure whether consumers confuse one mark with another except by asking them in some clever way? The phenomenon of confusion is hidden in the minds of consumers, and can’t be measured with calipers or rulers.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even when surveys are the only way to get at some particular knowledge, they may be done well or poorly. Zeisel (1959), citing <em>Coca-Cola v. Nehi Corp.</em>, 27 Del. Ch. 318, 326, 36 A.2d 156 (1944), says:</p>



<blockquote><p>Other aspects of an interview can also become grounds for criticism. Word association tests given to students in a classroom were rejected because their reactions were “bound to differ from that of the buyer in the market place when confronted with the.., beverage …. ” As another court remarked, “the issue is not whether the goods would be confused by a casual observer, but [rather] .. .by a prospective purchaser at the time he considered making the purchase. If the interviewee is not in a buying mood but is just in a friendly mood answering a pollster, his degree of attention is quite different.”</p></blockquote>



<p>That is to say, even though a survey might be the only way to judge the phenomenon of confusion, a college classroom was judged to be sufficiently different from shopping in a store (e.g.) to render the survey meaningless. I find this standard touchingly exacting compared to the present lax standard for taking survey evidence seriously. The present standard seems to be that the more math you do to survey data, the more reliable it is.</p>



<p>The meaning of my title is from a joke told at the end of <em>Annie Hall</em>:</p>



<blockquote><p>I thought of that old joke—you know, this guy goes to a psychiatrist and say doc, my brother’s crazy! He thinks he’s a chicken. And the doc says, why don’t you turn him in? Then the guy says, I would, but I need the eggs. I guess that’s pretty much now how I feel about relationships. They’re totally crazy, irrational, and absurd, but I guess we keep going through it because most of us need the eggs.</p></blockquote>



<p>Surveys are perhaps the only way to get certain information, information about the most important and pressing phenomena, about happiness and suffering in all its forms. These are eggs that most of us need. So even though surveys are bullshit, they are not “turned in” like the unfortunate brother in Woody Allen’s joke, but embraced in a plausibility structure whose maintenance is widespread and in which we are all complicit.</p>



<p><strong>The Phenomenon of the Survey</strong></p>



<p>To understand what’s wrong with surveys, we must alternate between critically examining survey …</p></div></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="content"><p>As we start a new decade, it’s a good time to reflect on expectations for the next 10 years. Tyler thinks the Great Stagnation <a href="https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2020/12/why-did-the-great-stagnation-end.html">could be ending</a>. Caleb sees <a href="https://www.agglomerations.tech/cracks-in-the-great-stagnation/">cracks</a>. Noah expresses <a href="https://noahpinion.substack.com/p/techno-optimism-for-the-2020s">techno-optimism</a>. In this post, my aim is not to predict an end or non-end to stagnation. Rather, it is to think through the particulars of how technology could evolve over the next decade. Then we can assess separately whether we should consider it the Roaring 20s or the Boring 20s.</p><p>What would constitute an end to the Great Stagnation? Any precise cutoff will be arbitrary, but for the sake of discussion, let’s say sustained growth in <a href="https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/indicators-data/total-factor-productivity-tfp/">utilization-adjusted total factor productivity</a> of 2 percent per year. By comparison, mean utilization-adjusted TFP growth from 1947 through 1972 was 2.1 percent. Since 2005, it has been 0.17 percent. (Note: it is important to use the utilization-adjusted series, as this corrects for the business cycle.)</p><p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/a7a8a1d9e4c4d1050c2902966a316436559074f1/cd6b6/img/tfp.png" alt="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947" title="Total factor productivity in the U.S. since 1947"></p><p>Whatever your cutoff for TFP growth, one of my convictions is that scientific breakthroughs alone are not enough to drive an end to the Great Stagnation. TFP only budges when new technologies are adopted at scale, and generally this means products, not just science. Science lays critical groundwork for new technology, but after all the science is done, much work remains. Someone must shepherd the breakthrough to the product stage, where it can actually affect TFP. This means building businesses, surmounting regulatory obstacles, and scaling production.</p><p>With that caveat firmly in mind, what will the next decade bring in terms of meaningful technological change? Here’s what I’m watching.</p><h2 id="biotech-and-health">Biotech and health</h2><p>We are coming off a huge win: two new mRNA COVID vaccines, conceived and brought to market in less than a year. The ability to encode and deploy arbitrary mRNA in our bodies sure seems like a game changer—it allows us to essentially program our cells to make whatever proteins we want. In the case of the COVID vaccines, the vaccine payload instructs our cells to make the coronavirus spike protein, which our immune system then learns to attack. Bert Hubert has a <a href="https://berthub.eu/articles/posts/reverse-engineering-source-code-of-the-biontech-pfizer-vaccine/">fascinating write-up</a> of the “code” in the vaccine.</p><p>Bringing a brand new vaccine to market in less than a year—using a never-before-applied-in-humans-at-scale technology no less—is a world record, but it could have been even faster. As David Wallace-Wells <a href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/12/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-design.html">emphasizes</a>, Moderna’s vaccine was designed by January 13. We had it the whole time. Some delay was necessary to determine effective dosing. Some further regulatory delay may have been warranted to ensure the vaccine was safe and to ascertain its efficacy. But as Wallace-Wells indicates, the regulatory outcome was never really in doubt. “None of the scientists I spoke to for this story were at all surprised by either outcome,” he writes. “All said they expected the vaccines were safe and effective all along.”</p><p>What should we make of the fact that all of the scientists knew all along that Moderna’s vaccine would work? The question in my mind is: what other mRNA treatments do we have the whole time? What if I told you Moderna has an <a href="https://www.poz.com/article/experimental-hiv-vaccine-stimulates-production-neutralizing-antibodies">HIV vaccine candidate</a>? HIV lacks SARS-CoV-2’s telltale spike protein and thus may prove a more challenging foe—but don’t you wonder, if we treated the problem with real urgency, whether new mRNA technology could wipe out the AIDS epidemic this decade? I do.</p><p>And mRNA technology can be deployed against more than just viruses. Both Moderna and BioNTech have personalized vaccine candidates targeting cancer. Although called a “cancer vaccine,” the treatment is only administered once the subject has cancer—it isn’t preventative. The companies use an algorithm to analyze the genetic sequences of the tumor and the patient’s healthy cells and predict which molecules could be used to generate a strong immune response against the cancer. “I was actually witnessing the cancer cells shrinking before my eyes,” <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03072-8">said</a> Brad Kremer, a melanoma patient who received the BioNTech treatment. So let’s milk mRNA technology for all it’s worth this decade. It can save us from more than just a pandemic.</p><p>What about CRISPR? It is a great example of a technology that has not yet made a meaningful economic contribution. Although the technique for editing DNA was discovered in 2012—and a Nobel Prize was awarded to its two discoverers this year—no treatment using CRISPR has been approved outside of clinical trials. So far, its impact has been limited to making researchers more productive—not a bad thing, to be sure, but not close to CRISPR’s full potential. As trials progress, however, I do think some CRISPR treatments will come online in the next few years, especially those targeting genetic disorders that we have very limited means of otherwise treating.</p><p>DeepMind’s <a href="https://medium.com/cgo-benchmark/deepminds-protein-folding-solution-what-just-happened-279d32e8d0f">protein-folding breakthrough</a> signals a promising decade for the science of proteomics. Most directly, being able to predict protein shapes will enable us to discover drugs more rapidly. Buuuut, because drug trials take many years, we might expect this technology not to really be felt by the general public until the 2030s.</p><p>What DeepMind’s achievement indicates to me the most is that machine learning is actually useful. This might seem obvious, but consider: most applications of machine learning so far—excluding autonomous vehicles, which have themselves not really arrived yet—are toys. I love watching AlphaZero crush Stockfish on YouTube, but chess is literally a game. GPT-3 produced some fun demos. AlphaFold heralds something different—non-toy superhuman performance is now here, and I am interested to see what else it can do. Aside from the aforementioned AVs, I expect it to be applied widely in other areas of biology. Again, it will take a long time for the breakthroughs to trickle down into products, but at least the 2030s should be sick. I mean, not sick. Healthy.</p><p>Let’s talk about life extension, one of my favorite biotech topics. 2020 was a big year for the Conboy Lab at Berkeley, which proved that all the weird past findings about “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parabiosis">young blood</a>” extending life were not actually due to any elixir in the blood of children (thank goodness). Rather, the rejuvenating aspects of young blood experiments were due to the dilution of harmful factors in old blood. By mechanically removing plasma and replacing it with saline and enough albumin to replace what was taken out, they diluted aged blood factors in both mice and humans and were able to <a href="https://www.aging-us.com/article/103418/text#fulltext">rejuvenate germ layer tissues</a> and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-020-00297-8">improve cognition by reducing neuroinflammation</a>.</p><p>These findings are exciting not only because they represent a scientific advance in understanding aging, but also because they herald the first real anti-aging product that could come to market. Therapeutic plasma exchange is FDA-approved (not for aging, but for a bunch of other conditions). I imagine there remain prohibitions on advertising that it can add years to your life, but it is safe, and a doctor can prescribe it off label. It’s also cheap. An automated plasmapheresis machine—which lets you do treatment after treatment—can be bought online for under $3,000. That is less than the cost of a single transfusion of young blood sold by the startup <a href="https://www.ambrosiaplasma.com/">Ambrosia</a>. How long until someone opens a clinic offering plasma dilution? I bet someone tries it in 2021. If it works, people will get over the weirdness, and it could be commonplace by 2030.</p><p>Another longevity product that is about to get hot: aging clocks based on DNA methylation or proteomics. Do you want to know how biologically old you are? Today, for a few hundred dollars, you can get a test that will tell you. As these tests become better and cheaper, self-experimenters are going to have a field day. Doing before-and-after aging tests, anyone who can get their hands on human growth hormone could replicate the protocol used by <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13028">Fahy et al.</a> to rejuvenate the thymus. As the thymus is a critical element of the immune system, decline of which is a critical factor in aging, this is non-trivial rejuvenation. The Fahy study found that 12 months of treatment created about 2.5 years of epigenetic rejuvenation, with results accelerating in the last quarter of the trial.</p><p>There is a lot more in the <a href="https://www.lifespan.io/road-maps/the-rejuvenation-roadmap/">Rejuvenation Roadmap</a>—dozens of possible life-extending treatments are at various stages of development. There’s a good chance a few senolytic drugs will be approved by the end of the decade. As I noted <a href="https://fortune.com/2020/12/30/anti-aging-research-health-care-spending-biden/">yesterday at Fortune</a>, we spend less than 1% of the NIH budget on aging biology—we should raise that by a lot.</p><p>Unlike others, I am not-so-bullish on metformin. It does seem to reduce all-cause mortality in Americans, but it may do so because <a href="https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/10.1089/met.2018.0105">88% of Americans are metabolically unhealthy</a>. If you are one of the 12%, and you should strive to be, I don’t think metformin will do much for you.</p><p>One final biotech observation: every year, the Apple Watch gets a new health-related sensor. This year it was blood oxygen, pretty good for detecting if you might have COVID! Fast forward to 2030 and wearables will have at least 10 more health-related sensors than they do today. Some no-brainers are body temperature, blood pressure, and blood glucose sensors. What will the other 7 be? At some point, it becomes possible to replace a lot of primary care with continuous monitoring. A few smart algorithms to provide simple medical advice could improve population-level health without much cost. More data could also yield faster, more accurate, and of course more remote diagnoses when you do have to see a doctor.</p><p>There is a lot in biotech that is promising right now, but in more than any other field, it is important not to be seduced by the sexy headlines showing rapid scientific progress. Don’t get complacent. Biology is proceeding faster than medical productivity because a lot of the wonderful discoveries are not being translated into approved treatments and products at a decent rate. Let’s salute and cheer for the discoveries, but spare many thoughts for the entrepreneurs trying to bring treatments to market.</p><h2 id="energy">Energy</h2><p>The 2010s were the …</p></article></div>

            <h3>Controls</h3>
            <p>
                Use the arrow keys to move left and right. Press down to soft
                drop. Use Z and X to rotate. Press enter to pause/unpause. Press
                escape to quick reset.
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Pieces</h3>
            <p>
                There are 7 pieces total. There are 6 pieces made out of every
                possible configuration of 3 triangles, and 1 piece made out of a
                single triangle, which will always spawn in groups of 3.
                <img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/allPieces.png">
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Mechanics</h3>
            <p>
                The mechanics are very similar to NES Tetris. It uses the same
                DAS, entry delay, and level speed timings.<br>
                All of the pieces are made out of 3 connected right triangles.
                There is also a white, single triangle piece which can be used
                to fix holes in your stack. It will always come out 3 at a time.
                The single triangle is also special, lines will only be cleared
                once they have all been placed. This allows you to fill 3 lines
                to score a Tritris!
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h3>Phasing</h3>
            <p>
                <b>IMPORTANT - Since the release of the Youtube video, phasing
                    has become easier. There are no longer any frame-perfect
                    tricks. Instead, all phases can be performed by holding each
                    key (rotate can now be held to become "charged").</b>
                <br>
                One of the most unique mechanics of Tritris is phasing. A piece
                will always move to the next location as long as the next
                location is valid (no intersecting triangles). By moving a piece
                in multiple ways at the same time, pieces are able to do many
                types of tucks and spins. Below are a few examples.
            </p>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/down.gif"></p><p>
                        The pieces are able to easily move down into an empty
                        space.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/downRotate.gif"></p><p>
                        For the bottom right triangle, X (rotate) is held once
                        above the desired position.
                        <b>Due to the phasing update, down does not need to be pressed.</b>
                        Once all 3 triangles are placed, the line clears.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/downMove.gif"></p><p>
                        Left or right are held when the piece is above the
                        desired position, and when the piece moves down, it also
                        moves horizontally.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/multiple.gif"></p><p>Here are a few examples of some phases!</p>
                </div>
            </div>
            <br>
            <hr>

            <h3>Scoring</h3>
            <div>
                <div>
                    <p><img src="https://goel25.github.io/tritris/assets/tritris.gif"></p><p>A Tritris is scored!</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In Tritris, clearing 4 lines at a time is not possible, so
                    the highest score value is obtained from 3 lines at a time,
                    a Tritris. This can only be achieved by settings up 3 rows,
                    each missing only one triangle, then placing a single
                    triangle in each row. Once all triangles are placed, the
                    rows clear and a Tritris is scored!
                    <br>
                    A triple is equivalent to a Tetris in NES Tetris, a double
                    is equivalent to a triple, and a single is equivalent to a
                    double.
                </p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s still magic even if you know how it’s done.</p>
<p>— Terry Pratchett</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Software is now as essential to research as telescopes, test tubes, and reference libraries.
This means that researchers <em>need</em> to know how to build, check, use, and share programs.
However,
most introductions to programming focus on developing commercial applications,
not on exploring problems whose answers aren’t yet known.
Our goal is to show you how to do that,
both on your own and as part of a team.</p>
<p>We believe every researcher should know
how to write short programs that clean and analyze data in a reproducible way
and how to use version control to keep track of what they have done.
But just as some astronomers spend their careers designing telescopes,
some researchers focus on building the software that makes research possible.
People who do this are called <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#rse">research software engineers</a>;
the aim of this book is to get you ready for this role by helping you go from
writing code for yourself to creating tools that help your entire field advance.</p>
<div id="intro-big-picture">
<h2> The Big Picture</h2>
<p>Our approach to research software engineering is based on three related concepts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#open_science">Open science</a>: Making data, methods, and results
freely available to all by publishing them under <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#open_license">open
licenses</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#reproducible_research">Reproducible research</a>: Ensuring that anyone
with access to the data and software can feasibly reproduce results, both to
check them and to build on them.</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#sustainable_software">Sustainable software</a>: The ease with which to
maintain and extend it rather than to replace it. Sustainability isn’t
just a property of the software: it also depends on the skills and culture
of its users.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>People often conflate these three ideas,
but they are distinct.
For example,
if you share your data and the programs that analyze it,
but don’t document what steps to take in what order,
your work is open but not reproducible.
Conversely,
if you completely automate your analysis,
but your data is only available to people in your lab,
your work is reproducible but not open.
Finally,
if a software package is being maintained by a couple of post-docs
who are being paid a fraction of what they could earn in industry
and have no realistic hope of promotion because their field doesn’t value tool building,
then sooner or later it will become <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#abandonware">abandonware</a>,
at which point openness and reproducibility become less relevant.</p>
<p>Nobody argues that research should be irreproducible or unsustainable,
but “not against it” and actively supporting it are very different things.
Academia doesn’t yet know how to reward people for writing useful software,
so while you may be thanked,
the effort you put in may not translate into academic job security or decent pay.</p>
<p>Some people worry that if they make their data and code publicly available,
someone else will use it and publish a result they could have come up with themselves.
This is almost unheard of in practice,
but that doesn’t stop it being used as a scare tactic.
Other people are afraid of looking foolish or incompetent by sharing code that might contain bugs.
This isn’t just <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/glossary.html#impostor_syndrome">impostor syndrome</a>:
members of marginalized groups are frequently judged more harshly than others,
so being wrong in public is much riskier for them.</p>
<p>With this course, we hope to give researchers the tools and knowledge to be
better research software developers, to be more efficient in their work, make
less mistakes, and work more openly and reproducibly.
We hope that by having more researchers with these skills and knowledge,
research culture can improve to address the issues raised above.</p>
</div>
<div id="intro-personas">
<h2> Intended Audience</h2>
<p>This book is written for researchers who are already using Python for their data analysis,
but who want to take their coding and software development to the next level.
You don’t have to be highly proficient with Python,
but you should already be comfortable doing things like reading data from files
and writing loops, conditionals, and functions.
The following personas are examples of the types of people
that are our target audience.</p>
<dl>
<dt>Amira Khan</dt>
<dd>completed a master’s in library science five years ago
and has since worked for a small aid organization.
She did some statistics during her degree,
and has learned some R and Python by doing data science courses online,
but has no formal training in programming.
Amira would like to tidy up the scripts, data sets, and reports she has created
in order to share them with her colleagues.
These lessons will show her how to do this.
</dd>
<dt>Jun Hsu</dt>
<dd>completed an <a href="https://www.insightdatascience.com/">Insight Data Science</a> fellowship last year after doing a PhD in Geology
and now works for a company that does forensic audits.
He uses a variety of machine learning and visualization packages,
and would now like to turn some of his own work into an open source project.
This book will show him how such a project should be organized
and how to encourage people to contribute to it.
</dd>
<dt>Sami Virtanen</dt>
<dd>became a competent programmer during a bachelor’s degree in applied math
and was then hired by the university’s research computing center.
The kinds of applications they are being asked to support
have shifted from fluid dynamics to data analysis;
this guide will teach them how to build and run data pipelines
so that they can pass those skills on to their users.
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div id="intro-syllabus">
<h2> What You Will Learn</h2>
<p>Rather than simply providing reference material about good coding practices,
the book follows Amira and Sami as they work together to write an actual software package
to address a real research question.
The data analysis task that we focus on
relates to a fascinating result in the field of quantitative linguistics.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf’s Law</a> states that the second most common word in a body of text
appears half as often as the most common,
the third most common appears a third as often, and so on.
To test whether Zipf’s Law holds for a collection of classic novels
that are freely available from <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/">Project Gutenberg</a>,
we write a software package that counts and analyzes the word frequency distribution
in any arbitrary body of text.</p>
<p>In the process of writing and publishing a Python package to verify Zipf’s Law,
we will show you how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Organize small and medium-sized data science projects.</li>
<li>Use the Unix shell to efficiently manage your data and code.</li>
<li>Write Python programs that can be used on the command line.</li>
<li>Use Git and GitHub to track and share your work.</li>
<li>Work productively in a small team where everyone is welcome.</li>
<li>Use Make to automate complex workflows.</li>
<li>Enable users to configure your software without modifying it directly.</li>
<li>Test your software and know which parts have not yet been tested.</li>
<li>Find, handle, and fix errors in your code.</li>
<li>Publish your code and research in open and reproducible ways.</li>
<li>Create Python packages that can be installed in standard ways.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="intro-using">
<h2> Using this Book</h2>
<p>This book was written to be used as the material for a (potentially) semester
long course at the university level,
although it can also be used for independent self-study.
Participatory live-coding is the anticipated style for teaching the material,
rather than lectures simply talking about the code presented <span>(Brown and Wilson <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/references.html#ref-Brow2018" role="doc-biblioref">2018</a>; Wilson <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/references.html#ref-Wils2018" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a><a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/references.html#ref-Wils2018" role="doc-biblioref">a</a>)</span>.
The chapters and their content are generally designed to be used in the order
given.</p>
<p>Chapters are structured with the introduction at the start, content in the middle,
and exercises at the end. Callout boxes are interspersed throughout the content
to be used as a supplement to the main text,
but not a requirement for the course overall.
Early chapters have many small exercises;
later chapters have fewer but larger exercises.
In order to break up long periods of live-coding while teaching,
it may be preferable to stop and complete some of the exercises
at key points throughout the chapter,
rather than waiting until the end.
Possible exercise solutions are provided (Appendix&nbsp;<a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/solutions.html#solutions">A</a>),
in addition to learning objectives (Appendix <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/objectives.html#objectives">B</a>)
and key points (Appendix <a href="https://merely-useful.github.io/py-rse/keypoints.html#keypoints">C</a>) for each chapter.</p>

				<p>Recently I have been spending time on improving the performance of <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a> (my encrypted backup tool), and wanted to compare it to some existing tools to try and find its relative performance in the backup tool landscape.</p>
<p>This post compares <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/bupstash">bupstash</a>, <a href="https://restic.net/">restic</a>, <a href="https://www.borgbackup.org/">borg backup</a> and plain old tar + gzip + GPG across a series of simple benchmarks.</p>
<p>What do all these tools have in common?</p>
<ul>
<li>They encrypt data at rest.</li>
<li>They compress data.</li>
<li>They have some form of incremental and/or deduplicated snapshotting.</li>
<li>They are all pretty great backup systems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to checkout the project websites to learn more, let’s get to the benchmarks.</p>
<h2 id="benchmarks">Benchmarks</h2>
<p>For these tests we are using the following versions of the given software:</p>
<ul>
<li>GNU tar 1.32 + gzip 1.10 + GPG 2.2.23</li>
<li>Bupstash 0.6.1</li>
<li>Borg 1.1.14</li>
<li>Restic 0.11.0</li>
</ul>
<p>The test machine has an AMD Ryzen Threadripper 1950X 16-Core Processor with 16 GB of ram, and an NVMe SSD hard drive. It is probably best to simply compare results relatively, as reproducing my test environment exactly would be difficult.</p>
<p>The scripts I used for my benchmarking can be found <a href="https://github.com/andrewchambers/EncryptedBackupShootout">here</a>, though they will definitely need tweaking for your environment.</p>
<h3 id="deduplication-and-compression">Deduplication and compression</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we take 20 different consecutive versions of the linux kernel source code and add them all to the same directory, we then create a snapshot and measure the size of the resulting tarball/repository.</p>
<p>The linux kernel versions chosen for this test are all the consecutive git commits preceeding version 5.9, with the resulting directory containing 21 GB of uncompressed files.</p>

<p>This benchmark shows the advantage the more sophisticated tools have over plain tarballs, they all have extremely good compression ratios when similar data is added multiple times to
a backup repository.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-fresh-directory-snapshot">Creating a fresh directory snapshot</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we are snapshotting a copy of the linux
5.9.8 source code.</p>
<p>The directory we are snapshotting is 1.1 GB comprised of 74725 files and directories.</p>
<p>The snapshots are all made to tmpfs so hopefully does not measure delays introduced by the network or disk activity.</p>

<p>Bupstash is the clear winner here for raw snapshotting speed.</p>
<h3 id="sending-a-fresh-snapshot-to-a-remote-server">Sending a fresh snapshot to a remote server</h3>
<p>This benchmark is the same as the fresh local snapshot benchmark except the files are sent to a remote server hosted on google cloud via ssh. This benchmark should only be considered an approximation of the effect latency has on the tool performance as it is so dependent on network speeds.</p>
<p>At the time of benchmarking my connection to the remote server can be summarized as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>server -&gt; client 10MiB/s</li>
<li>client -&gt; client 2.5MiB/s</li>
<li>ping 32 milliseconds</li>

<p>Plain tar takes the win, Restic performs poorly here, it has a far more latency-sensitive upload protocol.</p>
<h3 id="creating-an-incremental-directory-snapshot">Creating an incremental directory snapshot</h3>
<p>This benchmark is the same as the fresh local snapshot benchmark, except now we measure the time for an incremental snapshot using the builtin caching mechanism of the tools. What this means is each tool keeps a record of what files it has already sent, and is able to
skip doing that work again.</p>

</details>
<p>Incremental tar is the clear winner here, but why are the other tools slower? I think this is mainly because the other tools present each snapshot to the user as a full backup and thus do extra work to spare the end user from managing incremental backups manually.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to me that <code>bupstash put</code> is an order of magnitude faster than the other similar tools, though I currently can not explain clearly why that may be the case.</p>
<h3 id="sending-an-incremental-snapshot-to-a-remote-server">Sending an incremental snapshot to a remote server</h3>

<p>These results match closely with the local incremental snapshots.</p>
<h3 id="restoring-a-snapshot">Restoring a snapshot</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will restore the snapshot made in the fresh local snapshot benchmark to tmpfs. This is what measuring what happens when you need to do a bulk disaster recovery from your backup repository.</p>

<h3 id="restoring-a-snapshot-from-a-remote-server">Restoring a snapshot from a remote server</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will restore the snapshot made in the fresh remote snapshot benchmark to tmpfs. The main difference from the previous benchmark is the introduction of
an internet connection between the backup repository and restore point.</p>
<p>Network conditions are the same as the fresh network snapshot benchmark.</p>

</details>
<p>Interestingly, the introduction of the network pushed tar ahead of bupstash for backup restoration - this is something I am very interested in investigating further.</p>
<h3 id="pruning-an-old-backup">Pruning an old backup</h3>
<p>In this benchmark we will be removing an old snapshot from the backup repository on the same computer. For this test we generate a backup repository with 50 different snapshots of different versions of the linux kernel source code and then time how long it takes to remove one of the snapshots. This benchmark simulates
cycling old backups out of your backup repository when you no longer need them.</p>
<p>Tar with incremental backups does not easily support pruning of old backups, so does not participate in this benchmark.</p>

<p>The bupstash garbage collector is an order of magnitue faster than both restic and borg at pruning the backup repository.</p>
<h3 id="pruning-an-old-backup-on-a-remote-server">Pruning an old backup on a remote server</h3>

<p>Once again restic suffers the worst from introduced network latency of all the tools.</p>
<h3 id="approximate-peak-client-side-ram-usage">Approximate peak client side ram usage</h3>
<p>For this benchmark we repeat the fresh snapshot benchmark, but measure the peak client ram usage (RSS) as reported by the ‘time’ command. For tar we approximate this by summing the peak memory usage across tar, gpg and gzip.</p>

<p>Bupstash is very memory-efficient compared to restic and borg, but ultimately loses out to the simplicity of tar + gzip + GPG.</p>
<h2 id="conclusions-and-discussion">Conclusions and discussion</h2>
<p>GNU Tar + gzip + gpg is an excellent encrypted backup option and performed better than I expected. I think tar and gpg is still a great choice for users who prefer to DIY their own backup scripts. With this in mind, we must ask what are the problems with tar that the other tools address? My opinion is that managing
incremental backups, deduplication, pruning, and searching backups are far more difficult when using incremental tar compared to borg/restic/bupstash. With incremental tar, it quickly becomes quite hard to track which incremental
tarballs depend on eachother and you often need to periodically do full snapshots - losing most of the speed benefits.</p>
<p>As the biased author of bupstash, I am also pleased with how it has performed and hope I can push it further in the future. Restic, while fast at local operation, seems to trail the other tools when network latency is thrown into the mix. Borg is an all-around great tool and performed very well.</p>
<p>I can see both strengths and room for improvement in each of the tools tested, and encourage everyone to give them a try for yourself if you haven’t already.</p>
<p>As always, thank you for your time and see you next time :).</p>

								<p>Many of the greatest horrors of the history of humanity owe their occurrence solely to the establishment and social enforcement of a false reality. With gratitude to the Catholic philosopher Josef Pieper and his important 1970 essay “Abuse of Language, Abuse of Power” for the term and idea, we can refer to these alternative realities as ideological <em>pseudo-realities</em>.</p>
<p>Pseudo-realities, being false and unreal, will always generate tragedy and evil on a scale that is at least proportional to the reach of their grip on power—which is their chief interest—whether social, cultural, economic, political, or (particularly) a combination of several or all of these. So important to the development and tragedies of societies are these pseudo-realities when they arise and take root that it is worth outlining their basic properties and structure so that they can be identified and properly resisted before they result in sociopolitical calamities—up to and including war, genocide, and even civilizational collapse, all of which can take many millions of lives and can ruin many millions more in the vain pursuit of a fiction whose believers are, or are made, sufficiently intolerant.</p>
<h3 id="the-nature-of-pseudo-realities">The Nature of Pseudo-realities</h3>
<p>Pseudo-realities are, simply put, false constructions of reality. It is hopefully obvious that among the features of pseudo-realities is that they must present a plausible but deliberately wrong understanding of reality. They are cult “realities” in the sense that they are the way that members of cults experience and interpret the world—both social and material—around them. We should immediately recognize that these deliberately incorrect interpretations of reality serve two related functions. First, they are meant to mold the world to accommodate small proportions of people who suffer pathological limitations on their abilities to cope with reality as it is. Second, they are designed to replace all other analyses and motivations with power, which these essentially or functionally psychopathic individuals will contort and deform to their permanent advantage so long as their pseudo-real regime can last.</p>
<p>Pseudo-realities are always social fictions, which, in light of the above, means political fictions. That is, they are maintained not because they are true, in the sense that they correspond to reality, either material or human, but because a sufficient quantity of people in the society they attack either believe them or refuse to challenge them. This implies that pseudo-realities are<em> linguistic phenomena</em> above all else, and where power-granting linguistic distortions are present, it is likely that they are there to create and prop up some pseudo-reality. This also means that they require power, coercion, manipulation, and eventually force to keep them in place. Thus, they are the natural playground of psychopaths, and they are enabled by cowards and rationalizers. Most importantly, pseudo-realities do not attempt to describe reality as it is but rather as it “should be,” as determined by the relatively small fraction of the population who cannot bear living in reality unless it is bent to enable their own psychopathologies, which will be projected upon their enemies, which means all normal people.</p>
<p>Normal people do not accept pseudo-reality and interpret reality more or less accurately, granting the usual biases and limitations of human perspective. Their common heuristic is called<em> common sense</em>, though much more refined forms exist in the uncorrupted sciences. In reality, both of these are handmaidens of power, but in pseudo-realities, this is inverted. In pseudo-reality, common sense is denigrated as bias or some kind of false consciousness, and science is replaced by a scientism that is a tool of power itself. For all his faults and the faults of his philosophy (which enable much ideological pseudo-reality), Michel Foucault warned us about this abuse quite cogently, especially under the labels “biopower” and “biopolitics.” These accusations of bias and false consciousness are, of course, projections of the ideological pseudo-realist, who, by sheer force of rhetoric, transforms limitations on power into applications of power and thus his own applications of power into liberation from it. Foucault, for any insight he provided, is also guilty of this charge.</p>
<p>It must be observed that people who accept pseudo-realities as though they are “real” are no longer normal people. They perceive pseudo-reality in place of reality, and the more thoroughly they take on this delusional position, the more functional psychopathy they necessarily exhibit and thus the less normal they become. Importantly, normal people consistently and consequentially fail to realize this about their reprogrammed neighbors. Perceiving them as normal people when they are not, normal people will reliably misunderstand the motivations of ideological pseudo-realists—power and the universal installation of their own ideology so that everyone lives in a pseudo-reality that enables their pathologies—usually until it is far too late.</p>
<p>As a result of this failure of perspective, many particularly epistemically and morally open normal people will reinterpret the claims of pseudo-reality into something that is plausible in reality under the usual logic and morals that guide our thinking, and this reinterpretation will work to the benefit of the pseudo-realists who have ensnared them. This sort of person, who stands between the real world and the pseudo-real are useful idiots to the ideology, and their role is to generate copious amounts of epistemic and ethical camouflage for the pseudo-realists. This phenomenon is key to the success, spread, and acceptance of pseudo-realities because without it very few people outside of small psychologically, emotionally, or spiritually unwell people would accept a pseudo-reality as if it is a superior characterization of the genuine article. Clearly, the more plausible the account of pseudo-reality on offer, the stronger this effect will be, and the more power the ideologues who believe in it will be able to accrue.</p>
<p>Pseudo-realities may have any degree of plausibility in their distorted descriptions of reality, and thus may recruit different numbers of adherents. They are often said to be accessible only by applying a “theoretical lens,” awakening a specialized “consciousness,” or by means of some pathological form of faith. Whether by “lens,” “consciousness,” or “faith,” these intellectual constructs exist to make the pseudo-reality seem more plausible, to drag people into participating in it against their will, and to distinguish those who “can see,” “are awake,” or “believe” from those who cannot or, as it always eventually goes, <em>will not</em>. That is, they are the pretext to tell people who inhabit reality instead of pseudo-reality that they’re not looking at “reality” correctly, which means as pseudo-reality. This will typically be characterized as a kind of<em> willful ignorance</em> of the pseudo-reality, which will subsequently be described paradoxically as unconsciously maintained. Notice that this puts the burden of epistemic and moral responsibility on the person inhabiting reality, not the person positing its replacement with an absurd pseudo-reality. This is a key functional manipulation of pseudo-realists that must be understood. The ability to recognize this phenomenon when it occurs and to resist it is, at scale, the life and death of civilizations.</p>
<p>Adoption of a pseudo-reality tends to hinge upon a lack of ability or will to question, doubt, and reject them and their fundamental presuppositions and premises of the pseudo-reality. Therefore, the “logical” and “moral” systems that operate within the pseudo-reality will always seek to manufacture this failure wherever they can, and successful pseudo-realist attacks will evolve these features like a social virus until their effectiveness is very high. This deficiency is often the direct result of mental illness, usually paranoia, schizoidia, anxiety, or psychopathy, however, so maintaining and manufacturing these states in themselves and normal people is strongly incentivized by the false “logic” and false “morality” of the ideological pseudo-reality. That is, the methods and means applied in service to a pseudo-reality will create and manipulate psychological weaknesses in people to get them to carry water for a destructive lie. The nicer, more tolerant, and more charitable a community is, supposing it lacks the capacity to spot these counterfeits early on, the more susceptible its members will tend to be to these manipulations.</p>
<h3 id="pseudo-realities-and-power">Pseudo-realities and Power</h3>
<p>The ultimate purpose of creating a pseudo-reality is power, which the constructed pseudo-reality grants in many ways. Though these means are many, we should name a few. First, the pseudo-reality is always constructed such that it structurally advantages those who accept it over those who do not, frequently by overt double standards and through moral-linguistic traps. Double standards in this regard will always favor those who accept pseudo-reality as reality and will always disfavor those who seek the truth. An ideological pseudo-reality must displace reality in a sufficient population to grant itself power to succeed in its goals. Linguistic traps will often employ strategic double meanings of words, often by strategic redefinition (creating a <em>motte and bailey</em>), will beg the question in ways that forces people to participate in the pseudo-reality to respond (often by <em>Aufhebung</em>-style, i.e., Hegelian, dialectical traps), or will begin with an assumption of guilt and demand proof of innocence such that denial or resistance is taken as proof of guilt of some moral crime against the moral system that serves the pseudo-reality (a <em>kafkatrap</em>). Demands will be made with sufficient …</p></section></div></div></article></main></div></div></div></div></div></div></div>

    <p>The blog post <a href="https://fasterthanli.me/articles/i-want-off-mr-golangs-wild-ride">“I want off Mr. Golang’s Wild Ride”</a> by Amos incited
me to write a comment on its <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25616593">HN</a> submission page. But as the comment ran 5
paragraphs long, I have turned it into this blog post.</p>

<p>It is a well written and in-depth look at the rot inside the Golang ecosystem.
Make sure to read to the end and notice that the rot started at the core
contributors level.</p>

<p>Golang’s tagline, from their <a href="https://github.com/golang/go">repository</a>, is “Go is an open source
programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient
software.”</p>

<p>Reading this post by Amos should make it clear to you that Golang has succeeded
ONLY in the “simple” part of the claim; unless written with extreme care,
programs written in Golang are neither reliable, nor efficient.</p>

<p>Amos presents some examples of why I have disliked Golang since the beginning.
After having used Golang for a few years seriously, I disliked it enough to
start a fork of the language named <a href="https://github.com/gurjeet/gofy/tree/gofy">GoFY</a>. I named the language as such
because, since the beginning when I saw some of initial presentations by Rob
Pike specifically, and some others’ presentations and blog posts generally, they
had an air of ego when dismissing others’ opinions and concerns, and appeared to
say “these are our decisions, that is how it is, and if you don’t like it, Go
F*** Yourself”. So the project name was a GoFY to them back, from me.</p>

<p>I’m sure it looks a great language from afar, and for newcomers. But as a
seasoned developer who has seen a few other languages in thier lifetime, you
will quickly begin to see the problems with the language and the ecosystem
around it.  The astute among you may notice that in my <a href="https://gurjeet.singh.im/blog/persistence-perseverance">post yesterday</a> I
did not claim to be an expert in Golang; it’s hard to be an expert in something
that’s fragile, flaky and full of special cases. For the same reason I
never took up using MySQL; I have heard enough stories of its flakiness and
special cases that it never looked like a solid technology to me. I openly and
whole-heartedly recommend learning and using <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/">Postgres</a> to anyone who would
listen.</p>

<p>Fortunately I did not invest any more time in it other than to document a few
times in section <a href="https://github.com/gurjeet/gofy/tree/gofy#gofy-desired-differences">“GoFY Desired Differences”</a> as to what I would
like to see different in the GoFY language, which in turn would make it better
than Golang, at least for long-time systems developers like myself. I am glad I
didn’t burn any oil on it because creating a new language, even a fork, is
neither easy nor quick.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
<p>In the modern nation state, courts ("justice") operate with the threat of violence. The exact way a dispute is settled varies (jury, single judge, etc.), but the "finality" of the resolution they provide is based on the fact that the state asserts the final say, and if you don't agree, it doesn't matter, because they have men with guns. Importantly, they don't just have <em>some</em> men with guns (that's something <em>you</em> might have, too), they have an overwhelming number of men and increasingly large guns depending on how much you don't want to accept their say.</p>
<p>If you are thinking "that's a stupidly over-simplified way of thinking about modern justice systems", then that's fine; a lot of what follows is precisely about the <em>finesse</em> around this simplified view of the world.</p>
<h3>The threat is stronger than its execution</h3>
<p>This aphorism comes from the world of chess (as far as I gather); it's somehow both obvious but also subtle at the same time.
Forgive the sidetrack, but it reminds me of the possible originator of this phrase, a controversial figure in the history of chess - Aron Nimzowitsch. One (apocryphal?) <a href="http://www.caissa.com/ext/bulletin/ms/tlda0000/fms1221935698008892000004-%22Why-must-I-lose-to-this-IDIOT-%22">story</a> of him features him pointing at his grandmaster opponent and loudly proclaiming "Why must I lose to this idiot?!". But to the matter in hand - Nimzowitsch wrote one of the most famous early-ish treatises on chess strategy called "My System".</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/aronsystem.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>in this book he popularised (amongst many other less controversial things) the idea of <strong>overprotection</strong> - so for example, you have a pawn on square e5, and he considered it good strategy to protect it with a knight on f3, a rook on e1 and a bishop on g3 etc. etc. Many players - indeed top grandmasters - today find this idea faintly ridiculous. What interests me is that when they deride the idea they essentially never give credence to the element of truth it surely contains, which is this: if N &gt; 1 pieces protect a key square, it means that <em>any</em> of them can move without losing protection of that square. In other words the <em>potential</em> for <em>any</em> piece to move is preserved (contrasted with a single protector, which is therefore bound and cannot move away from protection).</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/overprotection.png" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>The idea behind the phrase "the threat is stronger than its execution" - which sounds paradoxical at first - is similar. Potentiality is more difficult for the adversary to handle than actuality, mostly because the adversary may have to handle many potential actions, rather than the one that is actualised.</p>
<p>This can manifest psychologically - inducing <em>fear</em> in an enemy is often a very excellent strategy, rather than directly attacking them. But it's important to understand that it's not just mind games. It's a matter of economy, and a matter of abstraction. Just like in the development of quantitative disciplines (all the way from early mathematics to modern computer programming, and much modern science), the development of abstractions allows for economy, which maximally leverages resources, and even open up whole new dimensions that were previously inaccessible.</p>
<h3>The virtualization of violence</h3>
<p>This line of thinking naturally leads us to how violence as a concrete actualization of will tends to get abstracted away. This is seen across nature, <em>not</em> only in human societies. It's well understood how access to mating in social animals (various types of mammals) is "arbitrated" through combat, and importantly, the combat is rarely to-the-death. Even more strikingly, the "combat" is reduced to competition over attributes <em>which might allow for better success in combat</em>. The obvious example is the stag's antlers:</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/antlers1.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>That's a lot of physical raw material, requiring a lot of nutrition, and with unclear direct utility (very inefficient!). These are only a quasi-abstraction from real horns designed to kill - they <em>can</em> kill other stags, but apparently it's very rare, but they have evolved to be very visually assessable by other stags, and their complex geometry allows for battles ("horns locked") which are more of an assessment of the ability to kill, than an attempt to do so. There are of course many further examples that are more obviously abstractions. Further, displays may not be of attributes designed to inflict violence, but attributes that display high levels of general fitness, which itself is an abstraction from "ability to gather a lot of resources". The peacock being the most famous visually striking example, albeit the exact mechanisms involved may not be a matter of settled science.</p>
<p>i<img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/peacock.jpg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>I will leave the biologists to extend this list further with more obscure examples...</p>
<p>A rather interesting summary of one perspective on these phenomena is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handicap_principle">the handicap principle</a> (which somehow I had not read before writing most of this document, and as you will understand from reading it, I now rather wish I had!).</p>
<p>Also, the two examples we've seen so far show how there are two sides to this phenomenon: show dominance by showing the <em>ability</em> to win a fight without fighting; show superior suitability by showing the <em>ability</em> to gather resources without actually gathering resources. They are clearly not <em>completely</em> distinct.</p>
<h3>The same in modern human society</h3>
<p>We can see both types of 'abstraction' very clearly even in modern society. The violence-competition is virtualized in sport, most obviously:</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/gridiron.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>(It's probably not an accident that in many places, sportsmen are pretty much at the top of the mating hierarchy, at least to some females!). But lest we get <em>too</em> abstract, let's not forget that just generally, displays of violence <em>capability</em> are also a big part of human society, even at the nation-state level:</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/militaryparadewithtanks.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>Once we start thinking about human behaviour this way, we can see it everywhere. Consider the engagement ring and ask yourself where this tradition might come from:</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/engagementring.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>We are not so different from peacocks here ... and it's not of course "irrational" in any but the most inane sense. Look at the analogy between the peacock's display and the engagement ring more closely, both:</p>
<ul>
<li>are costly in resources to create</li>
<li>are visually appealing</li>
<li>are (visually) very distinct from the normal "stuff" in the environment</li>
<li>are very immediately and easily recognized <em>by any viewer, on their own</em></li>
<li>signal that the creator is part of a group (genetic, or cultural)</li>
</ul>
<p>Much less obvious I think is that the <em>permanence</em> of these displays is not central. Sometimes they are very delicate and fragile (think: flowers, think: sports displays with substantial risk of injury that would cause permanent inability to repeat them), and this is <em>almost</em> the point - to the receiver of the signal, what matters is that the signal was unambiguously difficult to create. What matters much less is the "substrate", i.e. what the signal is "made of". This is part of the insight in the "handicap principle":</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>what matters is what you <em>couldn't</em> do, because you did this.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/smallbirdinjungle.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>Further, imagine yourself as a small bird in the jungle - to find mating partners in this <strong>extremely</strong> noisy environment, you are looking for a small signal - a patch of bright colour - in this high noise environment. You want the signal to be unambiguous - blue where everything is green, yellow, brown, red - and costly. You don't want to have to compare it to something else to check it's correct (is it the same color as something else on the other side of the jungle? sheesh!). You really don't care about semantics - you don't care what the signal "means", except specifically that it's in some sense pre-agreed (perhaps genetically? see the last bullet point); to an outsider the signal could be outlandish or ridiculous, and that doesn't matter.</p>
<h3>The court, the bank, and the abstraction of money</h3>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/bankofmontreal.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>You can see it in architecture; there is of course a very good reason why historically banks were built of extremely sturdy materials, at considerable cost. They were originally actually vaults for high concentrations of physical wealth, and had to protect well from direct frontal assault.</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/hongkong.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>Nowadays this is another abstraction of the type already mentioned; if an organization put <em>that</em> much money into building such an imposing building or flashy skyscraper, they're hardly likely to steal my pathetic little stash! Court buildings likewise represent an abstraction of the state's power, and so do government offices (this is particularly obvious in more authoritarian states like China, where the government buildings in smaller towns look almost absurd (this example is very typical, in Luxian):</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/luxian.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>The whole "virtualization" paradigm, taking concrete physical force and replacing it with "threats, stronger than executions" has entirely entered the realm of money too. Not to dip my toe into the various debates about the origin of money, I'll just talk about recent history: we moved from bearer instruments and certificates for bearer instruments, through to certificates representing pure "fiat" in the literal sense - fiat meaning the will of the governing power, essentially. So "fiat is backed by men with guns", the famous <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MJWi8VUHUzk">Krugman</a> quote,</p>
<p><img src="https://joinmarket.me/images/krugman.jpeg" width="436" height="436"></p>
<p>... is certainly right <em>in essence</em> even if you quibble over various details. In the same way that courts are "backed by men with guns".</p>
<p>But I think it's important to step back and consider what role money takes in a society - its purpose is always exactly abstraction. It solves the "double coincidence of wants" problem by creating an entirely new class of good that no one originally wanted (this is the counter intuitive about much mathematics - to solve a problem involving 2 or 3 things you add another thing, superficially making everything more complicated, but suddenly everything 'falls into place', creating a new structure with more symmetry. For example, if the general solution of polynomials is tortuous and even insoluble (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89variste_Galois">Galois</a>) for real numbers, by adding an apparent complexity: a new made-up solution to x^2=-1, you suddenly find that everything cleans itself up (see: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_algebra">the fundamental theorem of algebra</a>). Money does something similar, because we replace an O(N^2) pricing problem with an O(N) problem - …</p></div></div>

</header>
<p>
As checkboxes are one of the most confusing UI elements, here
are a few tips for drafting them clear and unambiguously.
</p>
<section>
<h2>Labels</h2>
<p>
Let's start with a classic tip: verbs clarify the intent.
</p>
<p><label> Billing Address </label>
<label> Ship to Billing Address</label>
</p>
<p>
Headings help too and avoid repetitive verbs.
</p>
<div>
<p><span>Time Settings:</span></p>
<p><label> 24-Hour Format</label>
</p></div>
<p>
Don't break the mood, keep the mindset polarity. e.g., in Sign Up:
</p>
<p><label> Opt out of Newsletter</label>
<label> Subscribe to Newsletter</label>
</p>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Maybe it's a Selector</h2>
<p>
Mitigate misreads by consolidating pairs like:
</p>
<p><label> Painted?</label>
<label>
Color

</label>
<br>
<label>
Color

</label>
</p>
<div>
<p>
Be aware the alternative might be unexpected to the user:
</p>
<p><label> 240 Volts?</label>
</p>
<div>
<div>
<p><span>Operating Voltage:</span></p>
<p><label> 240V</label>
<label> 480V</label>
</p></div>
</div>
</div>
</section>
<section>
<h2>Maybe it's a Button</h2>
<p>
Checkboxes imply options, Buttons actions. If toggling
requires confirmation, it's closer to an action.

  <p>
    By default, Android has a strong security model and incorporates <a href="https://source.android.com/security/selinux/">
    full system SELinux policies</a>, <a href="https://source.android.com/security/app-sandbox">strong app sandboxing</a>,
    <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot">full verified boot</a>, modern exploit mitigations like
    <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/cfi">fine-grained forward-edge Control-Flow Integrity</a> and
    <a href="https://source.android.com/devices/tech/debug/shadow-call-stack">ShadowCallStack</a>, widespread use of
    memory-safe languages (Java / Kotlin) and more. As such, this article explains common ways in which people worsen the
    security model rather than criticisms of the security model itself.
  </p>

  <h2 id="unlocking-the-bootloader"><a href="#unlocking-the-bootloader">Unlocking the bootloader</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    Unlocking the bootloader in Android is a large security risk. It disables <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/">verified boot</a>, a fundamental part of the security
    model. Verified boot ensures the integrity of the base system and boot chain to prevent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack">
    evil maid attacks</a> and malware persistence. </p><p>
    
    Contrary to common assumptions, verified boot is not just important for physical security — it prevents the persistence
    of <b>any</b> tampering with your system, be it from a physical attacker or a malicious application that has managed to
    hook itself into the operating system. For example, if a remote attacker has managed to exploit the system and gain high
    privileges, verified boot would revert their changes upon reboot and ensure that they cannot persist.
  </p></div>

  <h2 id="rooting"><a href="#rooting">Rooting your device</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    Rooting your device allows an attacker to easily gain extremely high privileges. Android's architecture is built
    upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege">principle of least privilege</a>. By default,
    unrestricted root is found nowhere in the system due to the <a href="https://source.android.com/security/selinux">
    full system SELinux policy</a>. Even the init system does not have unrestricted root access. Exposing privileges far
    greater than any other part of the OS to the application layer is not a good idea. </p><p>
    
    It does not matter if you have to whitelist apps that have root. An attacker can fake user input by for example,
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clickjacking">clickjacking</a> or they can exploit vulnerabilities in apps that
    you have granted root to. By rooting your device, you are breaking Android's security model and adding further layers
    of trust where it is inappropriate. </p><p>
    
    A common argument for rooting is that Linux allows root but this does not account for the fact that the average
    desktop Linux system does not have a security model like Android does. On the usual Linux system, <a href="https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/linux.html#root">gaining root is extremely easy</a>. This is why Linux hardening procedures often involve
    restricting access to the root account.
  </p></div>

  <h2 id="custom-roms"><a href="#custom-roms">Custom ROMs</a></h2>

  <p>
    The majority of custom ROMs severely weaken the security model by disabling verified boot, using userdebug builds,
    disabling SELinux, and various other issues. Furthermore, you are also usually at the mercy of the maintainer to
    apply security updates properly. Certain ROMs often apply security patches late or sometimes not apply them at all,
    especially when it comes to firmware patches.
  </p>

  <h3 id="lineageos"><a href="#lineageos">LineageOS</a></h3>

  <p>
    A common ROM that has many of these issues is <a href="https://lineageos.org/">LineageOS</a>:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      LineageOS <a href="https://github.com/LineageOS/hudson/blob/master/lineage-build-targets">uses
      userdebug builds by default</a>. This <a href="https://source.android.com/setup/build/building#choose-a-target">
      adds many debugging features as additional attack surface</a>. It also weakens various SELinux polices and exposes
      root access via adb which <a href="#root">as discussed above</a>, is not a good idea.
    </li>

    <li>
      LineageOS requires an unlocked bootloader, therefore disabling verified boot which <a href="#unlocking-the-bootloader">
      is essential to verify the integrity of the operating system</a>.
    </li>

    <li>
      It does not implement <a href="https://source.android.com/security/verifiedboot/verified-boot#rollback-protection">
      rollback protection</a>. This allows an attacker to downgrade the system to an older version and then exploit already
      patched vulnerabilities. The default updater even allows you to downgrade versions yourself.
    </li>

    <li>
      Most LineageOS builds also do not include firmware updates which prevents users from getting new patches to fix
      vulnerabilities. Instead, it gives a pop-up advising users to flash updates manually that most people will simply
      ignore.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    This is a non-exhaustive list. There are more issues than just those listed above. LineageOS (and most other custom
    ROMs) are focused on customizing the device and not privacy or security. Of course, you could build LineageOS yourself
    to fix many of these issues but most users will not be capable of doing so.

  <h2 id="microg-signature-spoofing"><a href="#microg-signature-spoofing">MicroG / Signature Spoofing</a></h2>

  <div>
    <p><a href="https://microg.org/">MicroG</a> is a common alternative to Google Play Services. It is often used to get rid
    of Google's tracking but most people do not realise that this can potentially worsen security as it
    <a href="https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_GmsCore/wiki/Signature-Spoofing">requires signature spoofing
    support</a> which allows apps to request to bypass signature verification. </p><p>
    
    Although, some signature spoofing implementations restrict it to make it less bad such as <a href="https://gitlab.com/calyxos/platform_frameworks_base/commit/dccce9d969f11c1739d19855ade9ccfbacf8ef76">CalyxOS'
    implementation</a> which allows only microG to spoof the Play Services signature and nothing else.

  <h2 id="firewalls"><a href="#firewalls">Firewalls</a></h2>

  <div><p>
    Firewalls such as <a href="https://github.com/ukanth/afwall/">AFWall+</a> or <a href="https://www.netguard.me/">
    Netguard</a> are regularly used on Android to attempt to block network access from a specific app but these
    do not reliably work — apps can use IPC to bypass the restrictions. If you cut off network access to an app, it
    will not prevent the app from sending an <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/Intent">
    intent</a> to another app (such as the browser) to make it make the same connection. </p><p>
    
    Many apps already do this unintentionally whilst using APIs such as the <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/DownloadManager">download manager</a>. </p><p>
    
    The most effective way to block network access is to revoke the <code>INTERNET</code> permission from the app
    like <a href="https://github.com/GrapheneOS/platform_frameworks_base/commit/5e2898e9d21dd6802bb0b0139e7e496c41e1cd80">
    GrapheneOS allows you to do</a>. This prevents abusing OS APIs to initiate network connections as they contain checks
    for that permission, one example of which is the aforementioned download manager. You should also run the app in its
    own user or work profile to ensure that it cannot abuse third party apps either.

<p><em>by a literal banana</em></p>
<p>I have been trying to understand the “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lexical_hypothesis" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lexical hypothesis</a>” of personality, and its modern descendant, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Five Factor Model of personality</a>, for <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/01/27/ignorance-a-skilled-practice/">several</a> <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/06/24/the-extended-sniff-test/">months</a>. In that time, I have said some provocative things about the Big Five, and even some unkind things that I admit were unbecoming to a banana. Here, I wish to situate the Five Factor Model in the context of its historical development and modern use, and to demonstrate to the reader the surprising accomplishment that it represents for the field of psychology.<span id="more-732"></span></p>
<p>In personality research, the “lexical hypothesis” refers to a hypothesis attributed to Francis Galton (1884). Galton supposed that each human language would reflect important realities of human character within that language and culture. In particular, he noted that the words used to evaluate character and personality are very numerous (he estimated over a thousand, using a thesaurus), and often overlap in meaning.</p>
<p>But Galton immediately left his thesaurus behind, readily admitting of the impossibility of <a href="https://carcinisation.com/2020/06/26/words-fail/">defining</a> any aspect of character. Rather, he turned to experimental means of testing the character in various ways, and insisted that <em>no particular map or model of personality is needed to start from</em>.</p>
<p>Nowhere in his essay does Galton propose surveys as a means for studying character. He would probably regard such methods as unscientific, as indicated in his final paragraph:</p>
<blockquote><p>[C]haracter ought to be measured by carefully recorded acts, representative of the usual conduct. An ordinary generalisation is nothing more than a muddle of vague memories of inexact observations. It is an easy vice to generalise. We want lists of facts, every one of which may be separately verified, valued and revalued, and the whole accurately summed. It is the statistics of each man’s conduct in small every-day affairs, that will probably be found to give the simplest and most precise measure of his character.</p></blockquote>
<p>The methods that Galton proposed are exclusively non-linguistic. For instance, he commented that observing children involved in play quickly gives one an idea of each child’s emotional expression. Galton’s proposed methods prefigure both hidden camera prank shows and Goffman’s “breaching experiments:”</p>
<blockquote><p>I will not attempt to describe particular games of children or of others, nor to suggest experiments, more or less comic, that might be secretly made to elicit the manifestations we seek, as many such will occur to ingenious persons. They exist in abundance, and I feel sure that if two or three experimenters were to act zealously and judiciously together as secret accomplices, they would soon collect abundant statistics of conduct. They would gradually simplify their test conditions and extend their scope, learning to probe character more quickly and from more of its sides.</p></blockquote>
<p>Other methods Galton expressed enthusiasm for include heart rate measurement (he wore a home-brew heart-rate-measuring apparatus while he delivered the lecture that makes up the text) and methods discoverable from personal context (giving an example from Benjamin Franklin, of a man with one attractive and one deformed leg, who kept track of which leg his interlocutors paid attention to, as a gauge of their optimism or pessimism). Galton would be surprised, I think, to find that the most promising and scientific theory of personality in the twenty-first century is premised entirely on survey responses as its “facts.”</p>
<p>Early in the study of personality, there was a major shift of meaning in the lexical hypothesis. At first, the thesaurus and the word list were its tools of study (e.g., Allport &amp; Odbert, 1936); the idea was to find common factors of meaning in the words themselves. Of course, there is no particularly scientific way to decide how much the word “annoying” is the same as “obnoxious,” or how much either is the same as “low-status.” The major shift was to begin to measure the correlations of an entirely different construct: the correlations of the words <em>when used to describe a particular person</em>. That is, rather than trying to measure the underlying meaning of words, researchers began to measure the degree to which different words were applied to the same person. “Sameness” and “correlation” were no longer distinguishable concepts for the methods.</p>
<p>Initially, lists of adjectives, and eventually, short survey questions, were administered to subjects, who described either a person they knew or themselves. When the responses were subjected to factor analysis—a mathematical analysis to reveal the structure of correlations between responses—a varying number of factors emerged, depending on the methods and the researchers and the questions and the subjects, and these factors were given varying names. Since the early 1990s, the Five Factor Model has been dominant, although the names of the factors vary somewhat even today. The acronym OCEAN is used for the traits: Openness to experience (sometimes called “intellect” or “imagination” or “open-mindedness”), Conscientiousness, Extraversion (sometimes called “surgency”), Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (sometimes called “negative emotionality” or “emotional stability” reversed).<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Today, the five traits are measured with various survey instruments, with five questions on the shortest version (one for each aspect) and sixty questions on a common long-form version (that used by Soto, 2019). Survey instruments are validated in a number of ways: how much their responses correlate between testings (test-retest reliability, with astrological sign as the gold standard), how much different raters agree using the criteria (inter-rater reliability), and a nebulous concept of construct validity, which sometimes includes scientific gestures designed to ensure that the instrument measures what it purports to measure. Many papers present elaborate numerical artifacts of validation, and I have found that some characterize the validity of their instruments as “good” without providing an indication of what would be “not good enough.” From a brief review of dozens of validated instruments in social psychology, it seems to me that it is relatively easy to “validate” meaningless instruments. As long as the mathematical bona fides are present, the construct need not be meaningful in other ways. (The reader who is rightly suspicious of my broad and unsourced claims may wish to search Google Scholar with variations of “scale,” “inventory,” and “survey instrument,” and examine the results critically. The naming of factors is often a particularly interesting step.)</p>
<p>The strong claim made by advocates of the Five Factor Model is that any set of questions describing a human being, administered to subjects and the responses subjected to factor analysis, will reveal the same five factors (paraphrasing Jordan Peterson in <a href="https://youtu.be/pCceO_D4AlY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video</a>, around 11:10-16:40). This strong claim, though dubious in a number of respects, is a major part of the basis for the scientific legitimacy of the Big Five. It is interesting to see which aspects of the strong claim are admitted to be false by advocates of the Big Five, and how much is excused on the grounds that <i>at least it’s something</i>. The Five Factor Model is not perfect, advocates grant, but it is better than nothing. It is not clear how they measure “better than nothing;” this is a potentially interesting hypothesis in need of precisification, perhaps.</p>
<p>The Big Five exist as a special, scientifically validated property of language and survey methods, and that is one basis for their legitimacy. The other basis for the legitimacy of the Five Factor Model is its <i>replicable correlation with consequential life outcomes</i>. We know that the Big Five are not merely phantoms that fall out of a certain analysis of a certain use of language in WEIRD college students, because these traits are reliably correlated with things we care about.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>One of the most interesting features of the Big Five is the nature of its scientific evidence. Observe what is held out as a “replication” of the theory, and you will discover the theory’s true nature. The most impressive aspect of the ongoing accomplishment of the Five Factor Model is the degree to which it <i>deflects curiosity </i>about its underlying meaning with <i>rituals of scientific validation</i>, regardless of the rituals’ appropriateness in context. Since “replication” is the scientific ritual most recently shown to detect poor science in psychology, being shown to reliably “replicate” is a huge boost to the credibility of a theory.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>The interesting thing about the Five Factor Model is what it gets away with, in terms of being considered a theory, even though it is not causal, and makes no predictions. What counts as a “replication” of the Five Factor Model, as in Soto (2019), is the following: a correlation is found between one or more factors of the Five Factor Model and some other construct, and that correlation is found again in another sample, regardless of the size of the correlation. In almost all cases, and in 100% of Soto (2019)’s measures, the construct compared to a Big Five factor is derived from an online survey instrument.</p>
<p>What counts as a “consequential life outcome” is also fascinating. In most cases, the life outcome constructs are vague abstractions measured with survey instruments, much like the Big Five themselves. For instance, the life outcome “Inspiration” is measured with the Inspiration Scale, which asks the subject in four ways how often and how deeply inspired they are. Amazingly, this scale correlates a little bit with Extraversion and with Open-mindedness. Do these personality traits “predict” the life outcome of inspiration? Is “Inspiration” as instrumentalized here meaningfully different from the Big Five constructs, such that this correlation is meaningful?<span>&nbsp;</span></p>
<p>Compare the items for the construct “Inspiration” with the items for Extraversion and Open-mindedness used in Soto (2019):</p>
<p><b>Inspiration Scale Items</b></p>
<ul>
<li>I experience inspiration.</li></ul></div></article></div>

<p>The <strong>real</strong> repository is located <a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug" rel="nofollow">here</a></p>
<p>The GitHub repository <a href="https://github.com/unfrl/dug" rel="nofollow">here</a> is used for issues and stars <span aria-label="glowing star">🌟</span></p>
<p>A powerful global DNS progagation checker that can output in a variety of formats.</p>
<p>The goal of dug is to make it easy to check the propagation of DNS records. It is also capable of providing templated output that can be used in scripts for things like monitoring.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-usage">Usage</h2>
<p>Until theres a wiki for this, the easiest way to explore dug is through the help.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>dug help</code> -&gt; Get top level help explaining the different verbs</li>
<li><code>dug help run</code> or <code>dug run --help</code> -&gt; Get details about a specific verb (run, which is the default)</li>
<li><code>dug help update</code> or <code>dug update --help</code> -&gt; Get details about the update verb</li>
</ul>
<p>The simplest way to get started is to just run a query against the domain whose DNS records you’re updating.
For example: <code>dug git.kaijucode.com</code>:

<p>You can also do complicated things like ask for specific record types, get the output as json, and pipe it into other applications: <code>dug git.kaijucode.com -q A --output-format JSON --output-template Ipaddress,city,value,responsetime | jq</code>:
<a href="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif2.gif" rel="nofollow"><img src="https://git.kaijucode.com/matt/dug/media/branch/main/cli/Resources/gif2.gif" alt=""></a></p>

<p><em>Picture taken from <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www-cse-public/k12outreach/apcs/slides/java-recursive-tracing.pdf">this presentation</a></em></p>



<p>My esteemed colleague Shriram Krishnamurthi has written an interesting draft blog post on <a href="https://parentheticallyspeaking.org/articles/how-not-to-teach-recursion/">How Not to Teach Recursion</a> that details some of the common, perhaps misguided, ways computer science teachers teach recursion.</p>



<p>Let me start by saying that I agree with much of his criticism. Fibonacci is a contrived example and ignores the horrible computational complexity of the recursive solution compared to the iterative solution.  Euclid’s Algorithm, best left for a dedicated course in Cryptography, becomes an out of context example and I truly do not understand why anyone would care about Towers of Hanoi. My own education in recursion began by being required to implement the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight%27s_tour">Knight’s Tour</a> Problem on a chess board in Pascal and I still bear the unseen scars to this day. </p>



<p>Regarding recursion versus cyclicity, which is a very valid criticism, I make a point of always teaching stacks before teaching recursion. When students understand stacks, it is much easier to explain why unbounded recursion is different than cyclicity.  It also helps them to understand a computer security term like “smashing the stack” or why Stack Overflow is called Stack Overflow (they never use that website… ahem). With a proper understanding of stacks, the “dumb” jokes become not so dumb and do serve to elucidate learning. </p>



<p>Now let’s talk recursion in context of AP CS A, where things are much worse </p>



<div><p>In AP CS A, recursion is only tested on the multiple choice portion of the test. Let that sink in. As bad as any of the above examples, not a single one will appear on test. And what will appear on the test will likely look something like <a href="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/www-cse-public/k12outreach/apcs/slides/java-recursive-tracing.pdf">this</a>.</p><p>But it gets worse. The multiple choice test is timed and the students have to do a certain amount of problems in a relatively small amount of time. Correctly tracing mystery recursion problems takes time and doing that in a time crunch, is quite frankly, a good way to get students to absolutely abhor recursion for life. Frankly, Towers of Hanoi and Euclid would be an improvement.</p></div>



<div><p>My preference would be to wait to teach recursion until the students have significant experience in data structures, at least stacks, queues, lists, and trees. The beauty that is the recursive algorithm for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_traversal">walking a tree</a> is where I would want recursion to be introduced. Moving recursion out of AP CS A and collegiate CS1 into data structures is not likely to happen any time soon, so I have come up with a compromise in my own teaching.</p><p>While I no longer teach AP CS A at the high school level for this and many other reasons. I do use the Fibonacci example, although I quickly explain all the limitations in context of the computational complexity I like to first teach (that is not part of the AP CS A curriculum). Students do first know stacks and lists (not so much trees) and I do a bit of hand waving explaining recursion and walking trees. I would prefer to leave recursion out entirely, but know all too well what waits them in college.</p><p>I tell them that, done properly, recursion is a beautiful thing. Which, I hope, will help them weather the storm to come in college that is Towers of Hanoi, Knight’s Tour, and Euclid.</p></div>
