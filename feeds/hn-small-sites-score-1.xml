<p>Machine learning is increasingly popular and the increasing number of companies are harnessing the power of this new technology. Yet the knowledge about the teams themselves is yet limited – what do they use? What do they like? Who are they?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neptune has been built by data scientists for data scientist – no mumbo-jumbo in between. So when facing the challenge of missing knowledge we do the best we can do – gather the data. Benefitting from our network of contacts and readers whom of many are machine-learning specialists themselves, we have launched a poll to get the answers about most popular technologies, the nature of teams and their daily work.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Results? Read below!&nbsp;</p>






<h2>Which area of Machine Learning are you working on?</h2>



<p>First question – what are teams working on? Is there any kind of hidden king behind the wall of hyping other technologies? Some peaceful leader of modern machine learning, steady growing in the sterile light of server rooms while media vendors keep chasing the over-pumped ghosts?&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have divided the categories into:&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Computer Vision</li><li>Reinforcement Learning</li><li>NLP</li><li>Forecasting</li><li>Tabular</li><li>Other</li></ol>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_general.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="ml_flavour_general" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_general.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_general.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_general.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_general.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>We found out that the most prominent area in teams was the <strong>NLP (Natural Language Processing), </strong>followed by <strong>Computer Vision, Forecasting, Tabular, Other, and Reinforcement Learning</strong>.</p>



<p>According to a report in 2019, <a href="https://solutionsreview.com/data-management/80-percent-of-your-data-will-be-unstructured-in-five-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80% of your data will be unstructured in the next 5 years</a>, and we can use this data to build machine learning models for tasks like sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, topic segmentation, text summarization, relationship extraction – you name it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Considering the advances in the NLP technology more use cases will emerge soon.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You may have heard on your phone calls when you connect to a company’s service care, “This call may be recorded for quality and training purposes,” or asked to fill a survey after you have purchased a service or a product from an organization.</p>



<p>This information can be used to understand an audience’s sentiment polarity about an organization’s product or service.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="ml_flavour_sometimes" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_sometimes.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>In the conducted surveys, 26 out of the 31 teams confirmed that they all worked with NLP to deal with textual data.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_primarly.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="ml_flavour_primarly" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_primarly.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_primarly.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_primarly.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/ml_flavour_primarly.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Almost all the teams have worked in nearly all areas except for Reinforcement Learning.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>“Reinforcement learning is an agent-based learning that enables an agent to learn in an interactive environment by trial and error.”</strong></p>



<p>But that’s not really surprising considering fact that the reinforcement learning is still more academic and research area, not the business one. For a serious reason – Reinforcement&nbsp;Learning may not be suitable for a startup is the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NQK4ZY_gwKI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data required for reinforcement learning </a>is massive, with <a href="https://www.alexirpan.com/2018/02/14/rl-hard.html">numerous technical challenges</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://openai.com/five/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OpenAIFive</a> system has an estimated batch size of over 1 million observations. This means we have over a million state-action-rewards to update on each simulation. This makes reinforcement learning samples efficient since a lot of training data is required to reach the desired performance.</p>



<p>For example, <a href="https://deepmind.com/research/case-studies/alphago-the-story-so-far" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AlphaGo</a>, the first AI agent who defeated world champion <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Sedol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lee Sedol</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(board_game)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GO</a>,&nbsp;was trained nonstop for a period of a few days by playing millions of games, accumulating thousands of years of knowledge in those simulations that estimated to have cost nearly <a href="https://www.yuzeh.com/data/agz-cost.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">$3 million for computation power alone</a>.</p>



<p>AlphaGo Zero showed everyone that it is possible to build systems that can defeat even a world champ, but developing this system is still not available to most startups due to the model’s expensiveness.</p>



<p>Key takeaway – work where money are. Either at business oriented fields or for tech giants with wagons of cash for reinforcement learning.&nbsp;</p>






<h2>What type of models do you work with?</h2>



<p>We asked all of the teams about the methods they use to build a model and list them in four categories.</p>



<ol><li>Deep Learning</li><li>Boosted Trees(LightGBM, XGBoost, Catboost)</li><li>Linear Regression</li><li>Other</li></ol>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_general.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="model_flavour_general" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_general.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_general.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_general.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_general.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Deep Learning models turn out to be the winner here that is used very often by 14 teams.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="model_flavour_sometimes" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_sometimes.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_sometimes.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>At least 29 out of 31 teams worked with Deep Learning models at some point.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_primarly.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="model_flavour_primarly" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_primarly.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_primarly.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_primarly.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/model_flavour_primarly.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>We can again see here that Deep learning is a winner. Deep Learning is gaining much popularity due to its predictive accuracy when trained on a massive amount of datasets.</p>



<p>Deep Learning tends to work best with unstructured data, and according to <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gartner</a>,<a href="https://www.dataversity.net/putting-structure-around-unstructured-data/#:~:text=In%20fact%2C%20analysts%20at%20Gartner,of%20enterprise%20data%20is%20unstructured.&amp;text=Finding%20ways%20to%20integrate%20new,the%20data%20as%20it%20grows." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> 80% of a enterprise data is unstructured</a> in the form of texts, images, pdfs, etc.</p>



<p>Deep Learning methods are applied to social media and unstructured data to better understand the client and segment them. The financial industry is adapting deep learning methods rapidly to build systems for detecting fraudulent transactions, trading, stock predictions, etc.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The healthcare industry is leveraging the power of deep learning for drug invention, disease diagnosis, virtual healthcare, and the list can go on and on.</p>



<p>So again – the teams stick to the technology that delivers the results while keeping its versatility. So the deep learning is a leading technology and nothing seems to change this course.&nbsp;</p>






<h2>What do you currently train your ML models on?</h2>



<p>Training a machine learning or deep learning model can be daunting sometimes due to limited computational power. On the other hand, a smart data scientist can tweak the model to be less data-hungry and use fewer resources. So we asked all 31 teams about the infrastructure they use for training or building their predictive models.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can categorize them into 4 categories.&nbsp;</p>



<ol><li>Local Machine (Laptop Or PC)</li><li>Local Cluster</li><li>Big Cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure)</li><li>Dedicated ML Cloud (Sagemaker, Floydhub)</li></ol>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_general.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="infra_general" srcset="https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_general.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_general.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_general.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i2.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_general.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>The least used infrastructure we can see here is the<strong> Dedicated ML Cloud (SageMaker, Floydhub),</strong> and the most used is here <strong>local pc and Big Cloud(AWS, GCP, Azure)</strong>.</p>



<p>Maybe because training your models on dedicated ML cloud services sometimes can <a href="https://medium.com/the-mission/why-building-your-own-deep-learning-computer-is-10x-cheaper-than-aws-b1c91b55ce8c#:~:text=There's%20a%20reason%20why%20datacenters,a%20lot%20for%20renting%20it." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">burn a hole in your pocket</a>. They are cool for teams that are heavy on cash – and there are such, but not that many.&nbsp;</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_sometimes.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="infra_sometimes" srcset="https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_sometimes.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_sometimes.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_sometimes.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_sometimes.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>Except for the dedicated ML cloud (SageMaker, Floydhub), we can see that model training on all the platforms, whether it is a local machine, Big Cloud or a local cluster were used at some point. It is not that surprising – it is common to run prototype locally at lower cost to save on trial-and-error process in the cloud – in the end, every second costs real cash.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="341" src="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_primarly.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1" alt="infra_primarly" srcset="https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_primarly.png?resize=1024%2C341&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_primarly.png?resize=300%2C100&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_primarly.png?resize=768%2C256&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i1.wp.com/neptune.ai/wp-content/uploads/infra_primarly.png?w=1296&amp;ssl=1 1296w" sizes="(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px" data-recalc-dims="1"></figure></div>



<p>We can see that the most often used infrastructure for training a predictive model is Big Cloud (Azure, AWS, GCP).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sometimes you may have limited RAM and GPU to train a predictive model, and you just can’t upgrade your system on your whim to meet your system needs; that’s where Cloud services come into play. Or you wish to finish your training in an hour, not in a week – money is not the only value after all.</p>






<h2>What are your favorite tools/frameworks/libraries for building and managing ML models?</h2>



<p>Data Science teams tend to have every data scientist’s machine learning tasks their own weapons in their framework’s arsenal to tackle any data science problem.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On the <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/">Excalidraw project</a>, we have decided to deprecate <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-desktop">Excalidraw Desktop</a>, an <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> wrapper for Excalidraw, in favor of the Web version that you can—and always could—find at <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">excalidraw.com</a>. After a careful analysis, we have decided that <a href="https://web.dev/pwa/">Progressive Web App</a> (PWA) is the future we want to build upon. Read on to learn more about our rationale.</p>
<!-- end -->
<h2>How Excalidraw Desktop came into being</h2>
<p>Soon after <a href="https://twitter.com/vjeux">@vjeux</a> had created the initial version of Excalidraw in January 2020 and <a href="https://blog.excalidraw.com/reflections-on-excalidraw/">blogged about it</a>, he proposed the following in <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/561#issue-555138343">Issue #561</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Would be great to wrap Excalidraw within Electron (or equivalent) and publish it as a native application to the various app stores.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The immediate reaction by <a href="https://github.com/voluntadpear">@voluntadpear</a> was to suggest:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“What about making it a PWA instead? Android currently supports adding them to the Play Store as Trusted Web Activities and hopefully iOS will do the same soon. On Desktop, Chrome lets you download a desktop shortcut to a PWA.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The decision that <a href="https://github.com/vjeux">@vjeux</a> took in the end was simple:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We should do both :)”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>While work on converting the version of Excalidraw into a PWA was started by <a href="https://github.com/voluntadpear">@voluntadpear</a> and later others, <a href="https://github.com/lipis">@lipis</a> independently <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw/issues/561#issuecomment-579573783">went ahead</a> and created a <a href="https://github.com/excalidraw/excalidraw-desktop">separate repo</a> for Excalidraw Desktop.</p>
<p>To this day, the initial goal set by <a href="https://github.com/vjeux">@vjeux</a>, that is, to submit Excalidraw to the various app stores, has not been reached yet. Honestly, no one has even started the submission process to any of the stores. But why is that? Before I try to provide an answer, let me quickly look at Electron, the platform.</p>
<h2>What is Electron?</h2>
<p>The unique selling point of <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/">Electron</a> is that it allows you to <em>“build cross-platform desktop apps with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS”</em>. Apps built with Electron are <em>“compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux”</em>, that is, <em>“Electron apps build and run on three platforms”</em>. According to the homepage, the hard parts that Electron makes easy are <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/auto-updater">automatic updates</a>, <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/menu">native menus and notifications</a>, <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/crash-reporter">crash reporting</a>, <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/content-tracing">debugging and profiling</a>, and <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/api/auto-updater#windows">Windows installers</a>. Turns out, some of the promised features need a detailed look at the small print.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, automatic updates <em>“are [currently] only [supported] on macOS and Windows. There is no built-in support for auto-updater on Linux, so it is recommended to use the distribution’s package manager to update your app”</em>.</li>
<li>Developers can create native menus by calling <code>Menu.setApplicationMenu(menu)</code>. On Windows and Linux, the menu will be set as each window’s top menu, while on macOS there are many system-defined standard menus, like the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsapplication/1428608-servicesmenu?language=objc">Services</a> menu. To make one’s menus a standard menu, developers should set their menu’s <code>role</code> accordingly, and Electron will recognize them and make them become standard menus. This means that a lot of menu-related code will make use of the following platform check: <code>const isMac = process.platform === 'darwin'</code>.</li>
<li>Windows installers can be made with <a href="https://github.com/electron/windows-installer">windows-installer</a>. The README of the project highlights that <em>“for a production app you need to sign your application. Internet Explorer’s SmartScreen filter will block your app from being downloaded, and many anti-virus vendors will consider your app as malware unless you obtain a valid cert”</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at just these three examples, it is clear that Electron is far from “write once, run everywhere”. Distributing an app on app stores requires <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/code-signing">code signing</a>, a security technology for certifying app ownership. Packaging an app requires using tools like <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-forge">electron-forge</a> and thinking about where to host packages for app updates. It gets complex relatively quickly, especially when the objective truly is cross platform support. I want to note that it is <em>abolutely</em> possible to create stunning Electron apps with enough effort and dedication. For Excalidraw Desktop, we were not there.</p>
<h2>Where Excalidraw Desktop left off</h2>
<p>Excalidraw Desktop so far is basically the Excalidraw Web app bundled as an <a href="https://github.com/electron/asar"><code>.asar</code></a> file with an added <strong>About Excalidraw</strong> window. The look and feel of the application is almost identical to the Web version.</p>

  <figcaption>The <strong>About Excalidraw</strong> menu providing insights into the versions</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On macOS, there is now a native menu at the top of the application, but since none of the menu actions—apart from <strong>Close Window</strong> and <strong>About Excalidraw</strong>—are hooked up to to anything, the menu is, in its current state, pretty useless. Meanwhile, all actions can of course be performed via the regular Excalidraw toolbars and the context menu.</p>

<p>We use <a href="https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder">electron-builder</a>, which supports <a href="https://www.electron.build/configuration/configuration#PlatformSpecificBuildOptions-fileAssociations">file type associations</a>. By double-clicking an <code>.excalidraw</code> file, ideally the Excalidraw Desktop app should open. The relevant excerpt of our <code>electron-builder.json</code> file looks like this:</p>
<div data-language="json"><pre><code><span>{</span>
  <span>"fileAssociations"</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      <span>"ext"</span><span>:</span> <span>"excalidraw"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"name"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Excalidraw"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"description"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Excalidraw file"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"role"</span><span>:</span> <span>"Editor"</span><span>,</span>
      <span>"mimeType"</span><span>:</span> <span>"application/json"</span>
    <span>}</span>
  <span>]</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Unfortunately, in practice, this does not always work as intended, since, depending on the installation type (for the current user, for all users), apps on Windows&nbsp;10 do not have the rights to associate a file type to themselves.</p>
<p>These shortcomings and the pending work to make the experience truly native-like on <em>all</em> platforms (which, again, with enough effort <em>is</em> possible) were a strong argument for us to reconsider our investment in Excalidraw Desktop. The way bigger argument for us, though, was that we foresee that for <em>our</em> use case, we do not need all the features Electron offers. The grown and still growing set of capabilities of the Web serves us equally well, if not better.</p>
<h2>How the Web serves us today and in the future</h2>
<p>Even in 2020, <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> is still <a href="https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2020/javascript#libraries">incredibly popular</a>. For many developers it has become a habit to use it, despite the fact that today they <a href="http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/">might not need jQuery</a>. There is a similar resource for Electron, aptly called <a href="https://youmightnotneedelectron.com/">You Might Not Need Electron</a>. Let me outline in the following why we think we do not need Electron.</p>
<h3>Installable Progressive Web App</h3>
<p>Excalidraw today is an <a href="https://web.dev/installable/">installable</a> Progressive Web App with a <a href="https://excalidraw.com/service-worker.js">service worker</a> and a <a href="https://excalidraw.com/manifest.json">Web App Manifest</a>. It caches all its resources in two caches, one for fonts and font-related CSS, and one for everything else.</p>

<p>Excalidraw is configured to run as a standalone application, so when you install it, you get an app that runs in its own window. It is fully integrated in the operating system’s multitasking UI and gets its own app icon on the home screen, Dock, or task bar; depending on what platform you install it.</p>

<h3>File system access</h3>
<p>Excalidraw makes use of <a href="https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/browser-nativefs">browser-nativefs</a> for accessing the file system of the operating system. On supporting browsers, this allows for a true open→edit→save workflow and actual over-saving and “save as”, with a transparent fallback for other browsers. You can learn more about this feature in my blog post <a href="https://blog.excalidraw.com/browser-nativefs/">Reading and writing files and directories with the browser-nativefs library</a>.</p>
<h3>Drag and drop support</h3>
<p>Files can be dragged and dropped onto the Excalidraw window just as in native applications. On a browser that supports the <a href="https://web.dev/file-system-access/">File System Access API</a>, a dropped file can be immediately edited and the modifications be saved to the original file. This is so intuitive that you sometimes forget that you are dealing with a Web app.</p>
<h3>Clipboard access</h3>
<p>Excalidraw works well with the operating system’s clipboard. Entire Excalidraw drawings or also just individual objects can be copied and pasted in <code>image/png</code> and <code>image/svg+xml</code> formats, allowing for an easy integration with other native tools like <a href="https://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a> or Web-based tools like <a href="https://jakearchibald.github.io/svgomg/">SVGOMG</a>.</p>

<h3>File handling</h3>
<p>Excalidraw already supports the experimental <a href="https://web.dev/file-handling/">File Handling API</a>, which means <code>.excalidraw</code> files can be double-clicked in the operating system’s file manager and open directly in the Excalidraw app, since Excalidraw registers as a file handler for <code>.excalidraw</code> files in the operating system.</p>
<h3>Declarative link capturing</h3>
<p>Excalidraw drawings can be shared by link—here is an <a href="https://excalidraw.com/#json=4646308765761536,jwZJW8JsOM75vdhqG2nBgA">example</a>. In the future, if people have Excalidraw installed as a PWA, such links will not open in a browser tab, but launch a new standalone window. This will work thanks to <a href="https://github.com/WICG/sw-launch/blob/master/declarative_link_capturing.md">declarative link capturing</a>, an, at the time of writing, bleeding-edge proposal for a new Web platform feature.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The Web has come a long way, with more and more features landing in browsers that only a couple of years or even months ago were unthinkable on the Web and exclusive to native applications. Excalidraw is at the forefront of what is possible in the browser, all while acknowledging that not all browsers on all platforms support each feature we make use of. By betting on a progressive enhancement strategy, we enjoy the latest and greatest wherever possible, but without leaving anyone behind. Best viewed in <em>any</em> browser.</p>
<p>Electron has served us well, but in 2020 and beyond, we can live without it. Oh, and for that objective of <a href="https://github/com/vjeux">@vjeux</a>: since the Android Play Store now accepts PWAs in a container format called <a href="https://web.dev/using-a-pwa-in-your-android-app/">Trusted Web Activity</a> and since the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/progressive-web-apps-edgehtml/microsoft-store">Microsoft Store supports PWAs</a>, too, you can expect Excalidraw in these stores in the not too distant future. Meanwhile, you can always use and install <a href="https://excalidraw.com/">Excalidraw in and from the browser</a>.</p></div></div>]]>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>Facebook often asks users to input their mobile phone numbers. Users are asked to input their mobile phone numbers for easier password recovery or for easier contacts discovery on messanger app.
Even if the mobile phone number is kept private and it is not public, the default facebook's privacy settings allows lookup of users through their mobile phone number, allowing malicious parties, such as spammers, to enumerate all those inattentive users.</p>

<p>With few lines of codes, and few facebook's account, it is possible to enumerate all the Facebook's users that didn't manually deactivated lookup by phone numbers. In few hours it is possible to populate a large database of users with respectively their name, surname, avatar photos and mobile phone numbers, along with all the public informations they input on Facebook. This database can then be used for unlegitimate purpose, such as advertising or spamming. In this brief report, i am going to show how I built a script for achieving this easily, and i put the result of my experiment.</p>

<h3>Anatomy of the search</h3>

<p>The Facebook's privacy policy that allows users to be looked up through their mobile phone number allows malicious party to make two different kind of search for ambigous purposes: 
</p><ul>
	<li>Retrieving a targeted users' phone number even if it is private;</li>
	<li>Enumerating all the users that didn't manually deactivated lookup by phone numbers, along with their phone numbers too.</li>
</ul>

<p>In both cases, the attack vectors consist in brute forcing all the possible numbers and input them in the facebook search. Whenever a match is found, Facebook's search returns one and just one result, giving to the searcher the certainity that the searched phone numbers belong to that user.</p>

<p>We will discuss later about the facebook protections (such as request's rate limits) and how to avert them.</p>

<h3>Brute forcing all possible phone numbers in a restricted set.</h3>

<p>My experiment consisted in trying to enumerate italian facebook's users and retrieving their phone numbers. Mobile phone numbers are always composed by 10 digist, of which the first three depends on the carriers, so are usually easily predictable. Coding a script for generating all the possible phone numbers is trivial: with 32 common carrier's prefix, all the possibile italian phone numbers are 10<sup>7</sup>*32.</p>

<p>After populating locally this database, it is enough to perform a search on facebook using a browser, inspecting network's traffic and exporting the HAR (http archive). Then it is trivial to parse the request's archive and replay requests programmatically changing search's input. </p>

<p>During my experiment, using cookies from my personal facebook's account, â€¨I sent over 400 requests to Facebook in a total range of time of about 8 minutes, and matched 50 users: 50 strangers of which i got name, surname, photo and phone number, intended to be private, (and all the public info). I did not receive any limitation from Facebook.â€¨ The success rate was about 10%, so that each 10 requests searching for a random phone number a match was found.</p>

<p>Below a screenshot of the script executing on my shell:</p>

<h3>Averting rate limits</h3>

<p>Firstly saying there is not public knowledge about Facebook protections, a possible threat came to my mind: More or less Facebook receives a request from an account to â€˜search.phpâ€™ every time an user digits a character in the search input. A user searching a phone number using web user interface inputs 10 characters, so that about 10 requests are sent to Facebookâ€™s server. An user performing some searches on Facebook's website sends an huge amount of requests. This could suggest that Facebook expects many request by the same account for searches, allowing malicious searcher to perform more requests without limitations.</p>

<p>Putting a random timeout between requests helps preventing being marked by facebook as an automated tool (prohibited by facebook's policy).</p>

<h3>Making the attack more effective</h3>

<p>Using such a trivial tool it is possible to populate a large database of mobile phone's contacts. Parallelizing the searches with many accounts it is possible to slolwly query the facebook's database and retrieve all the contacts' information. The attack can be easily distribuited.</p>

<p>In order not to sent useless request to facebook's servers (searching of not existing phone numbers, for example), it is possibile to use free services such as Twilio's apis that allows to lookup phone numbers to check their existency. For a small amount of money (half cent of dollar), it is even possible to lookup the mobile carrier of a given phone number.</p>

<h3>Targeting a single user</h3>
<p>Targeting a single user to retrieve its phone number is also possible. In fact, it is enough to retreive its facebook's username (which is public), and input it in reset password form. Facebook will show the last two digits of its mobile phone number, restricting the searched space. In fact, assuming the nationality of user's mobile phone carriers, possibile permutations are: n_carriers_prefix*10<sup>5</sup>. In case of italians phone numbers, possibile phone numers are 32M. <br>
Making so many queries to Facebook's server is surely not trivial, but parallelizing the attack makes it possible. Moreover, in the meantime we find a match, we can enumerate all the users that helds the tried phone numbers.</p>


<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>Even if Facebook's privacy policy expects such behavior, protections adopted to prevent misues seems not to be effective. Malicious users can easily populate large databases and using it for unlegitimate purposes (such as spam). Facebook, as other social networks, offers highly customizable privacy settings, but these settings have a default beahvior that in most cases could be dangerous for users' privacy. Thought most of the users are inattentive to privacy's issues, these default settings should have the most possibile privacy-preventing configurations.</p>

	<p><strong> Der Chef des TÃ¼binger Biotech-Unternehmens Curevac spricht sich dafÃ¼r aus, im Kampf gegen Corona die Patente nicht verfallen zu lassen, aber sie kurzfristig auszusetzen. So kann die Forschung schneller arbeiten. </strong></p>
	
	

















		
		
	<p> Stuttgart - Franz-Werner Haas, der Vorstandschef des Tübinger Biotech-Unternehmens <a href="https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/thema/Curevac" title="Curevac">Curevac</a>, fordert eine enge internationale Zusammenarbeit, um die Weiterentwicklung eines Corona-Impfstoffs zu fördern. <a href="https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.interview-mit-den-chefs-des-tuebinger-impfstoffherstellers-curevac-wir-kaempfengegen-das-virusund-die-zeit.8fe0d5d1-ecb6-4f64-aab3-e5e35749fd7e.html" target="_blank">Neben dem Teilen von Studiendaten zur Wirksamkeit vorhandener Impfstoffe zählt er dazu auch die Aussetzung von Patenten, sagte er unserer Zeitung</a>. Die Patente sollten zwar grundsätzlich erteilt, in der Pandemiephase aber ausgesetzt werden. Er folgt damit einer Empfehlung der Welthandelsorganisation (WTO). â€žWir brauchen einanderâ€œ, sagt auch Curevac-Gründer Ingmar Hoerr zur Bekämpfung der Pandemie. â€žDas Brett, das wir bohren, ist einfach zu dick.â€œ</p>

	<p>Curevac ist nach Biontech das zweite deutsche Unternehmen, das einen Covid-19-Impfstoff auf den Markt bringt. Die entscheidende Testphase hat in dieser Woche begonnen. Haas erwartet erste Ergebnisse im ersten Quartal 2021. Auf dieser Basis rechnet er mit einer vorläufigen Zulassung und dem Beginn der Impfung mit dem Curevac-Impfstoff im zweiten Quartal 2021. </p>
	
	

















		
		
	<p>Das Vakzin käme damit später als die Produkte einiger Wettbewerber auf den Markt, mit denen nach den neuesten Planungen noch vor Weihnachten die ersten Deutschen geimpft werden sollen. Haas begründet den zeitlichen Verzug damit, viel Zeit in eine bessere Lagerfähigkeit des eigenen Impfstoffs investiert zu haben. Der Curevac-Impfstoff kann bei Kühlschranktemperatur drei Monate gelagert werden. Hingegen muss etwa das Vakzin von Biontech bei minus 70 Grad gelagert werden, was die Impflogistik verkompliziert. Zur nachhaltigen Bekämpfung der Pandemie müsse weltweit intensiv geimpft werden, fordert Hoerr.</p>
	
	

















		
		
	<h2>Schutzbedürftige Gruppen könnten laut Haas bis Sommer geimpft sein</h2> <p>In Deutschland können nach Einschätzung von Haas bis zum Sommer besondere schutzbedürftige Gruppen geimpft sein. Bis Ende 2021 sollten auch all diejenigen geimpft werden können, für die noch spezifische Studien durchgeführt werden müssen, wie etwa Kinder oder Menschen mit Vorerkrankungen.</p>
	
	

















		
		
	<p>Bei den Corona-Impfungen haben Personen, die älter als 80 Jahre alt sind, sowie Menschen, die in Alten- und Pflegeheimen leben oder arbeiten â€žhöchste Prioritätâ€œ. So steht es im Referentenentwurf der â€žVerordnung zum Anspruch auf Schutzimpfung gegen das Coronavirus Sars-CoV-2â€œ von Bundesgesundheitsminister Jens Spahn (CDU). Der Minister hat angekündigt, die Verordnung an diesem Freitag unterzeichnen zu wollen.</p>

<!-- NOWRAPPER(!) -->          














<!-- oms_zone does not match -->

	

















		
		
	<p>In die Gruppe mit â€žhöchster Prioritätâ€œ fallen auch Personen, die von ambulanten Pflegediensten betreut werden oder die dort tätig sind. Die Impfung findet in den Zentren statt, deren Standorte die Länder festlegen. Im Land gibt es 59 Impfzentren. Seit dem 15. Dezember sind sogenannte Zentrale Zentren eingerichtet worden. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After looking at the features, components and libraries for Vue, React and Angular it’s time to do an actual comparison of the three. While in terms of popularity React is still top there are substantial differences in where each of the frameworks excels. So even if you’re already committed to one (or want to switch) it’s probably a good idea to check out exactly how they measure up against each other in a few key aspects.</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p>Before we get to the meat it’s probably prudent to point out what these differences stem from. Each of the three frameworks has a different approach to development and aims at helping devs in a different way. <strong>React and Angular are developed by big companies</strong> namely Facebook and Google while <strong>Vue has started as a side project</strong> of a Google developer. While all are JavaScript based, each presents a slightly different syntax approach. React uses JavaScript and JSX (which combines HTML and JavaScript logic), Angular uses TypeScript (HTML and TypeScript logic is split) Vue uses JavaScript (HTML and JavaScript logic is split). All of them are component-driven, but they treat coding them differently along with a number of default features included.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>React</strong> combines the UI and behavior of components, the same code is responsible for both creating a UI component and dictating its behavior. </li>
<li><strong>Vue</strong> takes the same approach and even lets you combine the UI and behavior of components from within a script. </li>
<li><strong>Angular</strong> completely separates the two, the UI parts of components are attributes of HTML tags while their behaviors are in the form of JavaScript code. </li>
</ul>

<td><strong>Vue</strong></td>

<td><em>JavaScript</em></td>
<td><em>fair amount</em></td>

<h2>Learning curve</h2>
<p>Finally the main difference in approach is probably the learning curve. Vue is the easiest to learn and can even serve as a stepping stone for learning the two others, as there is some overlap especially in handling components. Simplicity and customizability obviously have their advantages, but there are also some drawbacks as it makes it somewhat difficult to debug and test. React is middle of the road, it is harder to get into but has great documentation and an easy to follow starting guide. The drawback is it does require use of third party libraries for more complex stuff. This makes the learning curve not so steep but highly dependent on what you actually want to do and what third party libraries you’ll need to learn to do it. Angular is the complete framework, but also has the steepest learning curve requiring learning TypeScript, RxJS and MVC. The investment of time and effort may prove well worth it as mastering it will make building your app a breeze.</p>

<h2>Minimalism vs all-in-one</h2>
<p>Approach and philosophy are important and all but that’s mostly just the pitch. For a clearer picture it’s better to look at the features. As mentioned above React takes a minimalistic approach here, it provides you with a library for rendering content to the DOM. It does provide some rudimentary built-in state management support but you’ll likely need to use a state management library like Redux (which is fortunately quite easy to learn). There aren’t any other special features and if you need some other functionalities you’ll need to check out community provided solutions. That does make it a lot slimmer than the other two, but can be a hassle if you’re working on a complex project and looking to get started from the get go. Vue is the middle ground, it provides some features, but isn’t the complete package Angular is. You get built in state management as well as a built-in router. Though for form validation you’ll need something like the Vuelidate library and a library for Http client functions (there’s quite a few to choose from) Angular gives you all these features out of the box and more, there’s an official CLI which helps building, managing, updating and deploying projects even easier.</p>

<h2>Less is more</h2>
<p>The thought that comes to mind is probably, why not go with Angular, after all it has the most features. Well more isn’t always better and as mentioned the steep learning curve can be a turnoff especially if you’re looking to get started right away or working on projects requiring less complex solutions out of the box. Oh and emphasis on ‘out-of-the-box’ here, it’s not like Vue and React are useless when it comes to features. Just the opposite, they’re freely available to you when you need them, you just need to reach out to the community instead of getting them built-in with the framework. As you can see it comes to personal preference and focusing on what fits you best now and what might fit you best in the future, hopefully this little piece helped with that at least a little bit.</p></div><p>The GraphQL Editor is a supportive tool for both advanced GraphQL users as well as those taking their first steps with GraphQL APIs.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      
<p>As <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://senx.io/" target="_blank">SenX</a> enters its second week of remote work, I thought it would be a good time to write about the importance of time and <a href="https://blog.senx.io/working-with-geo-data-in-warp-10/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">geo time series</a> during a pandemic like the one we are experiencing with the coronavirus and the associated COVID-19.</p>



<p>For millions if not billions of people on Earth, <strong>some time series has become the most important thing to look at.</strong> Whether it is the #FlattenTheCurve graph or the Hammer and the dance illustration, or the various graphs showing the evolution of the number of cases, recovering patients, and unfortunately deaths, those are all-time series, i.e. graphs whose x-axis represents the time and the y-axis the evolution of tracked quantities.</p>



<figure><img src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5e6aac7295ff060008467cf9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Science_Covid19-Infographic.jpg" alt="Coronavirus COVID-19 #FlattenTheCurve strategy"><figcaption>#FlattenTheCurve</figcaption></figure>



<h2>Contact Tracing</h2>



<p>But another trend about to begin will bring people exposed even more to time series. As the world learns how countries such as Singapore, South Korea, or Taiwan have dealt with the COVID-19 outbreak, the notion of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contact_tracing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contact Tracing</a> has appeared in the media and will soon be in everybody's mouth.</p>



<p>The reaction to that notion, which is widely used in public health but may appear new to many, varies from country to country, and among countries varies with culture, political background, or religious belief. Some are considering it as the end of privacy and liberty. The others as a salvation technique or more moderate ones as a good temporary tactic for fighting the outbreak.</p>



<h3>But what exactly is contact tracing? </h3>



<p>The idea is very simple. It keeps a log of who you came close to so when someone gets tested positive with COVID-19 his or her log can be accessed. The people appearing in the log can be contacted to test them too. Logs used to be your memory, now with the advent of technology they can be tracked automatically.</p>



<p>By relying on those automated logs, the sphere of contagion of the newly discovered patient can easily be determined from the patient's own log and from those of the people that were in contact with that patient with the same process being extended as individuals are tested positive.</p>



<h3>How are the people you came in contact with identified? </h3>



<p>Well, that is rather simple, with the help of technology. Contact tracing relies on a mobile app which exploits the <strong>Bluetooth signal of the phone</strong> it is installed on. Bluetooth is a short-range radio system. It means that it cannot be transmitted more than a few meters. So technically if you can receive the Bluetooth signal from another phone, then this phone is in the vicinity of yours. </p>

<p>When that happens, the mobile application adds an entry to its log, saying it saw a signal from another application. The id logged is a random id that is assigned to your phone at the time you installed the app. <strong>Only the organization responsible for the application can associate this random id with your phone number</strong>. So yes, you should trust this organization for willing to not do evil.</p>



<p>That is all there is to it, contact tracing in a few paragraphs. </p>



<h3>Back to our own topic now </h3>



<p>The log kept by the contact tracing application has one important component, <strong>the timestamping</strong> of the entries. Because if you came in contact with someone more than 21 days ago (roughly the longest incubation period for COVID-19), then there is no need to contact that person as you were probably not contagious when you two came close. So yes, the base of contact tracing is recording time series and later analyzing them to reconstruct a timed graph of interactions.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2>What about Warp 10?</h2>



<p><a href="https://warp10.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warp 10</a> is our advanced time series platform. It can be used to analyze those time series, even at a large scale, at the scale of a whole population if need be. So any agency willing to put contact tracing in place should contact us, we can help.</p>



<p>Note that beyond the contact tracing some countries have used in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, there might be some other situations where more information may need to be collected, most notably actual location data when a pathogen agent is really contagious and can stay in the environment and spread without human to human contact. In that case, besides obvious debates about privacy or lack thereof that would be legitimate to have, the data collected are no longer simply time series but geo time series. And there again Warp 10 can help to analyze them.</p>



<p>The weeks to come will undoubtedly bring on the table the question of contact tracing. I hope this article helped you understand better how it works. The social implication of contact tracing will need to be balanced with the benefit that it can bring to fighting the ongoing pandemic. When those debates will have settled, remember that technology such as Warp 10 can help analyze those data fast.</p>



<p><strong>Keep safe, stay at home!</strong></p>



<p>The Ministry of Health of Singapore just announced it would be open-sourcing its own contact tracing application is used for fighting the COVID-19 outbreak.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This simple psychological trick could vastly reduce tech's carbon footprint.</p><article><p>We humans are creatures of comfort. We like taking the easy route, the low-hanging fruit, the way that doesn’t make us think.</p><p>That’s why default options and standards are so powerful. We’re more likely to stick with them than go out on a limb for the bright red options just out of reach.</p><p>In this article, I’ll show you how defaults can be used to save energy and thereby reduce CO₂ emissions in technology.</p><h2>The Default Effect</h2><p>Whether you’re designing a product, service or process, <strong>the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_effect"><em>default effect</em></a> is a powerful way to influence behavior</strong>.</p><p>Crafty webfolk use defaults to hide things from users, trick them into buying things they don’t want, giving up more personal information than they want, or signing up for newsletters they don’t need. When used to morally reproachable ends, such <a href="https://darkpatterns.org/hall-of-shame.html">dark patterns</a> can lead to quick gains. But they damage the business in the long run.</p><p>Facebook is a prime example of tricking users into sharing personal information when they assume the default settings are meant to guard their privacy. There’s even a dark pattern with its CEO’s namesake: “<a href="https://darkpatterns.org/types-of-dark-pattern/privacy-zuckering.html">privacy zuckering</a>.”</p><p>But the default effect can also be used for good intent.</p><p>For example, in Germany you have to opt-in to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organ_donation">organ donation</a> – the default option is to be opted out. The consent rate is a meager 12%. Across the border in Austria however, the default effect works in your favor. There you’re opted in per default. The consent rate is a proud 99%.</p><p>In 2015, the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/11/us/california-law-will-automatically-register-drivers-to-vote.html">“motor voter” law in California</a> was passed. It automatically registers new drivers to vote unless they opt out, thus nudging millions of Californians towards their civic responsibility.</p><h2>How Changing Defaults Would Save Energy</h2><p>Whenever data is stored on servers, transferred over telecommunications networks or processed on end user devices, the electronics involved consume electricity. The energy consumption of the internet may have already surpassed that of the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think">airline industry</a> and is more than <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/global-warming-data-centres-consume-three-times-much-energy-next-decade-experts-warn-a6830086.html">1 ⅓ times that of the UK</a> as a whole.</p><p>So by reducing the amount of data we store, transfer or process, we reduce the energy needed. Less coal, biofuels or atom rods need to be burned, fewer windmills need to turn, fewer solar panels need to operate.</p><p>So us tech workers need to ask ourselves</p><blockquote><p>Does the default option or standard use the least amount of energy possible?</p></blockquote><h2>Low Power Mode in Devices Per Default</h2><p>When your iPhone is running low on juice, it’ll ask you to turn on low-power mode. Doing so stops automatic mail fetching and background app refreshing and reduces some visual effects. But why wait until you’re running for the next outlet?</p><p>You could, of course, set up an <a href="https://medium.com/macoclock/turn-on-low-power-mode-at-any-ios14-trick-6f5cfcb3b3cd">automation to enable Low Power Mode</a> at any battery level. But that’s more of a thing for <em>power users</em> (excuse the pun 🙃).</p><p>A greener alternative for the masses would be to have low-power mode enabled by default. The system could ask whether to turn on “High Power Mode” for tasks that need it.</p><figure><picture><img loading="lazy" data-srcset="/img/green-by-default-dialog-low-power-mode.svg"></picture><figcaption><span><strong>DON'T:</strong></span> Ask to turn on Low Power Mode when the battery's already low.</figcaption></figure><figure><picture><img loading="lazy" data-srcset="/img/green-by-default-dialog-high-power-mode.svg"></picture><figcaption><span><strong>DO:</strong></span> Have Low Power Mode on by default – and ask for more power only when it's needed.</figcaption></figure><p>The Mac’s energy settings are a bit complicated. There have been calls for a simpler <a href="https://www.macrumors.com/2020/01/15/call-for-low-power-mode-for-macs/">iPhone-style Low Power Mode on MacBooks</a>.</p><p>Also, do Siri and Alexa really need to burn the candle at both ends, constantly waiting on your beckon call and sipping electricity throughout the night? They should just go to sleep when you do, maybe suggesting their own sleep times based on your latest/earliest interactions.</p><h2>Reduce web data with the “pull” principle</h2><p>Reducing the number of bytes you send to users not only corresponds to a smaller carbon footprint, it also means content loads faster, thus leading to happier users and better business metrics. So just how much web data are we talking about?</p><p>The <a href="https://httparchive.org/reports/page-weight?start=2020_01_01&amp;end=latest&amp;view=list">HTTP Archive</a> reports on the page weight of millions of websites.</p><p>I took a look at the latest median (p50) transfer sizes of the following data types and have ranked them from smallest to largest:</p><p>Median data transfer in kilobytes by type<br>(p50, October 2020)</p><p><span>Desktop</span><span>Mobile</span></p><dl><dt>HTML</dt><dd><span>25.8</span></dd><dd><span>24.1</span></dd><dt>CSS</dt><dd><span>72.7</span></dd><dd><span>66.9</span></dd><dt>Fonts</dt><dd><span>131.4</span></dd><dd><span>111.1</span></dd><dt>JavaScript</dt><dd><span>451.7</span></dd><dd><span>412.5</span></dd><dt>Images</dt><dd><span>973.4</span></dd><dd><span>902.9</span></dd><dt>Video</dt><dd><span>1538.2</span></dd><dd><span>1867.9</span></dd></dl><p>We see that in terms of the number of bytes flying around the web, <strong>videos, images and JavaScript are the biggest energy hogs</strong>.</p><p>The best way to reduce the amount of data on the web: avoiding transferring it to the user altogether until she actively requests, or <em>pulls</em>, it from the web via interaction (e.g button click) or navigation (e.g. lazy loading).</p><p>Here are some examples.</p><h3>Don’t auto-play videos</h3><p>Videos are by far the biggest offenders when it comes to putting the Internet on an energy diet.</p><p>And video chat and entertainment have exploded due to Corona. Video chat apparently has a much <a href="https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20200305-why-your-internet-habits-are-not-as-clean-as-you-think">lower impact than meeting in person</a>. I’d love to find similar comparisons between the home theater and the one that smells of overpriced popcorn and soft drinks.</p><p>Still, the point I’m trying to make in this post is: we still need to be aware of the cost of our data use and design system defaults to use minimal energy.</p><p>For example, Netflix makes it so easy for users to binge watch entire series. Not only do they provide stellar content, they auto-play it too.</p><figure><picture><img loading="lazy" data-srcset="/img/green-by-default-autoplay-1.svg"></picture><figcaption><span><strong>DON'T:</strong></span> Auto-play the next 45 minutes of your life.</figcaption></figure><figure><img loading="lazy" src="https://blr.design/img//green-by-default-autoplay-2.svg"><figcaption><span><strong>DO:</strong></span> Add a bit of friction when it comes to data consumption.</figcaption></figure><p>By having auto-play off by default, the user would have to actively play the next video. And while that might not help you right after watching a cliffhanger, it provides just a bit of friction to avoid more data transfer.</p><p>Another way streaming sites could be green by default: saving videos locally for a period of time. My child, for example, loves watching a certain show. Instead of pulling the videos from Netflix servers each time she views them, the app could just play them from the local cache if requested within a week or two. That would require quite a bit of storage on my device – but that’s not really a problem.</p><p>If you use video on your site, think about using the default effect to limit data use: you can make sure videos don’t auto-play.

December 17, 2020 | https://unop.uk/dotnet-5-self-contained-single-file-apps-linux/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://unop.uk/dotnet-5-self-contained-single-file-apps-linux/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
            

<p>.NET 5 is out <a href="https://unop.uk/dotnet-core-3-0-and-dotnet-5-0">on schedule</a> (but with a reduced scope).
The Core branding has gone but it’s the same modern cross-platform codebase and not the old Windows-only Framework.</p>

<p>I’m normally a <abbr title="Long Term Support">LTS</abbr> person (I only upgraded from Ubuntu 18.04 LTS to 20.04 LTS recently, now that 20.10 is out).
As you become an experienced engineer you learn to value LTS and stop chasing the latest JavaScript framework of the week.
Most of my projects (for example, <a href="https://unop.uk/huxley-2-release/">Huxley 2</a>) will stay on 3.1 LTS until at least next year when .NET 6 LTS comes out.</p>

<p>However, there is one feature of .NET 5 that is quite interesting and I wanted to try out.
This feature is self-contained <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-5-0/#single-file-applications">single file apps</a> and it is only available on Linux (not on mac or Windows, yet).
This is another area where Linux is a step ahead.</p>

<h2 id="octoplot">OctoPlot</h2>

<p>I’ve upgraded my <a href="https://unop.uk/octoplot-visualise-paid-energy-use-in-your-terminal/">OctoPlot</a> tool to .NET 5 and produced some self-contained single file app Linux binaries. You can stay on 3.1 and use the 5.0 SDK but the binaries are bigger. I also trimmed out any unused code from the assemblies (including <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/deploying/ready-to-run">R2R</a>, which is not the same AOT compilation as CoreRT or .NET Native) to get them as small as possible.</p>

<p>The result is a binary under 5MB compressed. This is by no means tiny compared to a Python script but it includes the runtime, making it easy to deploy. This is about a quarter of the size of the previous release artefacts.</p>

<p>If you want to see the results in action then you can <code>wget</code> (or <code>curl</code>) a binary from <a href="https://github.com/jpsingleton/octoplot/releases/1.0.1">the GitHub release</a>.
For example, on a Raspberry Pi running Raspberry Pi OS (e.g. a <a href="https://unop.uk/pi-hole-extended-part-2/">pi hole</a>) use the following commands (replace <code>arm</code> with <code>x64</code> or <code>arm64</code> as appropriate).</p>

<p>Download with <code>wget</code> (upper case <code>O</code>):</p>

<pre><code>wget -O octoplot.xz https://github.com/jpsingleton/octoplot/releases/download/1.0.1/octoplot-linux-arm.xz
</code></pre>

<p>Or if you prefer <code>curl</code> (lower case <code>o</code>):</p>

<pre><code>curl -L -o octoplot.xz https://github.com/jpsingleton/octoplot/releases/download/1.0.1/octoplot-linux-arm.xz
</code></pre>

<p><code>-L</code> is required to follow the GitHub redirect to AWS S3.</p>

<p>Then decompress the binary, make it executable and run it.</p>

<pre><code>xz -d octoplot.xz
chmod +x octoplot
./octoplot j
</code></pre>

<p>You should specify the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distribution_network_operator#History">region ID character</a> for the area you are interested in.
E.g. <code>j</code> for South East England, the default value is <code>p</code> (North Scotland).
Add it to your <code>PATH</code> if you want to run <code>octoplot</code> from anywhere.</p>

<h2 id="install">Install</h2>

<p>If you want to build it for yourself then you can install .NET 5 with your usual <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu#2004-">package manager</a>.
Before you start using it you may want to disable the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/telemetry">telemetry</a> that is on by default.
You can do this in many places, e.g. <code>~/.bashrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>export DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1
</code></pre>

<p>Or in <code>/etc/environment</code> (no need for the <code>export</code> command here) for wider reach:</p>

<pre><code>DOTNET_CLI_TELEMETRY_OPTOUT=1
</code></pre>

<p>You can also alter your <code>PATH</code> here.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>I use my <code>octoplot</code> tool to help me plan when the cheapest time will be to run appliances.
For example, when to set the timer on the oven for to be paid for it to pyrolytic auto-clean.</p>

<p>Our latest Agile bill from Octopus Energy put the average cost per kWh at about 8p, which is roughly half-price compared to fixed tariffs. This would save us over £300 a year if it continues.</p>

<p>You can use my <a href="https://unop.uk/octoyosu-agile-tariff-comparison-tool/">Octoyosu</a> tool to see how much you could save.
If you want to switch then you can thank me (and save £50) by using <a href="https://share.octopus.energy/witty-wave-889">this referral link</a>.</p>

<p>Your mileage may vary (pun intended) as we have an <a href="https://unop.uk/ev-reading/">EV</a> (a second hand Leaf) that I typically charge overnight at weekends.
I’ll save a follow-up review after a few more months of ownership for a future post but in summary it’s best car I’ve ever driven. It’s so much fun to drive and outrageously cheap to run but it still hasn’t stopped me from walking to the shops.</p>

<p>It’s not just about cost and it’s important to reduce usage too. I don’t want to be part of the problem.</p>

<p>I’ve finished reading Clearing the Air: The Beginning and the End of Air Pollution by Tim Smedley, which is excellent and well worth a read. Although EVs produce no exhaust emissions and produce less from brake wear, they still re-suspend pollution on the road produced by fossil cars. Sitting in traffic is the worst place to be from an exposure perspective, plus there’s the obvious additional negative health implications from lack of exercise.</p>

<p>Speaking of exercise, last weekend (as a lockdown project) I lagged the loft with insulation made from recycled glass, improving what was there already.
As autumn leaves (fall) and winter arrives, this should help reduce our energy usage when the freezing temperatures come in December. It helped that I’m used to wearing a face mask now!</p>

Recently someone opened up an <a href="https://github.com/elixir-gettext">issue on Gettext</a> saying compilation of Gettext modules got slower in Erlang/OTP 23. In this article, we are going to explore how I have debugged this problem and the three separate pull requests sent to the Erlang/OTP repository to improve compiler performance.</p>
<p>
For those not familar, the Gettext project converts <code>.po</code> files like this:</p>
<pre><code># pt
msgid "Hello world"
msgstr "Olá mundo"

# pl
msgid "Hello world"
msgstr "Witaj świecie"</code></pre>
<p>
Into a module with functions:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>translate</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-1">(</span><span>"pt"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"Hello world"</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-1">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Olá mundo"</span><span>
</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>translate</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-2">(</span><span>"pl"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"Hello world"</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-2">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Witaj świecie"</span></code></pre>
<p>
While we start with an Elixir application, we end-up doing most of the work with the Erlang compiler and tools, so most of the lessons here are applicable to the wider ecosystem. Be sure to read until the end for a welcome surprise.</p>
<h2>
Isolating the slow file</h2>
<p>
When project compilation is slow, the first step is to identify which files are slow. In Elixir v1.11, this can be done like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix compile --force --profile time</code></pre>
<p>
The command above will print:</p>
<pre><code>...
[profile] lib/ecto/query/planner.ex compiled in 1376ms (plus 596ms waiting)
[profile] lib/ecto/association.ex compiled in 904ms (plus 1168ms waiting)
[profile] lib/ecto/changeset.ex compiled in 869ms (plus 1301ms waiting)
[profile] Finished compilation cycle of 95 modules in 2579ms
[profile] Finished group pass check of 95 modules in 104ms</code></pre>
<p>
Compilation of each file in your project is done in parallel. The overall message is:</p>
<pre><code>[profile] FILE compiled in COMPILE_TIME (plus WAITING_TIME waiting)</code></pre>
<p>
<code>COMPILE_TIME</code> is the time we were effectively compiling code. However, since a file may depend on a module defined in another file, <code>WAITING_TIME</code> is the time we wait until the file we depend on becomes available. High waiting times are not usually a concern, so we focus on the files with high compilation times.</p>
<p>
At the end, we print two summaries:</p>
<pre><code>[profile] Finished compilation cycle of 95 modules in 2579ms
[profile] Finished group pass check of 95 modules in 104ms</code></pre>
<p>
The first includes the time to compile all files in parallel and includes how many modules have been defined. The second is the time to execute a group pass which looks at all modules at once, in order to find undefined functions, emit deprecations, etc.</p>
<p>
Unless the “group pass check” is the slow one - which would be a bug in the Elixir compiler - we are often looking at a single file being the root cause of slow compilation. With this file in hand, it is time to dig deeper.</p>
<h2>
Timing the slow file</h2>
<p>
Once we have identified the slow file, we need to understand why it is slow. When Elixir compiles a file, it executes code at three distinct stages. For example, let’s assume the slow down was in <code>lib/problematic_file.ex</code> that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span># FILE LEVEL</span><span>
</span><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>ProblematicModule</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0623758596-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span># MODULE LEVEL</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0623758596-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span># FUNCTION LEVEL</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="0623758596-2">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="0623758596-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
When compiling the file above, Elixir will execute each level in order. If that file has multiple modules, then compilation will happen for each module in the file, first at MODULE LEVEL and then FUNCTION LEVEL.</p>

TIP: If a file with multiple modules is slow, I suggest breaking those modules into separate files and repeating the steps in the previous section.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
With this knowledge in hand, we want to compile the file once again, but now passing the <code>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time</code> flag to the underlying Erlang compiler, which will print time reports. One option is to do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix compile
$ touch lib/problematic_file.ex
$ ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time mix compile</code></pre>
<p>
Then, for each module being compiled (which includes the one in your <code>mix.exs</code>), you will see a report like this:</p>
<pre><code>core             :  0.653 s   72136.4 kB
sys_core_fold    :  0.482 s   69055.3 kB
sys_core_alias   :  0.146 s   69055.3 kB
core_transforms  :  0.000 s   69055.3 kB
sys_core_bsm     :  0.098 s   69055.3 kB
v3_kernel        :  2.250 s  169439.0 kB</code></pre>
<p>
Most compilers work by doing multiple passes on your code. Above we can see how much time was spent on each pass and how much memory the code representation, also known as Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), takes after each pass.</p>
<p>
The <code>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time mix compile</code> command above has one issue though. If other files depend on the problematic file, they may be recompiled too, and that will add noise to your output. If that’s the case, you can also do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time mix run lib/problematic_file.ex</code></pre>
<p>
This is a rather neat trick: we are re-running a file that we have just compiled. You will get warnings about modules being redefined but they are safe to ignore.</p>
<p>
With the time reports in hand, there are two possible scenarios here:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
One (or several) of the passes in the report are slow. This means the slow down happens when compiling at the FUNCTION LEVEL and it will be associated with the generation of the <code>.beam</code> file for <code>ProblematicModule</code>    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
All passes are fast and the slow down happens before the reports emitted by <code>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time</code> are printed. If this is the case, the slowdown is actually happening at the MODULE LEVEL, before the generation of the <code>.beam</code> file    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Most times, the slowdown is actually at the FUNCTION LEVEL, including the one reported as a Gettext issue, so that’s the one we will explore. Performance issues at the MODULE LEVEL may still happen though, especially in large module bodies as seen in Phoenix’s Router - but don’t worry, those have often already been optimized throughout the years!</p>
<h2>
Moving to Erlang</h2>
<p>
At this point, we have found a module that is slow to compile. Given the original Gettext issue pointed to a difference of performance between Erlang versions, my next step is to remove Elixir from the equation.</p>
<p>
Luckily, this is very easy to do with the <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/decompile">decompile</a> project:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix archive.install github michalmuskala/decompile
$ mix decompile ProblematicModule --to erl</code></pre>
<p>
This command will emit a <code>Elixir.ProblematicModule.erl</code> file, which is literally the compiled Elixir code, represented in Erlang. Now, let’s compile it again, but without involving Elixir at all:</p>
<pre><code>$ erlc +time Elixir.ProblematicModule.erl</code></pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>
TIP: the command above may not work out of the box. That’s because the <code>.erl</code> file generated by <code>decompile</code> may have invalid syntax. In those cases, you can manually fix those errors. They are often small nits.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you want to try it yourself, you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/josevalim/694c1799143fcf25e43aa27e3e11e4c1">find the <code>.erl</code> file for the Gettext report here</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ erlc +time Elixir.GettextCompile.Gettext.erl</code></pre>
<p>
Here are the relevant snippets of the report I got on my machine:</p>
<pre><code>...
expand_records         :      0.065 s   19988.0 kB
core                   :      3.295 s  373293.3 kB
...
beam_ssa_bool          :      1.125 s   39252.7 kB
...
beam_ssa_bsm           :      2.432 s   39263.1 kB
   ...
beam_ssa_funs          :      0.119 s   39263.1 kB
beam_ssa_opt           :      6.242 s   39298.0 kB
   ...
...
beam_ssa_pre_codegen   :      3.426 s   48897.5 kB
   ...
...</code></pre>
<p>
Looking at the report you can start building an intuition about which passes are slow. Given we were also told the code compiled fast on Erlang/OTP 22.3, I compiled the same file with that Erlang version and compared the reports side by side. Here are my notes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
The <code>core</code> pass got considerably slower between Erlang/OTP versions (from 1.8s to 3.2s)    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Going from the <code>expand_records</code> pass to <code>core</code> increases the memory usage by almost 20 times (although this behaviour was also there on Erlang/OTP 22)    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
The <code>beam_ssa_bool</code> did not exist on Erlang/OTP 22    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
In Erlang/OTP 22.3, the module takes 22 seconds to compile. On version 23.1, it takes 32 seconds. We have some notes and a reasonable target of 22 seconds to optimize towards. Let’s get to work.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
Note: it is worth saying that it is very natural for new passes to be added and others to be removed between Erlang/OTP versions, precisely because the compiler is getting smarter all the time! As part of this process, some passes get faster and others get slower. Such is life. :)  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
Pull request #1: the profiler option</h2>
<p>
The Erlang compiler also has a neat feature that alows us to profile any compiler pass. Since we have detected the slow down in the <code>core</code> file, let’s profile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ erlc +'{eprof, core}' Elixir.ProblematicModule.erl</code></pre>
<p>
It will print a report like this:</p>
<pre><code>core: Running eprof

****** Process &lt;0.111.0&gt;    -- 100.00 % of profiled time ***
FUNCTION                   CALLS        %      TIME  [uS / CALLS]

gen:do_for_proc/2              1     0.00         0  [      0.00]
gen:'-call/4-fun-0-'/4         1     0.00         0  [      0.00]
v3_core:unforce/2              2     0.00         0  [      0.00]

v3_core:expr_map/4             1     0.00         0  [      0.00]
v3_core:safe_map/2             1     0.00         0  [      0.00]</code></pre>
<p>
With the slowest entries coming at the bottom. In this Gettext module, the slowest entry was:</p>
<pre><code>cerl_trees:mapfold/4     3220377    19.14   2447684  [      0.76]</code></pre>
<p>
Jackpot! 20% of the compilation time was spent on a single function. This is a great opportunity for optimization.</p>
<p>
I usually like to say there are two types of performance improvements. You have semantic improvements, which you can only pull off by having a grasp of the domain. The more you understand, the more likely you are to be able to come up with an improved algorithm (or the more you will be certain you are already implementing the state of the art). There are also mechanical improvements, which are more about how the runtime and the data structures in the language work. Often you work with a mixture of both.</p>
<p>
In this case, the function <code>cerl_trees:mapfold/4</code> is a function that traverses all AST nodes recursively. You can also see it was called more than 3 million times. The <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/db13f8883721c7a217a80cb2c73a1e419f462d83/lib/compiler/src/v3_core.erl#L3040">caller of this function in the <code>core</code> pass has the following goal</a>:</p>

              <p>If you’re of a certain age, then you remember Pez, the candy, and even more so, the ingenious spring-loaded mechanical dispensers. They were the kid’s equivalent of a gold cigarette lighter.</p>
<p>Some things I bet you didn’t know:</p>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Pez originated in Austria and was originally marketed as a smoking cessation aid.</li>
<li>Pez tablets started out peppermint flavored. The name comes from the first, middle, and last letters in the German word for peppermint (pfefferminz).</li>
<li>The transition from breath mint to fruit flavored candy was driven by the plan to market Pez to kids.</li>
<li>The iconic Pez dispenser design is patented.</li>
<li>Some of the rarest Pez dispensers now sell for thousands of dollars.</li>
</ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>This is a post I've been wanting to write for a while now. I want to put down in layman's terms what various cryptographic operations represent, and common use cases for them. When designing large systems we don't need to get bogged down in details of how a Diffie-Hellman handshake works, what we need are abstractions, patterns and black boxes we can effectively use together and reason about.</p><p>With this post I hope to present terms you may or may not have heard before, hopefully with a few examples, one for anyone to understand and at least one for developers to understand.</p><p>Before we go any further it's worth mentioning the old adage - never roll your own crypto. Always build on proven, audited libraries and preferably get the implementation looked at by someone who knows what they're doing. Cryptographic operations can fail (often silently) in unpredictable ways, leaving you stuck with the assumption that what you've built is secure, when it's really not.</p><div><h2 id="hashing">Hashing</h2><p>Hashing has many, many use cases in the digital world. For our purposes it can be easiest to explain hashing as a deep check for equality. Given two things (files, sentences, words, images) how do we ascertain that they are identical? This can be hard to reason about outside of computing because almost never are two items perfectly equal.</p><h5 id="in-a-system">In a system</h5><p>The most common use case almost all of us will be familiar with is password hashing. When users enter their password we don’t want to store that in plaintext, if a database of raw user passwords was leaked it’d be catastrophic. What we do instead is hash the password and store that. If the database is ever leaked the user passwords can’t be reversed from the hash.</p><p>I don’t need to provide another example for hashing because it’s so common, however let’s briefly look at how we might leverage hashing to build a custom image caching system. When we browse user profiles on a mobile application, the mobile application (hopefully) doesn’t fetch the images every time you see the image. What it <em>could</em> do, to save bandwidth, is just send the hash of the current image to the server. The server checks if this hash matches the hash of the latest upload, and only sends the new image if it doesn’t match, meaning the clients version is outdated.</p><h2 id="symmetric-encryption">Symmetric encryption</h2><p>Symmetric encryption is something most of us are probably familiar with, however if not, it’s simply the act of encrypting something with a key. If you don’t have the key, you can’t decrypt the data.</p><p>A good analogy can be to liken symmetric encryption with a safe. It’s big, heavy and you know whatever’s in there is going to be private. If you’ve got the combination - awesome - you’ve got full access to it. If not, you’re out of luck and you’re gonna have to try break it open.</p><h5 id="in-a-system-1">In a system</h5><p>As a practical example of symmetric encryption in a wider digital system, imagine you want to save data in the cloud. You’ve run out of space on your laptop and want to use Dropbox to store your data. Just sending your data to Dropbox is a recipe for disaster, anyone at Dropbox would be able to view your private information. However if you generate a symmetric key and encrypt your data with it before sending it to Dropbox, you know no one else is going to be able to see it.</p><h2 id="asymmetric-encryption">Asymmetric encryption</h2><p>Asymmetric encryption is a really powerful concept we can model entire systems around. It all boils down to there being a different key for encryption and decryption.</p><p>As a simple example, let’s liken asymmetric encryption to a letterbox. With a letterbox anyone can put mail in it, however only people with the key can read said mail. This is at odds with symmetric encryption from our previous example, where you need the key to put anything into the box.</p><h5 id="in-a-system-2">In a system</h5><p>I’ve struggled here to just pick one example to explore, but perhaps the most relevant is encrypted communication. With asymmetric encryption you have a public key (this is what others see, like the name on your letterbox) and you have a private key (like the name suggests, this one should be kept secret - otherwise anyone could open your letterbox). When two users want to communicate securely they simply encrypt their messages to the recipients public key. Now no one else other than those two can read their messages. To spell this out:</p><ul><li>User B (recipient) publishes their public key</li><li>User A (sender) encrypts a message to B’s public key</li><li>User A sends the encrypted message to B</li><li>User B receives the message and decrypts it with their private key.</li></ul><h2 id="signatures">Signatures</h2><p>Another great aspect of asymmetric cryptography is the ability to provide proof that a message came from someone in particular. To use the mail analogy again, this can be thought of as a stamp on the letter. You know that only Steve has the stamp “Steve’s stamp”, so you can trust any letter with this to be from him.</p><h5 id="in-a-system-3">In a system</h5><p>Digital signatures are used almost everywhere in the internet today. In the context of cryptocurrency and blockchains, every transaction you send it accompanied by a signature over the payload you’re sending - asserting that it came from you.</p><p>Let’s also take a moment to think about internal or external communication between various services you’ve written. How do you know when a request comes from your payments service that it’s really your payments service sending this message? When a user of your website does an action (buying an item, for example), how do you tie that action to the right user?</p><p>A common solution is signed payloads, <a href="https://jwt.io/">JSON Web Tokens</a> being a popular specification to follow. A session token is any many aspects just a signature over some payload you’ve provided, an assertion that at some point this user authenticated with you. A basic user authentication flow might go:</p><ul><li>User sends you their username and password</li><li>You verify that the password hash matches the saved hash for this username</li><li>You generate a signed payload that includes their unique ID and potentially anything else you don’t want to have to read from the database for every request.</li></ul><p>Now every request that comes to your server can just verify the signature provided, and you allow them access to the system based on that.</p><h2 id="blind-signatures">Blind Signatures</h2><p>A blind signature is one where the signer doesn’t need to about the contents of the message. This can be hard to reason about but one simple example is in an election voting situation. Alice comes in to vote and proves her identity to the officials at the location. After voting (her choice remains a secret) she hands the sealed envelope to the official, who signs and submits it. In this case the signer has no idea what choice Alice has made, however later at the vote counting station we can verify that this envelope is valid because it was signed by an official.</p><h5 id="in-a-system-4">In a system</h5><p>We could improve upon the above voting example and think about payments. Imagine we’re wanting to make a payment somewhere and not have the merchant know our identity, this is where we could leverage blind signatures to make transactions privately.</p><ol><li>We go to the bank and ask for a cheque for $100</li><li>We take this cheque and send our order to a shop (anonymously), asking for $100 worth of goods</li><li>The shop can verify this blind signature with the bank and send our goods to our specified address</li><li>We’ve successfully completed a purchase without either the bank knowing what we’re buying, or the merchant knowing who we are.</li></ol><h2 id="secret-sharing">Secret sharing</h2><p>I’ve wracked my brain for hours trying to think of a good analogy for secret sharing, but I wasn’t able to come up with one. Essentially it comes down to (what seems like) magic, you and another party are able to agree on something without ever communicating, it’s pretty cool.</p><p>What we’re talking about here are Diffie-Hellman key exchanges. They underpin almost all modern communication. Most of your browser traffic these days is secured via TLS (which implies some kind of key exchange between your browser and the server) however I’d like to explore another cool use case in the context of privacy preserving applications.</p><p>Before we dive into the example, at the highest level a Diffie-Hellman key exchange works as follows:</p><ul><li><code>DH(Alice's public key, Bob's private key) = shared_secret</code></li><li><code>DH(Bob's public key, Alice's private key) = shared_secret</code></li></ul><p>This <code>shared_secret</code> is only computable by Alice and Bob, no one else would be able to figure it out.</p><h5 id="a-use-case">A use case</h5><p>Let’s explore how we could build a privacy preserving messaging platform using a centralised database. At its most basic (and totally open) a message between two parties would look like this:</p><table><thead><tr><th>from</th><th>to</th><th>payload</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alice</td><td>Bob</td><td>Hi!</td></tr><tr><td>Bob</td><td>Alice</td><td>Hey! What’s up?</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>This is how most applications have been built for the last twenty years. Maybe data is encrypted at rest, but in my experience working at software companies encryption at rest means nothing, every employee still has access to this data on demand, in the worst case it’s a Jira ticket away.</p><p>Step one in our privacy preserving journey is to encrypt the data swapped between parties, Alice encrypts messages to Bob’s public key and vice-versa. Now we as the providers of this service can’t see the data being swapped:</p><table><thead><tr><th>from</th><th>to</th><th>payload</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Alice</td><td>Bob</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>Bob</td><td>Alice</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table><p>However here we can unfortunately still tell that Alice and Bob are communicating. What could we do to hide the communication between these two?</p><p>One solution I’ll propose - which also has the benefit of sender privacy, so we’re killing two birds with one stone here - would be to generate a shared secret and hash it with the recipients identifier. Now messages just have a <code>payload</code> and a <code>to</code> property. The <code>to</code></p><table><thead><tr><th>to</th><th>payload</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>HASH(alice_bob_shared_secret, Bob)</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>HASH(alice_bob_shared_secret, Alice)</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>HASH(alice_bob_shared_secret, Bob)</td><td>XXXXXXXXXXXXXX</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr><tr><td>…</td><td>…</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Remember only Alice and Bob can generate this shared secret, and the HASH function is some irreversible function that hides its content. Now whenever Bob wants to find messages from Alice he computes <code>HASH(alice_bob_shared_secret, Bob)</code> and queries all messages that match that <code>to</code> field.</p><p>As you can see now we only …</p></div></div>

	<section>
		<p>Working in many different environments provided me a good perspective on what scaling models are applied by different companies. Today I'd like to spend a bunch of keystrokes on one of the worst scaling models I've ever encountered.</p><p>I call it:</p><blockquote>Scaling by bubbling the problems out</blockquote><p>A <em>'busy person'</em>, usually a leader or manager, identifies a persistent problem within the organization: something that consumes focus and time, impacts the quality, slows down the value delivery, etc. This problem is either completely new (caused by the growth) or has evolved over time, but now its severity is more apparent.</p><p>Here are a few examples (of such problems) to make sure we're on the same page:</p><ul><li><strong>the number of quality defects</strong> (for the whole product) is increasing; until now, each team had been able to deal with their deliverables' quality</li><li><strong>the quality of internal communication</strong> deteriorates - people start complaining they don't know what's happening in the org, there are more and more misunderstandings and misalignments</li><li>the engineering unit needs to grow, and the <strong>recruitment takes more time increasingly</strong> - hereby hemorrhaging the last reserves of time of the unit's manager</li></ul><p>Initially, such a problem is dealt with in an ad-hoc way (through a one-off, point-directed action). But it keeps popping up back (as due to its nature, it can't be eliminated permanently). Apparently, that kind of a problem requires continuous effort and ownership (to make sure it doesn't get out of control).</p><p>Finally, the <em>'busy person'</em> (mentioned above) decides that burying her/his head in the sand won't work anymore, so why not do what all the handbooks advise?</p><p>That sounds like a tremendous idea, but the devil is in details. The <em>'busy person'</em> doesn't delegate responsibility, function, or role. (S)he <strong>outsources</strong> the problem by creating a new (formal or no) position (or even a sub-unit) to deal with that problem, so all the annoyances are out of the <em>'busy person's'</em> back.</p><p>This way the problem is contained within some sort of a <strong>bubble</strong>, but it's someone else's bubble! Problem-related black box our <em>'busy person'</em> doesn't have to worry about.</p><p>Got it?</p><ul><li>Problem <strong>X</strong> -&gt; <strong>X</strong> Manager / <strong>X</strong> Team</li><li><strong>Quality </strong>problem -&gt; <strong>Quality </strong>Manager / <strong>Quality </strong>(Assurance) Team</li><li><strong>Communication </strong>problem -&gt; <strong>Communication </strong>Manager / <strong>Communication</strong> Team</li><li><strong>Recruitment </strong>problem -&gt; <strong>Recruitment </strong>Manager / <strong>Recruitment </strong>Team</li></ul><p>Oh, how convenient is that! If the problem re-appears, it's clear who's guilt...^M^M^M to be asked to fix the situation.</p><p>As the crisis is prevented now, the <em>'busy person'</em> continues with her/his quest, smug and oblivious to the consequences of the change just made ...</p><p>Yes, it seems that short-term, we're all good here. Putting someone in charge of the crisis sounds like a decent plan. But it's not really what happened here. A new position has been spawned <strong>not to solve</strong> the actual problem (which may be hidden and unobvious) <strong>but to patch</strong> its visible symptoms, potentially making the organization more complex, inter-dependent, and bureaucratic.</p><p>Instead of well-thought-through systemic change, we're adding a sub-unit (usually with the manager in charge) with the responsibility of dealing with problem X. If you had any hopes for getting rid of problem X permanently - abandon any faith in that. If problem X is the sole reason for the sub-unit's existence, it will subliminally act <strong>to preserve and solidify</strong> that problem (under control, but still).</p><p>In more simple words:</p><ol><li>no wider context</li><li>no holistic view (to understand the flow of work and value, or the nature of the problem)</li><li>no systemic approach (System's Theory)</li></ol><p>While in fact the solutions to before-mentioned problems may be much more simple and straightforward:</p><ul><li><strong>the quality issues</strong> may be a result of reaching the critical capacity of manual regression testing (with test automation as a likely answer) or pushing quality checks towards the end of process (e.g. by not doing proper reviews)</li><li><strong>internal communication</strong> could deteriorate because of the increasing number of actors - a good idea is to check the component/area boundaries to verify the number &amp; validity of dependencies; other potential root cause may be an underlying conflict or misaligned priorities of two (or more) parties</li><li><strong>extensive recruitment</strong> will be a problem if you centralize the 'gating' too much - although acquiring talent is manager's/leader's duty, (s)he should get a lot of control over it directly to the teams (who are looking for more members) - it's their skin in the game of getting the most proper people on board</li></ul><hr><p>Just to make sure I'm clear - what I'm saying here is not against the popular principle of <em>'single-threaded teams'</em> (ones dedicated end-to-end, exclusively to well-defined narrow topic). I'm all for crystal-clear focus and unequivocal responsibility range, but the area covered by such a team should be <strong>defined by product/service vision</strong>, instead of what kind of piece of garbage has been thrown over the fence to save you some time ...</p>

<p>I was reading the
<a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_5.10">Linux 5.10 release summary on KernelNewbies</a>, and a
section stood out to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1.6. Static calls for improved post-Spectre performance</p>

  <p>Static calls are a replacement for global function pointers. They use code patching to allow
direct calls to be used instead of indirect calls. They give the flexibility of function pointers,
but with improved performance. This is especially important for cases where retpolines would
otherwise be used, as retpolines can significantly impact performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of time looking at the Linux kernel, but never directly at its indirect call
setup or post-<a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a> mitigations. These changes sound very cool,
so I’m going to use this post to try and explain and understand them (both to myself and others).</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: One of the original authors of the patchset has emailed me with some corrections
and answers to the questions that I ask below. I’ve marked each with either “Correction” or
“Update.” Thanks, Peter!</p>

<h2 id="background-indirect-calls-spectre-and-retpolines">Background: indirect calls, Spectre, and retpolines</h2>

<h3 id="indirect-calls">Indirect calls</h3>

<p>Indirect calls are one of C’s most powerful language features, and are critical for writing
higher-order code without a supplementary object or function/method dispatch system.</p>

<p>Most C programmers are familiar with the basics of indirect calls, thanks to standard and POSIX
functions like <code>qsort</code> and <code>pthread_create</code>: each takes a <em>function pointer</em>, which it then
calls internally to complete the functionality of the surrounding call:</p>

<p>Observe: our <code>call</code> goes through a memory or register operand (<code>[rbp - 8]</code>)<sup id="fnref:opt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:opt">1</a></sup> to get the target,
instead of a direct target specified by the operand value itself (like, say,
<code>call 0xacabacab ; @good_rand</code>). That’s what makes it indirect.</p>

<p>But we can go even further than this! Indeed, a common pattern in C is to declare
entire <em>structures</em> of operations, using each to parametrize a lower level set of behaviors
(for example, the core POSIX I/O APIs) over independent implementations.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, this technique isn’t limited to userspace: the Linux kernel itself makes
aggressive use of indirect calls, particularly in architecture-agnostic interfaces
(like the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html">VFS</a> and sub-specializations
like <code>procfs</code>) and the architecture-specific internals of subsystems like
<a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><code>perf_events</code></a>.</p>

<p>So that’s neat. It’s so neat that CPU engineers got all
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor#Indirect_branch_predictor">hot in the pants</a> trying
to squeeze extra performance out of them<sup id="fnref:perf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:perf">2</a></sup>, and we ended up with
<a href="https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf">Spectre v2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="spectre-v2">Spectre (v2)</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/spectre.png" alt="The Spectre logo"></p>

<p>The exact mechanism that Spectre v2 (also known as
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715">CVE-2017-5715</a>) exploits is
<em>slightly</em> out of scope of this post, but at a high level:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Modern (x86) CPUs contain an <em>indirect branch predictor</em>, which attempts to guess the target
of an indirect call or jump.</p>

    <p>To actually speed things up, the CPU <strong>speculatively executes</strong> the
 predicted branch:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A correct prediction means that the indirect call completes significantly faster
 (since it’s already executing or has finished executing speculatively);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A misprediction <strong>should</strong> result in a slower (but still
 successful) indirect call with <strong>no side effects from the incorrect speculation.</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In other words: the CPU is responsible for <strong>rolling back</strong> any side effects associated
 with any misprediction and subsequent speculation. Mis-speculation is a <em>microarchitectural</em>
 detail that should not manifest in <em>architectural</em> changes, like modified registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rolling back</strong> any mis-speculated state is a relatively expensive operation, with a lot of
microarchitectural implications: cache lines and other bits of state need to be fixed up so that
the <em>actual</em> program control flow isn’t tainted by failed speculations.</p>

    <p>In practice, rolling back the entire speculated state would undo most of the advantages
 of speculating in the first place. Instead of doing that, x86 and other ISAs will just mark
 (many) of the bits of speculated state (like cache lines) as stale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This fixup behavior (either reverting or marking speculated state) results in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack"><em>side-channel</em></a>: an attacker can
<em>train</em> the branch predictor to speculatively execute a bit of code
(not unlike a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">ROP gadget</a>) that modifies
a piece of microarchitectural state in a data-dependent manner, such as a cache entry
whose address is dependent on a secret value that was speculatively fetched.</p>

    <p>The attacker can then <em>probe</em> that microarchitectural state by <strong>timing</strong> access to it:
 fast accesses indicate a speculatively modified state, disclosing the secret.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The original Spectre v2 attack focused on cache lines since they’re relatively easy to time, even
from high level (and sandboxed!) languages that don’t have access to
<a href="https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_30.html"><code>clflush</code></a> or other cache-line
primitives on x86. But the concept is a general one: it’s difficult to execute speculatively without
leaking <em>some</em> information, and subsequent vulnerabilities (like <a href="https://mdsattacks.com/">MDS</a> and
<a href="https://zombieloadattack.com/">ZombieLoad</a>) have exposed information leaks in other
microarchitectural features.</p>

<p>This is bad news: an attacker running one of the <strong>safest</strong> contexts (JavaScript or other managed
code, in a sandbox, in userspace) can conceivably train the indirect branch predictor to
speculatively execute a gadget in kernelspace, potentially
<a href="https://cyber.wtf/2017/07/28/negative-result-reading-kernel-memory-from-user-mode/">disclosing kernel memory</a>.</p>

<p>So, the kernel needed a new mitigation. That mitigation is <em>retpolines</em>.</p>

<h3 id="retpolines">Retpolines</h3>

<p>To mitigate Spectre v2, the kernel needs to prevent the CPU from speculating on an attacker
controlled indirect branch.</p>

<p>A retpoline (short for <em>ret</em>urn
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampoline_(computing)"><em>trampoline</em></a>) does exactly that: indirect
jumps and calls are surrounded by a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk">thunk</a> that
effectively traps the speculated execution in an infinite loop, spinning it until the misprediction
is resolved.</p>

<p>Intel’s
<a href="https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/api-app/sites/default/files/Retpoline-A-Branch-Target-Injection-Mitigation.pdf">Retpoline whitepaper</a>
has some helpful illustrations:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/retpoline.png" alt="A visualization of speculative execution with and without a retpoline."></p>

<p>This works by converting the indirect control flow from an <em>indirect branch</em> to an
<em>indirect return</em><sup id="fnref:allreturns" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:allreturns">3</a></sup>, hence the “ret” in retpoline. Returns are <em>also</em> predicted,
but with an additional mechanism given priority: the
<a href="https://blog.stuffedcow.net/2018/04/ras-microbenchmarks/">Return Stack Buffer</a><sup id="fnref:rsb" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rsb">4</a></sup>. To ensure that
the RSB can’t be maliciously trained away from the infinite loop, the retpoline begins with a
direct <code>CALL</code> that primes the RSB to always<sup id="fnref:notalways" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notalways">5</a></sup> predict the infinite loop.</p>

<p>Here’s what an indirect call retpoline <em>actually</em> looks like<sup id="fnref:ool" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ool">6</a></sup>, simplified significantly from
the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.14/source/arch/x86/lib/retpoline.S">kernel</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.14/source/arch/x86/include/asm/nospec-branch.h">source</a>:</p>

</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></div></div>

<p>…all of that to replace a simple <code>call [rax]</code>!</p>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

<p>There are repercussions for this kind of trickery:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s slow when correctly predicted: we’ve replaced a single indirect <code>CALL</code> with at least two
direct <code>CALL</code>s, plus a <code>RET</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s <em>really</em> slow when mispredicted: we <em>literally</em> spin in place using <code>PAUSE</code> and <code>LFENCE</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s a ROP gadget, so it <em>looks</em> like an exploit primitive. That means it screws with Intel’s
<a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/4d/2a/control-flow-enforcement-technology-preview.pdf">CET</a>
and similar protections on other platforms. Intel claims that newer hardware will support “enhanced

Something so mind-altering that it questions your definition of what you’ve known to be true for so long. I imagine the first people to watch a film or see an airplane felt this. It’s an inexplicable energy that has the power to redefine. In many ways, artists have been at the center of challenging commonly held beliefs, and using entirely new mediums to express speculative ideas. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-fa7pc"><span><span>While never the first thing to come to mind when discussing art, creative coding is revolutionizing what art is and can be. As we enter a more digital world, creative coding may be the contemporary art movement we need in order to articulate major societal challenges we are facing as technology advances. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-gar4"><span><span>Put simply, creative coding is an emerging specialty that utilizes code and programming as a medium to create art. Programming’s versatility and ubiquitous nature makes it especially expressive, allowing it to manifest itself as digital paintings, data visualization, or even robotics. </span></span></p><p id="viewer-aesrq"><span><span>Unlike the functional focus of most uses of code - like the code lines of a navigation app - creative coding uses programming languages for a solely artistic purpose.</span></span></p><p id="viewer-bg2ev"><span><span>As artists, we generally hold a stigma regarding coding having high barriers to entry, and as engineers, we also hold a stigma surrounding the difficulties of creative expression.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Get Elm with hot reloading on top of IHP, the new framework that makes Haskell a cool kid in web dev.</p><article><p><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a> was my gateway drug into type-safe functional programming. It's such a good tool for making robust frontends. Writing big projects in React and TypeScript honestly bums me out because of it.</p><p>I have always wanted have to have the equivalent type-safe joy on the backend like I have with Elm.</p><p>Now I have it all, with SSR included and an amazing developer experience 😍</p><p><strong><a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/">IHP</a> is a new web framework that has opened a wide door for the web development community to get into Haskell.</strong> Like Rails and Laravel, it's great for quick prototyping, well documented and easy to use.</p><p>It even has the pipe operator (<code>|&gt;</code>) included making it even more similar to the Elm syntax.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer: This tutorial should work for Mac and Linux. If you develop on Windows, it might not work without some tweaks on your own</strong></p><h2>Create a new IHP Project</h2><p>If you haven't installed IHP already, make sure you do. <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://ihp.digitallyinduced.com/Guide/installation.html">It's surprisingly easy to get going</a>.</p><p>Start a fresh IHP project for this tutorial. Luckily, it couldn't be easier as soon as IHP is properly installed.</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>To verify the app is working, cd into the <code>ihp-with-elm</code> folder and run <code>./start</code>.</p><h2>Update .gitignore</h2><p>Let's update <code>.gitignore</code> as soon as possible to avoid pushing unwanted stuff into git.</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><h2>Initialize node and elm</h2><p>In your <code>default.nix</code> file in the root folder, add <code>Node.js</code> and <code>elm</code> to <code>otherDeps</code>:</p><code-editor language="nix"></code-editor><p>To update your local environment, close the server <strong>(ctrl+c)</strong> and run</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>Then initialize Node.js and elm at the project root.</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>For this tutorial, we will rename the <code>src</code> folder that elm generated into <code>elm</code>.</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>Set the source directories folder to <strong>"elm"</strong> in <code>elm.json</code>.</p><code-editor language="json"></code-editor><h2>Getting the Haskell template ready</h2><p>Let's start writing the Elm entrypoint into the Haskel template.</p><p>Go to <code>Web/View/Static/Welcome.hs</code> and replace all the html inside the HSX in <code>VelcomeView</code>:</p><code-editor language="hs"></code-editor><p>If your IHP app is not already running, run it with <code>./start</code> and see the output on <code>localhost:8000</code>.</p><p><img src="https://driftercode.com/images/archive/ihp-with-elm/elm-not-loaded.jpg" alt="Elm not running" loading="lazy"></p><p>As you see, Elm has not been loaded, because we naturally haven't written any Elm code yet. Let's close the server <strong>(ctrl+c)</strong> and do that now.</p><h2>Setting up Elm</h2><p>Install <code>node-elm-compiler</code> for compiling and <code>elm-hot</code> for hot reloading in development. <code>parcel-bundler</code> is a "zero config" JavaScript bundler.</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>You could do it all without a bundler like Parcel. IHP discourages bundlers, and I agree that it's not always necessary.</p><p>Still, Parcel provides valuable niceties like tight production minification and good hot reloading in development, so I prefer to use Parcel when things get a bit more advanced.</p><p>Create <code>index.js</code> and <code>Main.elm</code> in the elm folder:</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>The <code>elm/index.js</code> should look like this to initialize the Elm file.</p><code-editor language="javascript"></code-editor><p>Finally, lets' insert the code for <code>elm/Main.elm</code>!</p><code-editor language="elm"></code-editor><p>Add the <code>start</code> and <code>build</code> scripts into the <code>package.json</code>:</p><code-editor language="json"></code-editor><p>You should now be able to run <code>npm start</code> in one terminal and <code>./start</code> in another terminal.</p><p>There you should have it! Elm in Haskell with hot reloading and the Elm debugger is ready for you in the bottom right corner. Beautiful!</p><p><img src="https://driftercode.com/images/archive/ihp-with-elm/elm-loaded.jpg" alt="Elm running" loading="lazy"></p><h2>Build for production</h2><p>When pushing your IHP app to production, you need to make sure that it builds the Elm applications.</p><p>Go to the <code>Makefile</code> in the project root and append this line to the list of <code>JS_FILES</code>:</p><code-editor language="makefile"></code-editor><p>And put this at the bottom of the Makefile.</p><code-editor language="makefile"></code-editor><p>It should now be ready to ship to production for example to IHP Cloud.</p><p>For a complete overview of what has been done, see the <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/kodeFant/ihp-with-elm/commit/485726d51b0c167e27e660d9696f0d289378314a">diff on my demo-repo</a>.</p><h2>Bonus: Run IHP and the frontend in one command</h2><p>Running two commands to start up the service can be difficult for a very lazy developer.</p><p><code>concurrently</code> is a tool that lets you spawn and kill multiple commands as one.</p><p>Install it as a developer dependency through npm:</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>Then replace the <code>start</code> script in <code>package.json</code> and add accordingly:</p><code-editor language="json"></code-editor><p>With that you can now run both the IHP app and the JavaScript simultaneously with this single command.</p><code-editor language="bash"></code-editor><p>And quit with <strong>(ctrl+c)</strong> as always.</p><h2>Things I don't use Elm for in IHP</h2><p>IHP gives you HTML templating (HSX) with pure functions, very similar to Elm. In that regard it's partially overlapping with Elm.</p><p>It can be a blurry line for beginners, so here are my recommendations for how to set those lines.</p><ul><li>Use HSX for <strong>basic HTML</strong>, even if it requires a couple of lines of JavaScript. I would for example write a basic hamburger menu in HSX/HTML.</li><li>Use HSX for <strong>forms</strong>. Forms are pretty much always a bigger pain written in app code. If you have been living in the Single Page App world for a while, you will realize forms written in normal HTML is not that bad. IHP gives you a convenient way of writing forms with server-side validation.</li><li>Use Elm for the <strong>advanced UI stuff</strong> requiring heavy use of DOM manipulation. Elm shines in writing user interfaces with high complexity. If the lines of JavaScript are getting too many, turn to Elm!</li><li>Do you want the content to have <strong>SSR</strong> for search engine optimization? Use HSX.</li></ul><p>So unless you really want to write a full Single Page App, Elm should be used with restraint in IHP, for only specific supercharged parts of the site.</p><p><strong>Most sites are actually better off outputting just HTML and CSS.</strong></p><h2>Next up</h2><p>I want to take this application further in future posts showing you how to interact between IHP and Elm, and how use Elm within protected boundaries (requiring authentication). Stay tuned if these are topics that intrigue you 😊</p></article></div>]]>

<h4>Summary </h4>
<p> HF Radios are important for military communications. IP is widely used       
  and is the basis for most network communication. This paper looks at         
use of IP over HF Radio and the efficiency of different types of application     
    over IP. The key findings are:                   </p>
<ul>
  <li>That IP can be operated over HF Radio, and that doing so may be            
   useful, particularly to enable support of applications that are only          
     available to run over IP.</li>
  <li> That most IP based applications running over a HF link will make          
     very inefficient use of the HF link, and that direct application use        
       of the HF link using STANAG 5066 will give much better 
performance.</li></ul>
<p>This paper concludes that applications intended for regular use over          
 HF Radio should not use IP and should instead be directly integrated           
with STANAG 5066.</p></blockquote-wp>
<h2>IP</h2>
<p>IP (Internet Protocol) is the basis of the Internet, and the most widely      
     used protocol. It supports a number of transports, including TCP, UDP       
    and RTP, and a myriad of end applications. IP is the universal interface     
      between physical networks and application. Application writers develop     
      to IP, or to one of the standardized protocols or middleware systems       
    that run over IP. Networking technology providers seek to provide IP         
operation as a primary goal.</p>
<p>"IP Everywhere" is such a strong culture, that it is difficult           to 
appreciate the few places where IP is not the right answer. IP is           
universal and is the right answer almost all of the time. This paper           
looks at why IP is not the right solution for HF Radio. Another example          
 of where IP is not right is deep space communications, where the long  </p>
<h2>Key Factors for Good Performance over HF</h2>
<p>HF Radio is very slow with typical rates around 1200 bits per second.         
  This slow speed is usually perceived as the primary difficulty with           
using HF. For components about the modem level, speed is determined.           
There are two general issues relating to performance that are now described.</p>
<h3>Turnaround time</h3>
<p>For data applications, the most significant problem with HF is turnaround     
      time. Turnaround time is the time taken to change direction of data        
   flow, and for HF Radio this is measured in seconds or tens of seconds.        
 Turnaround time is caused by factors at multiple levels:</p>
<ol>
  <li> Modem turnaround time</li>
  <li> Interleaver completion time. This can be a significant time (e.g.,        
       2.16 seconds for STANAG 4539 short interleaver or 8.64 seconds for        
       the long interleaver).</li>
  <li> Delays due to Comsec layer.</li>
  <li> The HF Radio must switch from send to receive. (An HF Radio is            
   a simplex device, and cannot send and receive at the same time).</li>
  <li> HF Skywave latency times.</li></ol>
<p>All of this leads to a turnaround time of at least a few seconds and          
 sometimes as much as 20-30 seconds. In order to make (reasonably) efficient     
      use of an HF link, it is critical to have transmit time longer than        
   turnaround time. This has a significant impact on applications.</p>
<p>For VHF and higher frequencies, turnaround time is less, so the impact        
   is less significant. For VHF, full duplex transmission can also be used,      
     which removes the impact completely.</p>
<h3>Efficient Use of the Pipe</h3>
<p>It is important that applications use the HF link as efficiently as           
possible, as bandwidth is limited. There are a number of things that         
need to be considered:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Data Compression. This will be important for most applications.            
   Compression is not discussed in this paper, but should be addressed           
    by applications operating over HF.</li>
  <li> Protocol and Header Overhead. It is important that protocols do           
    not consume undue bandwidth with headers and other information. This         
      should be optimized. The protocols discussed in this paper, and in         
      particular STANAG 5066 are well optimized.</li>
  <li> Grouping data. Where possible data should be sent together in long        
       transmissions, to minimize the effect of turnaround time.</li>
  <li> Avoiding repeat transmissions, except when data is lost. It is            
   clearly important that data is not sent twice when not needed, and            
   applications should be designed to avoid this.</li></ul>
<p>These last two points have potential for significant inefficiency,           
and are discussed in more detail in the context of relevant protocols.</p>
<h2>STANAG 5066</h2>
<p>STANAG 5066 is a NATO standard for running applications over HF Radio.        
   This is described in the Isode whitepaper <a href="http://www.isode.com/whitepapers/stanag-5066.html">STANAG 
          5066: The Standard for Data Applications over HF Radio.</a></p>
<p>An HF Modem provides a quite basic send/receive capability. STANAG           
5066 provides application oriented capabilities over this. Capabilities          
 of relevance to this paper:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Decoupling. Data can be accepted from one or more applications,            
   and queued for sending. A STANAG 5066 server can then “fill             the 
  pipe” to avoid wasting capacity.</li>
  <li> Fragmentation. STANAG 5066 will break application data into blocks        
       appropriate for the modem speed (DPDUs). This is important both for       
        precedence handling and acknowledgement.</li>
  <li> Precedence handling. STANAG 5066 will send higher priority data           
    (DPDUs) first..</li>
  <li> Support for multicast, which can also be used to support nodes            
   in Radio Silence (also known as EMCON (Emission Control)).</li>
  <li> Reliable transmission is supported for non-multicast traffic, by          
     acknowledgement at the DPDU level. This means that when there is data       
        loss (e.g., due to Radio noise) that retransmission is of the lost       
        DPDUs. This is more efficient than application level 
retransmission.</li>
  <li> Minimizing turnarounds. STANAG 5066 has long transmit times (up           
    to 127.5 seconds) and works to maximize transmit time. Acknowledgements      
         are delayed wherever possible, so reliable transmission does not 
  increase             the number of turnarounds.</li></ol>
<p>The central service in STANAG 5066 is "unit data". This service           
allows transfer of a block of data, with a maximum size constrained           
set at the STANAG 5066 level (typically 2 kBytes). Applications using  </p>
<p>Unit data may be unacknowledged (best effort) or acknowledged (reliable).     
      The choice is made by the application using STANAG 5066. Unacknowledged    
       must be used where data is being sent to more than one recipient 
(broadcast           or multicast) or where the recipient is in EMCON (Emission 
Control)           and cannot transmit an acknowledgement.</p>
<h2>IP over HF Radio </h2>
<p>IP could be mapped onto HF Radio in a number of ways. There are two           
mechanisms standardized (STANAG 5066 and STANAG 4538) which are discussed        
   here. These provide similar characteristics to the IP user, and so the        
   choice of mapping does not significantly affect the analysis in this          
 paper. It is hard to conceive of alternate mappings that would lead           
to improvements.</p>
<h2>IP over HF Radio using STANAG 5066</h2>
<p>STANAG 5066 defines use of IP over STANAG 5066. This support is mandatory     
      in the current standard, although not all STANAG 5066 products support     
      it. The mapping is very simple: essentially an IP packet is mapped 
directly           onto STANAG 5066 unit data. There are two options for unit 
data, both         of which are valid for IP:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Unreliable. This is a natural mapping for IP, as IP is defined as          
     an unreliable protocol.</li>
  <li> Reliable. This may be used for unicast and non-EMCON transmission. 
</li></ol>
<p>There are a number of factors in the choice:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If data needs to be retransmitted, reliable will be more efficient,        
       as this can be done at the DPDU level, rather than forcing the 
  application             to retransmit the complete unit data.</li>
  <li> Some applications respond to lost data by either reducing transmission    
           rate, or by packet exchange which leads to more turnarounds. These    
           are both undesirable, and can be addressed by the reliable 
  option.</li>
  <li> A consequence of minimizing turnarounds is that in the event of           
    data loss, IP packets using the reliable option may be considerably          
     delayed. Some applications and operating respond badly to this delay,       
        and data may be retransmitted unnecessarily.</li></ul>
<p>This choice gives a flavor of the issues that will be examined in the         
  rest of this paper. The support of IP over HF radio is quite straightforward.  
         The issues arise from the interaction of applications using IP and 
consequences           of the underlying characteristics of HF Radio.</p>
<p>Where priority data is carried in IP, this can be mapped onto STANAG          
 5066 priority. Handling of priority at the IP level is discussed in           
the Isode whitepaper<a href="http://www.isode.com/whitepapers/low-latency.html"> 
Sending FLASH Messages             Quickly</a>.</p>
<h2>IP over HF Radio using STANAG 4538</h2>
<p>STANAG 4538 provides an alternate set of data link services and ARQ           
(acknowledgement mechanisms to support reliable data) to STANAG 5066.           
STANAG 4538 and associated specification is an example of 3G HF Radio.           
STANAG 4538 provides a reliable point to point data service that will           
work with very poor radio conditions. This makes it ideal for use with           
small “man pack” radios with whip aerials that will often           need to deal 
with poor signals. STANAG 4538 defines a mapping of IP           over its data 
services, which is a straightforward use of the underlying           reliable 
data transfer. It has characteristics very similar to the reliable         
mapping of STANAG 5066.</p>
<p>STANAG 5066 and associated standards is an …</p></div></div></div></div>

<p>As part of my Ph.D. program in Software Engineering in the <a href="https://www.isri.cmu.edu/">Institute for Software Research</a> at <a href="http://cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, I have to serve as a Teaching Assistant twice throughout the duration of the program.  Normally, the department requests that you serve as TA in two different classes, but under special circumstances you can TA the same course twice if you take on more responsibility in your second term.  These responsibilities effectively move you from a more traditional TA role, where you mainly hold recitation and correct assignments, to include giving lectures and be involved with part of the course delivery and design.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>My first time TA’ing was for <a href="http://cmu-313.github.io/">17-313 Foundations of Software Engineering</a>, co-instructed by <a href="https://clairelegoues.com/">Claire Le Goues</a> and <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mhilton/">Michael Hilton</a>, in the Fall 2019 semester.  I was selected for this TA role based on my industry experience (for those of you that don’t know, I worked many a job from 1998 - 2015 before leaving to pursue my Ph.D.) and since I was taking two courses that semester, used the TA to fill the remainder of the time while putting research off for most of the semester.  The class was sized around 32 student and it was held on campus with two recitation sections that I taught myself.  As part of this, I also delivered a single lecture on Chaos Engineering and had Tammy Butow (from Gremlin) come and give a short guest lecture to reinforce the lecture material and prepare students for an in-person class recitation on using Gremlin to put chaos into practice with the code they had been working with all semester.</p>

<p>In Spring 2020, I took CS Pedagogy at CMU, a course that is co-instructed by Michael and Charlie Garrod designed specifically for students interested in teaching.  This was a fantastic course that is only offered occasionally (and, highly recommended!) where we learned how to properly design and deliver lectures over the course of 12 weeks.  During this period, I perfected a lecture, along with several active learning activities, on Lamport and vector clocks, that I delivered as part of my final project.  However, I wanted to put into practice what I had learned in this class, so I inquired about participating in an extended TA of 17-313 where I could serve in the role as co-instructor instead of just a normal TA.</p>

<p>I was approved and it would be set that I would serve in this role for the Fall 2020 semester, in a format that none of us were prepared for: remote and hybrid learning in a quarantine setting.</p>

<h2 id="17-313-redux-fall-2020">17-313 Redux, Fall 2020</h2>

<p>Fall 2020 brought a number of changes and along with these changes came challenges.</p>

<h3 id="logistical-challenges">Logistical Challenges</h3>

<p>This year, we faced a number of new challenges around logistics:</p>

<ul>
  <li>First, 17-313 had doubled it’s enrollment and had a waitlist. Istead of around 30 students, we’d have 60.</li>
  <li>Next, students would be participating in the course mostly online and we would be lecturing on Zoom.</li>
  <li>There wasn’t going to be another TA besides myself, because getting TA’s in a semester where many students were taking the semester off was difficult for every class at CMU.</li>
  <li>Students who didn’t travel back to Pittsburgh after the summer break would be participating remotely from wherever they were: some were in different timezones in the US, some all over the world: we had students in Africa, Singapore, and China.</li>
  <li>We would have four recitation sections.  The first would be on campus, in person, in a socially distanced setting.  The second would be hybrid, where I would Zoom from the classroom and students could come to class or participate online, and finally the final two would be completely online.  These would have to be recorded and spread over the week in between and across lectures for that week (of which, we had two.)</li>
</ul>

<p>It was scary.  First off, we’re a software engineering course.  This entire course isn’t designed around writing software, it’s designed to help students learn process, collaboration, team management, the software development lifecycle, etc.  Most of our lectures involved group-based active learning activities.  Many, an overwhelming majority, of our recitation activities relied on close group work.  We’d have to make some changes.</p>

<p>It would be new, it would be difficult, it would be challenging.</p>

<p>In the section below, I’m going to briefly outline what I’m specifically proud of this semester and some of the things we learned when running this course online.</p>

<h3 id="technical-challenges">Technical Challenges</h3>

<p>We face technical challenges every year and none of these were new because of COVID-19.  However, debugging and dealing with them asynchronously was challenging in many respects.</p>

<p>Our course is designed around using Docker to run some code in a Linux environment and every semester this is a problem with Microsoft Windows.  In Fall 2019, most of the problems we ran into were around students with Mac’s that were too old (or running too outdated of an OS) to use Docker or Windows machines where Docker ran pitifully slow because of the emulation required to run Docker inside of a VirtualBox VM without hardware support (as, most of our students do NOT have Windows Professional, which was required for Hyper-V.)  In Fall 2020, we had new Docker problems where WSL2 had gone GA about 14 days before the semester, docker-machine was no longer a supported option, and students had to spent the first week upgrading Windows to a release that supported WSL2-native Docker.</p>

<p>Outside of issues of just running Docker, this issue that <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/WSL/issues/4166">I had been tracking for a year</a>  as I was an early WSL2 adopted on the development Insiders channel, on memory being reclaimed by WSL2 and not being released was a huge problem for students, who had to repeatedely restart WSL2 when they ran out of memory in Windows using Docker.  Further exacerbating that issue, students who had Windows Home with either 6 or 8GB of memory on their own laptops, sometimes could not even build their own Docker containers before running out of memory, leaving us with few options to help them.  Finally, several students just did not have enough disk space available.  Within the first two weeks, I spent hours a day Zoom’ing with students on screensharing to debug at least 15 or more unique environments students had trying to get them in a place where they had a working Docker configuration to be able to run the single container required for the course.</p>

<h3 id="recitation-challenges">Recitation Challenges</h3>

<p>Recitation sections also posed their own set of challenges.  I outline some of the things we learned below.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>We had to rethink how every recitation would work to ensure it worked in both a socially-distanced classroom as well as in a Zoom-based classroom.  We decided on the following.  First, for recitations that were purely in Zoom, we’d use breakout rooms.  However, in the classroom, students were instructed about how close they could have their desks to one another using indicators on the floor; therefore, we would have these students use a Zoom breakout room for screensharing or collaborate through a shared Google doc.  In Zoom, we’d used random assignment for breakout rooms; in the classroom, we’d use a 60 person classroom, adjusted for 20 students, to group students together based on their location in the classroom – opposite sides – so they could have actual discussions verbally.  Whereas smaller breakout rooms seemed to work for many activities on Zoom better, larger groups worked much better in the classroom.  Finally, since you don’t have the classroom to overhear how groups are working together, I needed a mechanism to gauge group progress: in Zoom, I would need to constantly move breakout room to breakout room to see how people were working, but given the delay required to switch rooms in Zoom, this was less than ideal.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>One thing we tried during lecture and recitation, was to have students collaborate on building design documents, etc. on shared Google Docs.  This worked well at first, but we soon learned that smaller breakout rooms didn’t work well: 60 students in a collaborative Google slide deck would cause Google to report that there were too many users on the same document and disable editing.  This got better once we moved to larger documents.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Some of our recitation activities relied on students working together in the classroom to build something physical (or, do physical collaboration.)  One of these was our agile activity that typically involves building paper airplanes.  I completely rewrote that recitation to work in an asynchrous format that I talked about at length in a <a href="http://christophermeiklejohn.com/teaching/2020/12/08/agile.html">previous post</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>For both lectures and recitations, we learned that students would mostly arrive with cameras and mics off.  We quickly learned that students would enable them in smaller breakout rooms, and therefore pushed to use breakout rooms with active learning activities early in both recitation and lecture: students would always return with cameras on and be more willing to talk afterwards, since they would turn them on in the breakout.  For the smaller recitations (2-4 people), students would immediately turn their cameras on, which seems to indicate that students are less comfortable in the larger groups.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Recitation sizes, arguably the most challenging aspect of running recitations in this format.  For each recitation, we had roughly 10-15 students scheduled.  However, the numbers throughout the semester varied greatly.  First, students were able to choose which recitation they attended and since they were recorded, they could also attend asynchronously.  This made week-to-week predictions of the attendence difficult.  One observation was that the students in the in-person section were relatively stable: the students who came, always came (even, when the in-person recitation section went fully remote from in-person after the Thanksgiving break, per CMU policy.)  The other recitations would flucutate between either almost all students to the smallest number I ever had in a section, two students.  This made it especially difficult for …</p></li></ul></div></div>

  <span>const</span> clicks <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>

      Clicks: </span><span>{</span>clicks<span>.</span>current<span>}</span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>This is how this component looks like (I added a re-render button so you can
actually test it out 😄):</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p>The example below is completely interactive, try clicking the "Clicks" button and then click on "Re-render".</p></div><p>As you can see, if you click the "Clicks" button it doesn't do anything. However, after click on "Re-render", it gets updated with the number of clicks we did previously.</p><h2>Difference with a variable</h2><p>You might wonder why not just use a simple variable as the example below:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>let</span> clicks <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>

<span>function</span> <span>OutsideVariableButton</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>And here's an interactive example for it:</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p><strong>Type</strong><strong>Result</strong><span>outside variable</span></p></div><p>The button works the same way that our previous example. However, the problem arises when you have multiple instances of the same component like the example below.

In fact, all the examples
from this article uses the same button component, so if you click the button
from the first example and then click on "re-render" on the second example, the count it is gonna be
incremented!

re-render and useRef doesn't.</p></blockquote><p>In the following example I added two buttons: one that updates its count with <code>useRef</code> and the other one with <code>useState</code>. I added some labels so you can identify them easily.</p><div><h2>Interactive Example</h2><p><strong>Type</strong><strong>Result</strong><span>state</span><span>ref</span></p></div><p>You'll notice that clicking on the button with <code>useRef</code> doesn't trigger a re-render and thus, the view isn't updated. On the other side, when you click on the button that uses <code>useState</code>, it will update its clicks count immediately.</p><p>To perform imperative actions on DOM nodes, React provides a way to get a
reference to them via refs. All you have to do is to assign a <code>ref</code> property to
a node with a ref object like this:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>CustomInput</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>The way to get a DOM reference using refs works (informally 😅) as follows:</p><div><p><span>Today</span></p><div><p>React</p><p>Hey, what's up?<span>12:00</span></p></div><div><p>Could you give me a reference to this dom node?<span>12:00<svg style="color:#34B7F1" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M5 13l4 4L19 7"></path></svg><svg style="color:#34B7F1;margin-left:-12px" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M5 13l4 4L19 7"></path></svg></span></p></div><div><p>React</p><p>Sure, I assigned it to the 'current' property of your ref.<span>12:00</span></p></div></div><p>On the first render, <code>inputRef</code>'s value will be <code>{ current: null }</code> and in the
following renders it will have its <code>current</code> property assigned to the specified DOM
node:</p><p>However, if you only reference <code>inputRef</code> inside <code>useEffect</code> then it'll always
reference the DOM node so you don't need to worry about it being undefined.</p><p>Let's update our example to get an idea of how this works:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>AttachingToDomExample</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> inputRef <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>

  console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"Render inputRef value:"</span><span>,</span> inputRef<span>)</span>

  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"useEffect inputRef value:"</span><span>,</span> inputRef<span>)</span><span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>input</span> <span>ref</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>inputRef<span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here's the console output when rendering this component:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Render</th><th>Location</th><th>Value</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Render</td><td>{ current: undefined }</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>useEffect</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Render</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>useEffect</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>Render</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr><tr><td></td><td>useEffect</td><td>{ current: &lt;input /<!-- -->&gt;<!-- --> }</td></tr></tbody></table><p>As you can see, if you access the <code>inputRef</code> inside <code>useEffect</code> then you don't
need to worry about it being <code>undefined</code> because React will assign it
automatically for you.</p><p>Let's start with a simple real-world application for refs: <code>usePrevious</code>. This
hook stores the previous value for a given state variable.
<a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-faq.html#how-to-get-the-previous-props-or-state" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">It is even referenced on React's docs</a> as a way to "get the previous props or state". Let's see it in
action first:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>UsePreviousExample</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>clicks<span>,</span> setClicks<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span>
  
  <span>const</span> previousClicks <span>=</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span>clicks<span>)</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setClicks</span><span>(</span>clicks <span>+</span> <span>1</span><span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
        Clicks: </span><span>{</span>clicks<span>}</span><span> - Before: </span><span>{</span>previousClicks<span>}</span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here's the output so you can play with it:</p><p>You can notice that the <code>previousClicks</code> variable stores the value for the previous render
for a given variable. Here's its implementation:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
    ref<span>.</span>current <span>=</span> value
  <span>}</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Let's analyze how it works.</p><p>Let's simulate what happens on the first render. We can remove the call to
<code>useEffect</code> since it doesn't affect the return value on the first render:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>On the first render it is called with a value of <code>0</code>:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> previousClicks <span>=</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>In this case, <code>usePrevious</code> will return <code>undefined</code>:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>After increase the value for count, here's how the <code>usePrevious</code> call will look:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>const</span> previousClicks <span>=</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>Since <code>usePrevious</code> is called again, its effect needs to run:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>useEffect</span><span>(</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>
  ref<span>.</span>current <span>=</span> <span>0</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div><p>After this, the <code>usePrevious</code> function is called again:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code>
<span>function</span> <span>usePrevious</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> ref <span>=</span> <span>useRef</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
  <span>return</span> ref<span>.</span>current 
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>And so on. Here's the value for each render for both variables:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Render</th><th>clicks</th><th>previousClicks</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>0</td><td>undefined</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>1</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>2</td><td>1</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>3</td><td>2</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Callback Refs are a different way to set refs. It gives you a fine-grain control
over when refs are attached and detached because you provide a function instead
of a ref variable. This function gets called every time the component mounts and
unmounts.</p><p><a href="https://codesandbox.io/s/callback-ref-example-lqe8w?file=/src/App.js" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Here's an example</a> that shows/hides an emoji every time you click its button.
The important thing here is the <code>ref</code> prop that we added. We use a function to log
the provided ref:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>const</span> <span>callback</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>ref</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> console<span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>"callback:"</span><span>,</span> ref<span>)</span>

<span>function</span> <span>App</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>const</span> <span>[</span>show<span>,</span> setShow<span>]</span> <span>=</span> <span>useState</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;</span>button</span> <span>onClick</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>setShow</span><span>(</span><span>!</span>show<span>)</span><span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
        </span><span>{</span>show <span>?</span> <span>"Hide"</span> <span>:</span> <span>"Show"</span><span>}</span><span>
      </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>button</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      </span><span>{</span>show <span>&amp;&amp;</span> <span><span><span>&lt;</span>span</span> <span>ref</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span>callback<span>}</span></span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>👋</span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>span</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>}</span><span>
    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div><p>Here's an interactive version of the previous code (you can check the output in
the console to see that I'm not lying 🙃):</p><p><em>Note: If you use callback refs as inline functions, it will be called
twice: one with <code>null</code> and another one with the DOM element.
This is because React needs to clear the previous ref every time the function is
created. A workaround for this is to use a class method.</em></p><div><h2>Warning</h2><p><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html#legacy-api-string-refs" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">String refs</a> are a legacy feature and they are likely to be removed in future React versions.</p></div><p>The way it works is that you provide a string as a ref value like <code>ref="exampleRef"</code> and it automatically gets assigned to <code>this.refs</code>.</p><p><em>Note: String refs can only be used with class components.</em></p><p>Here's an usage example:</p><div data-language="jsx"><pre><code><span>export</span> <span>default</span> <span>class</span> <span>App</span> <span>extends</span> <span>React<span>.</span>Component</span> <span>{</span>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2>The Labeling Problem</h2><p>The efficacy of a machine learning model is limited to the quality and quantity of data being used to train the model. The most powerful models typically require massive amounts of data to train. If the target variables in the model are categorical, there is an equally massive amount of labels in the dataset. Unfortunately, most of these labels are done by hand-- a painstakingly slow and resource intensive process. The time and resources that come with labeling datasets by hand creates inefficiencies in many machine learning pipelines. The categorical datasets that data scientists and programmers often learn from – such as those hosted on the <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php">UCI Machine Learning Repository </a>or those preprocessed and uploaded to <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets">Kaggle</a> – are idealized cases that do not reflect the typical reality of handling categorical data. In these datasets, someone has already taken the time to clean and process the data, providing the labels needed to train machine models. In real-life cases, this is usually not the case.</p><p>The origin of the categorical data labels often varies with the type of data in question. For example, pattern-recognition algorithms are often trained on labels provided through crowdsourcing. An algorithm trying to distinguish dogs from cats in images relies on humans to label each image beforehand. In ambiguous images, multiple people can assign different labels, resulting in a lower confidence for each category. On the other hand, medical diagnoses are often given in degrees of confidence either by some predefined test or by the doctor themselves. Similarly, natural language processing algorithms use confidence metrics to evaluate which definition of a word to employ (and, therefore, which meaning is intended) based on the context in which it is used. Despite the apparent categorical nature to these use cases, the reality can be quite the opposite.</p><p>Common in all of these cases is the association of a <em>probability </em>with the label. Whether the probability is simply an ensemble of multiple labels or intrinsic to the labeling methodology, the machine learning algorithms that train on these datasets must be able to handle probabilistic data labels. In some sense, the probability of a label is more informative than the label itself, as it also conveys the degree of confidence for a given observation. Understanding how to take advantage of this, and which approaches to handling these probabilistic data labels produce better models is a practical skill for data scientists and programmers encountering real-world categorical datasets. Additionally, tools that speed up or automate the labeling process in the machine learning pipeline resolve the inefficiencies that come with human labeling. Programmatically labeling is one such approach to do so.</p><p>In this tutorial, I use Python to walk through several different approaches to using probabilistic data labels to train machine learning models. I use a dataset that has both probabilistic labels and true labels to show that, if the probabilistic labels are of high quality, they are more than sufficient in constructing high performance machine learning models.</p><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>To follow along with the code in this tutorial, you’ll need to have a recent version of Python installed. I use the <a href="https://anaconda.org/">Anaconda Navigator</a> for all my programming needs, but the code used in this tutorial is generalized to work with any Python 3.7 distribution. To install Anaconda, go <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/">here</a>. &nbsp;You can find all of the code and data used on my <a href="https://gitlab.com/dsblendo/prob_data_labels">GitLab repository</a>.</p><p>All of the packages I will be using are prebuilt into the Anaconda distribution, except for the <a href="https://keras.io/">Keras package</a>. Keras provides us with the building blocks to construct our neural nets. To install for use in Anaconda, we can use <a href="https://conda-forge.org/">conda-forge</a> (you may also have to <a href="https://conda-forge.org/docs/user/introduction.html">install conda-forge</a>):</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;conda install -c conda-forge keras&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>Alternatively, if you are using another Python distribution, you can install Keras with pip:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;pip install keras&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>To import the necessary packages and functions that we will use, in Python run:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;<strong>import</strong> numpy <strong>as</strong> np<br><strong>import</strong> pandas <strong>as</strong> pd<br><strong>import</strong> matplotlib.pyplot <strong>as</strong> plt<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.metrics <strong>import</strong> accuracy_score<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.metrics <strong>import</strong> precision_recall_fscore_support <br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.model_selection <strong>import</strong> train_test_split<br><strong>from</strong> sklearn.feature_extraction.text <strong>import</strong> TfidfVectorizer<br><strong>from</strong> keras.models <strong>import</strong> Model<br><strong>from</strong> keras <strong>import</strong> optimizers<br><strong>from</strong> keras.layers <strong>import</strong> Input, Dense, Dropout&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>If any error indicates that a package cannot be found, simply install it using the same syntax as above, switching out the package name as needed. <br>‍</p><p>The data I will be working with is the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/wanderfj/enron-spam">Enron Spam classification dataset</a> from Kaggle. The dataset contains the text from 33,715 emails that are classified as either wanted (ham) or unwanted (spam). &nbsp;As can be seen below, the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Text&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; column contains the text of each email. We will use this text to train our model to classify the email as either ham or spam. </p><p>The &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Gold&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; column contains the ‘gold’ labels included in the original <em>.csv</em> file from Kaggle: 0 for ham and 1 for spam. There is an additional column that is not in the original Kaggle dataset: the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Pred&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt;<em> </em>column<em>.</em> This column contains probabilistic labels from 0 to 100 (rather than the binary labels in the &lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;Spam_Gold&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/code&gt; column) that indicate the probability of each email belonging to the spam class. </p><p>These probabilities were programmatically labeled using <a href="https://www.watchful.io/">Watchful</a>, without looking at the original gold labels. It would take days for a human to label each email to by hand, while Watchful accomplished this in around 3 hours. &nbsp; </p><p>To import the dataset, we can use the<em> </em>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; package:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;file_path = 'watchful_export.csv'<br>email_df = pd.read_csv(file_path)<br>email_df.head()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>The output should look something like this:</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c4e081336a4_lMVu2dmf4RMJnd1IEucaulz17cuRIdK4qweUknWLuduEplP55gg4a9TYNu-OtnZW5uvadw8pTtl3fFnq3gPXhlkg4zbzD2azXTUmdcV5YOBF1R5BYANjItlhYmXjNmjbbkUR0zJD.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>All set? Let’s go.</p><h2>Exploring the Data</h2><p>Before we get to the model implementation, it is always a good idea to explore the data we are working with. We can also compare the probabilistic data labels provided by Watchful with the original gold labels and evaluate how well the algorithm did. In most real-life cases, this is not possible, as the true labels are either limited to a few observations, not known at all, or have poor quality. </p><p>First, it is worth looking at the distribution of spam and ham emails in the gold labels and the probabilistic labels. This gives us an idea of the balance of the dataset, as well as how well the probabilistic labels match up to the gold labels. &nbsp;</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;gold_col_name = 'Spam_Gold'<br>pred_col_name = 'Spam_Pred'<br>text_col_name = 'Text'<br>pct_spam = email_df[gold_col_name].sum() / email_df.shape[0]<br>pct_ham = 1 - pct_spam<br>pct_spam, pct_ham&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c78a41336c8_VtYibTj6IYwpv8vQnofsEzLXZknIAdMi-NyTfM8ep6hDCBAIm1-nF7ZJGwK2hGhgq-Kv2n4XKObnIri8Nd9vTg8g8Jocgok0BPzgRvey6eUbl1xuCBdEanlQdeESi2KdGvf7yHlK.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>So, the dataset has nearly an equal distribution of spam and ham emails. Dealing with sparse data is not trivial for most machine learning algorithms. Fortunately, we don’t have to worry about it. As, expected, the histogram of gold labels is nearly equal in height:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(email_df[gold_col_name])<br>plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c35f4133692__jnMfpcDBpKOL_PUwnyz0kWOWBaZaRA2v8hf5CsFdfQBMSTqqmR7qFd2chzDdjsKYgwmaUqsF_EZ_wPPfgxwp-Ylb0Y6IW8y8XqSSVaEPKIk63E6mKwMKt2rC4cdQXP9nrCRJ-Fp.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>And for the probabilistic labels:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(email_df[pred_col_name])<br>plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551ccb721336ec_fcbwX4G08cR9jGH2dHljz611Pmh4PXe1xLE_1hRmApL3Bx-qTG5nMZwTQS9g141qSpW2Bk6JktXXrvBjayV8Hw41vqpGso3MBR8Hi8Lni2nwtlaObjuu2IbQKwr_Y6NCP_Hs-dGc.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The distributions are pretty similar.

For example, one could imagine that curt, plain text is probably not an advertisement for some product and is therefore an indicator of a ham email. On the other hand, text that is long and superfluous is generally more common in advertisements, and may indicate a spam email. </p><p>To get an idea of the distribution of the number of words used in the emails, we can take advantage of Python’s list comprehension syntax:</p><p>&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;lengths = np.array([len(doc.split()) <strong>for</strong> doc <strong>in</strong> email_df[text_col_name]])<br>pd.DataFrame(lengths).describe()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c243c1336b6_EYN_5xU56hJ15QgNOLP3EmEqd6gF-mP-PgWbdv-JyDiBLvPYUFapSe0m5yP1tZ_gS-OeoWU-JQrhyjCf04-MSbqO0DO30rd-X22ToTLL8M9bcYFkRTxlua8mGFmeB31oa226knO9.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>And to visualize the email length distribution:</p><p>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.hist(lengths[lengths &lt; 1000])&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;</p><p>&lt;pre class="inline"&gt;&lt;code class="python"&gt;plt.show()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;<br></p><figure><p><img src="https://assets.website-files.com/5f93514c79551c30eb133543/5f93514c79551c99b21336da_yrc6gT2jZBziyvh20WyReaApqY-f8qhxSmFPhCQCQI6wuX7bouHAKja3bGZlMy8knBZcVrh-9Qtlgnmc6GWxyv61Fz5YEGbK5DniKzEJmf7_wLRdUg3eSbGHnqk8JbGX-od97H__.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>The distribution is heavily skewed, as expected for a text-based communication medium – most emails are relatively short, and the probability of a longer email scales inversely with the length.

		<h2>Passing of a Great Mind</h2>
<h3>John von Neumann, a Brilliant, Jovial Mathematician, was a Prodigious Servant of Science and his Country</h3>
<p><em>by Clary Blair Jr</em>. –&nbsp;<em>Life Magazine</em>&nbsp;(February 25th, 1957)</p>
<p>The world lost one of its greatest scientists when Professor John von Neumann, 54, died this month of cancer in Washington, D.C. His death, like his life’s work, passed almost unnoticed by the public. But scientists throughout the free world regarded it as a tragic loss. They knew that Von Neumann’s brilliant mind had not only advanced his own special field, pure mathematics, but had also helped put the West in an immeasurably stronger position in the nuclear arms race. Before he was 30 he had established himself as one of the world’s foremost mathematicians. In World War II he was the principal discoverer of the implosion method, the secret of the atomic bomb.</p>
<p>The government officials and scientists who attended the requiem mass at the Walter Reed Hospital chapel last week were there not merely in recognition of his vast contributions to science, but also to pay personal tribute to a warm and delightful personality and a selfless servant of his country.</p>
<p>For more than a year Von Neumann had known he was going to die. But until the illness was far advanced he continued to devote himself to serving the government as a member of the Atomic Energy Commission, to which he was appointed in 1954. A telephone by his bed connected directly with his EAC office. On several occasions he was taken downtown in a limousine to attend commission meetings in a wheelchair. At Walter Reed, where he was moved early last spring, an Air Force officer, Lieut. Colonel Vincent Ford, worked full time assisting him. Eight airmen, all cleared for top secret material, were assigned to help on a 24-hour basis. His work for the Air Force and other government departments continued. Cabinet members and military officials continually came for his advice, and on one occasion Secretary of Defence Charles Wilson, Air Force Secretary Donald Quarles and most of the top Air Force brass gathered in Von Neumann’s suite to consult his judgement while there was still time. So relentlessly did Von Neumann pursue his official duties that he risked neglecting the treatise which was to form the capstone of his work on the scientific specialty, computing machines, to which he had devoted many recent years.</p>

<p>His fellow scientists, however, did not need any further evidence of Von Neumann’s rank as a scientist – or his assured place in history. They knew that during World War II at Los Alamos Von Neumann’s development of the idea of implosion speeded up the making of the atomic bomb by at least a full year. His later work with electronic computers quickened U.S. development of the H-bomb by months. The chief designer of the H-bomb, Edward Teller, once said with wry humor that Von Neumann was “one of those rare mathematicians who could descend to the level of the physicist.” Many theoretical physicists admit that they learned more from Von Neumann in methods of scientific thinking than from any of their colleagues. Hans Bethe, who was director of the theoretical physics division at Los Alamos, says, “I have sometimes wondered whether a brain like Von Neumann’s does not indicate a species superior to that of man.”</p>

<p>The foremost authority on computing machines in the U.S., Von Neumann was more than anyone else responsible for the increased use of the electronic “brains” in government and industry. The machine he called MANIAC (mathematical analyzer, numerical integrator and computer), which he built at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., was the prototype for most of the advanced calculating machines now in use. Another machine, NORC, which he built for the Navy, can deliver a full day’s weather prediction in a few minutes. The principal adviser to the U.S. Air Force on nuclear weapons, Von Neumann was the most influential scientific force behind the U.S. decision to embark on accelerated production of intercontinental ballistic missiles. His “theory of games,” outlined in a book which he published in 1944 in collaboration with Economist Oskar Morgenstern, opened up an entirely new branch of mathematics. Analyzing the mathematical probabilities behind games of chance, Von Neumann went on to formulate a mathematical approach to such widespread fields as economics, sociology and even military strategy. His contributions to the quantum theory, the theory which explains the emission and absorption of energy in atoms and the one on which all atomic and nuclear physics are based, were set forth in a work entitled <em>Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics</em>&nbsp;which he wrote at the age of 23. It is today one of the cornerstones of this highly specialized branch of mathematical thought.</p>
<p>For Von Neumann the road to success was a many-laned highway with little traffic and no speed limit. He was born in 1903 in Budapest and was of the same generation of <a href="http://slatestarcodex.com/2017/05/26/the-atomic-bomb-considered-as-hungarian-high-school-science-fair-project/">Hungarian physicists</a> as Edward Teller, Leo Szilard and Eugene Wigner, all of whom later worked on atomic energy development for the U.S.</p>
<p>The eldest of three sons of a well-to-do Jewish financier who had been decorated by the Emperor Franz Josef, John von Neumann grew up in a society which placed a premium on intellectual achievement. At the age of 6 he was able to divide two eight-digit numbers in his head. By the age of 8 he had mastered college calculus and as a trick could memorize on sight a column in a telephone book and repeat back the names, addresses and numbers. History was only a “hobby,” but by the outbreak of World War I, when he was 10, his photographic mind had absorbed most of the contents of the 46-volume works edited by the German historian Oncken with a sophistication that startled his elders.</p>
<p>Despite his obvious technical ability, as a young man Von Neumann wanted to follow his father’s financial career, but he was soon dissuaded. Under a kind of supertutor, a first-rank mathematician at the University of Budapest named Leopold Fejer, Von Neumann was steered into the academic world. At 21 he received two degrees – one in chemical engineering at Zurich and a PhD in mathematics from the University of Budapest. The following year, 1926, as Admiral Horthy’s rightist regime had been repressing Hungarian Jews, he moved to Göttingen, Germany, then the mathematical center of the world. It was there that he published his major work on quantum mechanics.</p>
<h4>The young professor</h4>
<p>His fame now spreading, Von Neumann at 23 qualified as a <em>Privatdozent</em>&nbsp;(lecturer) at the University of Berlin, one of the youngest in the school’s history. But the Nazis had already begun their march to power. In 1929 Von Neumann accepted a visiting lectureship at Princeton University and in 1930, at the age of 26, he took a job there as professor of mathematical physics – after a quick trip to Budapest to marry a vivacious 18-year-old named Mariette Kovesi. Three years later, when the Institute for Advanced Study was founded at Princeton, Von Neumann was appointed – as was Albert Einstein – to be one of its first full professors. “He was so young,” a member of the institute recalls, “that most people who saw him in the halls mistook him for a graduate student.”</p>

<p>Although they worked near each other in the same building, Einstein and Von Neumann were not intimate, and because their approach to scientific matters was different they never formally collaborated. A member of the institute who worked side by side with both men in the early days recalls, “Einstein’s mind was slow and contemplative. He would think about something for years. Johnny’s mind was just the opposite. It was lightning quick – stunningly fast. If you gave him a problem he either solved it right away or not at all. If he had to think about it a long time and it bored him, hist interest would begin to wander. And Johnny’s mind would not shine unless whatever he was working on had his undivided attention.” But the problems he did care about, such as his “theory of games,” absorbed him for much longer periods.</p>
<h4>‘Proof by erasure’</h4>
<p>Partly because of this quicksilver quality Von Neumann was not an outstanding teacher to many of his students. But for the advanced students who could ascend to his level he was inspirational. His lectures were brilliant, although at times difficult to follow because of his way of erasing and rewriting dozens of formulae on the blackboard. In explaining mathematical problems Von Neumann would write his equations hurriedly, starting at the top of the blackboard and working down. When he reached the bottom, if the problem was unfinished, he would erase the top equations and start down again. By the time he had done this two or three times most other mathematicians would find themselves unable to keep track. On one such occasion a colleague at Princeton waited until Von Neumann had finished and said, “I see. Proof by erasure.”</p>
<p>Von Neumann himself was perpetually interested in many fields unrelated to science. Several years ago his wife gave him a 21-volume Cambridge History set, and she is sure he memorized every name and fact in the books. “He is a major expert on all the royal family trees in Europe,” a friend said once. “He can tell you who fell in love with whom, and why, what obscure cousin this or that czar married, how many illegitimate children he had and so on.” One night during the Princeton days a world-famous expert on Byzantine history came to the Von Neumann house for a party. “Johnny and the professor got into a corner and began discussing some obscure facet,” recalls a friend who was there. “Then an argument arose over a date. Johnny insisted it was this, the professor that. So Johnny said, ‘Let’s get the book.’ They looked it up and Johnny was right. A few weeks later the professor was invited to the Von Neumann house again. He called Mrs. von Neumann and said jokingly, ‘I’ll come if Johnny promises not to discuss Byzantine history. …</p></div></div>

All I know is this: Where the topic of GNOME’s health goes, accurate data rarely follows. Of course, there <em>is</em> data — lots of it in fact, in public source code repositories. Though flawed in many ways, it allows us to make comparisons to the past — and maybe predictions for the future: Are a few organizations carrying most of the workload, making them critical points of failure? Are new contributors able to pick up the slack from those who leave? Is the project graying (i.e. increasingly dominated by veterans)?</p><p>In one of my occasional fits of hubris, I set out to process this data to see if I could shake out anything meaningful.

It’s safe to say that GNOME is dependent on paid developers in a big way. Specifically, and to no one’s surprise, it leans heavily on Red Hat.</p><h2 id="observations">General observations</h2><p>A few observations can be made with confidence:</p><ul><li>By F/OSS standards, the project is not <em>un</em>healthy. It has hundreds of experienced and first-time contributors every year. It is well-organized and arguably well-funded compared to its peers. But:</li><li>Every metric has the project peaking around 2010.</li><li>A diminishing number of veterans is doing an increasing share of the work.</li><li>Although recruitment is stable, newcomers don’t seem to be hitting their stride in terms of commits.</li><li>Corporate sponsorship is probably necessary to keep the project going, but the field of sponsors has kept thinning.</li></ul><p>I think GNOME is addressing the risk factors competently by modernizing infrastructure (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/">Discourse</a>). This has obvious value even in the absence of quantifiable results, but it’ll be interesting to see if the effect can be measured over the next couple of years.</p><p>Diminished enthusiasm may also be due to there being fewer ways for a new contributor to make their mark or assume a role of responsibility. GNOME has become more conservative, certainly much more so than it was a decade ago in the run-up to GNOME 3. The rationale and phrasing in <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/new-gnome-versioning-scheme/4235">the announcement of the new versioning scheme</a> (e.g. <em>“Radical technological and design changes are too disruptive for maintainers, users, and developers”</em>) seems indicative of this trend<sup>1</sup>.</p><h2 id="methodology">Notes on methodology</h2><p>So what’s wrong with this analysis? If you’re so inclined, you can find the details under the next couple of subheadings and pass harsh, harsh judgement.</p><p>I’ve set the unscientific rigor bar high enough to hopefully yield something useful, but low enough that I could do it in my spare time and not get stuck in the dreaded state commonly known as “90% done”.</p><h3>Module selection</h3><p>I aggregated data from <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-repos">189 Git repositories</a>. The vast majority of these are hosted on <code>gnome.org</code>, with a handful from <code>freedesktop.org</code> and <code>github.com</code>. Commits are uniquely identified by their commit hash, meaning trivial duplicates are counted only once.</p><p>GNOME has always been a decentralized, big-tent project, so it’s not obvious how to delineate it. I’ve tried to be fair by including most of the repositories from a full meta-gnome-desktop jhbuild, including fairly low-level dependencies like Cairo, Pango, and Pipewire, as well as past, present and would-be flagship applications under the GNOME umbrella. Documentation and infrastructure is represented, as are many archived projects (e.g. ORBit2, Bonobo, Sabayon, GAL).</p><p>I was a little uncertain about what to do with X.Org and Wayland. In the end I decided to include the latter, but not the former, since Wayland has close ties to GNOME (it even references GTK+ in its TODO file), while X.Org has its roots in the much older XFree86.</p><p>Mono is another project I resisted including; its development was tangential to GNOME proper, diverging completely in the most recent decade. However, I did include GtkSharp and several GNOME-hosted C# applications common on desktops in the 2005-2010 time frame.</p><p>Since I haven’t established hard criteria for module selection, it’s subject to various biases. Older code is probably underrepresented, since providers of important functionality were more loosely attached to the project early on (e.g. GNOME Online Accounts and Telepathy got pulled in, should I have included Gaim or Pidgin too? How about XChat?).</p><p>Anyway, the list isn’t terrible, but there’s room for improvement.</p><h3>Contributor identities</h3><p>Similar studies often identify contributors by their e-mail addresses. I used full author names instead, since there’s good reason to think they’re more stable over a 20-year time span. We’re fairly consistent in spelling our own names, and we change them rarely (often never). On the other hand, e-mail addresses come and go with different hosting arrangements, employers, etc.</p><p>An added challenge with this approach is that sometimes different people have the exact same name. In practice, I’m not aware of any instances of this happening in GNOME. It seems to be rare enough that I doubt it’d introduce significant error in most projects.</p><p>I should add here that the drive-by cohort depends on a fair amount of hindsight (you never know when someone might come back with more contributions, but the likelihood drops off quickly as time passes). This means the cohorts for 2020 are preliminary. They’ll be a lot more accurate with another run late next year.</p><h3>Domain names</h3><p>I’m using e-mail domain names as a proxy for organizations in some of the graphs. This is a notoriously unreliable approach for at least three reasons:</p><ol><li>Contributors often use personal e-mail addresses for paid work, leading to significant undercounting in general.</li><li>Specific companies may require their employees (or ask them nicely) to use company e-mail for collaboration. Out of the listed companies, I know of at least one that definitely did this. However, there are many that don’t, and these will be comparatively less well represented.</li><li>The mapping between DNS and organizations isn’t one-to-one. A company may operate under multiple names or TLDs (e.g. <code>.co.uk</code> and <code>.com</code>).</li></ol><p>Despite these weaknesses, it’s common to slice the data this way. It’s difficult to do better without access to semi-closed data troves, and depending on your views on privacy and ability to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">PII</a> safely, it might not be something you’d want to get into anyway. But I bet you’d be well-positioned for it if you were, say, the corporate owner of both LinkedIn and GitHub.</p><p>When grouping by organization, the goal is to get an idea of which outside entities are sponsoring contributions. Therefore, I’ve filtered out addresses from the biggest mass e-mail providers like <code>@gmail.com</code> and project-centric providers of personal accounts (e.g. <code>@gnome.org</code>, <code>@gtk.org</code>).</p><p>I took the liberty of reassigning the personal domains of a few extra prolific authors who would’ve otherwise showed up as individual organizations. Since there’s no way I’m doing it for everyone, this introduces some bias. The full details are in <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-meta.json">the project’s metadata file</a> (see: <a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/2020/12/16/on-the-graying-of-gnome/#code">code</a>).</p><h3>Version control systems</h3><p>Changeovers in version control systems divide GNOME’s VCS history into three eras with noticeable discontinuities between them.</p><h4>Before 1998: Dark ages</h4><p>In the Bad Old Days, Free Software would often use plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System">RCS</a> or no version control at all.

        <p>Published on: 2020-12-16</p>
        
<p>I'm going to consider a fairly unpopular idea: most efforts towards "explainable AI" are essentially pointless. Useful as an academic pursuit and topic for philosophical debate, but not much else.</p>
<p>Consider this article a generator of interesting intuitions and viewpoints, rather than an authoritative take-down of explainability techniques.</p>
<p>That disclaimer aside:</p>
<hr>
<p>What if almost every problem for which it is desirable to use machine learning is unexplainable?</p>
<p>At least unexplainable in an efficient-enough way to be worth explaining. Whether it is an algorithm or a human that is doing the explanation.</p>
<p>Let's define "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">explainable AI</a>" in a semi-narrow sense, inspired by the DARPA definition, as an inference system that can answer the questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why was that prediction made as a function of our inputs and their interactions?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Under what conditions would the outcome differ?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How confident can we be in this prediction and why is the confidence such?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why might we be unable to answer the above questions in a satisfactory manner for most machine learning algorithms? I think I can name four chief reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some problems are just too complex to explain. Often enough, these are perfect problems for machine learning, it's exactly their intractability to our brains that makes them ideal for equation-generating algorithms to solve.</li>
<li>Some problems, while not that complex, are really boring and no human wants or should be forced to understand them.</li>
<li>Some problems can be understood, but understanding in itself is different for every single one of us, and people's culture and background often influence what "understanding" means. So explainable for one person is not explainable for another.</li>
<li>Even given an explanation that everyone agrees on, this usually puts us no closer to most of what we want to achieve with said explanation, things like gathering better data or removing "biases" from our models.</li>
</ol>
<h2>I - Unexplainable due to complexity</h2>
<p>Let's say, physicists, take in 100 PetaBytes of experimental data, reduce them using equations, and claim with a high probability that there exists this thing called a "Higgs Boson" with implications for how gravity works, among other things.</p>
<p>The resulting Boson can probably be defined within a few pages of text via things such as mass, the things it decays into, its charge, its spin, the various interactions it can have with other particles, and so on.</p>
<p>But if a luddite like myself asks the physicists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did you predict this fundamental particle exists?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will either get a "press conference answer" which carries no meaning other than providing a "satisfying" feeling, but it doesn't answer any of the above questions.</p>
<p>It doesn't tell me why the data shows the existence of the Higgs Boson, it doesn't tell me how the data could have been different in order for this not to be the case, and it doesn't tell me how confident they are in this inference and why.</p>
<p>If I press for an answer that roughly satisfies the explainability criteria I mentioned above, I will at best get them to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, the standard model is a fairly advanced concept in physics, so you first have to understand that and why it came to be. Then you have to understand the experimental statistics needed to interpret the kind of data we work with here. In the process, you'll obviously learn quantum mechanics, but to understands the significance of the Higgs boson specifically it's very important that you have an amazing grasp of general relativity, since part of the reason we defined it as is and why it's so relevant is because it might be a unifying link between the two theories. Depending on how smart you are this might take 6 to 20 years to wrap your head around, really you won't even be the same person by the time you're done with this. And oh, once you get your Ph.D. and work with us for half a decade there's a chance you'll disagree with your statistics and our model and might think that we are wrong, which is fine, but in that case, you will find the explanation unsatisfactory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are fine with this, since physics is bound to be complex, it earns its keep by being useful and making predictions about very specific things with very tight error margins, its fundamental to all other areas of scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>When we say that we "understand" physics what we really mean is that there are a few dozen of thousands of blokes that spent half their lives turning their brains into hyper-optimized physics-thinking machines and they assure us that they "understand" it.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, the edges of physics are a black box, I know physics works because Nvidia sells me GPUs with more VRAM each year and I'm able to watch videos of nuclear reactors glowing on youtube while patients in the nearby oncology ward are getting treated with radiation therapy.</p>
<p>This is true for many complex areas, we "understand" them because a few specialists say they do, and the knowledge that trickles down from those specialists has results that are obvious to all. Or, more realistically, because a dozen-domain long chain of specialists combined, each relying on the other, is able to produce results that are obvious to all.</p>
<p>As long as there is a group of specialist that understands the field, as long as those specialists can prove to us that their discoveries can affect the real world (thus excluding groups of well-synchronized insane people) and as long as they can teach other people to understand the field... we claim that it's "understood".</p>
<hr>
<p>But what about a credit risk analysis "AI" making a prediction that we should loan Steve at most 14,200$?</p>
<p>The model making this prediction might be operating with TBs worth of data about Steve, his browsing history, his transaction history, his music preferences, a video of him walking into the bank... each time he walked into the bank for the last 20 years, various things data aggregators tell us about him, from his preference about clothing to the likelihood he wants to buy an SUV, and of course, the actual stated purpose Steve gave us for the credit, both in text and as a video recording.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the "AI" has been trained on previous data from millions of people similar to Steve and the outcomes of the loans handed to then, thus working with petabytes of data in order to draw the 1-line conclusion of "You should loan steve, at most, 14,200$, if you want to probabilistically make a profit".</p>
<p>If we ask the AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is the maximum loan 14,200$? How did the various inputs and their interactions contribute to coming up with this number?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, the real answer is probably something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, I can explain this to you, but 314,667,344,401 parameters had a significant role in coming up with this number, and if you want to "truly" understand that then you'd have to understand my other 696,333,744,001 parameters and the ways they related to each other in the equation. In order to do this, you have to gain an understanding of human-gate analysis as well as how its progress over time relates to life-satisfaction, credit history analysis, shopping preference analysis, error theory behind the certainty of said shopping preferences, and about 100 other mini-models that end up coalescing into the broader model that gave this prediction. And the way they "coalesce" is even more complex than any of the individual models. You can probably do this given 10 or 20 years, but basically, you'd have to re-train your brain from scratch to be like an automated risk analyst, you'd only be able to explain this to another automated risk analysts, and the "you" "understanding" my decision will be quite different from the "you" that is currently asking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even the above is an optimist take assuming the "AI" is made of multiple modules that are somewhat explainable.</p>
<p>So, is the "AI" unexplainable here?</p>
<p>Well, not more so than the physicists are. Both of them can, in theory, explain the reasoning behind their choice. But in both cases, the reasoning is not simple, there's no single data point that is crucial, if even a few inputs were to change slightly the outcome might be completely different, but the input space is so fast it's impossible to reason about all significant changes to it.</p>
<p>This is just the way things are in physics and it might be just the way things are in credit risk analysis. After all, there's no fundamental rule of the universe saying it should be easy to comprehend by the human mind. The reason this is more obvious in physics is simply because physicists have been gathering loads of data for a long time. But it might be equally true in all other fields of inquiry, based on current models, it probably is. It's just that those other fields didn't have enough data nor the intelligence required to grok through it until recently.</p>
<h2>II - Some problems are boring</h2>
<p>There is a class of problems that is complex, but not as complex as to be impenetrable to the vast majority of human minds.</p>
<p>To harken back to the physics example, think classical mechanics. Given the observations made by Galileo and some training in analysis, most of us could, in principle, understand classical mechanics.</p>
<p>But this is still difficult, it requires a lot of background knowledge, although fairly common and useful background knowledge and a significant amount of times. Ranging from, say, a day to several months depending on the person.</p>
<p>This is time well spent learning classical mechanics, but what if the problem domain was something else, say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figuring out if a blotch on a dental CT scan is more likely to indicate a streptococcus or a lactobacillus infection.</li>
<li>Understanding what makes an image used to advertise a hiking pole attractive to middle-class Slovenians over the age of 54.</li>
<li>Figuring out, using l2 data, if the spread for the price of soybean oil is too wide, and whether the bias is towards the sell or buy.</li>
<li>Finding the optimal price at which to pre-sell a new brand of luxury sparkling water based on yet uncertain …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>Up to now, I have used vi as an example for modal text editor, mostly because
I expect most programmers have at least heard of it. However, I don’t believe
vi and clones are the best modal text editor out there.</p>
<p>I have been working, for the last 5 years, on a new modal editor called
Kakoune. It first started as a reimplementation of Vim (the most popular vi
clone) whose source code is quite dated. But, I soon realized that we could
improve a lot on vi editing model.</p>
<div>
<h3 id="_improving_on_the_editing_model">Improving on the editing model</h3>
<p>vi basic grammar is <strong>verb</strong> followed by <strong>object</strong>; it’s nice because it matches
well with the order we use in English, "delete word". On the other hand,
it does not match well with the nature of what we express: There is only
a handful of <strong>verbs</strong> in text editing (<strong>d</strong>elete, <strong>y</strong>ank, <strong>p</strong>aste,
<strong>i</strong>nsert…​), and they don’t compose, contrarily to <strong>objects</strong> which can be
arbitrarily complex, and difficult to express. That means that errors are
not handled well. If you express your object wrongly with a delete verb,
the wrong text will get deleted, you will need to undo, and try again.</p>
<p>Kakoune’s grammar is <strong>object</strong> followed by <strong>verb</strong>, combined with instantaneous
feedback, that means you always see the current object (In Kakoune we call
that the selection) before you apply your change, which allows you to correct
errors on the go.</p>
<p>Kakoune tries hard to fix one of the big problems with the vi model: its
lack of interactivity. Because of the <strong>verb</strong> followed by <strong>object</strong> grammar,
vi changes are made in the dark, we don’t see their effect until the whole
editing <strong>sentence</strong> is finished. <code>5dw</code> will delete to next five words, if
you then realize that was one word too many, you need to undo, go back to
your initial position, and try again with <code>4dw</code>. In Kakoune, you would do
<code>5W</code>, see immediately that one more word than expected was selected, type
<code>BH</code> to remove that word from the selection, then <code>d</code> to delete.  At each
step you get visual feedback, and have the opportunity to correct it.</p>
<p>At the lower level, the problem is that vi treats moving around and selecting
an object as two different things. Kakoune unifies that, moving <strong>is</strong> selecting.
<code>w</code> does not just go to the next word, it selects from current position to
the next word. By convention, capital commands tend to expand the selection,
so <code>W</code> would expand the current selection to the next word.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_multiple_selections">Multiple selections</h3>
<p>Another particular feature of Kakoune is its support for, and emphasis
towards the use of multiple selections. Multiple selections in Kakoune
are not just one additional feature, it is the central way of interacting
with your text. For example there is no such thing as a "global replace" in
Kakoune. What you would do is select the whole buffer with the <code>%</code> command,
then select all matches for a regex in the current selections (that is the
whole buffer here) with the <code>s</code> command, which prompts for a regex. You would
end up with one selection for each match of your regex and use the insert
mode to do your change. Globally replacing foo with bar would be done with
<code>%sfoo&lt;ret&gt;cbar&lt;esc&gt;</code> which is just the combination of basic building blocks.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Multiple selections provides us with a very powerful to express structural
selection: we can subselect matches inside the current selections, keep
selections containing/not containing a match, split selections on a regex,
swap selections contents…​</p>
<p>For example, convert from <code>snake_case_style</code> to <code>camelCaseStyle</code> can be done
by selecting the word (with <code>w</code> for example) then subselecting underscores
in the word with <code>s_&lt;ret&gt;</code>, deleting these with <code>d</code>, then upper casing the
selected characters with <code>~</code>. The inverse operation could be done by selecting
the word, then subselecting the upper case characters with <code>s[A-Z]&lt;ret&gt;</code>
lower casing them with ` and then inserting an underscore before them with
<code>i_&lt;esc&gt;</code> This operation could be put in a macro, and would be reusable
easily to convert any identifier.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Another example would be parameter swapping, if you had <code>func(arg2, arg1);</code>
you could select the contents of the parenthesis with <code>&lt;a-i&gt;(</code>, split the
selection on comma with <code>S, &lt;ret&gt;</code>, and swap selection contents with <code>&lt;a-)&gt;</code>.</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>It is as well easy to use multiple selections for alignment, as the <code>&amp;</code>
command will align all selection cursors by inserting blanks before
selection start</p>

<p>Or to use multiple selections as a way to gather some text from different
places and regroup it in another place, thanks to a special form of pasting

<h3 id="_interactive_predictable_and_fast">Interactive, predictable and fast</h3>
<p>A design goal of Kakoune is to beat vim at its own game, while providing a
cleaner editing model. The combination of multiple selections and cleaned up
grammar shows that it’s possible to have text edition that is interactive,
predictable, and fast at the same time.</p>
<p>Interactivity comes from providing feedback on every command, made possible by
the inverted <strong>object</strong> then <strong>verb</strong> grammar. Every selection modification
has direct visual feedback; regex-based selections incrementally show what
will get selected, including when the regular expression is invalid; and even
yanking some text displays a message notifying how many selections were yanked.</p>
<p>Predictability comes from the simple effect of most commands. Each command is
conceptually simple, doing one single thing. <code>d</code> deletes whatever is selected,
nothing more. <code>%</code> selects the whole buffer. <code>s</code> prompts for a regex and
selects matches in the previous selection. It is the combination of these
building blocks that allows for complex, but predictable, actions on the text.</p>
<p>Being fast, as in requiring fewer keystrokes, is provided by carefully designing
the set of editing commands so that they interact well together, and by sometimes
sacrificing beauty for useability. For example, <code>&lt;a-s&gt;</code> is equivalent to
<code>S^&lt;ret&gt;</code>: they both split on new lines, but this is such a common use case that
it deserves to have its own key shortcut. As shown in <a href="http://github.com/mawww/golf">http://github.com/mawww/golf</a>,
Kakoune manages to beat Vim at the keystroke count game in most cases,
using much more idiomatic commands.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_discoverability">Discoverability</h3>
<p>Keyboard oriented programs tend to be at a disadvantage compared to GUI
applications because they are less discoverable; there is no menu bar on
which to click to see the available options, no tooltip appearing when you
hover above a button explaining what it does.</p>
<p>Kakoune solves this problem through the use of two mechanisms: extensive
completion support, and auto-information display.</p>
<p>When a command is written in a prompt, Kakoune will automatically open a menu
providing you with the available completions for the current parameter. It
will know if the parameter is supposed to be a word against a fixed set
of word, the name of a buffer, a filename, etc…​ Actually, as soon as <code>:</code>
is typed, entering command prompt mode, the list of existing commands will
be displayed in the completion menu.</p>
<p>Additionally, Kakoune will display an information box, describing what the
command does, what optional switches it can take, what they do…​</p>

<p>Command discoverability</p>

</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>That information box gets displayed in other cases, for example if the <code>g</code>
key is hit, which then waits for another key (<code>g</code> is the <strong>goto</strong> commands
prefix), an information box will display all the recognized keys, informing
the user that Kakoune is waiting on a keystroke, and listing the available
options.</p>
<p>To go even further in discoverability, the auto information system can
be set to display an information box after each normal mode keystroke,
explaining what the key pressed just did.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_extensive_completion_support">Extensive completion support</h3>
<p>Keyboard oriented programs are much easier to work with when they provide
extensive completion support. For a long time, completion has been prefix
based, and that has been working very well.</p>
<p>More recently, we started to see more and more programs using the so called
fuzzy completion. Fuzzy completion tends to be subsequence based, instead
of prefix based, which means the typed query needs to be a subsequence of
a candidate to be considered matching, instead of a prefix. That will generate
more candidates (all prefix matches are also subsequence matches), so it
needs a good ranking algorithm to sort the matches and put the best ones first.</p>
<p>Kakoune embraces fuzzy matching for its completion support, which kicks in both
during insert mode, and prompt mode.</p>
<div>
<p>Word completion support</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/completion.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>Insert mode completion provides completion suggestions while inserting in the
buffer, it can complete words from the buffer, or from all buffers, lines,
filenames, or get completion candidates from an external source, making it
possible to implement intelligent code completion.</p>
<div>
<p>Language specific completion support</p>
<p>
<video src="https://kakoune.org/why-kakoune/video/cpp-completion.webm" autoplay="" controls="" loop="">

</video>
</p>
</div>
<p>Prompt completion is displayed whenever we enter command mode, and provides
completion candidates that are adapted to the command being entered, and to
the current argument being edited.</p>
</div>
<div>
<h3 id="_a_better_unix_citizen">A better unix citizen</h3>
<p>Easily making programs cooperate with each others is one of the main strength
of the Unix environment. Kakoune is designed to integrate nicely with a POSIX
system: various text editing commands give direct access to the power of POSIX
tools, like <code>|</code>, which prompts for a shell command and pipe selections through
it, replacing their contents with the command output, or <code>$</code> that prompts for
a command, and keeps selections for which the command returned success.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Author's Note: The latest version of this essay is now a chapter in <a href="https://www.learninpublic.org/#learn-more">the Coding Career Handbook</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are often told that <strong>Knowledge is Power</strong>. This is mostly true - except for at least two points in your career.</p>
<p>Have you thought about how <strong>Ignorance can be Power</strong> too? I can think of at least two stages in a career when you can wield lack of knowledge as a form of power (in the neutral, <em>ability to influence others to do what you need</em> sense, not in the petty <em>dominating over others</em> sense).</p>
<p>And we'll talk about how you can wield ignorance throughout the rest of your career too - with <strong>Lampshading</strong>!</p>
<section>
  <h2 id="when-youre-very-senior"><a href="#when-youre-very-senior">When you're very senior</a></h2>
  <p>First, when you're in <strong>senior management</strong>, typically at least a couple layers removed from individual contributors. Beyond a certain level you are not being paid to have the right answers - that's what your reports are for. It's your job to ask the right <em>questions</em>, and to enable your team to figure out how to get the answers.</p>
  <p>In my career so far I've often noticed that it is <em>senior management</em>, not middle or junior people, that are most likely to say "Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't understand what's going on here. <a href="https://www.dictionary.com/e/slang/eli5/">Can you explain like I'm five?</a>" Done right, it can expose weak reasoning and bust bullshit, particularly when framed with the (mostly correct) belief that <a href="https://www.passiton.com/inspirational-quotes/3363-if-you-cant-explain-it-simply-you-dont">"If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough."</a>.</p>
  <p>Note I'm not absolving incompetent management of the need to know domain knowledge necessary to be an effective leader. I'm simply observing that at senior levels you are <em>not</em> expected to know everything, and that's an interesting violation of "Knowledge is Power" you have probably experienced.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="when-youre-new"><a href="#when-youre-new">When you're new</a></h2>
  <p>Second, <strong>when you're new</strong>, typically entry level in a career or a new joiner to a community or company. At this level, again, nobody expects you to know <em>anything</em>. Sure, you needed to know <em>enough</em> to fool someone into hiring you. But so long as you never lied or lied-by-omission, nobody is going to turn around and fire you for having holes in your knowledge.</p>
  <p>Of course, there are cases where this doesn't apply. Junior talent are the most expendable, and some companies don't have a healthy attitude to mentorship and hiring. But in general, I find the tech industry a lot better for mentoring than, say, finance. Tech companies generally place explicit responsibility on seniors/team leads to mentor juniors, especially as part of their career progression goals.</p>
  <p>You might imagine, having restarted my career 2-4 times depending how you count it, that I have a good deal of personal experience with being a total newbie.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="storytime"><a href="#storytime">Storytime!</a></h2>
  <p>Here I can tell you about my first day on my new dev job, fresh out of bootcamp.</p>
  <p>My team all joined on the same day - 3 new hires (me and 2 more experienced devs). My new boss, a confident senior dev who had had a long tenure with the firm, was walking us through our tech stack. All of a sudden he paused, and said, "oh by the way, we're going to use TypeScript. You all know TypeScript, right?". Coworker 1 nodded, Coworker 2 nodded. There was that unspoken sense of <em>duh, we're all professionals here, of course we use TypeScript</em>.</p>
  <p>And then all eyes were on me.</p>
  <p>I don't do well with peer pressure. In Gretchen Rubin's <a href="https://gretchenrubin.com/2015/01/ta-da-the-launch-of-my-quiz-on-the-four-tendencies-learn-about-yourself/">4 Tendencies</a> model, I'm an Obliger - I like to please people and put my own concerns aside. Of course my bootcamp hadn't taught TypeScript, we'd only had 3 months to learn fullstack JS! And of course I wanted to say yes!</p>
  <p>I had a probably visible moment of panic, before going with "no I don't know TypeScript." My boss simply nodded, saying, "you can learn on the job", and moved on.</p>
  <p>I think in my first few months I probably had a dozen little tests like that. Did I know how to do professional code reviews? (No) Did I know how to do BEM naming? (No, and I proudly still don't) Did I know what Clean Code was? (eh.. nope).</p>
  <p>Every time I confessed ignorance, they gave me what I needed to learn, and I caught up. If I made a mistake, they taught me what I did wrong. What were they gonna do, fire me? They knew what they were doing when they hired me out of bootcamp.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="lampshading"><a href="#lampshading">Lampshading</a></h2>
  <p>So we see that confessing ignorance works at both the senior and junior stages of careers. But it also works in isolated situations as well, for example when you caveat what you don't know while <a href="https://www.swyx.io/writing/learn-in-public">learning in public</a>.</p>
  <p>Given my casual interest in creative writing, I often compare this technique with <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/LampshadeHanging">Lampshading</a>. To quote from TV Tropes:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Lampshade Hanging (or, more informally, <strong>Lampshading</strong>) is the writers' trick of dealing with any element of the story that threatens the audience's Willing Suspension of Disbelief, whether a very implausible plot development, or a particularly blatant use of a trope, <strong>by calling attention to it and simply moving on</strong>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p>Applied to real life: You call out your own weakness, so that others can't.</p>
  <p>In fact, by most functional team dynamics, others are then obliged to help you fix your weakness. This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_power">soft power</a>.</p>
  <p>Many Americans (of a certain age) immediately sympathize with this by linking it to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sHE0wmgljco">the final battle in 8 Mile</a>. In it, Eminem kicks off by naming every single weakness of his that his opponent Papa Doc was going to, literally stealing all the words from Papa Doc's mouth and turning himself into a sympathetic character. <strong>Weakness is strength</strong> here purely because of lampshading.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="the-stupid-question-safe-harbor"><a href="#the-stupid-question-safe-harbor">The Stupid Question Safe Harbor</a></h2>
  <p>In real life, I often lampshade by invoking the "Stupid Question Safe Harbor" (SQSH).</p>
  <p>A "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe_harbor_(law)">Safe Harbor</a>" is a legal idea that explicitly okays some behavior that may be in a grey zone due to unclear rules. So I use it as an analogy for how we act when someone says "I have a Stupid Question".</p>
  <p>When we invoke the "Stupid Question Safe Harbor", we are acknowledging the question is potentially stupid, AND that we all know that there's not really such a thing as a stupid question, but we'll just get it out of the way to ask something really basic - because getting mutual understanding is more important than saving face.</p>
  <p>The trick here is you actually are saving face - now you've invoked the SQSH, people understand you’re roleplaying, you're explicitly invoking a well understood mode of conversation, and you're not <em>ACTUALLY</em> that stupid. Right? Right?? <em>nervous laughter</em></p>
  <p>When you are in a group scenario, the SQSH has positive externalities. There may be multiple people wondering the same thing, but only one person has to "take the hit" of asking the "stupid question", and yet all benefit. I like performing this role of <a href="https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1096645037788618752">Stupid Questions as a Service</a>.</p>
</section>
<section>
  <h2 id="advanced-lampshading"><a href="#advanced-lampshading">Advanced Lampshading</a></h2>
  <p>Once you learn to look out for <strong>Lampshading</strong>, you may see powerful users of it out there in the wild who use it to Learn in Public:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Kyle Simpson famously was told "You Don't Know JS" in an interview, and turned that into his <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS">primary claim to fame</a>, controversial title and all.</li>
    <li>I eventually took my own TypeScript learnings, explicitly lampshaded that I was learning, and put them online and that became the <a href="https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react-typescript-cheatsheet/">React TypeScript Cheatsheets</a></li>
    <li>I <em>frequently</em> lampshade my mistakes during my talks. Clicker not working? Call attention to it. Joke didn't land? Call myself out. Self aware, self deprecating humor is always appreciated by the audience, and fills dead air. But you can also use it to set up <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/91029-every-great-magic-trick-consists-of-three-parts-or-acts">a Pledge, in advance of a Turn and the final Prestige</a>, which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KJP1E-Y-xyo">exactly how I set up my own livecoding talks</a>.</li>
    <li><a href="https://twitter.com/Nicolemens/status/1229610008167383040?s=20">This woman lampshading to ward off all trolls</a></li>
    <li><em>who else lampshades very well? let me know</em></li>
  </ul>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>


			
<p>Being a manager can be extremely hard, it can feel isolating at times especially if you don’t have a good support network of peers. But how do you cultivate this team of peers when your days are filled with 1:1s, meetings, code reviews and other things you need to get done?</p>



<p>Earlier this year I was struggling with this question. I needed to expand and nurture my peer group but was too busy with the day to day tasks of leading multiple teams to do anything regularly. That’s when I found this excellent post on <a href="https://blog.danielna.com/starting-an-engineering-management-book-club/">starting an engineering manager book club</a> by Daniel Na. I asked my peers if they’d be interested in starting a book club for engineering managers. They said yes and I got started thinking about what it could look like.</p>



<p>I wanted the book club to, first and foremost, be a place where we could help one another with challenges in our day to day jobs. Sometimes helping someone is as simple as listening to their problems. Sometimes you have experience and can offer more targeted advice and sometimes people just need to vent. I wanted a place where this could happen freely. I also wanted us to grow as a team, learning new ways to manage our engineers, new techniques to motivate and help grow people’s careers.</p>



<p>Having now led a few of these I thought I’d share some tips that have worked well.</p>



<p><strong>1. Keep it small, 8 people or less</strong></p>



<p>One of the goals is to allow everyone a chance to discuss the book and talk about how that’s impacting their day to day challenges. If the group is too big it can make it difficult for a couple of reasons. One reason, logistically speaking, is that it’ll be hard to get everyone a chance to talk in the allotted time. The other problem is a little more nuanced. As the group grows people can be worried about sharing their opinion with a large audience. You may also have someone who dominates the conversation. It’s the job of the moderator to keep the loud ones from <a href="https://www.psychologytoday.com/ca/blog/the-couch/201204/5-steps-dealing-people-who-talk-too-much">talking too much</a> and to get the quiet ones to share their opinions. Keeping the group smaller helps with both of these.</p>



<p><strong>2. Choose the book together</strong></p>



<p>It can be easier to want to read your favourite management book. You know it’s great and will help others just like it helped you. It’s important to choose the book as a group though because it broadens the potential list of books and gives everyone an opportunity to suggest their favourite book. I asked for people’s favourite management books and then did a Slack poll allowing people to vote for their top three. We then read the most voted on the book. This helped ensure the majority of people were actually interested in the book club and helped with attendance.</p>



<p><strong>3. Schedule every meeting from the start</strong></p>



<p>One of the things that worked really well was scheduling every meeting in advance. I planned out every chapter that we’d be reading and scheduled it for the same time every week. We all have busy calendars and planning in advance made it easier to carve out a chunk in everyone’s day. It also helped me plan for days that didn’t work for the majority and allowed me to not have to skip a week because I couldn’t find a time slot that worked.</p>



<p><strong>4. Have the meeting early in the morning</strong></p>



<p>This one is very team and timezone dependent. We found that early mornings before the rush of the day started worked best. People were less likely to have conflicts or meetings that went long and it helped set the tone for the day. I always felt refreshed after the book club, feeling like I could be a better manager to my team.</p>



<p><strong>5. Keep it manageable each week (1 or 2 chapters)</strong></p>



<p>This one is very book dependent. Some books throw a lot of discussable content into each chapter. Some books have very short chapters with themes that span multiple chapters. Plan the book to read 30-60 pages a week.</p>



<p><strong>6. Have some prepared questions but allow the conversation to flow</strong></p>



<p>The goal of a moderator is to guide the conversation. Sometimes that means letting people go where they need to go and sometimes that means guiding the conversation with specific questions. I usually find 3 or 4 questions is the right number for an hour-long discussion with &lt;8 people.</p>



<p>Icebreakers are a good way to get everyone comfortable talking. I like asking questions like “What’s the best piece of advice you’ve ever been given?” or “What’s the most pressing decision you need to make right now”. Sometimes these icebreakers take the entire meeting and that’s ok! If you’re looking for some good icebreakers Vanessa Van Edwards has a <a href="https://www.scienceofpeople.com/meeting-icebreakers/">great article on them</a>.</p>



<p>It’s also ok to have periods of silence. <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/averyblank/2017/06/20/6-ways-leaders-use-silence-to-increase-their-power-that-you-can-do-too/?sh=75b5922427c8">Silence is a tactic</a> you can use to empower others to participate, to drive home an important answer or just to figure out what you want to say next.</p>



<p><strong>7. Call on the quiet people</strong></p>



<p>Not everyone is comfortable sharing. Some people take longer to warm up than others and some people feel like they have nothing valuable to share. Every manager has a unique perspective on things and when they contribute the whole group grows. It’s the job of the moderator to know who’s participating and who isn’t and call on the quiet ones to provide their opinion.</p>



<p><strong>8. Vegas Rules</strong></p>



<p>What happens in the book club stays in the book club. One of the most important rules of running a book club is creating psychological safety. If people don’t feel safe in sharing their management challenges then the discussion will never move past superficial conversation. If the group commits to open and honest conversation that stays within the walls of the book club you can really make something great.</p>



<p><strong>9. Know when to quit a book</strong></p>



<p>Not every book is a winner. You and your book club don’t have to power through a book that isn’t working for you. After the first few meetings, it’s a good idea to check in on everyone and see how they’re enjoying the book. If it feels like you’re trying to pull teeth getting people to share it may be time to move on to another book.</p>



<hr>



<p>These are the things that helped our group have a successful book club. I hope you all can level up your peer group with your own book club and I’d love to hear how it goes.</p>

<h2 id="intended-audience">Intended audience</h2>

<p>GitHub Pages uses <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a publishing system based on the Ruby programming language. The Jekyll documentation is excellent, especially if you already know Jekyll, program in Ruby, and have both Ruby and Jekyll installed on your local computer. The GitHub Pages documentation is comprehensive and excellent–if you’re already a Jekyll expert.</p>

<p><a href="https://tomcam.github.io/least-github-pages/">The Least You Need to Know About GitHub Pages</a> is designed for people who don’t happen to know Jekyll already but who need to get up to speed in GitHub Pages quickly to get a job done <em>now</em>. It tells you not only <em>what</em> to do step by step,
but also briefly explains <em>why</em> you’re doing it.</p>

<p>You probably don’t want to use GitHub Pages on sites that require complex, individual formatting on a per-page basis. 
GitHub Pages uses Markdown, which has some limited formatting information but not a lot.
GitHub Pages then uses Jekyll to turn that Markdown into HTML, based on the Jekyll theme you’ve chosen. Generally speaking this approach is
absolutely ideal for blogs, technical documents and instructional materials that require versioning and collaboration, where the
main work product is words and pictures. It is not a good fit for things like boutique pages, restaurant menu sites, consumer product sites, and so on where
custom formatting is the norm.</p>

<p>I found this thought exercise in the book <a href="https://smile.amazon.com/Happy-More-Less-Everything-Absolutely-ebook/dp/B01HE7TG7Y?sa-no-redirect=1">Happy</a> by Derren Brown.</p>



<p>Imagine <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/07/how-easily-our-lives-could-have-gone-differently/">suddenly everyone disappears</a>, but all of the world’s infrastructure and food supply magically continues to work. So you are the only person on Earth and you don’t have to worry about finding food/water/shelter. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/21/non-fluffy-brainstorming-questions-for-long-term-career-planning/">What would you do all day</a>? </p>



<p>It’s a forcing function to make us realize how much of our behavior is driven by status seeking. It might be fun to drive a Ferrari and live in a mansion with no one around to stop you. You could sleep in the Oval Office! But without anyone else to see it, what’s the point? Once the novelty wore off, what would be left?</p>



<p>Would I still <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/09/running-advice-i-wish-id-gotten/">exercise</a> or eat well if I didn’t have anyone to look good for? Would I still want a nice house, or would I end up somewhere tiny and easy to clean? Would I even care about cleaning if nobody was around to think I’m a slob? Would I have <a href="https://critter.blog/2019/07/01/learning-to-crochet-as-a-32-year-old-man/">hobbies</a> with no one to try to impress or even talk to about them? Would I travel to beautiful places if I had no one to share them with? Would I bother taking pictures of those places if no one else could see them?</p>



<p>What could I <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/09/10/what-the-heck-do-i-even-want/">possibly care about</a>? I honestly have no idea. Does that mean everything I do is status seeking? Or just that without community, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/04/what-we-have-left/">the human condition</a> does not exist? </p>

<hr>
<p>
There are four distinct steps involved in transforming a C or C++ source file into an executable binary: <i>preprocessing</i>, <i>compiling</i>, <i>assembling</i>, and <i>linking</i>.
</p>
<p>
In theory each step is the responsibility of a dedicated tool: the preprocessor <code>cpp</code>, the compiler <code>cc</code>, the assembler <code>as</code>, and the linker <code>ld</code>. In practice the compiler will happily orchestrate all four steps for us and we can build a simple C or C++ program using a single command:
</p>
<pre>$ cc source.c
</pre>
<p>
By default the resulting executable will be given the rather unappealing name of <code>a.out</code> — short for <i>assembler output</i> — but we can fix this by specifying a custom output name:
</p>
<pre>$ cc -o name source.c
</pre>
<p>
We'll look briefly below at each step of the compilation process and summarize some of the most useful options available.
</p>
<p>
The interface we'll describe was developed originally for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Compiler_Collection">GCC</a>  — the GNU C Compiler —  and its supporting toolchain. This interface was later mimicked by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang">Clang</a>, which aimed to be a drop-in replacement for GCC, and so now applies to both. It's a little crufty and inconsistent but the desire for backwards compatibility means we're stuck with it for the foreseeable future.
</p>
<p>
(To avoid repeating the awkward "C or C++" all the time we'll assume below that we're compiling a C program, but the steps and options are identical for both. Just substitute a <code>.cpp</code> extension in place of <code>.c</code> for C++ source files.)
</p>
<h3 id="preprocessing">
Preprocessing
</h3>
<p>
The C preprocessor <code>cpp</code> is responsible for executing <code>#</code> directives and expanding macros. It takes a <code>.c</code> source file as input and outputs an expanded source file, still written in C.
</p>
<p>
Preprocessed files typically aren't retained, but when they are the convention is to give them a <code>.i</code> extension. (I have no idea why.)
</p>
<p>
We can use the compiler's <code>-E</code> flag to view the preprocessed source. Output is printed to standard out by default unless we also use the <code>-o</code> flag to specify an output filename.
</p>
<pre>$ cc -E source.c
</pre>
<p>
The following preprocessor options are available (and can be passed directly to the compiler):
</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>
<code>-C</code>
</td>
<td>
Retain source comments in the output.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<code>-D&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code>
</td>
<td>
Define the named symbol before preprocessing. If no value is specified the symbol will have a default value of 1.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<code>-I&lt;directory&gt;</code>
</td>
<td>
Add the specified directory to the search path for <code>#include</code> files.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<code>-P</code>
</td>
<td>
Omit debugging information from the output.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<code>-U&lt;name&gt;</code>
</td>
<td>
Undefine the named symbol before preprocessing.
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="compiling">
Compiling
</h3>
<p>
The compiler <code>cc</code> translates a source file written in C into <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assembly_language">assembly language</a>.
</p>
<p>
Assembly language is a human-readable representation of the binary machine code that actually runs on the computer's hardware; as such it's specific to the CPU architecture of the target system.
</p>
<p>
Assembly language files typically aren't retained but we can view them using the compiler's <code>-S</code> flag which halts the compilation process after they've been generated.
</p>
<pre>$ cc -S source.c
</pre>
<p>
This will generate a <code>.s</code> assembly file for each input file provided.
</p>
<h3 id="assembling">
Assembling
</h3>
<p>
The assembler <code>as</code> translates source files written in assembly language into executable binary code. It outputs a single <code>.o</code> object file for each input file provided.
</p>
<p>
The compiler defaults to automatically deleting these object files but we can retain them using the <code>-c</code> flag.
</p>
<pre>$ cc -c source.c
</pre>
<p>
This instructs the compiler to compile and assemble the object files but stop before linking them into an executable.
</p>
<h3 id="linking">
Linking
</h3>
<p>
Linking is the final stage of the compilation process. The linker <code>ld</code> combines multiple object files into a single executable file. It also links in code from the standard library and any other external libraries referenced by the files.
</p>
<p>
The C standard library is linked in automatically. To link in a static library <code>libfoo.a</code> located on the default library search path we use the <code>-l</code> flag:
</p>
<pre>$ cc source.c -lfoo
</pre>
<p>
Note that the standard <code>lib</code> prefix and <code>.a</code> (<i>archive</i>) extension are omitted. To link to a library that isn't on the default search path we have two options:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>
We can specify the library's full filepath as if it were a source or object file:
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre>$ cc source.c /path/to/lib/libfoo.a
</pre>
<ol start="2">
<li>
<p>
We can add the containing directory to the search path using the <code>-L</code> flag:
</p>
</li>
</ol>
<pre>$ cc source.c -L/path/to/lib -lfoo
</pre>
<p>
Note that libraries must be specified <i>after</i> the source or object files that reference them.
</p>
<h3 id="multiple-files">
Multiple Files
</h3>
<p>
The compiler will happily accept multiple input files in varying stages of compilation:
</p>
<pre>$ cc src.c asm.s obj.o
</pre>
<p>
In this case <code>src.c</code> will be compiled and assembled, <code>asm.s</code> will be assembled, and the two resulting object files will be linked with <code>obj.o</code> into an executable.
</p>
<h3 id="warnings-standards">
Warnings &amp; Standards
</h3>
<p>
Turn on compiler warnings with the following flags:
</p>
<pre>-Wall -Wextra --std=c99 --pedantic
</pre>
<p>
The <code>-Wall</code> and <code>-Wextra</code> flags turn on most of the compiler's available warnings. The <code>--std=c99</code> flag instructs the compiler to use the C99 standard (available options include <code>c90</code> and <code>c11</code>). The final <code>--pedantic</code> flag turns on a number of additional warnings specific to the particular standard chosen.
</p>
<p>
Warnings can be turned off individually, e.g.
</p>
<pre>-Wno-unused-parameter
</pre>
<p>
will tell the compiler to stop bugging us about unused parameters.
</p>
<h3 id="compiling-static-libraries">
Compiling Static Libraries
</h3>
<p>
A static library is simply a collection or <i>archive</i> of object files. Static libraries are created using the <code>ar</code> (<i>archiver</i>) tool and by convention are given a <code>lib</code> prefix and <code>.a</code> extension.
</p>
<pre>$ ar -rv libfoo.a one.o two.o three.o
</pre>
<p>
Static libraries are built into the executable at compiletime — they do not have to be present on the system at runtime.
</p>
<h3 id="compiling-dynamic-libraries">
Compiling Dynamic Libraries
</h3>
<p>
A dynamic or <i>shared object</i> library is a special collection of object files that can be loaded by a program at runtime. Dynamic libraries are created using the compiler's <code>--shared</code> flag and by convention are given a <code>lib</code> prefix and <code>.so</code> extension.
</p>
<pre>$ cc --shared -o libfoo.so one.o two.o three.o
</pre>
<p>
Dynamic libraries can be used in two ways:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
An executable can be linked against a dynamic library at compiletime. Multiple executables can then share a single library instance, which must be available on the system at runtime.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
An executable can dynamically load and unload library files at runtime using the system's dynamic linking functions. Libraries used in this way can form the basis of a plugin system for an application.
</p>
</li>
</ul>

                          <p>Version 1.0.  It’s here.  After three and a half years of development,
we are happy to announce the release of version 1.0 of Sequoia!</p>
<p>The release includes the low-level crate <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sequoia-openpgp"><code>sequoia-openpgp</code></a>, and a
program to verify detached signatures geared towards software
distribution systems called <a href="https://crates.io/crates/sequoia-sqv"><code>sqv</code></a>.</p>
<p>We will support this API with security updates for at least one year.
In 9 months, we will announce whether we will extend this commitment.
The two main criteria will be our financial situation (please
<a href="https://pep.foundation/support-pep/index.html">donate</a>, or sponsor a developer or two), and the number of users.</p>

<p>We actually <a href="https://mastodon.social/@sequoiapgp/103364362621954545">almost released</a> version 1.0 about a year ago.  All of the
features that we had planned for version 1.0 were implemented, we had
good test coverage, and we even had a few users.  But, we decided to
wait.  We decided to wait not because we thought of another feature,
or because we became aware of a significant bug, but because <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/465">we</a>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/466">decided</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/467">to</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/468">take</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/469">some</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/470">time</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/471">to</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/472">improve</a>
<a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/473">our</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/474">documentation</a>.</p>
<p>Our goal was to make sure that every module had a helpful
introduction, and all public methods had a useful description, a link
to <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880">the standard</a>, when appropriate, and a meaningful example.
Dividing the task between five people, we figured it would delay the
release by a month, perhaps two.  In the end, well, it took nearly a
year, and we had to scale our ambitions back a bit.  Nevertheless,
we’re quite happy with <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/cert/index.html">the</a> <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/parse/stream/trait.DecryptionHelper.html">result</a>.</p>
<p>First, the documentation is much better.  It’s of course hard to
quantify its quality.  But, we can distill a few numbers.  When we
started our documentation effort shortly after we released version
0.14, the Sequoia library had just over 11k lines of comments
including 53 documentation tests, and 37 kSLOC including 12 kSLOC of
unit tests.  The 1.0 release has over 33k lines of comments (190%
more) including 464 documentation tests (780% more), and 44 kSLOC (21%
or 7.5 kSLOC more) including 8k SLOC of additional unit tests.</p>
<p>Second, in the process of documenting our public API and writing
examples, we discovered many minor annoyances, some inconsistencies,
and more than a few bugs.  Since we hadn’t yet commited to a stable
API, we could and did fix them.</p>
<p>Finally, as the rate of change of the API had decreased, more projects
were willing to try out Sequoia.  They provided additional useful
feedback, which we integrated.</p>
<p>All in all, we feel that with version 1.0 we’ve not only checked the
<a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/news/cyberpunk-2077-is-a-disaster-on-ps4-and-xbox-one-and-it-gets-worse">right boxes</a>, but we also have a high-quality API and implementation
that we can be proud of.</p>

<p>Sequoia was started 3.5 years ago by Justus Winter, Kai Michaelis and
me, Neal Walfield.  Prior to working on Sequoia, the three of us had
worked together at <a href="http://www.g10code.de/">g10code</a> on <a href="https://gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a>.  The <a href="https://pep.foundation/">p≡p foundation</a> hired
us not only to create a new OpenPGP implementation using a new
architecture and programming language, but to improve the ecosystem
around privacy-preserving tools as a whole.</p>
<p>The Sequoia library is a first step in that direction.  But it is not
our end goal.  Indeed, over the past three years, we’ve helped other
OpenPGP implementations.  We’ve reported bugs that we’ve found (thanks
in particular to our <a href="https://tests.sequoia-pgp.org/">OpenPGP interoperability test suite</a>), and even
contributed some fixes to other OpenPGP implementations.</p>
<p>And, we’ve invested in tooling.  We developed <a href="https://gitlab.com/hagrid-keyserver/hagrid">Hagrid</a>, a new
verifying OpenPGP key server, which powers <a href="https://keys.openpgp.org/">keys.openpgp.org</a> and is
now maintained by Vincent Breitmoser.  We’ve helped <a href="https://openpgp-ca.gitlab.io/openpgp-ca/">OpenPGP CA</a>, a
tool written by Heiko Schaefer to create <em>federated</em> CAs for groups
like activists, lawyers, and journalists, but also companies, who
don’t want to trust centralized infrastructure whose primary
incentives are monetary.  OpenPGP CA significantly simplifies key
discovery and authentication for unsophisticated OpenPGP users.  We’ve
developed <a href="https://gitlab.com/koverto/koverto">Koverto</a>, an SMTP proxy, which makes it easy to sign and
encrypt mails sent by services that don’t support OpenPGP out of the
box, like most CMSes.  We developed a tool, <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/keyring-linter"><code>sq-keyring-linter</code></a>
(<a href="https://packages.debian.org/sid/sq-keyring-linter">Debian</a>), to help users update their OpenPGP Certificates, so that
we can <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/Rp-inhYKT8A9H5E34iLTrc9I0gc/">finally get rid of SHA-1</a>.</p>
<p>We’re thinking big.  We’re thinking not only about mail encryption or
even encryption in general, but also about integrity and
authentication.  And, we’re thinking in particular, about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure">PKI</a>.  If
users can’t easily find the <strong>right</strong> certificate for a communication
partner, encryption and digital signatures are worthless, and possibly
even dangerous.</p>

<p>In designing Sequoia, we took a library-first approach.  Although we
have a command-line tool, <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sq/index.html"><code>sq</code></a>, which we are not yet releasing, we
intend for the library to always provide a richer, more expressive
interface.  We agree that there is value in process separation, but we
want to avoid the dangerous complexity of <em>safely</em> shelling out to
another program.</p>
<p>The sequoia-openpgp crate (Rust’s terminology for a library) is a
low-level, policy-free OpenPGP implementation.  Our goal was to
implement all of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880">RFC 4880</a>, and provide an API that can be used to
access and modify pretty much everything, but is simultaneously secure
by default.</p>
<p>We understand low-level to mean not only an API that provides getters
and setters, but an API that provides interfaces to parse and
serialize those fields, and can combine them in ways intended by the
standard, and needed by users.  For instance, the <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/struct.Cert.html"><code>Cert</code></a> data
structure encapsulates an OpenPGP certificate (casually referred to as
an OpenPGP key).  It canonicalizes the structure, and makes it easy to
<a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/cert/struct.ValidCert.html#method.revocation_status">query its properties</a>.  But, it does so in such a way that it is
still possible for a user to inspect and modify the low-level bits
themselves without reimplementing the rest of the functionality.
Another example is the <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/parse/stream/trait.DecryptionHelper.html"><code>DecryptionHelper</code></a>, which makes it easy to
parse and decrypt an OpenPGP message.</p>
<p>An example of how we make the API safe by default is that it is hard
to accidentally export secret key material.  In Sequoia, you have to
explicitly <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/struct.Cert.html#secret-keys">opt-in to export it</a>.  Similarly, when <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/packet/signature/struct.SignatureBuilder.html">updating a
signature</a>, the creation time, hash algorithm, and issuer are
automatically updated.  This is usually what the user wants, but is
easy to forget, and hard to debug when forgotten.  Critically, it is
easy to opt out when that behavior is not desired.</p>
<p>While developing Sequoia, we spent a lot of time thinking about
extremes and corner cases.  For instance, OpenPGP supports
notarizations (signatures over signatures), but as far as we know no
OpenPGP implementation supports them.  We implemented support for it
anyway, and it improved the ergonomics of the common case.</p>
<h2 id="notable-details">Notable Details</h2>
<p>The devel is in the details.  And while deviloping Sequoia, we paid
attention.  Here are a few noteworthy details:</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1">SHA-1</a> has been broken since 2005.  And, in 2011 NIST deprecated its
use.  Initially, we decided to simply reject any signature that used
SHA-1.  However, we were recently forced to <a href="https://mailarchive.ietf.org/arch/msg/openpgp/Rp-inhYKT8A9H5E34iLTrc9I0gc/">reevaluate</a> <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/595">that
decision</a>: 22% of Debian developers use a certificate that relies on
SHA-1 as do 63% of Arch developers.  Even the Fedora release keys use
SHA-1.</p>
<p>We decided that we couldn’t simply reenable SHA-1.  After some
consideration, we’ve opted to <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/policy/enum.HashAlgoSecurity.html">permit it</a> in contexts where collision
attacks similar to the one presented in <a href="https://sha-mbles.github.io/">SHA-1 is a Shambles</a> are
harder.  We also use a variant of SHA-1 called <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sha1collisiondetection">SHA1CD</a> (SHA-1
Collision Detection), which detects and neutralizes the known attacks
against SHA-1.  Among others, <a href="https://github.blog/2017-03-20-sha-1-collision-detection-on-github-com/">GitHub uses it</a>.  And, we have also
decided to <strong><a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/policy/struct.StandardPolicy.html#method.reject_hash_at">start rejecting SHA-1 by default</a> at the beginning of
2023</strong>, i.e., in a bit more than two years.  This will hopefully give
Debian developers and others sufficient time to <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/keyring-linter">fix</a> or replace their
certificates.</p>
<p>When we create a signature, we include a <a href="https://gitlab.com/sequoia-pgp/sequoia/-/issues/597">salt</a>.  This makes it harder
for an attacker to predict what data a user will sign.  And, it foils
attacks where an attacker needs multiple signatures over the same
message.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://www.undeadly.org/cgi?action=article;sid=20190621081455">OpenSSH</a>, we <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/crypto/mem/struct.Encrypted.html">encrypt secret key material</a> while it is in
memory.  This frustrates side-channel attacks.</p>
<p>Sequoia supports <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/serialize/stream/padding/index.html">padding messages</a> to obfuscate an encrypted
message’s length.  We include support for the <a href="https://bford.info/pub/sec/purb.pdf">padmé</a> scheme, but
other schemes can be plugged in.</p>
<p>To allow users to control the policy while still using higher-level
functionality, Sequoia uses a <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/policy/index.html">policy object</a>.  A policy object is
passed to any method that checks something for validity.  For
instance, when a method needs to determine whether a binding signature
should be used, it invokes the policy object’s <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/policy/trait.Policy.html#method.signature"><code>signature</code> callback</a>.
Our experience suggests that this approach greatly simplifies dealing
with this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-cutting_concern">cross-cutting concern</a> in a highly flexible manner.</p>
<p>Policy objects can also be embedded in other objects.  For instance, a
<a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/cert/struct.ValidCert.html"><code>ValidCert</code></a> encapsulates a <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/struct.Cert.html"><code>Cert</code></a> and a policy object.  This
ensures that the application of the policy is consistent, and hard to
forget to apply.</p>
<p>In Sequoia, we prefer the use of formal grammars rather than ad-hoc
parsing when doing any non-trivial parsing.  For instance, when
verifying the structure of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-11.1">OpenPGP Certificates</a> and <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4880#section-11.3">OpenPGP
Messages</a>, we use <a href="https://github.com/lalrpop/lalrpop">LALRPOP</a>, a parser generator, to generate the
parser.</p>
<p>Sequoia implements a streaming API.  If not careful, this can lead to
a consumer processing unauthenticated data, which was exploited by
<a href="https://efail.de/">EFAIL</a>.  To mitigate this type of failure, the <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/parse/stream/trait.DecryptionHelper.html"><code>DecryptionHelper</code></a>
withholds the last <code>O(1)</code> bytes of data, and only releases it if the
message can be authenticated.  This makes it harder for an attacker to
control what is released.  And for short messages, nothing is released
since the whole message is buffered.</p>
<p>We’ve tried to ensure that data structures that may be used in a
side-channel sensitive context use constant time comparisons.</p>
<p>Where possible, we use a device driver-style API so that it is
straightforward to add new backends.  For instance, our <a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/crypto/trait.Signer.html"><code>Signer</code></a> and
<a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_openpgp/parse/stream/struct.Decryptor.html"><code>Decryptor</code></a> traits make it easy to implement alternative signing and
decryption backends.  In addition to the in-memory implementations, we
already have implementations that use secret key material managed by
<a href="https://docs.sequoia-pgp.org/sequoia_ipc/gnupg/struct.KeyPair.html">gpg agent</a>.</p>
<p>We tried hard to provide helpful error messages.  This is particularly
difficult …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wow! Yesterday the EU published the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">Digital Markets Act</a>, a legislative proposal seeking to protect the fundamental rights of users in the digital world. &nbsp;This proposal has the potential to be a major catalyst for the emergence of a unifying communications layer for the open web.<br></p><p>Indeed the Digital Markets Act is pushing interoperability between messaging apps, which is a major win for consumers.</p><p>People will no longer be forced into - or trapped within - walled gardens like Facebook Messenger or WhatsApp. Instead, they should be able to choose any app they prefer, and then communicate with anyone - just like you can choose your email provider and still email people that use a different one; or call people on different phone networks.<br></p><p>In fact, when you think about it, it’s crazy that messaging apps don’t already interoperate.<br></p><p>To quote the EU’s proposal:<br></p><p><em>Concretely, the Digital Markets Act will[...]:</em></p><ul><li><em><em><em>Require gatekeepers to proactively put in place certain measures, such as targeted measures allowing the software of third parties to properly function and interoperate with their own services;</em></em></em></li><li><em><em><em>Impose sanctions for non-compliance, which could include fines of up to 10% of the gatekeeper's worldwide turnover, to ensure the effectiveness of the new rules.</em></em></em><br></li></ul><p><strong>An idea whose time has come</strong><br></p><p>That’s something that occurred to us back in 2014, when we started development on <a href="https://matrix.org/">Matrix</a>. We saw the way the web was increasingly centralised and that the general public were being robbed of their privacy. We set about creating a disruptive, decentralised open communications network that would put ordinary people back in control of their online conversations. Through Matrix, they would be able to host their app wherever they wanted. Instead of having to leave it on the servers of a proprietary walled garden app; leaving it there, under the ownership of the service provider, free to be monetised, datamined (or breached, or anything else).<br></p><p>We thought that tech-savvy, early-adopters would propel the project forward and we were right, to an extent. We have a fantastic community behind us, who have supported us through thick and thin. <br></p><p>We then quite quickly realised that governments were very interested in decentralised real time communications, because it assured them of their digital sovereignty. Our first flagship deployment, the French government’s <a href="https://static.element.io/pdfs/case-study-france-embraces-matrix-to-build-tchap.pdf">Tchap platform</a>, was proof of that; along with a slew of similar deployments around the world. Most of those have been on-premise deployments. We’re now seeing open source companies and security-conscious commercial firms adopting Element and Matrix, mainly through <a href="https://ems.element.io/">Element Matrix Services</a>; our Matrix-based hosting service.<br></p><p>What we didn’t foresee, especially in such a short timeframe, was that those centralised platform giants would become so dominant that legislators would also disrupt the marketplace. For the EU, it’s not just about igniting innovation in a dominated marketplace. It’s also a push to improve online privacy, stronger personal data ownership and raise security standards.</p><figure><img src="https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-at-09.01.42.png" alt="" srcset="https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-at-09.01.42.png 600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-at-09.01.42.png 1000w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-at-09.01.42.png 1600w, https://element.io/blog/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-16-at-09.01.42.png 1750w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p><strong>This is for everyone</strong><br></p><p>These serendipitous improvements will take place because consumers will be able to pick a messaging app based on <strong>what</strong> it offers, not <strong>who</strong> it offers. And people are far more likely to choose privacy-respecting apps, where their data isn’t mined and sold off to advertisers or exploited to swing elections. Privacy - and security - should improve as a result. <br></p><p>It’s an initial blow to the likes of Facebook and Google whose business model is based on collecting and harvesting users’ data. But hopefully, they will commit to interoperability and compete on features, rather than locking people into their proprietary systems.<br></p><div><p>Indeed, instead of slipping into a comfortable middle age, they will be kept on their toes by a changing landscape and a new breed of competitors who can challenge not just those incumbents but the very notion of centralised technology.</p></div><p><strong>The interoperability the EU wants already exists</strong><br></p><p>For Element, and Matrix, this is a significant moment. Europe is looking to transform a centralised, siloed, gatekeeper-centric digital landscape into a new era of competitive, interoperable and privacy-centric communications.<br></p><p>Matrix - as both a protocol and a network - already exists. It offers digital sovereignty, interoperability and security. It can even operate on a peer-to-peer basis; independent of traditional internet infrastructure and able to connect the unconnected in the world’s most rural places.<br></p><p>As the internet giants react to Europe’s new direction - and step through the stages of denial, anger and bargaining - once thing they cannot deny is that an open standard for communication interoperability already exists. <br></p><p>Technically, we can have interoperability between all messaging apps in place before Spring 2021. Let’s see how long the politics - company politics - take to play out.</p></div></div>]]>

However, availability of these items may be compromised during periods of high demand, such as in a pandemic. Recently, sterilization and decontamination of face masks has emerged as a novel method to prolong the limited supply of existing respirators. The study evaluated particle penetration for commonly available face masks and alternatives.

A limitation of this study is the decision to test each mask on a single man (and woman for a few comparisons) rather than a large number of individuals with a full range of facial configurations.</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/IMG_2187.jpeg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/IMG_2187.jpeg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/IMG_2187.jpeg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/IMG_2187.jpeg 1057w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598207951491-255eaf139751?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGZhY2UlMjBtYXNrfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="Man wearing a black mask" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598207951491-255eaf139751?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGZhY2UlMjBtYXNrfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598207951491-255eaf139751?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGZhY2UlMjBtYXNrfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598207951491-255eaf139751?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGZhY2UlMjBtYXNrfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598207951491-255eaf139751?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDJ8fGZhY2UlMjBtYXNrfGVufDB8fHw&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://unsplash.com/@gmalhotra?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Gayatri Malhotra</a> / <a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure><p>Even face masks with less than 95% FFE (eg, surgical masks) are effective in preventing acquisition of epidemic coronaviruses.

  <div itemprop="articleBody">
    <p>After two and a half years of being independent, I am returning to Google.</p>

<p>The time off was really valuable. I was still feeling residual effects from burnout on the Android team in late 2015, and also drained by family and personal things that were happening and needed more time and energy. I got that, and return recharged and with some insights that I hope will be useful. I’ll touch on a few of those in this post. Each could probably be its own blog post, but today I want to briefly note the event.</p>

<p>I am now a research software engineer on the Google Fonts team, working on a number of topics in font technology, including font design tools, GPU-accelerated font rendering, and evolution of font file formats to be more efficient and capable.</p>

<h2 id="on-open-source-sustainability">On open source sustainability</h2>

<p>Much has been written on open source sustainability, notably <a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/">Nadia Eghbal</a>’s <em>Working in Public.</em> I won’t speak to open source more broadly (except to note how impressed I am with Blender and Krita), but for the specific task of building an ecosystem for a library, I think there is one model that actually works: being hired by a company that depends on that ecosystem.</p>

<p>To some extent, that’s an indictment of our capitalist system. In an ideal universe, there would be strong institutions dedicated to the public interest where open source developers could develop, researchers could research, and spend an absolute minimum of time and energy hustling for support. For software, in any case, universities are not that (as demonstrated by <a href="https://blog.cocalc.com/2019/04/12/should-i-resign-from-my-full-professor-job-to-work-fulltime-on-cocalc.html">William Stein’s experience with Cocalc at University of Washington</a>), otherwise I’d be quite tempted. In the actual world, working for a company like Google is about as close as you can come.</p>

<p>I remain skeptical of patronage-style platforms such as Patreon or Github Sponsors. I think it’s possible to make them work, but only for a small number of fortunate people, and even then, the incentives for creating maximum value aren’t that well aligned with the incentive structure of hustling on social media.</p>

<p>So me (re-)joining Google full time is basically a statement of confidence in this model of being employed to work on open source. Other models can work, and people should definitely find what works for them, but particularly for the projects I’m interested in, it makes sense.</p>

<h2 id="on-rust">On Rust</h2>

<p>I continue to love Rust, and believe it offers a stronger foundation for building software. I feel like I started my Rust journey in the early ’90s, when I was working on retrofitting <a href="https://theory.stanford.edu/~aiken/publications/papers/pldi95.pdf">static memory management</a> to ML, using explicit lifetime regions.</p>

<p>Rust adoption is trending up, including at Google. The language is in good shape, but the library ecosystem is still fairly immature, missing a number of critical pieces. Building up that ecosystem is an incredibly rewarding project.</p>

<p>I am particularly excited about Rust for font technology and infrastructure. Today, Python rules on the font design and production side, partly to the connection of typeface designer <a href="https://medium.com/type-thursday/learning-python-makes-you-a-better-designer-an-interview-with-just-van-rossum-8d4758c192d8">Just van Rossum</a> being Guido’s brother. The flexibility and expressiveness of Python makes it a good fit, but we’ve also gotten to a place where the <em>production</em> of fonts is done in Python, and the <em>consumption</em> is in C++.</p>

<p>Rust lets us build reliable, performant code that can also be deployed in production, and can be the basis of fluidly interactive UI tools. I’m not the only one who sees this potential; YesLogic is building their next-generation font shaper <a href="https://github.com/yeslogic/allsorts">Allsorts</a> in Rust, for many of the same reasons.</p>

<p>The Google Fonts team has been interested in adopting more Rust for a while, and part of my role is to facilitate that. I’m really looking forward to it.</p>

<h2 id="on-research">On research</h2>

<p>I have rebranded myself somewhat as a researcher, but that doesn’t <em>quite</em> capture the whole story either. I have always loved research, and that love sustained the energy to complete my <a href="https://levien.com/phd/phd.html">PhD</a>, but I also love building real things, and actually feel that many of these practical problems are more interesting than many of the abstract topics fashionable in academia. Just as much as writing papers and so on, I’m trying to build open source software and community around that. There isn’t really a word for this role, but even without such a word I’m trying to consciously create it for myself, and am grateful that Google is allowing me to try.</p>

<h2 id="on-the-work">On the work</h2>

<p>This is the most exciting part for me. I have a very long-term interest in 2D graphics, font technology, and UI, and have been doing a bunch of interesting things on all these fronts. I expect to spend most of my time continuing to advance research on all these frontiers.</p>

<p>The scope of these projects is large, and more ambitious than one person could really do. That’s one reason I’ve been consciously developing an open source community around them. That will continue.</p>

<p>Most of the day-to-day work on <a href="https://github.com/linebender/druid">Druid</a> and <a href="https://github.com/linebender/runebender">Runebender</a> will be done by Colin Rofls, though I very much enjoy getting my elbows in the code too and will be doing some of that.</p>

<p>A major focus will be building out the <a href="https://github.com/linebender/piet-gpu/blob/master/doc/vision.md">piet-gpu vision</a>. I believe a high-performance 2D rendering engine will be a great thing for the Rust ecosystem and with potential for large impact. It feels like good research; whether it goes into production at scale or not, I expect the things we learn from doing it will help inform the next generation of UI technology. That’s equally true for research into fundamental UI principles, for example the <a href="https://raphlinus.github.io/rust/druid/2020/09/25/principled-reactive-ui.html">Crochet</a> architecture for Druid.</p>

<p>There are also really exciting advances in <a href="https://github.com/linebender/spline">spline</a> technology in the pipeline. I think these have the potential to be a more appealing and productive basis for drawing fonts than cubic Béziers. The next big step is to validate whether they actually work as well as I’m hoping. That involves polishing the UX and integrating them into Runebender. If that turns out really well, a longer term (but more speculative) aspiration is to get them into a font format, where they could reduce binary size while increasing quality. It’s obvious the Google Fonts team is the best home for this work.</p>

<p>I have a lot of work in front of me, but am more excited than ever. On to an old new adventure, and may 2021 be a time of healing and renewed energy for all.</p>

      <div>
  
  <p><span>14 Dec 2020</span></p><p>An application is a living, breathing code base that will continually change over time. As the application evolves, early decisions won’t scale, and shortcuts taken will reveal technical debt. When the time comes to address these problems, one thing you can start doing today to make refactoring tomorrow easier is using encapsulation.</p>



<p>Imagine your application has a <code>User</code> model, and the <code>User</code> can have a role. The role is stored as a column on the model.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># == Schema Information</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Table name: users</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#  id                     :bigint(8)        not null, primary key</span>
<span>#  email                  :string           default(""), not null</span>
<span>#  first_name             :string</span>
<span>#  last_name              :string</span>
<span>#  role                   :string</span>
<span>#  created_at             :datetime         not null</span>
<span>#  updated_at             :datetime         not null</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>class</span> <span>User</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationRecord</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>You might have actions in your controller where you check if a user has a specific role. You might decide to directly access the role attribute and compare it with the role you care about:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>ItemController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>update</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>role</span> <span>==</span> <span>'admin'</span> <span>||</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>role</span> <span>==</span> <span>'operations'</span>
       <span>update_item</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>[</span><span>:item_id</span><span>])</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>While this seems harmless at first, it becomes painful to refactor when you have to extend the relationship so a user can have many roles.</p>

<h2 id="extending-role-to-its-own-model">Extending Role To Its Own Model</h2>

<p>Imagine your product manager asks you to support users having multiple roles. You will have to move the role attribute from the <code>User</code> model to its own model.</p>

<h3 id="models">Models</h3>

<p>The resulting model design might look like the following. The <code>User</code> model now has a <code>has_many</code> relationship through a joining class (<code>UserRole</code>) to a <code>Role</code> model.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># == Schema Information</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Table name: users</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#  id                     :bigint(8)        not null, primary key</span>
<span>#  email                  :string           default(""), not null</span>
<span>#  first_name             :string</span>
<span>#  last_name              :string</span>
<span>#  role                   :string</span>
<span>#  created_at             :datetime         not null</span>
<span>#  updated_at             :datetime         not null</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>class</span> <span>User</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:user_roles</span><span>,</span> <span>dependent: :destroy</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:roles</span><span>,</span> <span>through: :user_roles</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span># == Schema Information</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Table name: user_roles</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#  id         :bigint(8)        not null, primary key</span>
<span>#  created_at :datetime         not null</span>
<span>#  updated_at :datetime         not null</span>
<span>#  role_id    :bigint(8)</span>
<span>#  user_id    :bigint(8)</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>class</span> <span>UserRole</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span>belongs_to</span> <span>:user</span>
  <span>belongs_to</span> <span>:role</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<div><div><pre><code><span># == Schema Information</span>
<span>#</span>
<span># Table name: users</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>#  id                     :bigint(8)        not null, primary key</span>
<span>#  name                   :string</span>
<span>#  created_at             :datetime         not null</span>
<span>#  updated_at             :datetime         not null</span>
<span>#</span>
<span>class</span> <span>Role</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:user_roles</span><span>,</span> <span>dependent: :destroy</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:users</span><span>,</span> <span>through: :user_roles</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>

<p>Instead of checking if a <code>user.role</code> is equal to a role, we’ll now check if a specific role is in the list of roles attached to a user.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>admin_role</span> <span>=</span> <span>Role</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>name: </span><span>'admin'</span><span>)</span>
<span>operations_role</span> <span>=</span> <span>Role</span><span>.</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>name</span> <span>:</span> <span>'operations'</span><span>)</span>
<span>user</span> <span>=</span> <span>User</span><span>.</span><span>find</span><span>(</span><span>1</span><span>)</span>

<span># add roles to user</span>
<span>user</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>admin_role</span>
<span>user</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span> <span>&lt;&lt;</span> <span>operations_role</span>
<span>user</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span> <span># [&lt;Role name: 'admin'&gt;, &lt;Role name: 'operations'&gt;]</span>

<span># check if a user is an admin</span>
<span>user</span><span>.</span><span>roles</span><span>.</span><span>exists?</span><span>(</span><span>name: </span><span>'admin'</span><span>)</span> <span># true</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<h3 id="refactoring-usages">Refactoring Usages</h3>

<p>When we refactor the <code>ItemController</code> to use these new models and methods, we first want to bring all methods into the <code>User</code> class and then update usages.</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># Encapsulate all User role related methods.</span>
<span># New feature is also gated behind a feature flag.</span>

<span>class</span> <span>User</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationRecord</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:user_roles</span><span>,</span> <span>dependent: :destroy</span>
  <span>has_many</span> <span>:roles</span><span>,</span> <span>through: :user_roles</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>has_role?</span><span>(</span><span>role_name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>feature_flag_on?</span>
      <span>roles</span><span>.</span><span>exists?</span><span>(</span><span>name: </span><span>role_name</span><span>)</span>
    <span>else</span>
      <span>role</span> <span>==</span> <span>role_name</span>
    <span>end</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>admin?</span>
    <span>has_role?</span><span>(</span><span>'admin'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>operations?</span>
    <span>has_role?</span><span>(</span><span>'operations'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>end</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>With these methods now encapsulated in the <code>User</code> class, checking if a user has a certain role becomes easy!</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span># No explicit feature flag check needed.</span>
<span># All logic is encapsulated inside the User methods.</span>

<span>class</span> <span>ItemController</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>ApplicationController</span>
  <span>def</span> <span>update</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>admin?</span> <span>||</span> <span>user</span><span>.</span><span>operations?</span>
       <span>update_item</span><span>(</span><span>params</span><span>[</span><span>:item_id</span><span>])</span>
    <span>end</span>

<span>end</span>

It <a href="https://www.stjohns.edu/about/leadership-and-administration/administrative-offices/office-provost/policies-procedures-and-reports">advertises</a> “freedom of inquiry.” But earlier this fall, it found a professor <a href="https://www.thefire.org/teaching-history-not-permitted-st-johns-bulldozes-academic-freedom-punishes-professor-for-posing-question-about-columbian-exchange/">guilty</a> of “bias, discrimination, and harassment” for asking his introductory history class if the positives of expanding global trade in the 15th and 16th centuries justified the negatives. The slave trade was part of this phenomenon, so some people judged the question off-limits, and a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CE9udVzpYkC/">group</a> of self-declared radicals petitioned to have him fired. Now, adjunct professor Richard Taylor, a former 9/11 first responder, cannot even serve as a guest lecturer about 9/11—<a href="https://www.thefire.org/update-st-johns-limits-academic-freedom-of-history-department-in-ongoing-effort-to-punish-professor-for-asking-question/">he’s barred from teaching</a>.</p><p>Then there’s the case from earlier this year at Babson College. Administrators demonstrated that they understood comedy as poorly as they understood free expression when it came to Professor Asheen Phansey, who made a private, satirical joke on Facebook. He was responding to President Donald Trump’s threat to bomb 52 Iranian locations, including cultural sites. “In retaliation,” Phansey quipped, “Ayatollah Khomenei should tweet a list of 52 sites of beloved American cultural heritage that he would bomb. Um… Mall of America? …Kardashian residence?” The administrators <a href="https://www.thefire.org/babson-college-abandons-freedom-of-expression-fires-professor-over-facebook-post-criticizing-trump-threat-to-bomb-iran-cultural-sites/">fired</a> him.</p><div><p>College leaders please nobody when they try to please everybody in a cancel campaign. So why try? Instead, why not defend the core enlightenment mission of a college, which the University of Chicago describes as the “discovery, improvement, and dissemination of knowledge”? That language appears in the <a href="http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/07/pdf/kalverpt.pdf">Kalven Report</a>, which the university commissioned in 1967 to address the tension between open inquiry and activism in a university environment. The report states that “a university must sustain an extraordinary environment of freedom of inquiry and maintain an independence from political fashions, passions, and pressures.”</p><p>Living up to these values may be hard but, with sufficient courage, it’s possible. Perhaps the best example of a college president with backbone when faced with an effort to banish a professor comes from 20 years ago, before “cancel culture” was part of our popular lexicon.</p></div><div><p>In December 2000, the renowned poet and University of Alaska Professor Linda McCarriston published a poem called “<a href="https://www.thefire.org/linda-mccarristons-indian-girls-2/">Indian Girls</a>,” about alcoholism and the sexual abuse of children in Native American communities. Students protested, including some in McCarriston’s class. They <a href="https://www.thefire.org/professors-poem-draws-fiery-conflict/">argued</a> that the poem was insulting and stereotyping of Native communities. Then came the investigation. That is, until the university president, Mark R. Hamilton, heard about it. </p><p>Hamilton was a <a href="https://www.alaska.edu/uajourney/presidents/1998-2010-mark-r.-hamilto/">retired U.S. Army major general</a> who brokered peace negotiations in El Salvador and Somalia. He was also an admirer of the First Amendment’s protection for freedom of speech, and knew it was his job as a government official leading a public university system to guarantee that protection. </p></div><p>Besides the “Indian Girls” imbroglio, there was also a controversy around an invited campus speaker, and an open letter from faculty members written to President Bill Clinton against a proposal to drill within the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The open letter prompted Alaska’s governor to call Hamilton to complain: What are you going to do about it?</p><p>Responding to all three matters at once, Hamilton wrote an <a href="https://www.thefire.org/president-hamiltons-memo/">open letter of his own</a>. “What I want to make clear and unambiguous is that responses to complaints or demands for action regarding constitutionally guaranteed freedoms of speech CANNOT BE QUALIFIED,” he wrote. </p><p>“Attempts to assuage anger or to demonstrate concern by qualifying our support for free speech serve to cloud what must be a clear message. Noting that, for example, ‘The University supports the right to free speech, but we intend to check into this matter,’ or ‘The University supports the right of free speech, but I have asked Dean X or Provost Y to investigate the circumstances,’ is unacceptable. There is nothing to ‘check into,’ nothing ‘to investigate.’ ” </p><p>Case closed.</p><p><strong>For years, we at the <a href="http://thefire.org/">Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a> (FIRE) </strong>have worked to defend free speech and academic freedom on campus. Two observations we can make are: 1) colleges used to get in front of these controversies faster and more categorically than they do now; and 2) when they do remove the possibility of punishment and assert their values from the beginning, the demands tend to peter out, often quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>Qualifying free-speech defenses, we find, only prolongs the fight and emboldens would-be censors. What’s more, leaders at public colleges need to be careful: Investigating protected speech can result in legal liability. As the University of Alaska president Hamilton wrote, when it comes to speech protected by the First Amendment, “There is nothing to ‘check into,’ nothing ‘to investigate.’”</p><p>While rarer, we do see shades of Hamilton’s response from some of today’s more courageous college presidents.&nbsp;Last year, the president of University of the Arts in Philadelphia, David Yager, rejected calls to fire Professor Camille Paglia over her statements surrounding the #MeToo movement and transgender people: “Across our nation it is all too common that opinions expressed that differ from another’s—especially those that are controversial—can spark passion and even outrage, often resulting in calls to suppress that speech,” he wrote <a href="https://www.uarts.edu/node/43674">in a letter</a> to the university community. “That simply cannot be allowed to happen.”&nbsp;</p><p>The would-be censors called his letter “<a href="https://www.change.org/p/uarts-president-david-yager-uarts-support-transgender-students-and-survivors-of-sexual-assault">wildly ignorant</a>.” But the controversy soon fizzled and the demands stopped, much as they did at the University of Alaska. Yager’s letter, like Hamilton’s, left no room for compromise.</p><p>Most recently, the University of Chicago president, Robert Zimmer, wrote a community-wide email of his own, rejecting calls to punish a geophysical sciences professor, Dorian Abbot, for videos he had made critiquing diversity initiatives. A total of 129 students, alumni, and staff wrote <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fCOezNmxmaeVLSirrYp9y2nzy7m9Yr-rgPulwW-eNDw/edit">an open letter</a> to his faculty alleging that Abbot’s videos “threaten the safety and belonging of all underrepresented groups” and “represent an aggressive act towards the research and teaching communities of which Professor Abbot is a member.”&nbsp;</p><div><p>To this, Zimmer <a href="https://president.uchicago.edu/page/statement-faculty-free-expression-and-diversity">wrote</a> to the campus community: “The University does not limit the comments of faculty members, mandate apologies, or impose other disciplinary consequences for such comments, unless there has been a violation of University policy or the law.” (Under normal circumstances, that last clause about “University Policy” might worry us, but Chicago receives <a href="https://www.thefire.org/schools/university-of-chicago/">a “green-light” rating</a> from FIRE, which means it does not maintain any policies that threaten free expression.)</p><p>Sometimes, college leaders—or, more often, those at the center of the controversy—make matters worse by apologizing for hurt feelings. In a perfect world, a heartfelt, genuine apology would settle matters and placate the mob. But during a cancel campaign, apologies tend to be received as confessions that you <em>are</em> a witch deserving of further persecution.&nbsp;</p></div><p>Research backs this up. <a href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioural-public-policy/article/does-apologizing-work-an-empirical-test-of-the-conventional-wisdom/D34F1D89E6FF6A6E32C22C75F0C5FE24">A 2019 study</a> of whether apologizing works found that “when a prominent figure apologizes for a controversial statement, individuals are either unaffected or become more likely to desire that the individual be punished.” The scholar Cass Sunstein, of Harvard Law School, conducted a similar study and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/27/opinion/sunday/when-should-a-politician-apologize.html">found</a> that “an apology tended to decrease rather than to increase overall support for those who said or did things that many people consider offensive.”</p><p><strong>So what is the antidote to campus cancel campaigns? </strong>A strong, unequivocal defense of the right to free inquiry and expression <em>after</em> the campaign begins is important. But much of the groundwork for a successful defense begins <em>before</em> the campaign. Here are three vital practices.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Stop violating the law</strong>. Public colleges in the United States are bound by the First Amendment, yet <a href="https://www.thefire.org/resources/spotlight/reports/spotlight-on-speech-codes-2021/">85% of them maintain speech codes</a> that restrict speech protected by the Constitution. We have a group of lawyers whose full-time job it is to work collegially with campus administrators to help them fix restrictive speech codes. We are happy to help.</p></li><li><p><strong>Commit and recommit to free speech and inquiry</strong>. Faculty and administrators should seek out opportunities to enshrine protections for free speech and inquiry in campus policy. These policies should be adopted publicly and conspicuously. The <a href="https://www.thefire.org/get-involved/student-network/take-action/adopting-the-chicago-statement/">Chicago Statement</a>—a freedom-of-expression declaration from the University of Chicago in 2014—is one such policy that colleges can easily adopt and adapt, and <a href="https://www.thefire.org/chicago-statement-university-and-faculty-body-support/">78 have already done so</a>. Same goes for the aforementioned <a href="http://www-news.uchicago.edu/releases/07/pdf/kalverpt.pdf">Kalven Report</a>. (There’s a reason <a href="https://www.thefire.org/research/publications/student-surveys/2020-college-free-speech-rankings/2020-college-free-speech-rankings-view-rankings/">student survey data</a> finds the University of Chicago to be the number one school for free speech in the country.) </p></li><li><p><strong>Teach students about free speech from day one</strong>. Principles of free speech can run counter to our moral intuitions, and may be taken for granted. But the principles are essential if colleges are to fulfill their core missions. Sadly, few incoming students are aware of these principles and their role in the larger project of human knowledge. Only a handful of colleges teach them in their orientation programming. That is why we joined with New York University’s First Amendment Watch to create <a href="https://www.thefire.org/resources/free-speech-freshman-orientation/">a series of orientation modules and videos</a> that are ready for colleges to use right away.</p></li></ul><p>Fighting cancel culture isn’t easy for campus leaders. It’s a fight that seems to get more challenging every day. But, while the war might be neverending, individual battles can be won. Courageous leaders have shown us a way—it’s up to others to follow it.</p><p><strong>Greg Lukianoff is president and chief executive and Nico Perrino is vice president for the <a href="https://www.thefire.org/">Foundation for Individual Rights in Education</a> (FIRE). Both are producers of the recently released free-speech documentary, <a href="http://mightyira.com/">Mighty Ira: A Civil Liberties Story</a>.</strong></p></div></div>]]>

I have selected most of the text, and on the right side you can see two copy&amp;paste results. In the upper half is the result directly after scanning, right after the bundled ABBYY FineReader that comes with the iX500 did its magic. In the lower half is the result <strong>after</strong> modifying (removed a blank page) and saving that same PDF in <em>Preview</em>.</p><p>Hard to believe, but that’s <a href="https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/odd-pdf-behavior/21400">not</a> <a href="http://www.documentsnap.com/ocr-text-macos-sierra-preview/">the</a> <a href="https://discussions.apple.com/thread/8010687">first</a> time Apple <a href="https://mjtsai.com/blog/2016/12/21/more-macos-preview-pdf-trouble/">messed this up</a>. Sure, even Apple can’t account for all use cases when changing complex stuff like internal PDF handling. But:</p><ul><li>The iX500 is an insanely popular and common scanner</li><li>I don’t know any OCR software that is more popular than ABBYY FineReader</li><li>macOS used to be the absolute best in class OS for dealing with PDFs by a <strong>long</strong> shot</li><li>IT HAPPENED BEFORE</li></ul><p>I wish Apple was still charging for OS updates, so I could at least refund it.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> This is such a nasty bug – if you don’t already know to expect it, you will only find out months or possibly years later. I almost missed it this time, because even after modifying and saving the file it’s still not happening. You have to completely close the file and reopen it, only then will you realize that it has been destroyed.</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Yes, I blame only Apple for this. I’ll repeat what I told Philipp (noted Apple apologist!) when we argued about this last week after I discovered the problem: ABBYY says they don’t support Big Sur yet, that’s fine. But Apple didn’t tell me that I can’t upgrade to Big Sur when I use ABBYY. I’d be a lot less angry if there was a changelog or release notes <em>from Apple</em> where it says there is a known problem with OCR’ed PDFs in Preview. <em>Their</em> software is broken, <em>they</em> need to tell me. I don’t care if it only worked because they had workarounds for super shitty PDFs that ABBYY possibly produces, I just need my OS to keep working for me. This bug could hit me without even owning a scanner at all – someone sending me a PDF that I then unknowingly break before archiving it. That’s the part I’m mad about. <a href="#fnref:1" role="doc-backlink">↩︎</a></p></li></ol></section></div></div>]]>

<p>After nearly 20 years in this business, I've become convinced that everything you need to know about scheduling and project planning is contained in Scott Berkum's <a href="https://scottberkun.com/making-things-happen/">Making Things Happen</a> and this article.</p>
<p><a href="https://apenwarr.ca/log/20170810">The world in which IPv6 was a good design</a> by Apenwarr</p>
<p>Apenwarr is the only person who appears on this list twice. This is a deep historical and technical dive into IPv6, based on his long experience and technical know-how.</p>
<p><a href="http://winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html">The Lisp Curse</a> by Rudolf Winestock</p>
<p>This article joins Richard Gabriel's <a href="https://www.dreamsongs.com/WIB.html">Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big</a> as not just a great article on Lisp, but a model on how to think about the evolution and social stresses on programming languages.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/low-contrast/">Low-Contrast Text Is Not the Answer</a> by Katie Sherwin </p>
<p>Low-constrast text has been a pox on the internet since the Netscape defaulted to a gray background for all websites. I'm tired of it. I keep this article handy to help me argue my point for people who need something written and official instead of looking at the evidence in front of their eyes.</p>
<p><a href="http://rachelbythebay.com/w/2011/06/07/forked/">Don't Mix threads and forks</a> by Rachel</p>
<p>Rachel (whose last name I don't know) is a veteran of the silicon valley darlings, and groks systems more than anyone else I've ever read. Her blog posts are succinctly written deep dives into the obscure causes of common bugs. This post on threads and forks is one of the best.</p>

<p><a href="https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/06/12/a-weird-system-call-process-vm-readv/">How to spy on a Ruby program</a> by Julia Evans</p>
<p>Julia Evans' blog is one of the best programming blogs out there.</p>
<p>Most blogs make confident statements of absolute truth. Julia Evans is different, she shows the journey and the questions that guide her. The result is years of slowly watching a novice programmer become a master.</p>
<p>This post is one of her best, and resulted in a open source project of her own.</p>
<p><a href="https://twobithistory.org/2018/12/18/rss.html">The Rise and Demise of RSS</a> by Sinclair Target</p>
<p>Any of Two Bit history could have been chosen, but this one is a particular sore point. I miss RSS.</p>
<p><a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/284-jepsen-mongodb">Jepsen: MongoDB</a> by Kyle Kingsbury</p>
<p>Kyle Kingsbury went on a journey to test the limits and truth of all the various databases, and his result was a series of posts that combine wit, memes, and rock-solid tests. In each readable post he breaks a database over his leg like Bane. His teardown of Mongo is one of his best.</p>
<p>(I feel bad including this here. This article is out of date since the team at Mongo went on to work with Kyle to fix up their problems.)</p>            </article></div>]]>

<![CDATA[Setting up my blog – why I opted for static content over a CMS]]>

December 16, 2020 | https://blog.tietokone.io/setting-up-this-blog/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://blog.tietokone.io/setting-up-this-blog/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>When I decided to start this blog, one of the first decisions I had to make was, what stack should I use to build it? There are basically three different approaches:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Build the site from scratch</li>
  <li>Use a CMS (there are many solutions out there, including Drupal, Wix and WordPress)</li>
  <li>Use a static site generator such as Jekyll</li>
</ul>

<p>As a web developer, building the site from scratch would have been no problem, but was it really necessary for something as simple as a blog? Almost certainly not, and as I was keen to get going as quickly as possible, I discarded that solution.</p>

<p>This reduced the choice to one between a CMS and a static site generator.  To make my decision, I considered the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Functional support (does it do what I need?)</li>
  <li>Ease and cost of set-up and hosting (how quickly and cheaply can I get going?)</li>
  <li>Framework complexity (how much is going on behind the scenes when the site runs?)</li>
  <li>Performance (how quickly do the pages load?)</li>
</ul>

<p>When evaluating these criteria, it was important to consider my use-case - a simple, static blog that supports a moderated comments section, possibly Google analytics, and not much else. It’s always important to bear in mind what you’re actually trying to do - <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html">YAGNI</a> applies here. If I needed to build something more complex, with a shopping cart, badge system and authorisation, for instance, the results would have been different. However, the criteria and general evaluation approach would have remained the same.</p>

<h2 id="evaluation">Evaluation</h2>

<p>For the evaluation, I decided to compare two representative technologies: WordPress (CMS) and Jekyll (static site generator).</p>

<h3 id="functionality">Functionality</h3>

<p>Both approaches were more than adequate. WordPress was frankly overkill for my use-case, and Jekyll comfortably met my needs.</p>

<p><em>Verdict: draw</em></p>

<h3 id="setup-and-hosting">Setup and hosting</h3>

<p>There are free hosted solutions for both WordPress and Jekyll. A number of companies offer <a href="https://smartblogger.com/free-wordpress-hosting/">free WordPress hosting</a>. Most of them have bandwidth limits of 5-30GB, although WordPress.com offer unlimited bandwidth. The setups are of varying levels of complexity, with WordPress.com offering one of the simplest, albeit with a some bloat that needed to be removed.</p>

<p><a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is a popular solution for hosting Jekyll, offering 100GB bandwidth. It’s exceptionally easy to set up - I simply forked <a href="https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now">this example repo</a>, updated the markdown file for the first post, and was on my way, all on my phone. The downside for non-technical people is that you need to be familiar with markdown and GitHub, but for me this was a positive, rather than a negative.</p>

<p><em>Verdict: draw (depends on your preference for WYSIWYG vs. markdown)</em></p>

<h3 id="framework-complexity">Framework complexity</h3>

<p>This one was easy: WordPress is a full-blown CMS backed by a database and a framework to dynamically turn database content into html pages, whereas Jekyll compiles a set of static html and css files. For each request, a WordPress site is simply doing a lot more processing than an equivalent Jekyll-generated site.</p>

<p><em>Verdict: Jekyll</em></p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>Since WordPress does a lot more processing per request than a Jekyll-generated site, you’d expect it to be slower. However, in IT, you should never make assumptions without measurement - there could be all sorts of reasons why WordPress sites worked out quicker <em>in practice</em>, such as use of CDNs and caching, better hosting, etc.</p>

<p><em>WebNiyom</em> does an interesting <a href="https://webniyom.com/jekyll-wordpress-speed/">comparison</a> of two self-hosted sites, where Jekyll came out the clear winner (it was around 50% quicker). However, to do a fair comparison, I decided to use <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed insights</a> to compare sites hosted using two common simple solutions: WordPress.com and GitHub Pages.</p>

<p>I <a href="https://tietokonetest.wordpress.com/">recreated the blog</a> on <em>wordpress.com</em>. PageSpeed insights gave it a <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftietokonetest.wordpress.com%2F&amp;tab=mobile">score</a> of <strong>82</strong> for <em>mobile</em> and <strong>94</strong> for <em>desktop</em>. The Jekyll site had a <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.tietokone.io%2F&amp;tab=mobile">perfect score</a> of <strong>100</strong> for both. (Note that each run will give slightly different scores, and this blog will have changed considerably since I did the test.)</p>

<p><em>Verdict: Jekyll</em></p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>An objective evaluation of both approaches led me to the conclusion that Jekyll/GitHub Pages was the best solution <em>for my use-case</em>. For owners of simple, static blogs, I’d strongly recommend eschewing heavy CMS platforms in favour of much more lightweight static site generators. However, the most important thing for me is to evaluate technologies objectively based on my specific use-case, to measure what can be measured (e.g. performance), and to come to a conclusion based on the evidence, not on preconceptions.</p>

<p>In my next post, I’ll be talking about <a href="https://github.com/lukedawilson/tanagra">tanagra.js</a>, my open-source, lightweight Javascript serialiser.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><main id="main-content"><article><img src="https://i.ibb.co/KzGcFd9/yoonjae-baik-p7-Ms-AMLSbb-U-unsplash.jpg?w=1226&amp;h=400&amp;fit=crop&amp;crop=edges" alt=""><div><section><p>What is the state of your IoT (Internet of Things)-security in your home? Do you have any gadgets on your network that are vulnerable to exploitation? Maybe you have any devices you do not recognize? If you own an IoT-device then you should be curious about how it talks to the Internet and how security is taken care of.</p>
</section><article><section><p>We've all heard the horror stories. Whether it's <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/stranger-hacks-baby-monitor-tells-child-i-love-you-n1090046">hacked baby monitors</a> or <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/14/retailers-urged-to-withdraw-toys-that-allow-hackers-to-talk-to-children%20">talking toys</a>, <a href="https://auth0.com/blog/surprised-turns-out-consumers-dont-trust-iot-security/%20">consumers and developers seem to agree</a> on one thing; <em>don’t trust your IoT-devices</em>. This article tries to explain common security flaws with IoT-devices and includes a comprehensive "do-it-yourself" guide on how you can minimize the security threat.</p>
<p>Before we dive into the guide, what is an IoT-device and what security concerns should we be aware of?</p>
<h2>IoT-devices in your home</h2>
<p>The Internet of things promises us connected devices in your home talking to each other and the Internet. The connectivity enables your printer, fridge, vacuum cleaning robot or floor-heaters to be automated while you are on-the-go and not at home. Maybe even more efficient home-management. But should we put our trust into the vendor of our IoT coffe-machine that they won't leak our data, won't get hacked and has privacy and GDPR as their core focus? What priorities do these vendors have and how does that affect us?  </p>
<h2>Security concerns</h2>
<p><strong>Default / Weak passwords</strong></p>
<p>"Box fresh" devices often have a default password. If your device has a weak or easy to guess password then it will be susceptible to guessing attacks. Default passwords are <a href="https://www.routerpasswords.com/">easily obtained from the Internet</a></p>
<p><strong>Missing security updates</strong></p>
<p>IoT-devices are often built on pre-existing technologies such as the Linux operating system or using HTTP services such as Apache or NGINX. Over time, flaws are discovered in all software products which should be addressed. Failure to update against known vulnerabilities in supporting software will increase the chances of a remote attacker being able to compromise the device.</p>
<p><strong>Insecure web administration</strong></p>
<p>Some devices offer some form of web application to provision and administer the device. These interfaces are vulnerable to the same risks as enterprise applications or Internet sites. </p>
<p><strong>Use of insecure protocols</strong></p>
<p>An insecure protocol includes (but is not limited to): ftp, telnet, http or SNMP. The protocol is said to be insecure if it employs no transport layer encryption or has known security weaknesses. Those listed all fall into the first category. </p>
<p>It is common to offer administration functions over most of the listed protocols. The impact of using insecure protocols is that an attacker on the same network would be able to conduct a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) exploitation to compromise the device.</p>
<p><strong>Bad configuration</strong></p>
<p>All networked services are potential avenues for an attacker to target your device. A vulnerability assessment of these networked services would uncover known flaws. Most likely your device is powered by an embedded operating system. To gain defence in depth review the operating system for configuration weaknesses such as: processes with elevated privileges, file permissions etc. </p>
<p><strong>Insecure data storage</strong></p>
<p>If your device can store data locally then you need to be aware of the risks of doing so. Are your controls robust enough to prevent trivial retrieval of sensitive information? Do you use some form of encryption to protect data while the device is powered off?</p>
<h2>"Do-it-yourself" security checklist</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Change default passwords:</strong> </p>
<p>Refer to the manual, do an online search, or contact the manufacturer for advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check for firmware and system updates:</strong> </p>
<p>Even a brand new device could need a security update. Refer to the manual, do an online search, or contact the manufacturer for advice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Apply updates regularly:</strong></p>
<p>Manufacturers patch bugs and flaws on an ongoing basis – and so should you.Sign up for automatic updates or software update alerts when possible.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Set up a guest WiFi network for IoT-devices to connect to:</strong></p>
<p>Isolate your IoT-devices from your home computers to reduce risk to important data. If you need advice, start with an online search for your WiFi router model. Many devices make it easy to set up a guest network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disable Universal Plug-and-Play (UPnP) functionality:</strong></p>
<p>Some IoT-devices can leave your home firewall vulnerable to attack via UPnP. Unless you specifically need it for an IoT-device, turn off UPnP. An online search can help you find advice for your specific model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Google <em>{name of the device}</em> + CVE:</strong></p>
<p>You should see if there exists one or more <a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/">Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) </a> for your device. If there is, see if the manufacturer of your device has patched the CVE in one of the software updates, or consider sending them an email letting them know. If the CVE is serious, you should consider turning your IoT off until there is a fix available. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Check for open ports:</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://gist.github.com/rsperl/321aac3d529aa8f8c7924fd12d581b67">Nmap-cheatsheet</a></p>
<p>First obtain the IP-address of your device. This can be done by looking for "connected devices" on your router or do a network scan with <a href="https://nmap.org/">nmap</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Does your device expose any ports? </li>
<li>What does that port do? (google port + {port number})</li>
<li>Can you connect to your device through the port? For example through your web browser, ftp client, ssh?</li>
<li>Example of a generic scan for performing host discovery on your subnet:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>nmap -sP 192.168.1.0/24</code></p>
<p>Secondly do a full service scan on your device. Grab a cup of coffee, this usually takes some time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Example of a specific scan to find printer's open ports on your subnet:</li>
</ul>
<p><code>nmap -p 515,9100 192.168.1.0/24 -oG - | grep open</code></p>
</li>
</ul></section></article></div></article></main></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="8a920a5" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p><em>Major feature changes have successfully pushed Lambda workloads into the mainstream, even if FaaS purists feel betrayed</em></p><p>Is serverless winning?</p><p>If you ask AWS, they’ll say <em>definitely</em>. Nearly half of all new applications built inside Amazon this year are <a href="https://siliconangle.com/2020/11/30/exclusive-aws-chief-andy-jassy-wakeup-call-cloud-adoption/">running on Lambda</a>. Andy Jassy took time in his re:Invent keynote to call out the thousands of enterprises who now run Lambda workloads in production, but perhaps most interesting was that this year the new serverless feature announcements graduated to Jassy’s keynote — a spot usually reserved for the flashiest, most strategic reveals of the year. AWS, at least, clearly believes that serverless is now one of the primary selling points for its cloud.</p><p>(On the other hand, there’s <a href="https://thenewstack.io/adoption-of-aws-lambda-serverless-stalls/">this odd article</a>, which spends most of its length demonstrating FaaS growth, but ran under the headline “Serverless Adoption Stalls” because … Kubernetes teams say they aren’t using as much Lambda? In other news, cats report eating fewer vegetables.)</p><p>What’s not in debate is that Lambda, still the 900-pound gorilla of FaaS, looks a lot different today than when it went GA in 2015. The <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/forrestbrazeal/">loud, weird niche of engineers</a> who bought into serverless early have always had <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulDJohnston/status/1336765475615879181">very specific ideas</a> about what good serverless systems look like … and lately, Lambda’s been rattling their assumptions.</p><h2 id="h-the-decline-and-fall-of-the-serverless-manifesto">The Decline and Fall of The Serverless Manifesto</h2><p>Those original ideals of FaaS purity didn’t just materialize out of thin air. As recently as 2016, AWS serverless leadership was talking up something they called the Serverless Compute Manifesto. This was a radical vision for how Functions-as-a-Service should, uh, function. The manifesto showed up at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCOgc3MRUrs">all sorts of talks</a>, including <a href="https://twitter.com/Serverlessconf/status/735839492431548418">at ACG’s ServerlessConf</a>. Here are its key tenets:</p><p><em><strong>The Serverless Compute Manifesto (circa 2016)</strong></em></p><ul><li><em>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling</em></li><li><em>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model</em></li><li><em>Permanent storage lives elsewhere</em></li><li><em>Scales per request; Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity</em></li><li><em>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)</em></li><li><em>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere</em></li></ul><p>This manifesto formed a shocking and highly countercultural blueprint for how to build and deploy software. It attracted a small but vibrant community of true believers and a somewhat larger and much louder set of skeptics.&nbsp;</p><p>But in retrospect, the serverless compute manifesto had trouble penetrating beyond that small, engaged nucleus. The bold vision just left out too many existing, legacy workloads and teams.</p><p>So, gradually, like the commandments in Orwell’s <em>Animal Farm, </em>AWS’s non-negotiables of serverless compute began to change. Let’s run through each point of the manifesto and see if Lambda still adheres to it.</p><p><strong>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling?</strong></p><p><em>Sorta, but not strictly. </em>You can deploy multi-function Lambda Layers to manage large binaries, or (now in preview) Lambda Extensions to plug in third-party agents that I’ve been told should definitely not be thought of as “sidecars for Lambda”.</p><p><strong>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true. </em>As of re:Invent 2020, Lambda <a href="https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/packaging-aws-lambda-functions-as-container-images">now allows you to bring your own containers</a> instead of just shipping a ZIP file of code.</p><p><strong>Permanent storage lives elsewhere?</strong></p><p><em>Not necessarily. </em>Lambda now integrates with EFS, which I guess is technically “elsewhere”, but no more so than any other NFS share attached to a server is “elsewhere”. It’s a persistent filesystem mounted to your compute.</p><p><strong>Scales per request?</strong></p><p><em>Yes!</em> Now that Lambda can run containers, I believe the request model is now the biggest remaining conceptual difference between Lambda and a managed container service like AWS Fargate. Lambda gives you a new execution environment per concurrent request, whereas a Fargate-like service will still process multiple concurrent requests on the same (long-lived) container.</p><p><strong>Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true. </em>Meet Provisioned Capacity, which trades your cold start problem for a hot cost problem. (I snark, but Provisioned Capacity is way better than running your own Lambda pre-warming job, which a LOT of people used to do.)</p><p><strong>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)?</strong></p><p><em>No longer true – </em>not if you use Provisioned Capacity or EFS, anyway.</p><p><strong>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere?</strong></p><p><em>Ehhhh. </em>This one is about abstracting away availability zones, which a lot of higher-level AWS services besides Lambda (including Fargate!) now do. That said, we’re starting to hear more guidance from AWS that really, the fault domain you need to be thinking about is regions. That’s right: regions are the new availability zones, and savvy Lambda developers are rolling their own (very un-managed) multi-region architectures as we speak.&nbsp;</p><p>To reinforce the trend, let’s check in with two other defining early features of Lambda:</p><p><strong>Intentional time and space constraints?</strong></p><p><em>Less and less true</em>. Function disk sizes, runtime limits, and CPU and memory sizes have steadily increased over the last 5 years. Today you can run a Lambda function for 15 minutes with 10 GB of memory and 6 vCPUs – a hefty enough blob of compute to make you think seriously about multi-threading, multi-purpose functions, and other things that are against the old ideals of FaaS.</p><p><strong>Zero-trust networking?</strong></p><p><em>Only if you want it. </em>In the old days, Lambda architectures biased heavily toward IAM security rather than using VPCs, partly for ideological reasons but also because attaching functions to custom ENIs added tremendous cold start overhead. Today, innovation from AWS has made customer-managed VPCs much more compatible with Lambda.</p><p>So what we have now is an updated manifesto that looks like this:</p><p><em><strong>The Serverless Compute Manifesto (circa 2020)</strong></em></p><ul><li><em><s>Functions are the unit of deployment and scaling</s></em></li><li><em><s>No machines, VMs, or containers visible in the programming model</s></em></li><li><em><s>Permanent storage lives elsewhere</s></em></li><li><em>Scales per request; </em><em><s>Users cannot over- or under-provision capacity</s></em></li><li><em><s>Never pay for idle (no cold servers/containers or their costs)</s></em></li><li><em><s>Implicitly fault-tolerant because functions can run anywhere</s></em></li><li><em><s>Intentional time and space constraints</s></em></li><li><em><s>Zero-trust networking</s></em></li></ul><p>I feel like Willy Wonka at the end of the chocolate factory tour, looking around to see where all the children went. Of all those ideological principles, those lines in the sand, <em>per-request scaling is the only thing left.&nbsp;</em></p><p>You can still build according to the original serverless manifesto, of course. But the service doesn’t <em>require </em>you to.</p><p>If you had to distill the revised value prop of Lambda down into a single maxim, <em>Animal Farm-</em>style, what would you even say at this point? “<em>All workloads are managed, but some are more managed than others?</em>“</p><h2 id="h-the-rise-of-serverless-for-everyone">The rise of serverless for everyone</h2><p>This seems like the right time to clarify that I mostly like the additions to Lambda. I think they are necessary and in many cases, an unmixed good.</p><p>I wouldn’t have said that four years ago. I was much more of a FaaS purist at that time. What changed my mind was years of hearing a very particular type of statement from engineering teams, repeated over and over in different variations:</p><p><strong><em>I would love to use Lambda, if only it …</em></strong><em> </em>[connected back to my on-prem VPC, was big enough to run my workload, let me use the same language or developer tooling as my other systems, was always warm, supported some form of shared storage, etc, etc]</p><p>My first reaction to these statements was: Why would you want to use Lambda if you can’t or won’t embrace stateless, containerless, scale-to-zero functions? That’s the whole <em>point </em>of Lambda. It sounded to me like those Kubernetes cats from the New Stack survey, saying they’d really like to eat vegetables if they only contained more meat.</p><p>But I’ve since come to understand that the really powerful part of that statement is the beginning part. It’s a statement of longing.</p><p><em>I’d love to use Lambda, if only …</em></p><p>What is it about Lambda, and serverless compute in general, that inspires this reaction in so many people? Why does a brand-new baby computing paradigm spark such compulsive interest everywhere from tiny startups to big ol’ legacy enterprises?</p><p>Because more than any specific technical detail, serverless computing is an idea. An idea expressed in a simple phrase: <em>Own less, build more. </em>All the serverless doctrine, all the technical guidance boils down to this goal. Lambda is an aspirational lifestyle.</p><p>Lambda, circa 2016, was massively ahead of its time, and to some extent still is. But because of the new feature additions, up to and including container support, it’s making the <em>own less, build more </em>identity more accessible to more builders than ever before.&nbsp;</p><p>What AWS is doing is, one by one, taking away the <em>if only</em>s<em>. </em>They’re removing reflexive objections to serverless by providing reassuring options — shared storage, provisioned capacity — for teams that need them. <em>I’d love to use Lambda!</em></p><h2 id="h-guiding-the-future">Guiding the future</h2><p>Will some teams use these features out of confusion or inertia, not realizing that they could build something more radical, more manifesto-like? Yes, and I think this is an area where AWS can do a lot more to help.</p><p>Look, the Lambda console is a mess – you know it, I know it, AWS knows it. It’s got more tacked-on feature creep and incoherent UX paths than a 2001 VCR. And say what you will about infrastructure-as-code, the console is still how people explore new services. It’s how they form feelings about what kind of builders they want to be.</p><p>A console redesign is needed for sure, but not just an arbitrary facelift. We need one that foregrounds the Lambda features that support the original manifesto: code-level programming abstractions, function-level deployments. And then a careful reveal of progressive complexity as you push up against the limits of the manifesto or your own organizational constraints. (Is there such a thing as “regressive complexity”? Because that’s the current console.)</p><p>What you want is for builders to be confronted with the simpler, more managed options every time they start a new …</p></div></div></div>

<p>The strain of the COVID-19 pandemic on society and healthcare systems turned fine fault lines into gaping canyons. Reflecting on <a href="https://omarmetwally.blog/2015/07/03/if-hospitals-were-run-like-startups/">my writings about U.S. hospitals 5 years ago</a>, I asked myself what had changed and what still must change to rebuild a healthcare system that can deliver medical care wherever and whenever it’s needed. What problems were prevalent in the healthcare system before the pandemic, and how did the pandemic highlight these deficiencies? In my day-to-day work as a doctor, what diverts my time and energy away from the most important and fulfilling aspect of doctoring – patient care?</p>



<p>Direct and effective communication with patients is the most important aspect of healthcare, in my view. A doctor working in the community who is licensed and certified has demonstrated a body of knowledge and skills to provide medical care within a certain scope of practice. Someone with a health concern is arguably not seeking the smartest doctor they can find; they want a doctor with whom they can communicate their concerns, understand their health issue, and make a mutually acceptable treatment plan. In daily practice, I feel that 95% of my time and energy are consumed by tasks that do not relate directly to patient care. Even more unfortunate is the fact that these 95% of tasks are the ones by which doctors are evaluated and compensated: clicking through electronic health records (EHR), wrestling with flawed communication systems (such as hospital phones, pagers, texting, and email) to receive and share information with other members of the healthcare team, answering “queries” from hospital administration for the purpose of billing patients and insurance companies, and wasting life-years trying to wrangle health information systems as mandated by hospital administrators and insurance companies.</p>







<p>1. The world wide web</p>



<p>The pandemic pushed the role of “telemedicine” (healthcare rendered by phone or digitally) into the foreground as a way to deliver healthcare efficiently while reducing the spread of the coronavirus. Regrettably the first and biggest problem with healthcare is internet connectivity and how EHR software sends and receives information between a doctor’s phone/computer and the hospital server. Even in the year 2020, reliable, high-speed internet is a scarce resource in the United States. Most Americans have no choice of internet service provider, if they are lucky to even have access to one.  In a time where human resources are stretched thin and inefficiently used, trying to reach a human in the event of a service interruption can easily waste hours if not days waiting on hold or confined to chatbot purgatory. Many doctors now work remotely to a large extent, if not entirely. Reliable, fast internet is prerequisite to being able to deliver good healthcare. This is especially true because of the nature of EHRs, which use “Virtual Machines” and “Remote Desktops” that require a reliable, low-latency, high-speed internet connection. A client that runs at a snail’s speed and frequently disconnects, requiring 10 minutes to repeat the authentication process before dropping the connection again, is severely detrimental to patient care.</p>



<p>2. Electronic Health Records</p>



<p>EHRs are essentially spreadsheets in fancy packaging. They’re not smart in the sense that a phone is smart; they don’t learn, predict, or automate tasks. In fact software that is slow, requires a lot of clicking and non-intuitive behavior, and which wastes a lot of time with authentication and logging in, is not much better than typing text into the simplest text editor and saving it in a rudimentary database. That is the core of a hospital or clinic’s information system: text and media files saved chronologically and accessible to the right people at the right time. I prefer to type or dictate notes freestyle rather than use templates because it’s faster for me, gives me more control over the document, and helps me communicate my assessment and treatment plan more effectively than relying on a template created by someonen else who may conceptualize a diagnostic process and treatment plan much differently than their peers. An ideal EHR to me would simply be typed into a Unix terminal (for a reader unfamiliar with Unix, imagine a black screen with a flashing white cursor) and piped into a hospital server, which would then use the text to help doctors appreciate the clinical Gestalt or “big picture”: what could harm or kill the patient in the next few hours? And beyond the first 12-24 hours, how to safely discharge the patient? As an EHR user, I don’t want a fancy front-end trickling through a lagging virtual machine; I want a simple, low-latency, text-focused interface and a smart backend, in other words, very simple software that looks dumb but is actually smart. </p>



<p>3. Communication</p>



<p>On top of the pressure of having to synthesize a huge amount of dynamic information to make fast and sound decisions about patient care, doctors are inundated and constantly interrupted by communications from other members of the care team. Doctors work closely with nurses, aids, phlebotomists, lab and radiology technicians, doctors from different specialties, clerks, social workers, insurance companies, and hospital administrators. There is a lot of information constantly moving back and forth in real-time between all parties. This flow of information is often like a waterfall rather than a water faucet – the communications are not prioritized and frequently fail to reach the right person at the right time. There are times when a doctor’s attention should be focused entirely on the task at hand, for example when assessing or speaking with a patient at bedside. This is no time to be interrupted with billing queries or non-urgent questions about other patients’ care. A constant stream of unprioritized and unfocused information can make it extremely difficult to focus on the critical 1% of information which can hurt patients if this information is not processed correctly at the right time. In order to hold people accountable for their decisions, they need to be given a fair chance, with tools that work without draining life out of the users. A page or phone call that may or may not find the intended recipient, and a note left in the EHR saying, “tried to call you but you didn’t answer your phone,” is subjective and not constructive without a way for all parties to track communications from their origin to their destination.</p>

<p>In addition to the right tools, there is a need for sound systems. A doctor’s extensive education and training culminates in a highly specialized set of skills and knowledge. Doctors should take pride and joy in their work; they endured long, grueling training out of a desire to help humanity. Out of training, doctors traditionally became their own bosses, working in community hospitals or private clinics, practicing medicine the way they were taught in a style that becomes their own. Nowadays doctors are managed by administrators who are not doctors. There is a reason why healthcare systems look and function the way they do, an evolutionary end-product of decades of legislative, financial, operational, and societal forces exerting themselves on doctors and hospitals. Back in the day, doctors saw their own patients in their own clinic and treated their patients when they were hospitalized too. This is exceptional nowadays. There was no, “I’m your doctor for today,” or “I’m your doctor this shift, until 8pm.” The reality is that this mode of doctoring has become rare. Having experienced the modern-day flavor of corporate medicine in urban areas and the more traditional model in rural areas, I appreciate the pros and cons of both models. “I’m your doctor, period” can be spoken by a doctor lucky enough to escape corporate medicine, but also a doctor prepared to withstand the stress of not having any personal or protected time away from work. Too many talented doctors nowadays burn out after short-lived clinical careers, depriving patients of the care of great doctors who fell victim to the 95% non-clinical burden on top of the already stressful 5% clinical work.</p>



<p>4. More communication</p>



<p>There is a clear line between “outpatient” and “inpatient” medicine in most doctors’ minds, that is, healthcare delivered in a clinic, where a patient goes to an appointment and returns home, compared to a hospital, where a patient stays overnight. Patients don’t think in terms of “inpatient” and “outpatient.” A patient who wakes in the middle of the night with a fever and shortness of breath, or a patient with a growing breast lump, have concerns that needs to be addressed immediately by someone who actually cares. It sounds obvious, but I could not copy and paste this phrase too many times: by someone who actually cares. Not a voice menu, not a chatbot, not “Due to unusually high call volumes…,” and not a tired, under-paid clerk who is poorly equipped to do their job. A doctor has the knowledge to assess whether a problem is urgent or not urgent, concerning or likely harmless. It’s not fair or realistic to expect patients, lacking specialized knowledge, exposed to the vast informational waste littering cyberspace, biased by personal experience and anxiety about a health condition, to make those calls.</p>



<p>“Due to unusually high call volumes…” has become this year’s mantra. Nearly every call I attempt to place to an insurance company, hospital, or clinic is met with this phrase and indefinite wait times, now nine months since the start of the pandemic.  Most negative feedback about doctors and hospitals relates to what goes on beyond the few minutes a doctor spends interacting directly with the patient: a medical assistant having a bad day, a disorganized clinic, the insurance labyrinth, bills…human …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="divbodyholder">  <div id="divbody"> <div> <h3> Entropy loss for reinforcement learning </h3> <p> September 20, 2018 — Chris Foster </p> <p>Reinforcement learning agents are notoriously unstable to train compared to other types of machine learning algorithms. One of the ways that a reinforcement learning algorithm can underperform is by becoming stuck during training on a strategy that is neither a good solution nor the absolute worst solution. We generally refer to this phenomenon as reaching a “local minimum” in the space of game strategies.</p> <!-- Content Breaker --> <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxima_and_minima">Local minima</a> under traditional supervised learning occurs when gradient descent finds a parameter set that results in lower error than expected, and the near parameters all result in an increase of error. Although there is a better set of parameters in a different location of the parameter space, gradient descent isn’t able to find it and becomes stuck in the local minimum. Some methods, such as training with momentum, help with this.</p> <p>In reinforcement learning, a similar situation can occur if the agent discovers a strategy that results in a reward that is better than it was receiving when it first started, but very far from a strategy that would result in optimal reward. This might often manifest as the agent deciding to take a single move, over and over. Entropy loss, I believe first discussed in a <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.54.3433&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">1991 paper</a>, is an additional loss parameter that can be added to a model to help with local minima in the same way that momentum might and to provide encouragement for the agent to take a variety of moves and explore the set of strategies more.</p> <p>For example, take a game like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)">snake</a>. In this environment, the snake must learn to navigate the environment it exists in without crashing into itself or a wall. The agent will have four moves available to it: up, right, down, and left. The agent receives +1 reward for every step it takes successfully and -1 reward for each time it crashes into either a wall or a snake’s tail. We ignore food in this simple example.</p> <p>In this environment, the randomly initialized weights will yield immediate death 1/4 of the time when the snake “moves back” onto its own tail. One of the first things the agent should learn is to avoid doing this. So lets train it and see a few example runs!</p> <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" width="300"> <source src="https://fosterelli.co/file/entropy-loss-for-reinforcement-learning/before.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support this video. </video> <p>It learns this very well! Unfortunately, it learns to avoid its tail by restricting its movement in only one or two directions. By moving in that fashion it does ensure the snake will never go back on its tail, but this strategy is clearly suboptimal as the agent only lasts a short period before crashing into the wall.</p> <p>As the agent progresses learning, its average move distribution will grow closer and closer to predictions where either a single move is guarenteed (<code>[ 1 0 0 0 ]</code>) or two moves are split equally (<code>[ 0.5 0.5 0 0 ]</code>). With a very low or zero probability, it’s unlikely to ever explore moving a different direction when faced with a wall. Because it reaches this local minima state, the agent never learns to understand how to avoid itself or that it must avoid walls.</p> <p>To solve this, we will encourage the agent to vary its moves by adding a new loss parameter based on the entropy of its predicted moves. The equation for entropy here is:</p><p> \[H(x) = -\sum_{i=1}^n {\mathrm{P}(x_i) \log_e \mathrm{P}(x_i)}\] </p><p>At each timestep, we will calculate the entropy of the softmax prediction output from the policy network. When we calculate the training loss at the end of the epoch, we’ll subtract the entropy loss over all of the timesteps from the reward-based policy and value losses.</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>beta</span> <span>=</span> <span>0.05</span> <span># Hyperparameter that controls the influence of entropy loss
</span><span>entropy_loss</span> <span>=</span> <span>torch</span><span>.</span><span>stack</span><span>(</span><span>entropy_losses</span><span>).</span><span>sum</span><span>()</span> <span># Sum of H(X) from all steps

</span><span>loss</span><span>.</span><span>backward</span><span>()</span> <span># Standard gradient update
</span></code></pre></div></div> <p>Intuitively, a lot of predictions such as <code>[ 1 0 0 0 ]</code> are going to have very low entropy, and our entropy loss component will be more positive. This encourages the network to only make strong predictions if it is <em>highly</em> confident in them, that means that the actor critic network will have to have a low enough loss from the policy and value loss parameters to offset the more positive entropy loss sufficiently so that the global loss remains low.</p> <video autoplay="" loop="" muted="" width="300"> <source src="https://fosterelli.co/file/entropy-loss-for-reinforcement-learning/after.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support this video. </video> <p>When we train the same network with this new entropy loss component, we get an agent that learns a significantly more diverse strategy and can survive without hitting walls!</p> <p>Entropy loss is a clever and simple mechanism to encourage the agent to explore by providing a loss parameter that teaches the network to avoid very confident predictions. As the distribution of the predictions becomes more spread out, the network will sample those moves more often and learn that they can lead to greater reward.</p> <p>While this is discussed briefly by the <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf">Atari deep RL paper</a>, I found that entropy loss can be critical to having effective agents in some circumstances and applies to more than just the network design mentioned in the paper. I couldn’t find much explanaining the intution behind entropy loss, though it pops up in lots of places, so hopefully helps elaborate on a real example of how it can take an agent from “not learning anything” to “solved the game” in some environments.</p>  </div>  </div> </div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/Helpcenter.png"></center>
<p>Being card game geeks, we run <a href="https://solitaired.com/">our solitaire site</a> as a fun hobby. As we gained some users though over the last year and launched a subscription service to generate some side income, we had to make sure we had reasonable customer support. </p>
<p>It was a no brainer to create a help center because we didnâ€™t want to spend time managing customer support tickets, and having a workflow where users could be self-directed and answer questions on their own was ideal. </p>
<h2 id="whenirealizedihatedhelpcenters">When I realized I hated help centers</h2>
<p>I had an issue with one of our service providers, and went to their site to figure out how to solve the problem. For 30 minutes, I hopped around their own help center with no luck finding the answer to my question. </p>
<p>I then started looking for a support line. After digging through various questions and hitting â€œNo, this did not answer my question,â€� I  found  that it was discontinued and the page redirected me back. </p>
<p>Needless to say, I wasnâ€™t happy. </p>
<p>It made me realize that instinctually, I always want to talk to someone. Whether it be over email, the phone, or chat, knowing that I was getting personalized attention would give me comfort and confidence that my issues will be resolved. </p>
<p>I decided then and there: We will get rid of our help center!</p>
<h2 id="removingourhelpcenterandimprovingourcustomersatisfactionscoreby12">Removing our help center and improving our customer satisfaction score by 12%</h2>
<p>We analyzed where users visited most in our help center. We found that three issues dominated 95% of requests:</p>
<ol>
<li>We had launched a subscription service and users wanted to understand how to cancel. Having run subscription businesses in the past, this wasnâ€™t too surprising. </li>
<li>How to report bugs in the game. Invariably, users came across some fringe bugs, especially for our <a href="https://solitaired.com/freecell">Freecell</a>, <a href="https://solitaired.com/klondike-solitaire">Klondike</a>, and <a href="https://solitaired.com/spider">Spider Solitaire</a> games, and wanted to report it. </li>
<li>Requests for more games. </li>
</ol>
<p>Addressing these questions were relatively simple, and we figured we can spend a few minutes a day responding to anything that came in. </p>
<p>We responded on average within two days and found that our customer satisfaction score (CSAT) improved from 65% to 73%. </p>
<h2 id="improvingcustomersatisfactionanother22">Improving customer satisfaction another 22%.</h2>
<p>We hypothesized that response time played a major role in improving customer satisfaction. </p>
<p>For the next week we decided to respond within 24 hours and we found that CSAT improved from 73% to 78%.</p>
<center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/24hours.png"></center>
<p>Realizing that response time makes a difference, we promised and communicated on our site that weâ€™d respond within 2 hours during business hours. CAST went up 82%. </p>
<p>We didnâ€™t want to stop, and we decided to add live chat and respond immediately during business hours. CSAT shot up to 89%!</p>
<h2 id="improvingrevenueby11">Improving revenue by 11%</h2>
<p>As we started responding and talking to our customers, we learned that many users would cancel their subscription because they didnâ€™t know how to access certain games, customization features, and due to some unknown bugs. </p>
<p>Operating a help center only gave users instructions on how to cancel, and did not give us an opportunity to understand why and course correct.</p>
<p>When we started understanding all the reasons our users were canceling, we were able to address this, improving our retention. In the first month, this improved our very modest subscription revenue by 11%. If you compound the impact of retention, it will likely be more over time. </p>
<center><img width="900" src="https://defbnszqe1hwm.cloudfront.net/images/Retention.png"></center>
<h2 id="ourcustomersupportsetuptodayandidealsolutions">Our customer support set up today, and ideal solutions</h2>
<p>Because we run the site for fun, itâ€™s difficult for us to commit to a SLA when someone responds. Today, we just have a simple contact us page. We try to get back within a day generally, but sometimes we miss that and sometimes weâ€™re able to respond earlier depending on competing priorities. </p>
<p>This has taught us though that many consumers want to talk to someone and want a response right away. With that said, some people are totally fine skipping the human interaction. We think an ideal set up is to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Have a help center that covers very simple questions, like how to use certain features. On those pages, there should be an option to quickly talk to a customer service agent. </li>
<li>Have a page on cancellation, but have a CTA talk to someone with a quick response. This will help you understand issues for paying customers and address it</li>
<li>Have a chatbot in lieu of a help center with similar works flow described above. However, set it up in a way where users understand they are talking to a bot, and at any point they can talk to someone</li>
</ol>
<p>Naturally, everyone has resource limitations. If you were to protoize KPIs like revenue, as I imagine you would, find a way to quickly talk to your paying customers or those most likely to pay to support your business goals.</p></div></div></div></div>]]>

            <!-- content --><p>At the Intel Memory and Storage Moment 2020, the company is finally unveiling its newest Optane SSD. Dubbed the Intel Optane P5800X, the new PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD utilizes Intel’s next-gen technology to put up impressive if not downright game-changing performance figures.<span id="more-49341"></span></p>
<h2>New Intel Optane P5800X 100 DWPD SSD</h2>
<p>The new Intel Optane P5800X SSD, as we already noted pushes the 100 DWPD barrier. Effectively, it is designed not just as a high-endurance SSD, but it is designed to be an easy-to-integrate write buffer for almost any high-speed write application. Let us get right to the specs of this new PCIe Gen4 NVMe SSD.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49345" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49345"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/?attachment_id=49345" rel="attachment wp-att-49345"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-Key-Specs.jpg" alt="Intel Optane SSD P5800X Key Specs" width="955" height="510" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-Key-Specs.jpg 955w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-Key-Specs-400x214.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-Key-Specs-800x427.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-Key-Specs-696x372.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-Key-Specs-786x420.jpg 786w" sizes="(max-width: 955px) 100vw, 955px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49345">Intel Optane SSD P5800X Key Specs</figcaption></figure>
<p>Intel is putting up some absolutely awesome write performance figures here in the 6.2GB/s range while maintaining 7.2GB/s read speeds. With its next-gen Optane media, it is able to hit 1.5M read or write random 4K IOPS. It can do even better in mixed workloads due to PCIe Gen4 being bi-directional so it can go faster than the speed limits of PCIe Gen4 in all read or all write directions when running in the 70/30 usage patterns. These drives are designed for 400GB, 800GB, 1.6TB, and 3.2TB capacities. When One has 3.2TB and a 100 DWPD rating, that means that these drives can be rated at over 2PB/ week of write endurance.</p>

<p>One of the big drivers here is that Intel’s cloud customers are looking at how they can have local caches for block storage and provide excellent QoS. The company’s direction is that one can use these high-endurance 400GB drives in smaller quantities to get the level of performance required for 100Gbps networks. As such, although one spends more per GB, using fewer drives and at lower capacities means one can more efficiently deploy resources. That is one of the more interesting marketing pitches for what is likely significantly pricier storage than the company’s TLC NAND offerings.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49344" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49344"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/?attachment_id=49344" rel="attachment wp-att-49344"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-High-IOPS-and-Bandwidth.jpg" alt="Intel Optane SSD P5800X High IOPS And Bandwidth" width="942" height="499" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-High-IOPS-and-Bandwidth.jpg 942w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-High-IOPS-and-Bandwidth-400x212.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-High-IOPS-and-Bandwidth-800x424.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-High-IOPS-and-Bandwidth-696x369.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Intel-Optane-SSD-P5800X-High-IOPS-and-Bandwidth-793x420.jpg 793w" sizes="(max-width: 942px) 100vw, 942px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49344">Intel Optane SSD P5800X High IOPS And Bandwidth</figcaption></figure>
<p>Just to highlight the latency versus load performance, one can see that the new Optane SSD goes well beyond the older Optane P4800X limited by first-gen technology, PCIe Gen3, and a relatively paltry 60 DWPD rating.</p>
<figure id="attachment_49349" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-49349"><a href="https://www.servethehome.com/?attachment_id=49349" rel="attachment wp-att-49349"><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Inte-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-Latency-v-Load.jpg" alt="Inte Memory And Storage Moment 2020 Optane P5800X Performance Latency V Load" width="1057" height="612" srcset="https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Inte-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-Latency-v-Load.jpg 1057w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Inte-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-Latency-v-Load-400x232.jpg 400w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Inte-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-Latency-v-Load-800x463.jpg 800w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Inte-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-Latency-v-Load-696x403.jpg 696w, https://www.servethehome.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Inte-Memory-and-Storage-Moment-2020-Optane-P5800X-Performance-Latency-v-Load-725x420.jpg 725w" sizes="(max-width: 1057px) 100vw, 1057px"></a><figcaption id="caption-attachment-49349">Intel Memory And Storage Moment 2020 Optane P5800X Performance Latency V Load</figcaption></figure>
<p>Aside from the consistent performance, we would expect, Intel is also showing off the performance per GB. Using the smaller SSD sizes, Intel is able to push the IOPS per GB of storage while maintaining low latency and excellent tail latencies.</p>

<p>Technology is moving forward in a big way as Intel as a company gets behind PCIe Gen4 with Ice Lake Xeons later in 2021.</p>
<h2>Final Words</h2>
<p>Yes, these are fast SSDs, and probably will be the fastest storage with decent capacity on the market for some time. Something interesting that we noticed is that Intel is only announcing the U.2 drives on the spec page. Not only is it interesting that the company is using U.2 NVMe here, but it is showing something else not mentioned explicitly. In the last image above, shown as part of the keynote, Intel has what appears to be an E1.S Optane P5800X drive. Since many hyper-scalers have migrated to the newer form factor that we highlighted in pieces such as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/facebook-introduces-next-gen-cooper-lake-intel-xeon-platforms/">Facebook Introduces Next-Gen Cooper Lake Intel Xeon Platforms</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.servethehome.com/hands-on-with-the-1u-half-petabyte-supermicro-edsff-server/">Hands-on with the 1U Half-Petabyte Supermicro EDSFF Server</a>, it makes sense that we are seeing Intel with next-gen form factor options.</p>
<p>For the foreseeable future, the P5800X is going to be the SSD to beat for raw performance.</p>

        <blockquote>
            "I’ve been fortunate enough to be a part of the Google team that helped create Knative and bring Cloud Run
            to market. I’ve watched Cloud Run mature as a product over the years. I’ve onboarded thousands of customers
            and I wrote a framework to help Go developers build Cloud Run applications faster--and even I learned a
            thing or two from this book. What took me three years to learn, Wietse delivers in less than a dozen
            chapters."

        <h2>About the Book</h2>
        <p>If you have experience building web applications on traditional infrastructure, this hands-on guide shows you
            how to get started with Cloud Run, a container-based serverless product on Google Cloud.

            Through the course of this book, you'll learn how to deploy several example applications that highlight
            different parts of the serverless stack on Google Cloud. Combining practical examples with fundamentals,
            this book will appeal to developers who are early in their learning journey as well as experienced
            practitioners (<a href="#review">learn what others say about the book</a>).</p>
        
        <h2>Who this Book is For</h2>
        <p>If you build, maintain or deploy web applications, this book is for you. You might go by the title of a
            software engineer, a developer, system administrator, solution architect, or a cloud engineer. I carefully
            balance hands-on demonstrations with deep dives into the fundamentals so that you’ll get value out of it
            whether you’re an aspiring, junior, or experienced developer. </p>

        <p>I tried to stay as programming language agnostic as possible and I use Go for the code listings, because it is easy to read if 
            you haven't worked with it before.</p>

        <h2>Full Chapter Outline</h2>
        <p>Chapter 1 gives a general overview of what a serverless application is, introduces you to Google Cloud and
            their serverless products without going too much in depth. If you are new to Google Cloud, this will be a
            great introduction.</p>
        <p><img src="https://wietsevenema.eu/cloud-run-book/pp1.png">
        </p>
        <p>Chapter 2 is a hands-on introduction to Cloud Run. I’ll show you how to get started with Google Cloud and
            deploy your first Cloud Run service. While the first part of the chapter focuses on using Cloud Run, in the
            second part I explain the runtime characteristics of Cloud Run and how they influence the way you build your
            application. I’ll also compare Cloud Run with the other serverless runtimes on Google Cloud: App Engine and
            Cloud Functions.</p>

        <p><img src="https://wietsevenema.eu/cloud-run-book/pp2.png">
        </p>

        <p>In Chapter 3 you’ll find a thorough introduction to application development with containers. In this chapter
            I show you how to run containers on your local machine with Docker, create your own container images (with
            and without Docker), and dive into the fundamentals of containers. </p>

        <p><img src="https://wietsevenema.eu/cloud-run-book/pp3.png">
        </p>
        <p>The containers on Cloud Run are disposable. This requires you to store data you need to persist beyond the
            lifetime of a single request in a database or another downstream system. In Chapter 4 I dive into the
            managed product Cloud SQL (managed relational databases such as MySQL and PostgreSQL), in Chapter 5 I follow
            up with MemoryStore (Redis). I discuss scalability and reliability, as Cloud Run can scale to 1,000
            containers very fast.</p>

        <p><img src="https://wietsevenema.eu/cloud-run-book/pp4.png">
        </p>

        <p>Especially if you are building a more serious application, you’ll want to make sure that every Cloud Run
            service in your system only has the permissions to do exactly what it needs to do. In information security,
            this is also known as the principle of least privilege: it helps to reduce the impact of a vulnerability in
            one part of the system. This is why I introduce you to Cloud Identity and Access Management (IAM) in Chapter
            6. </p>

        
        <p>Most applications have the need to schedule tasks to be executed later, either immediately after handling an
            HTTP request or at a scheduled time. In Chapter 7 I introduce you to Cloud Tasks when I cover patterns to
            use for task scheduling. </p>
        <p><img src="https://wietsevenema.eu/cloud-run-book/pp5.png">
        </p>

        <p>In Chapter 8 I’ll show you how to work with Terraform, an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool. Terraform lets
            you recreate your entire project using one command, which proves useful if your application grows beyond
            “Hello World”. If you are still getting started with building applications, you might want to skip this
            chapter and the last two chapters for now, to come back to them later.</p>

        <p>I want to make sure that you have proper visibility over what is going on in your system when you go live for
            end users. This is why I cover structured logging and tracing in Chapter 9. Doing this right is
            fundamentally important when you run a system in production. </p>

        <p>Finally, I move beyond the day-to-day concerns and think about the future in Chapter 10. If you build your
            application on top of a vendor-controlled platform, you should consider portability.</p>

        <h2 id="review">Review</h2>
        <blockquote>This is the most comprehensive, yet approachable guide to getting started with Cloud Run (and its
            vast array of accompanying tools and technologies) that currently exists - no small feat for a technology
            that's seen rapid evolution over the past 12 months. From introducing the concept of containers, to
            discussing the real-world considerations when deploying Cloud Run as part of a microservices-based
            architecture, Wietse has written a book that will appeal to both newcomers to Google Cloud and veteran
            developers alike.
            <br><b>Chris Tippett - Principal Consultant at Servian (UK)</b>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>Wietse Venema's book goes into significant technical depth while also keeping the reader grounded
            with realistic scenarios. I had the opportunity to review it, and look forward to purchasing a copy of my
            own so that I can read it again. Google Cloud Run may be the most interesting compute platform you'll use in
            the years ahead, and this book will help you build up the knowledge you need to successfully use it.
            <br><b>Richard Seroter, Director of Outbound Product Management at Google Cloud</b>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>What can I say... this guy definitely knows what he's talking about. He is as enthusiastic about the
            subject as most people are about little puppies, and manages to explain it in a way that anyone can
            understand it.
            His diagrams are a strong part of the book. They help you understand topics that can be daunting and
            difficult to comprehend, especially for junior backend developers like myself. Go buy this book, it will
            make your life running in the cloud a whole lot easier!
            <br>
            <b>Femke Buijs - Software Engineer at Mollie</b>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>Get ready for what I believe is going to be the de facto reference book for Google Cloud Run. Wietse
            Venema explores and explains every facet of the product and goes into details of building production-grade
            serverless apps. As a Cloud Run Product Manager, I helped review every chapter for accuracy.
            <br><b>Steren Giannini, Cloud Run Product Manager at Google Cloud</b>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>Wietse has an engaging and personal style that makes this book a pleasure to read. What I like
            especially, is that apart from essential knowledge about Cloud Run, it also contains plenty of anecdotes,
            best practices and useful advice to make you a better application developer. Highly recommended!
            <br><b>Robbert Brak - Principal Software Engineer at 4me</b>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>Developers looking to future proof their career for the next decade will love this book because: #1
            It is a practical, easy to read and concise guide on Cloud Run (the technology that finally closes the gap
            between Serverless and Containers). #2 The author covers a broad set of managed services on Google Cloud
            Platform to help you become productive quickly (even if you're new to GCP). #3 If you're skeptical about
            vendor lock-in, you will appreciate the section on how to take your serverless containers and "move out" of
            the Google Cloud.
            <br><b>Daniel Zivkovic, Solution Architect and Organizer of Serverless Toronto User Group</b>

<p>Chuken, a Japanese Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/chukenDr">influencer</a> with over 12,000 followers, promises to teach his fans how to escape poverty — not by learning personal finance hacks or leaning on welfare programs, but by using loyalty points.</p>



<p>Chuken, which means “loyal dog,” calls himself one of Japan’s top-tier point stars, someone well-versed in the complicated art of “point alchemy.” The loyalty rewards he’s accumulated have helped him pay for everything from utility bills and vacations to the occasional trip to the salon. “I’m one of probably up to 100 people in Japan who earn more than 1 million yen [nearly $10,000] a year from points,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Despite being the birthplace of payment technology like the QR code, Japan is still <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fdbdb92c-a6ea-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04">stubbornly addicted</a> to using cash: Around <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-boj/nearly-20-of-japan-households-using-e-money-but-cash-still-king-idUSKBN1XS0Q1">80% of people in the country</a> say they choose it over debit cards or payment apps for small purchases. The generous rewards programs that Chuken promotes are a way for digital payment companies to encourage consumer adoption. But the incentives have also given rise to an enthusiastic <em>poikatsu</em>, or “point activities,” subculture that wants to max out as much as possible.</p>



<p>“Considering how cash-dependent Japan is, for mobile payments to take off, there needs to be a change in consumer behavior,” said Celeste Goh, a financial technology analyst at the market intelligence firm S&amp;P Global. That’s where loyalty points enter the picture.</p>



<p>A doctor by day, Chuken, who asked to be identified only by his Twitter alias for privacy reasons, first became interested in rewards programs after experiencing his own financial struggles. He’s one of thousands of physicians at university hospitals in Japan who have gone <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/606/">regularly unpaid</a>, even during the Covid-19 pandemic. At first, Twitter was where he swapped tips with other poikatsu enthusiasts, but the hobby soon evolved into a full-fledged lifestyle.</p>



<p>Chuken is just one of many poikatsu personalities that have emerged on Japanese social media in recent years. The biggest stars produce content a few times a week, and also earn additional income from sponsored posts and YouTube advertisements.</p>



<div><p>On Instagram there’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jojo_secco_point/">Setsuko Kikuhara</a>, or Sekko, who describes herself as a “poikatsu-obsessed woman.” The single mother of a 5-year-old, Sekko caters her content primarily toward other parents. One of her popular hacks is teaching followers how to nab year-long passes to Hong Kong Disneyland. Her extreme point collection even landed her on a popular Japanese <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwueZH3NcnU">talk show</a>.</p><p>One of the most successful poikatsu influencers is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ryogakucho/">Ryogakucho</a>, a YouTube creator with more than 600,000 followers who posts step-by-step guides to point hacking. He regularly preaches the gospel of R-Points, a program run by e-commerce giant Rakuten, which rewards consumers for purchases made on its platform. A cartoon lion cheers on subscribers in every video.</p></div>

<div><p>Two years ago, a Japanese think tank <a href="https://www.nira.or.jp/pdf/cashless.pdf#page=15">surveyed 3,000 people in the country, the vast majority of whom said they used rewards points programs at least sometimes</a>. 37% said a major reason they did so was because it was fun. “It’s just like a math problem, game, or sport, but you’re spotting the loopholes of service providers,” said Chuken. “Poikatsu is a hobby that earns you money, rather than loses you money. The better you get, the more it benefits your life.”</p><p>The popularity of poikatsu is in part a result of Japanese consumers’ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-cashless-idUSKBN1XF0BT">notorious</a> resistance to cashless technology. Even as neighboring countries like South Korea and China quickly adopted digital payments, Japan has clung to physical currency, said Arnie Cho, a fintech analyst at the research firm GlobalData. In early 2020, upwards of <a href="https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/">700 million consumers</a> were using mobile payments in China, often relying on WeChat Pay and Alipay’s QR code systems. In Japan, that <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/news/fnn20191214001/the-little-known-story-of-the-birth-of-the-qr-code.html">homegrown technology</a> has rarely been used in fintech, and Chinese tourists have actually <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/smartphone-wielding-chinese-tourists-challenge-cashs-reign-11551609002">helped foster</a> its adoption in the country.</p></div>



<p>International commentators often <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/japan-holdout-asia-cash-free-future/">recycle cultural generalizations </a>to explain Japan’s devotion to cash, but some of the real reasons for the phenomenon may be purely pragmatic. A highly developed banking infrastructure in the country keeps ATMs close, whereas many markets in Southeast Asia are turning to mobile payments to serve the unbanked, said Cho. <a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/d3d72e3f-6cd9-4fef-9f64-15f4aea79d98#:~:text=There%20is%20minimal%20risk%20from,three%20robberies%20per%20100%2C000%20individuals">Low petty-crime rates</a> also allow the average consumer to feel comfortable carrying a wallet full of cash. Fintech services, meanwhile, <em>have</em> needed to combat problems with fraud. In 2019, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/7-eleven-japan-7pay-hackers-passwords-2019-7">over $500,000 was stolen</a> from 7pay, 7-Eleven Japan’s debut in the mobile payment space. Almost three months after it launched, the company shuttered the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rewards programs can be expensive for payment apps, but they’re also a reliable way to convince reluctant consumers to give their services a chance. The social media giant Line has relied heavily on point schemes over the past few years, after struggling to get the majority of Japan’s population who already use its messaging platform onto its digital wallet, Line Pay. “Point rewards are an easy-to-understand way to incentivize users,” said Line Pay spokesperson Mayu Kamioka.</p>



<div><p>Line introduced aggressive rewards campaigns in 2018 and 2019 for Line Pay, shortly after the Japanese government set a goal to increase digital payments to <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/12/03/reference/japan-grudgingly-heads-toward-cashless-society/">40% of all transactions by 2027</a> (it later <a href="https://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2018/0703_001.html">updated</a> the target to 2025). The strategy included the <a href="https://linecorp.com/ja/pr/news/ja/2020/3151">Line Point Club</a>, a tiered system that rewards users based on the number of purchases they make with Line Pay over a six-month span. The company has also used sporadic <a href="https://linecorp.com/ja/pr/news/ja/2019/2672">“Pay-Toku” campaigns</a>, flash deals that give rebates of up to 20% for Line Pay purchases.</p><p>Line said the incentives are working. In a <a href="https://www.linebiz.com/jp/column/research/20200219/">survey</a> the company’s research arm conducted in February, around 38% of smartphone owners said they used a mobile device to make a payment in brick-and-mortar shops in the past 12 months, an increase from 13% from the year before.</p></div>



<p>Line Pay is competing with over a dozen other payment apps in Japan, including PayPay, a service jointly operated by SoftBank and Yahoo! Japan. PayPay said it <a href="https://about.paypay.ne.jp/pr/20201021/01/">doubled its registered users</a> from 10 million to 20 million in three months last year, as it was relying on short-term cash-back <a href="https://image.paypay.ne.jp/pdf/pr20190204_en.pdf">programs</a>, which cost the company around $94 million (10 billion yen) each to run. As <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/08/03/business/corporate-business/yahoo-japan-line-to-postpone-merger-pandemic/">Line and Yahoo! Japan consider a merger next spring</a>, these competing promotions may end up benefiting both companies.</p>

<p>Japanese media outlets have dubbed ongoing fights between payment apps as the “Cashless Sengoku Period,” a nod to Japan’s warring feudal era dating back to the 1400s. Some influencers take it upon themselves to chart the competing campaigns, like Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/haiji_doctor">Haiji Hakase</a>, who is known for his rewards chart featuring color-coded breakdowns of the 12 major payment services and what they’ll be offering over the next few days. “The best deals have changed so rapidly as poikatsu booms. It’s fun to find the best solutions amid the moving targets,” he said.</p>



<p>Yuzuhiko, a 31-year-old office worker in the southwestern city of Fukuoka, who asked to use only his first name, posts poikatsu vlogs on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgIUiYo9N8nmubnLNV6DBzA/">YouTube channel</a> three times a week. In his videos, he explains the latest digital payment trends while speaking through a 3D-animated avatar of a brown tabby cat in a samurai helmet. “I am the only ‘cashless VTuber,’” he said, referring to “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181002-the-virtual-vloggers-taking-over-youtube">virtual YouTubers</a>” who use computer-generated avatars, a popular genre in Japan.</p>



<p>Yuzuhiko said he’s noticed a big bump in video views this year. In October 2019, <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/09/01/business/tax-rebate-small-retailers-cashless-payments/">a government rebate program</a> began awarding 5% back on some cashless payments, in an effort to boost adoption before the since-postponed 2020 Olympics. The increased popularity may also be due to Covid-19. “Because the pandemic brought financial difficulties to some households, now they might care more about making the most of the available point services,” Yuzuhiko said.</p>



<p>It’s not clear how long the boon in poikatsu content will last. The incentives offered by companies like Line and PayPay are designed to lure new users and could be discontinued once the companies establish a core base of customers. “Now might be the fad season for poikatsu,” said Chuken, “but I’m not sure if this trend will still be around in four to five years.”</p>

                <center><em><p>Making 3D graphics code safer by telling vectors where home is</p>
</em></center>
                <h4>Tuesday, December 15, 2020 · 3 min read</h4>
<p>When I took Pat and Matt’s wonderful graphics class CS348B (yay PBRT!), one of
the most frustrating debugging journeys I had was related to interpreting
vectors in the wrong coordinate systems. At the time I’d come up with an idea
to catch such bugs statically, and now, 1.5 years later, I finally have found
time to write down the idea.</p>
<p>Here is the problem: A vector only has “meaning” with respect to a coordinate
system. In graphics, a vector could be in all sorts of coordinate systems:
<em>world space</em>, or <em>object space</em>, or <em>camera space</em>, or <em>screen space</em>, or
<em>normalized device coordinate (NDC) space,</em> or <em>raster space</em> (some of these
are self-explanatory, but see <a href="http://www.pbr-book.org/3ed-2018/Camera_Models/Projective_Camera_Models.html">PBR
§6.1.1-6.2</a>
for definitions). This leads to bugs. If you interpret a “camera-space” vector
as if it were in “world space,” your math will be <em>all wrong!</em>  You need to
apply the affine transformation <code>cameraToWorld</code> before doing any world-space
computation on a camera-space vector. But what if you forget to do that? Your
C++ code will happily compile, but your poor bunny might look like chicken soup
instead… (I learned this the hard way!).</p>
<p><img src="https://hardmath123.github.io/static/pbrt-coordinate-system-diagram.png" alt="some pbrt coordinate systems"></p>
<p>This got me thinking: perhaps a safer <code>Vector3f</code> should know <em>at the type
level</em> what coordinate system it is in. Rather than a <code>Vector3f</code>, perhaps what
we really want is a <code>Vector3f&lt;WorldSpace&gt;</code>. You simply can’t add a
<code>Vector3f&lt;CameraSpace&gt;</code> to a <code>Vector3f&lt;WorldSpace&gt;</code> — that’s a <em>type error!</em>
The compiler <em>makes</em> you call <code>cameraToWorld</code> if you want to do anything with
these two vectors. (All this is very much in the spirit of
<a href="https://github.com/kach/torchsaber">torchsaber</a>, by the way.)</p>
<p>I think there are broadly two ways you might want to implement something like
this. One way is to treat <code>CameraSpace</code> as a purely formal symbol, just a
<em>name</em> or an <em>annotation</em>. The compiler’s job is to check these annotations.
You’d have to explicitly break this abstraction inside the implementation of
<code>cameraToWorld</code>, but from a pedagogical perspective I think that is exactly
what you want.</p>
<p>The other way is for the tag <code>CameraSpace</code> to somehow encode the actual
geometry of what <em>camera space</em> “means.” For example, each vector could also
carry around the <code>Transformation</code> that gets you to its host coordinate system
from <code>WorldSpace</code>. Given this information, the compiler could even be able to
<em>infer</em> the implementation of <code>cameraToWorld</code> for <em>free!</em> Of course, this comes
at a cost, which is that the compiler might not be able to statically check
equality of <code>Transformations</code>, because the matrices might not be materialized
at compile-time.</p>
<hr>
<p>In the rest of this post I’ll quickly literate-ly program option (1) as a proof
of concept. It is short and sweet (at least, as “sweet” as any bit of C++
hacking can be).</p>
<p>First, we define our coordinate system “annotations” as dummy classes.</p>
<pre><code>class Space {};
class WorldSpace : public Space {};
class CameraSpace : public Space {};
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we design a <code>Vec3</code> template class that takes in such a “tag” as a
template parameter (<code>CoordinateSystem</code>), and enforces that the tags are the
same on operations. I’ve implemented the “<code>+</code>“ operator but you can imagine the
rest — there is nothing sneaky going on here! In fact, this is exactly how
one implements a generic <code>Vector3</code> that can be specialized over numeric types
(e.g.  <code>Vector3&lt;float&gt;</code>, <code>Vector3&lt;int&gt;</code>, and so on).</p>
<pre><code>template &lt;class CoordinateSystem&gt;
class Vec3 {
  static_assert(
    std::is_base_of&lt;Space, CoordinateSystem&gt;::value,
    "Vec3 annotation must derive from Space"
  );

public:
  double x, y, z;
  Vec3(double x, double y, double z)
    : x(x), y(y), z(z) {};

  // the '+' operator!
  Vec3&lt;CoordinateSystem&gt; operator+(
    Vec3&lt;CoordinateSystem&gt;&amp; other
  ) {
    return Vec3(
      this-&gt;x + other.x,
      this-&gt;y + other.y,
      this-&gt;z + other.z
    );
  }
};
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that you need to <code>#include &lt;type_traits&gt;</code> to get <code>std::is_base_of</code>, which
is there just to protect you from trying to make a <code>Vec3&lt;string&gt;</code> or something
else uncouth like that. Completely optional.)</p>
<p>…actually, that’s it! We can already get some mileage out of this. For
example, this should be okay:</p>
<pre><code>Vec3&lt;WorldSpace&gt; p(0, 0, 0);
Vec3&lt;WorldSpace&gt; q(1, 1, 1);
auto r = p + q; // ok!
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, this is perhaps <em>not</em> okay:</p>
<pre><code>Vec3&lt;CameraSpace&gt; s(2, 2, 2);
auto t = r + s; // NOT OK!
</code></pre>
<p>And indeed, the compiler complains <em>and</em> gives a helpful error message!</p>
<pre><code>test.cc:40:14: error: no match for 'operator+'
(operand types are 'Vec3&lt;WorldSpace&gt;'
and 'Vec3&lt;CameraSpace&gt;')
   40 |   auto t = r + s; // NOT OK!
      |            ~ ^ ~
      |            |   |
      |            |   Vec3&lt;CameraSpace&gt;
      |            Vec3&lt;WorldSpace&gt;
</code></pre><p>Of course! How <em>dare</em> we add a camera-space vector to a world-space vector? We
need to transform <code>s</code> to world-space…</p>
<pre><code>Vec3&lt;WorldSpace&gt; cameraToWorld(
  Vec3&lt;CameraSpace&gt;&amp; vec
) {
  return Vec3&lt;WorldSpace&gt;(
    vec.x * 2, vec.y - 4, vec.z + 8 // or whatever
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>…and now <code>g++</code> is happy. :)</p>
<pre><code>auto u = r + cameraToWorld(s); // ok!
</code></pre>
<p>Perhaps this trick will make its way into PBRT someday!</p>

			<h3><span>Introduction</span></h3>
<p><span>When I was starting Akita, my team and I spent a lot of time talking with software developers and security engineers about how to improve data security in modern web applications.</span></p>
<p><span>Almost every time, it came up that a security team’s success depended on their ability to change developer behavior. And that communicating clearly about technical objectives was extremely helpful towards this.</span></p>
<p><span>This led to another question: especially given the popularity of “shifting left” in security, where can more automation help improve communication and align goals? This led Akita to become the API dev tools company we are today.</span></p>
<p><span>In this post, I’ll talk about what it would look like for security tooling to be more aligned with developer interests and workflows and why mapping out the API graph will get us there.</span></p>
<h3><span>What developers want</span></h3>
<p><span>What software engineers need from security teams makes a lot of sense, and is in fact what Snyk has been doing for open-source vulnerabilities, config files, and more:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Getting a prioritized list of issues. </b><span>Both the security teams and software teams told us that instead of knowing </span><i><span>all </span></i><span>possible ways a system can go wrong, getting a smaller set of alerts that are high-priority makes it more likely that any fixes occur.</span></li>
<li><b>Getting an actionable list of issues.</b><span> The easier it is for a developer to know </span><i><span>why</span></i><span> something is happening, for instance why an API is releasing access tokens when it shouldn’t be, the more likely it is that the developer will fix this issue.</span></li>
<li><b>Being informed of issues as soon as possible. </b><span>The longer a bug is in production before being fixed, the more expensive it is to fix: the developer is more likely to have lost context of the original code; the fix is likely to impact the development schedule more; the fix is likely to involve additional actions like scraping logs.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>It turns out, however, that it gets pretty hard to do this for data security issues including stray passwords and personally identifiable information (PII). We’ll get into this next—</span></p>
<h3><span>Why it’s hard to give developers what they want</span></h3>
<p><span>Let’s walk through a concrete example to illustrate why scanning code, configs, or the network is often not enough when it comes to data security.</span></p>
<p><span>Let’s say you’re working on an API that returns information about users. To comply with regulations, you omit user phone numbers from the response to prevent callers of your API from storing this information in a scattered fashion that makes it hard to process service deletion requests.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>For example, your API might look like:&nbsp;</span></p>
<pre><code>type User struct {
&nbsp;&nbsp;ID string `json:”id”`

&nbsp;&nbsp;// Don’t return phone number for regulation reasons!
&nbsp;&nbsp;Phone string `json:”-”`
}

func main() {
&nbsp;&nbsp;...
&nbsp;&nbsp;http.HandleFunc("/users/json", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/json")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w.WriteHeader(200)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enc := json.NewEncoder(w)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enc.Encode(myUsers)

&nbsp;&nbsp;})

&nbsp;&nbsp;...
}

</code></pre>
<p><span>One day, your colleague adds a new version of the endpoint that returns YAML instead of JSON because they want to introduce some competition in the data serialization market.&nbsp; A very reasonable implementation of the YAML endpoint produces a PR</span><a href="https://github.com/akitasoftware/akita-change-management-demo/pull/4/files"> <span>like this</span></a><span>:</span></p>
<pre><code> http.HandleFunc("/users/yaml", func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "application/x-yaml")
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;w.WriteHeader(200)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enc := yaml.NewEncoder(w)
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defer enc.Close()
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enc.Encode(myUsers)
&nbsp;&nbsp;})</code></pre>
<p><span>A code reviewer without insider knowledge is very likely to gloss over the fact that yaml.Encode(…) does something different than json.Encode. However, when someone actually uses this new endpoint, they get now get users’ phone numbers in the response! 🙊</span></p>

		</div>
	</div><div>
		<div>
			<p><span>There are a few reasons bugs like this one defy existing tooling:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><b>Issues like these are hard to prioritize. </b><span>Whether this change leads to a data leak depends on whether the phone numbers end up somewhere they are not supposed to go, like logs, API responses, or calls to third-party SaaS. This is hard to know without having the bigger picture of how different services are interacting.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Issues resulting from changes like these are often not actionable. </b><span>The data leak that this change causes may not have to do with this service at all, making it difficult to identify the root cause using only tools that scan logs, APIs, and third-party calls.</span></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><b>Issues like these are hard to catch before running the code. </b><span>It takes a careful reviewer to catch that a new string encoding could cause phone numbers to leak. Catching this issue using a linter or static analysis requires either having a rule matching on exactly the change we described, or to flag all changes to string marshalling. The former is unlikely; the latter would produce reports so noisy they would almost definitely get ignored.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>As a result, data leaks like this one are often caught in production, long after they have been introduced, without context about what led to them.</span></p>
<h3><span>How the API graph will help</span></h3>
<p><span>At Akita, we believe that mapping the graph of API interactions is the key to improving communication and aligning goals across security and software engineering teams. The API graph will show 1) what endpoints are actually getting called, 2) what data is being sent to those endpoints, and 3) the bigger pictures of how endpoints are interdependent on each other. Being able to capture the API graph allows us not only to get visibility into a system at a particular point in time, but to track changes at fine granularity. Mapping the API graph allows us to identify potential data security issues with high precision by </span><b>giving context to data flows</b><span> and </span><b>allowing us to use that context to detect changes over time</b><span>.</span></p>

<p><span>When we first set out to build the API graph, we wanted something that was 1) blackbox, language-agnostic, and 2) integrated easily with existing systems. Over the last couple of years, we have figured out how to do this by watching API traffic, building dynamic models of API behaviors that we capture as API specs, and connecting the dots on how APIs across a system depend on each other. Check out our </span><a href="https://docs.akita.software/docs?utm_source=2020_12_snyk_post&amp;utm_campaign=2020_testing&amp;utm_medium=snyk"><span>docs here</span></a><span>.</span></p>

<hr>

<h6><span>Help Akita help you!</span></h6>
<p><span><em><span>We believe that, in order to unlock the next level of automated tooling for data security, there need to be tools that give more visibility over the API graph. If you’re interested in helping us build this out, </span><a href="https://www.akitasoftware.com/get-invite?utm_source=&amp;utm_campaign=&amp;utm_medium="><span>please try out our private beta</span></a><span>!</span></em></span></p>

						<p>Amazon's Self-Driving Taxi Company, Zoox, has unveiled a self-driving car with no steering wheel that can drive day and night on a single charge. </p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/zoox-duo-headshot-a-j.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/zoox-duo-headshot-a-j.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/zoox-duo-headshot-a-j.jpg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/zoox-duo-headshot-a-j.jpg 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/zoox-duo-headshot-a-j.jpg 1800w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>By 2021, Zoox plans to launch an app-based ride-hailing service in cities like San Francisco and Las Vegas. Zoox, once an independent company, was acquired by Amazon in June. </p><p>Today, several of Zoox's quirky-looking mint-green vehicles are already being built at a facility in Fremont, Calif where the factory has the capacity to eventually produce 10,000 to 15,000 units annually. </p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Reveal-Side.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Reveal-Side.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Reveal-Side.jpg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Reveal-Side.jpg 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Reveal-Side.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>The unveiling of a production car marks a significant step for the company. Zoox's concept car does away with pedals, mirrors, and even the steering wheel. The ride uses cameras, lidars, and other sensors to help it navigate. If needed, Zoox employees can manually operate the vehicles remotely and communicate with passengers in real time.</p><p>“This is really about re-imagining transportation,” said Zoox CEO Aicha Evans on Bloomberg Television. “Not only do we have the capital required, we have the long-term vision.”</p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Single-Side---Coit-Tower-SF.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Single-Side---Coit-Tower-SF.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Single-Side---Coit-Tower-SF.jpg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Single-Side---Coit-Tower-SF.jpg 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Single-Side---Coit-Tower-SF.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>Evans added that the company would also introduce ride-hailing in other countries. Managers didn't tell how much rides will costs, but that the services offered by Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc. were "affordable" and competitive. Nor did they say that it wouldn't happen in 2021 when the service would start, but confirmed it. Evans used the Zoox app in a video released on Monday to hail the car outside the Fairmont hotel in San Francisco and spin around the block.</p><p>Zoox is one of the companies competing to put autonomous vehicles on the road. Many retrofitted traditional cars are being tested on public roads, and few are deployed commercially. </p><figure><img src="https://smosa.com/content/images/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Interior-day.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Interior-day.jpg 600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Interior-day.jpg 1000w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Interior-day.jpg 1600w, https://smosa.com/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Zoox-Autonomous-Vehicle---Interior-day.jpg 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"></figure><p>In October, a completely driver-free taxi service in the suburban Phoenix was introduced by Alphabet Inc. General Motors-backed Cruise is also evaluating autonomous vehicles in San Francisco—recently with no safety drivers behind the wheel—using a Chevy Bolt based electric vehicle fleet.</p><p>While several years have passed since their use, several of the peculiarly mint-green vehicles at the Zoox in Fremont, Calif are still being installed. The factory will produce between 10,000 and 15,000 units a year the managers said. Suppliers submit pre-assembled key components and Zoox then assembles final stages.</p>

<p>There’s this narrative in the Bitcoin community that you may have heard: The government doesn’t care about you and is printing money with no conscience. Preserve your wealth with Bitcoin! Money printers go brrrr! </p>



<p>It makes Bitcoin sound virtuous. </p>



<p>But it’s a sales pitch.</p>



<p>In this post, we’ll talk about how Bitcoin stacks up to gold as a hedge against inflation and why we don’t think wealth preservation is what really motivates most Bitcoin investors.</p>



<p>Table of Contents:</p>



<ul><li><a href="#Why-Bitcoin-Is-Compared-to-Gold">Why Bitcoin Is Compared to Gold</a></li><li><a href="#Why-Bitcoin-Is-Better-Than-Gold">Why Bitcoin Is Better Than Gold</a></li><li><a href="#The-Store-of-Value-Argument">The “Store of Value” Argument</a></li><li><a href="#Is-Preserving-Wealth-What-People-Really-Care-About">Is Preserving Wealth What People Really Care About?</a></li></ul>



<h2 id="Why-Bitcoin-Is-Compared-to-Gold">Why Bitcoin Is Compared to Gold</h2>



<p>People call Bitcoin “digital gold” because both Bitcoin and gold have a limited supply. Unlike fiat/paper currency, which can be printed at the discretion of the government, Bitcoin will only ever have 21 millions coins unless +51% of its miners agree to change the protocol (which is highly unlikely). As for gold, there’s only so much that can be mined out of the earth.</p>



<h2 id="Why-Bitcoin-Is-Better-Than-Gold">Why Bitcoin Is Better Than Gold</h2>



<p>Many believe Bitcoin is superior to gold because:</p>



<ol><li>It’s digital so potentially harder to get seized by the government or stolen by a criminal. (Of course, if someone knows you own Bitcoin, they could still threaten you with force or violence to access it). </li><li>It’s easy to send. Anyone with a basic internet connection and some sort of computing device can send/receive Bitcoin. But gold is not because it’s a physical object and a heavy one at that.</li><li>It’s easily verifiable through cryptographic technology.</li><li>It’s infinitely divisible, which of course gold is not. There’s actual a unit of currency called a Satoshi, and 1 Bitcoin equals 100 million Satoshis.</li><li>It is somewhat programmable (though not nearly as advanced as a <a href="https://prudentlycrypto.com/why-invest-in-ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum</a>).</li></ol>



<p>But Bitcoin has some important disadvantages:</p>



<ol><li>It’s not fully private. Because the Bitcoin ledger aka blockchain is open to the public, Bitcoin transactions can reveal information about the senders and recipients. Authorities have taken advantage of this lack of complete anonymity to catch criminals.</li><li>It’s not as widely accepted or trusted: by society, financial institutions, governments, etc.</li><li>It’s very speculative &amp; volatile and has a much shorter a track record.</li></ol>



<h2 id="The-Store-of-Value-Argument">The “Store of Value” Argument</h2>



<p>Because both Bitcoin and gold are scarce, people think Bitcoin can serve the same purpose as gold: act as a better store of value over paper money and hedge against inflation.</p>



<p>You may have heard worries over inflation because of governments printing money to provide financial relief due to Covid-19. Some notable investors, like Raoul Pal and Ray Dalio, have said so, too.</p>



<p>So in the eyes of many Bitcoin enthusiasts, one of the most compelling arguments in support of Bitcoin is the fact that it can preserve wealth from being inflated away.</p>



<p>(NOTE: We know <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-07/paul-tudor-jones-buys-bitcoin-says-he-s-reminded-of-gold-in-70s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paul Tudor Jones</a> says that a store of value must have purchasing power, trustworthiness, liquidity and portability. But scarcity is what the majority of folks focus on).</p>



<h2 id="Is-Preserving-Wealth-What-People-Really-Care-About">Is Preserving Wealth What People Really Care About?</h2>



<p>Let’s rephrase this question a bit: Let’s say inflation was high at 10% per year. But a total stock market ETF gave a 15% return on the year. Would anyone give a rat’s ass about Bitcoin, if it kept up with inflation but <em>didn’t</em> beat the market?</p>



<p>We think not. Because, let’s be honest, the excitement around Bitcoin <em>as an “investment</em>” is its outstanding returns.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many people promote Bitcoin, arguing that it is the best inflation hedge. But protecting against inflation is not as important to them as seeing the price of Bitcoin go up. Because Bitcoin is scarce, getting more people to adopt Bitcoin as an inflation hedge drives up the price. So the justification is your wealth preservation. But the motivation is their wealth accumulation.</p>



<p><em>Now, does this detract from Bitcoin as a financial innovation? </em>No.</p>



<p><em>Does this mean Bitcoin does NOT act as a hedge against inflation? </em>No, it can despite other people’s ulterior motives advocating for it.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Does this stop us <a href="https://prudentlycrypto.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crypto Prudes</a> from buying and hodling Bitcoin? </em>Not at all.</p>



<p>We just think it’s important to have clear eyes when betting on Bitcoin because Bitcoin as a “store of value” is not what is truly motivating current investors. The truth is they wanna see Bitcoin beat the pants off all other investments. Otherwise, nobody would really give a shit (us included). </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>
									Welcome to the third interview on 'The Observer Effect'. We are lucky to have one
									of the most interesting founders in technology and commerce - Tobi Lütke, Founder
									and CEO of Shopify. This interview was published on December 16th, 2020.

							</em></p><p><em>Tobi is one of the most thoughtful and first principles oriented founders I've met and
								this was a fascinating conversation. Enjoy!
								</em>
							</p><p><b><a href="https://sriramk.com/">Sriram Krishnan</a></b><br>
								<em><strong>Let’s start with the basics. Walk me through a typical day in the life of
										Tobi Lütke.</strong></em>
							</p><p>
								Here’s the honest answer: obviously I have a schedule and people helping me manage my
								time, however, I think a lot about where to devote my attention. In this way, there is
								no typical day.

							</p><p>My attention is the most liquid and valuable resource that I have. Even back in the day
								when Shopify went public, I spent a good deal of time pre-selling the various investors.
								During meetings, I would say, “Hey, I'm here, and we've been doing this roadshow, but I
								actually spend a lot of my time on the product.” This was to set expectations because I
								knew I wasn't going to attend very many investor conferences. Fundamentally, my
								attention belonged to the product, not to the sales and marketing of it. </p><p>A day in my life really depends on what's happening. That said, usually I have themes.
								For instance, I have a priority list, and I have decision logs that chronicle all the
								things I am trying to figure out. </p><p>
								These cover different questions. For example, if I had just taken the company over, how
								would I change it? How would I build a company to potentially disrupt Shopify? I try to
								make my calendar match these bigger topics and other urgent priorities. In a way, the
								calendar is nothing more than a strategy. Although it's incredibly easy—and it has
								happened to me quite a lot—to have circumstances dictate the calendar. Because of this,
								there’s this constant tug of war between the actual priorities of the company and the
								kind of things that have to be done.

							</p><p>So, I end up trying to insert themes into my days. Like today, for instance, I have a
								meeting with my small team to begin the week; I reserved my afternoon for product
								reviews—what we call “greenpathing exercises”—where, oddly, I'm trying to discern how
								everyone is thinking about the main things we're working on. I do this because
								oftentimes I feel as though I am the connective tissue combining operations, finance,
								and more formal business functions with the product itself. This connection helps me to
								make good decisions.</p><p>Lastly, on Wednesdays, Shopify doesn't do scheduled meetings. Usually, I have a list of
								memos to read or reactions to record to various mock-ups and so on. This is basically my
								very loosely defined schedule.</p><p>
								<b><i>How do you work with your so-called “expansion pack team” on reallocating your
										portfolio management on time? What does that loop look like?
									</i></b>
							</p><p>
								A lot of this is almost automatic by just having a good color coding system, which is
								really fun.
								<i>[laughs]</i>

							</p><p> At one point, I started complaining about blue weeks where every single time slot was
								taken. And someone said, “Well, if you don't like blue, I can make any color.” And I
								replied, “Well, how about we color based on leverage?” And that’s just what we did. </p><p>
								We ended up labeling my product-related things red, investor/Board of Director-related
								things some kind of teal color, et cetera. And the thing I’m looking for is a balanced
								week; a week where, ideally, I manage to devote about 30% of the time—at least—to the
								product and then as much as possible to things like recruiting, bigger picture projects,
								and one-on-ones.

							</p><p>
								And so, if my calendar becomes too external or too much of anything, it's the first
								thing we see when we sit down for our priorities meeting. This makes scheduling a lot
								easier.

							</p><p>
								<b><i>
										This is a very natural segue to my next question. One of the theories behind
										this whole set of interviews is diving into the atomic bits of how we spend our
										time in meetings. This time compounds over the long term and has a massive
										effect. What does a good meeting with Tobi look like? Alternatively, what does a
										bad meeting with you look like?
									</i>
							</b></p><div>
							<p>So actually, agendas are not terribly successful with me. I admire how other CEOs I’ve
								spoken with always have a strict agenda where everyone has a speaking slot. I find that
								absolutely fascinating. Even if I really set myself to an agenda and say, “Okay, great,
								this is going to happen,” I can't get through half of a meeting like this. Partly
								because a good meeting is, for me personally, when I learn something.</p>
								<blockquote>
									<p>..when I have my own ideas, the first thing I tend to do is
										just try to falsify them, to figure out why what I'm thinking about is probably
										incorrect...<em>
									</em></p>
								</blockquote>
							<p>
								I started a company because I love learning. I went into programming because I found it
								fascinating. During meetings, I just love to hear the things that teams have discovered.
								When you're discussing an idea or a decision, I want to know what has been considered.
								To be honest, I find myself more interested in the inputs of an idea than the actual
								decision. I say this because when I have my own ideas, the first thing I tend to do is
								just try to falsify them, to figure out why what I'm thinking about is probably
								incorrect. This is actually something that I have to explain to people that I work with.
								If I like someone's idea, I tend to do the same thing: I try to poke holes in it.
							</p>

							<p>I usually say, “Well, the implication of this choice means you've made the following
								assumptions. What inputs did you use to make these foundational assumptions?”
								Effectively, I'm trying to figure out if an idea is built on solid fundamentals. I find
								that shaky fundamentals tend to be where things often go wrong. The decision being
								discussed could be the perfect decision according to the various assumptions that
								everyone came into the room with. But if those assumptions are faulty, the seemingly
								perfect decision is faulty too. Interestingly, assumptions are rarely mentioned in the
								briefing docs or in the slide deck. Usually, I'm trying to make sure those are rock
								solid. Through this process, I invariably end up learning something completely new about
								a field. That gives me great confidence and comfort both in the decision and the
								direction.</p>

							
							<h2 id="enneagrams"><b>On Enneagrams and Comprehensivists</b></h2>
							<p>


								<b><i>Two words have come up a lot in preparatory conversations: comprehensivist and
										enneagrams. Could you talk about both?

									</i></b>

							</p>

							<p>Interesting.</p>
							<p>
								<i>[Laughs]</i>
								I feel like I'm becoming known for pointing people towards the enneagram. I actually
								don't think it's that valuable on its own. The valuable thing about any of these
								personality-type constructs is that they do a really good job of teaching people that
								other people are very different. That realization is probably one of the biggest growth
								moments for people in general. It tells you that different people play different roles.
								On that note, I do think that, ideally, people should play their own roles really,
								really well.

							</p>
							<p>
								I play the role of challenger, personally. I find that the enneagram helps me remind
								myself that with different people I have to talk about the same things in different
								ways. I think it allows you to skip some time which would otherwise be touch and go at
								the beginning of a relationship and helps build trust better. In short, it enables us to
								have fruitful and effective conversations.
								And comprehensivist, I mean, that's a fancy word.
							</p>
							<p>

								<i>[Laughs]</i> I don't think I've ever used it outside of putting it into my Twitter
								bio when I was reading Buckminster Fuller. That said, I do like range. I find that the
								first 80% of every field is pretty quick to learn—it’s equivalent to the Pareto
								principle—and I think that creativity generally is people using lessons from one field
								in another field in different ways. Because of this, I find learning fascinating.

								</p><blockquote>
									<p>..creativity generally is people using lessons from one field
										in another field in different ways...<em>
									</em></p>
								</blockquote>
							
						


							<h2 id="decisionmaking"><b>On Time and Attention on Shopify<br></b></h2>
							<p>
								<b><i>
										You try and design how your company spends time and attention. One particular
										incident came up recently which I found really fascinating. You wrote a script
										to delete every recurring meeting at Shopify. Talk about why you did that, and
										what you ended up learning from it.


									</i></b>
							</p>


							<p>
								<i>[Laughs]</i>
								So, going back a little bit further there—you know what, I should talk about books. One
								thing that is interesting is how people have accused Shopify of being a book club thinly
								veiled as a public company.

							</p>
							<p>We tend to read a lot and talk about a lot of books. We read Nassim Taleb’s books and one
								person on my team began talking about Antifragile and gave an outline. He said, “I think
								Nassim is putting a word to the thing that you keep talking about…” </p>

							<p>Now, I come from an engineering perspective. One of my biggest beefs with engineers, in
								general, is …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="whats-in-this-post">What’s in this post?</h2><p>Enough about the insides of Postgres indexes to impress your coworkers at the coffee machine or recruiters at a job interview 🤓.</p><p>We’ll have a look at B-Tree, Hash, GIN, GiST, BRIN indexes and focus on demystifying them.</p><h2 id="why-the-hell-do-i-even-need-an-index">Why the hell do I even need an index?</h2><p>Indexes are at the core of any querying in relational databases (the classic SQL databases like Postgres or MySQL). Therefore it is very rewarding and important to have an idea of how they work.</p><p>An illustration is worth a thousand words so let’s take an example. Let’s say we have a <code>user</code> table containing 1M million entries (or rows):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>user</span> (
  id   SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name TEXT,
  age  INTEGER
);
</code></pre></div><p>We want to know how many of our users are above 30. We run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Without any extra index, the database would have to go over the 1M entries one by one, look at their age and increment a counter for all the users above 30:</p><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/scan.png" alt="scan"></p><p>If it feels like an inefficient way of getting the result it’s because it is 💁‍♀️. It would be a slow query (called a “full table scan”, as every row needs to be scanned).</p><p>That’s where indexation comes into play. It will allow us to quickly locate the users we’re interested in, without having to lookup all the rows.</p><p>In Postgres, there are 5 types of indexes:</p><ul><li>B-Trees</li><li>Hashes</li><li>GINs</li><li>GiSTs</li><li>BRINs</li></ul><h2 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h2><h3 id="naming">Naming</h3><ul><li><strong>Row</strong>: An entry in the database (e.g. a user). Also called tuple.</li><li><strong>Column</strong>: An attribute of a row (e.g. the first name of a user).</li><li><strong>Table</strong>: A collection of rows (e.g. a user table).</li><li><strong>TID</strong>: Tuple ID. It’s an internal Postgres ID. It describes where to find the row on the disk.</li><li><strong>Operator</strong>: Reserved keyword representing operations on data (e.g. <code>AND</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>=</code>).</li><li><strong>Statement</strong>: Database operation (e.g. <code>CREATE TABLE user (name TEXT);</code>).</li><li><strong>Query</strong>: Statement that returns data (e.g. <code>SELECT * FROM user;</code>)</li></ul><h3 id="core-assumptions">Core assumptions</h3><ul><li>In general, an index needs to be able to fit in RAM to be fully efficient. That’s why having very large indexes can be problematic.</li><li>Fetching the row behind a <code>tid</code> is easy and relatively cheap to do. We consider it roughly equivalent to getting an element from an array by index (e.g. <code>var a = array[i]</code>).</li><li>We’ll only talk about read operations (queries). How to propagate writes to indexes is a whole other story.</li><li>Everything is more complex and complicated in real life, this post tries to explain things on a very high level and may be approximate on some parts. For more details, one should have a look at the <code>Further explanation</code> links.</li></ul><h2 id="b-tree-indexes">B-Tree indexes</h2><h3 id="usecase">Usecase</h3><p>So we want to index this query. We want to make it faster:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>We create a B-Tree index on the <code>age</code> column.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age);
</code></pre></div><p>No need to specify anything, B-Tree is the default index for Postgres and many other databases including MySQL, Oracle or SQL Server.</p><h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work</h3><p>A binary search tree (<strong>different from a B-Tree</strong>) is a well known data structure where every node of the tree has two children nodes. The values of the left and right children being respectively smaller and larger than their parent’s value.</p><p>A B-Tree is a generalised binary search tree where every node can have more than two children.</p><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/tree_comparison.png" alt="tree comparison"></p><p>A very helpful property of these trees is that their values are sorted. It makes it easy to lookup values. Exactly what we need to speed up our query!</p><p>Now a B-Tree index is slightly more than just a B-Tree. It is a linked list of tids, sorted by value and linked to a B-Tree.</p><p>Let’s run our query again and see how it looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/btree.png" alt="btree"></p><p>That was much easier! By using the sorting of the tree nodes, we can now quickly find the first user being above 30 and count from there. Remember? The linked list at the bottom is sorted by age!</p><p>As a side note, you may be wondering about multicolumn indexes, like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age_and_height <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age, height_cm);
</code></pre></div><p>The simplest way to visualize it is to imagine it as being roughly equivalent to a monocolumn index like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age_and_height <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age<span>+</span><span>'-'</span><span>+</span>height_cm);

                <div><h3 id="as-compared-to-the-the-intel-based-13-macbook-pro-">As compared to the the Intel-based 13" Macbook Pro.</h3><p><br>A few weeks ago, Apple released its first custom-designed silicon chip for the Mac, <a href="https://www.apple.com/mac/m1/">the M1</a>. There have been <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/hands-on-with-the-apple-m1-a-seriously-fast-x86-competitor/">several</a> <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/Apple-M1-Chip-Everything-We-Know">impressive</a> <a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2020/12/13/arm-macbook-vs-intel-macbook-a-simd-benchmark/">benchmarks</a> around its performance relative to its Intel-based predecessors, but we were interested in putting it through its paces on a machine learning (and, specifically, a computer vision) workload.</p><p>While Apple <a href="https://blog.tensorflow.org/2020/11/accelerating-tensorflow-performance-on-mac.html">announced support for TensorFlow</a> training on the M1, the toolchain isn't quite ready yet. With some effort, we were able to <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/how-to-run-jupyter-notebooks-on-a-mac-m1/">get Jupyter notebooks running on Apple Silicon</a>, for example, but the <a href="https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos">pre-release version of TensorFlow for Mac</a> wasn't ready for primetime just yet (notably SciPy is not yet compatible with the M1 which is required for <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/train-a-tensorflow2-object-detection-model/">TensorFlow's Object Detection API</a>).</p><p>Instead, we used <a href="https://blog.roboflow.com/createml">Apple's CreateML</a> to perform our benchmarks. This should be a fair comparison of the relative performance you will be able to expect for training machine learning models once the compatibility quirks are eventually sorted out in a few months. <em>(Presumably, Apple has already done the work in optimizing CreateML for both for their Intel and M1 devices.)</em></p><p>Unfortunately, since CreateML is not compatible with NVIDIA chips, it still doesn't give us a good head-to-head comparison between the new M1 and the 3090 or 2080ti for example (Apple claims 11 trillion operations per second on the M1's neural engine vs. NVIDIA's claim of 14.2 TOPS on the 2080ti).</p><p>As you decide whether or not to purchase the new M1 laptop – <a href="https://www.creativebloq.com/news/macbook-m1-december-sales">which just got a "surprise price cut"</a> – we set out to estimate how well the Apple M1 laptop performs against their previous generation machines' Intel CPUs and AMD Radeon GPUs. Is it worth it?</p><blockquote>TL;DR: if you're looking to tackle machine learning and computer vision problems on your Mac, the Apple M1 may be worth the upgrade once the software you require is compatible but it's not yet ready to replace a discrete GPU.</blockquote><figure><img src="https://blog.roboflow.com/content/images/2020/12/unpackaging-macbook.gif" alt=""><figcaption>Unboxing my new MacBook M1.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="the-test-machines">The Test Machines</h2><p>We used three recent MacBook Pro machines to do our comparison:</p><ul><li>MacBook Pro 13-inch (November 2020) M1 integrated system on a chip with 8GB memory. $1,499</li><li>MacBook Pro 13-inch (May 2020) 1.4 GHz Quad-Core Intel Core i5 with 16GB memory and Intel Iris Plus Graphics 645 (1536MB graphics memory). $1,699</li><li>MacBook Pro 16-inch (2019) 2.4 GHz 8-Core Intel Core i9 with 64GB memory and AMD Radeon Pro 5500M (8GB graphics memory). $3,899</li></ul><h2 id="test-methodology">Test Methodology</h2><p>To compare performance, we used <a href="https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/create-ml/">Create ML</a> to tackle a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBn7Cd8Z8yE">no code object recognition</a> problem.

(If you want to see how to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBn7Cd8Z8yE">deploy your model, watch this video</a>.) However, 5,000 iterations is enough for us to get a good sense of how the two systems perform against each other.</p><p>On this object detection task in Create ML, <strong>the 13" Apple M1-powered Macbook Pro performed significantly better than the 13" Intel Core i5 but underperformed the 15" i9 with its discrete Radeon Pro 5500M GPU</strong>.</p><ul><li>The Intel Core i5 took 542 minutes to run through 5,000 iterations (CPU training).</li><li>The Apple M1 took 149 minutes &nbsp;to do the same (8% GPU utilization).</li><li>The Intel Core i9 with Radeon Pro took 70 minutes (100% GPU utilization).</li></ul><p>Notably, training was unable to take advantage of the integrated Intel Iris graphics card to accelerate training but it was able to partially utilize the integrated graphics card on the M1. This is quite impressive for a system on a chip.</p><p>Unfortunately, while the AMD Radeon was able to reach full 100% utilization on the 15" Macbook Pro, the 13" M1 never made it above 10% utilization. Despite being faster on paper, it still needs more software improvements to capitalize on its hardware. Apple is continuing to actively work on this with <a href="https://github.com/apple/tensorflow_macos">their TensorFlow port</a> and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/mlcompute">their ML Compute framework</a>.</p><h3 id="the-verdict-based-on-this-benchmark-the-apple-m1-is-3-64-times-as-fast-as-the-intel-core-i5-but-is-not-fully-utilizing-its-gpu-and-thus-underperforms-the-i9-with-discrete-graphics-">The Verdict: Based on this benchmark, the Apple M1 is 3.64 times as fast as the Intel Core i5 but is not fully utilizing its GPU and, thus, underperforms the i9 with discrete graphics.<br></h3><p>It looks like there are still significant software optimizations for Apple to make in CreateML to fully take advantage of the raw power present in the M1. It should eventually be able to fully utilize its GPU during just like the i9 was. At which point it would likely handily outperform it.</p><p>There are plenty of things to consider when purchasing a new laptop; fitting an object detection model with Create ML is only one. But when pitting these two laptops purchased in 2020 against each other on this task, the Apple M1 appears to be a promising architecture that should be superior as the software is updated to take advantage of it. But, for now, I plan to hold off while things are ironed out.</p><figure><iframe width="356" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kBn7Cd8Z8yE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption>Go through the whole process of training and deploying a CreateML model to your iPhone via <a href="https://bit.ly/rf-yt-sub">our YouTube</a>.</figcaption></figure></div>

  <p><img alt="DeskPi Pro Raspberry Pi case" src="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/images/2020/deskpi.jpg"></p>

<p>Despite having worked on a <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2006/03/more-amstrad-e3-joy.html">number</a> <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2006/10/progress-with-the-balloon.html">of</a> <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2019/01/mapleboard.html">ARM</a> <a href="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/2020/09/rb3011-mainline.html">platforms</a> I’ve never actually had an ARM based development box at home. I have a Raspberry Pi B Classic (the original 256MB rev 0002 variant) a coworker gave me some years ago, but it’s not what you’d choose for a build machine and generally gets used as a self contained TFTP/console server for hooking up to devices under test. Mostly I’ve been able to do kernel development with the cross compilers already built as part of Debian, and either use pre-built images or Debian directly when I need userland pieces. At a previous job I had a <a href="http://macchiatobin.net/">Marvell MACCHIATObin</a> available to me, which works out as a nice platform - quad core A72 @ 2GHz with 16GB RAM, proper SATA and a PCIe slot. However they’re still a bit pricey for a casual home machine. I really like the look of the <a href="https://www.solid-run.com/arm-servers-networking-platforms/honeycomb-workstation/">HoneyComb LX2</a> - 16 A72 cores, up to 64GB RAM - but it’s even more expensive.</p>

<p>So when I saw the existence of the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/8gb-raspberry-pi-4-on-sale-now-at-75/">8GB Raspberry Pi 4</a> I was interested. Firstly, the Pi 4 is a proper 64 bit device (my existing Pi B is ARMv6 which means it needs to run Raspbian instead of native Debian armhf), capable of running an upstream kernel and unmodified Debian userspace. Secondly the Pi 4 has a USB 3 controller sitting on a PCIe bus rather than just the limited SoC USB 2 controller. It’s not SATA, but it’s still a fairly decent method of attaching some storage that’s faster/more reliable than an SD card. Finally 8GB RAM is starting to get to a decent amount - for a headless build box 4GB is probably generally enough, but I wanted some headroom.</p>

<p>The Pi comes as a bare board, so I needed a case. Ideally I wanted something self contained that could take the Pi, provide a USB/SATA adaptor and take the drive too. I came across the pre-order for the <a href="https://deskpi.com/products/deskpi-pro-for-raspberry-pi-4">DeskPi Pro</a>, decided it was the sort of thing I was after, and ordered one towards the end of September. It finally arrived at the start of December, at which point I got round to ordering a Pi 4 from <a href="https://cpc.farnell.com/">CPC</a>.</p>

<p>Total cost ~ £120 for the case + Pi.</p>

<h2 id="the-bad">The Bad</h2>

<p>First, let’s get the bad parts out of the way.</p>

<p><img alt="Broken USB port (right)" src="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/images/2020/deskpi-broken-usb.jpg"></p>

<p>I managed to break a USB port on the Desk Pi. It has a pair of forward facing ports, I plugged my wireless keyboard dongle into it and when trying to remove it the solid spacer bit in the socket broke off. I’ve never had this happen to me before and I’ve been using USB devices for 20 years, so I’m putting the blame on a shoddy socket.</p>

<p>The first drive I tried was an old Crucial M500 mSATA device. I have an adaptor that makes it look like a normal 2.5” drive so I used that. Unfortunately it resulted in a boot loop; the Pi would boot its initial firmware, try to talk to the drive and then reboot before even loading Linux. The DeskPi Pro comes with an m2 adaptor and I had a spare m2 drive, so I tried that and it all worked fine. This might just be power issues, but it was an unfortunate experience especially after the USB port had broken off.</p>

<p>(Given I ended up using an M.2 drive another case option would have been the <a href="https://www.argon40.com/argon-one-m-2-case-for-raspberry-pi-4.html">Argon ONE M.2</a>, which is a bit more compact.)</p>

<h2 id="the-annoying">The Annoying</h2>

<p><img alt="DeskPi Pro without rear bezel" src="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/images/2020/deskpi-open.jpg"></p>

<p>The case is a little snug; I was worried I was going to damage things as I slid it in. Additionally the construction process is a little involved. There’s a good set of instructions, but there are a lot of pieces and screws involved. This includes a couple of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexible_flat_cable">FFC cables</a> to join things up. I think this is because they’ve attempted to make a compact case rather than allowing a little extra room, and it does have the advantage that once assembled it feels robust without anything loose in it.</p>

<p><img alt="DeskPi Pro with rear bezel and USB3 dongle" src="https://www.earth.li/~noodles/blog/images/2020/deskpi-rear.jpg"></p>

<p>I hate the need for an external USB3 dongle to bridge from the Pi to the USB/SATA adaptor. All the cases I’ve seen with an internal drive bay have to do this, because the USB3 isn’t brought out internally by the Pi, but it just looks ugly to me. It’s hidden at the back, but meh.</p>

<p>Fan control is via a USB/serial device, which is fine, but it attaches to the USB C power port which defaults to being a USB peripheral. Raspbian based kernels support device tree overlays which allows easy reconfiguration to host mode, but for a Debian based system I ended up rolling my own dtb file. I changed</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include "bcm283x-rpi-usb-peripheral.dtsi"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>to</p>

<div><div><pre><code>#include "bcm283x-rpi-usb-host.dtsi"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>in <code>arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dts</code> and then I did:</p>

<div><div><pre><code>cpp -nostdinc -I include -I arch -undef -x assembler-with-cpp \
    arch/arm/boot/dts/bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dts &gt; rpi4.preprocessed
dtc -I dts -O dtb rpi4.preprocessed -o bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>and the resulting <code>bcm2711-rpi-4-b.dtb</code> file replaced the one in <code>/boot/firmware</code>. This isn’t a necessary step if you don’t want to use the cooling fan in the case, or the front USB ports, and it’s not really anyone’s fault, but it was an annoying extra step to have to figure out.</p>

<p>The DeskPi came with a microSD card that was supposed to have RaspiOS already on it. It didn’t, it was blank. In my case that was fine, because I wanted to use Debian, but it was a minor niggle.</p>

<h2 id="the-good">The Good</h2>

<p>I used Gunnar’s <a href="https://raspi.debian.net/">pre-built Pi Debian image</a> and it Just Worked; I dd’d it to the microSD as instructed and the Pi 4 came up with working wifi, video and USB enabling me to get it configured for my network. I did an <code>apt upgrade</code> and got updated to the Buster 10.7 release, as well as the latest 5.9 backport kernel, and everything came back without effort after a reboot. It’s lovely to be able to run Debian on this device without having to futz around with self-compiled kernels.</p>

<p>The DeskPi makes a lot of effort to route things externally. The SD slot is brought out to the front, making it easy to fiddle with the card contents without having to open the case to replace it. All the important ports are brought out to the back either through orientation of the Pi, or extenders in the case. That means the built in Pi USB ports, the HDMI sockets (conveniently converted to full size internally), an audio jack and a USB-C power port. The aforementioned USB3 dongle for the bridge to the drive is the only external thing that’s annoying.</p>

<p>Thermally things seem good too. I haven’t done a full torture test yet, but with the fan off the system is sitting at about 40°C while fairly idle. Some loops in bash that push load up to above 2 get the temperature up to 46°C or so, and turning the fan on brings it down to 40°C again. It’s audible, but quieter than my laptop and not annoying.</p>

<p>I liked the way the case came with everything I needed other than the Pi 4 and a suitable disk drive. There was an included PSU (a proper USB-C PD device, UK plug), the heatsink/fan is there, the USB/SATA converter is there and even an SD card is provided (though that’s just because I had a pre-order).</p>

<p>Speaking of the SD, I only needed it for initial setup. Recent Pi 4 bootloaders are capable of booting directly from USB mass storage devices. So I upgraded using the <a href="https://github.com/raspberrypi/rpi-eeprom/releases/tag/v2020.09.03-138a1">RPi EEPROM Recovery image</a> (which just needs extracted to the SD FAT partition, no need for anything complicated - boot with it and the screen goes all green and you know it’s ok), then created a FAT partition at the start of the drive for the kernel / bootloader config and a regular EXT4 partition for root. Copies everything over, updated paths, took out the SD and it all just works happily.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>My main complaint is the broken USB port, which feels like the result of a cheap connector. For a front facing port expected to see more use than the rear ports I think there’s a reasonable expectation of robustness. However I’m an early adopter and maybe future runs will be better.</p>

<p>Other than that I’m pretty happy. The case is exactly the sort of thing I wanted; I was looking for something that would turn the Pi into a box that can sit on my desk on the network and that I don’t have to worry about knocking wires out of or lots of cables hooking bits up. Everything being included made it very convenient to get up and running. I still haven’t poked the Pi that hard, but first impressions are looking good for it being a trouble free ARM64 dev box in the corner, until I can justify a HoneyComb.</p>

        <p><strong>On this page</strong>: A zero-to-hero guide for assessing the security risk of your Kubernetes cluster and hardening it.</p>

<p>Kubernetes is a container orchestrator that has seen year-after-year exponential growth in adoption.</p>

<p>While many organizations have adopted Kubernetes because of its hyped ability to
scale, extensibility, and multi-cloud support, many security teams have been
left playing catch-up.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This guide will help you rapidly ramp on what Kubernetes is and what it does
(and doesn’t do).</p>

  <p>You’ll learn how to understand the current state of your
Kubernetes deployment, hone in on what’s most risky, and how to mitigate that
risk.</p>

  <p>We’ll link to the best tools and other resources to learn more, and
include plenty of handy CLI one-liners to get the job done.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="guide-structure">Guide Structure</h2>

<p>The structure of this guide, which you can also quickly navigate by the navbar
links on the left hand side, is the following:</p>

<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>First we’ll give you an <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/overview">overview</a> of Kubernetes, discuss what it means to <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/secure-cluster-looks-like">secure a
cluster</a>, and talk about the end
goal here.</p>

<p>We’ll list a number of <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/tooling-up">solid tools</a> to get you
started, which will be used throughout this guide.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-your-environment">Understanding Your Environment</h3>

<p>You need to <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/understanding-your-environment">understand your environment</a> before you can secure it, so we start
there. We’ll quickly dive in to ways that you can collect information, and which information is relevant in the big picture.</p>

<p>We want to see what your cluster looks like, how you’re <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/how-deploying">deploying it</a> (managed vs self-hosted), what’s running
<a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/whats-running-in-cluster">inside</a> and <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/whats-running-nearby-cluster">nearby</a>, and what services are at risk of being compromised throughout the cluster’s lifetime.</p>

<h3 id="understanding-your-risk">Understanding Your Risk</h3>

<p>With all this information we will run through a simple risk analysis that helps us determine how likely an exploit would occur and determine how your cluster will hold up. Finally building
an overall risk baseline for the environment.</p>

<p>We’ll examine:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/understanding-your-risk">Access controls</a>: who can deploy and how are workloads being deployed?</li>
  <li>Which <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/services-exposed">services are exposed</a> publicly or internally?</li>
  <li>Do we have visibility into the cluster, and is our <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/how-vulnerable-is-cluster">cluster vulnerable</a> due to configuration mistakes or networking-related vulnerabilities?</li>
</ul>

<p>We’ll conclude by discussing <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/common-compromise-scenarios">common compromise
scenarios</a>: a pod being
compromised, a developer compromising a cluster, and a developer being
compromised by an attacker. And some stories of what I’ve seen in the real world
during my consulting work, for good measure 😎</p>

<h3 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping Up</h3>
<p>In the end, we’ll <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/putting-it-together">put it all together</a>,
and you will hopefully have enough information to get started reviewing your
cluster environment to identify gaps, vulnerabilities, and just questionable
areas that will need further inspection.</p>

<p>Once you have a risk assessment complete, it’ll be your job to continue onto the
risk management phase and find out what mitigations will best fit in to address
all the issues you found.</p>

<p>And of course, we conclude with a variety of <a href="https://tldrsec.com/guides/kubernetes/further-reading">further
resources</a> on Kubernetes threat modeling,
additional tools, and some of our favorite conference talks.</p>



<p>My name is Mark Manning and I’m currently a security architect at <a href="https://www.snowflake.com/">Snowflake</a>. I’ve spent years as a security consultant for a global security consulting firm where I assessed, reviewed, attacked, and sometimes, helped fix problems on a wide range of Kubernetes projects (among other types of projects). I was excited for the opportunity to collaborate with <em>tl;dr sec</em> and write about a topic I’ve dealt with repeatedly over the last 4 years, Kubernetes risk.</p>

<p>I’ve worked with customers just getting started with Kubernetes, cloud providers deploying their own Kubernetes platforms, and large organizations that have invested much of their business into embracing the “digital transformation.”</p>

<p>Today I’m working with Snowflake by focusing some of my experiences and offensive skills towards helping solve some really interesting security challenges. Part of that is Risk Management of Kubernetes clusters at scale.</p>

<p>I’ve seen how things can go right, and wrong, in the real world, in a vast variety of companies. While I don’t have all the answers, I enjoy sharing what I do know with the public, and <a href="https://www.twitter.com/antitree">on Twitter</a> or at <a href="https://www.shmoocon.org/speakers/#kubectl">hacker conferences</a>.</p>

<p>My hope is that some of us will continue to work heavily on Kubernetes security so that even if we don’t fix everything, the rest of the infosec industry can level-up to meet the challenges of securing these modern platforms.</p>

Naming Conventions: Private</h2><p>Rarely you will find an underscore (_) in front of a variable/function/method in JavaScript. If you see one, it is <em>intended</em> to be <em>private</em>. Even though it cannot be really enforced by JavaScript, declaring something as private tells us about how it should be used or how it should not be used.</p><p>For instance, a private method in a class should only be used internally by the class, but should be avoided to be used on the instance of the class:</p><pre><pre><p><span>class</span><span> </span><span>SoftwareDeveloper</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>constructor</span><span>(</span><span>firstName</span><span>,</span><span> lastName</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>firstName </span><span>=</span><span> firstName</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>lastName </span><span>=</span><span> lastName</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>_getName</span><span>(</span><span>firstName</span><span>,</span><span> lastName</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>_getName</span><span>(</span><span>firstName</span><span>,</span><span> lastName</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>    </span><span>return</span><span> </span><span>`</span><span>${</span><span>firstName</span><span>}</span><span> </span><span>${</span><span>lastName</span><span>}</span><span>`</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>var</span><span> me </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>new</span><span> </span><span>SoftwareDeveloper</span><span>(</span><span>'Robin'</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>'Wieruch'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>var</span><span> name </span><span>=</span><span> me</span><span>.</span><span>name</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> me</span><span>.</span><span>_getName</span><span>(</span><span>me</span><span>.</span><span>firstName</span><span>,</span><span> me</span><span>.</span><span>lastName</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span>console</span><span>.</span><span>log</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>)</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>A private variable/function can occur in a JavaScript file as well.

As hinted before, no one enforces one to not change the variable here, except a <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/const-let-var">const declaration of the variable for primitive data structures</a>, but it's capitalized naming suggests avoiding it.</p><h2 id="javascript-naming-conventions-global-variable"><a href="#javascript-naming-conventions-global-variable" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="javascript naming conventions global variable permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>JavaScript Naming Conventions: Global Variable</h2><p>A JavaScript variable is globally defined, if all its context has access to it. Often the context is defined by the JavaScript file where the variable is declared/defined in, but in smaller JavaScript projects it may be the entire project. There are no special naming conventions for global JavaScript variables.</p><ul><li>A global JavaScript variable is declared at the top of a project/file.</li><li>A global JavaScript variable is written in camelCase if it is mutable.</li><li>A global JavaScript variable is written in UPPERCASE if it is immutable.</li></ul><h2 id="javascript-naming-conventions-underscore"><a href="#javascript-naming-conventions-underscore" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="javascript naming conventions underscore permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>JavaScript Naming Conventions: Underscore</h2><p>So what about the underscore and dash in JavaScript variable namings? Since camelCase and PascalCase are primarily considered in JS, you have seen that the underscore is only rarely used for private variables or constants. Occasionally you will find underscores when getting information from third-parties like databases or <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/what-is-an-api-javascript/">APIs</a>. Another scenario where you might see an underscore are unused function parameters, but don't worry about these yet if you haven't seen them out there ;-)</p><h2 id="javascript-naming-conventions-dash"><a href="#javascript-naming-conventions-dash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="javascript naming conventions dash permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>JavaScript Naming Conventions: Dash</h2><p>A dash in a JavaScript variable isn't common sense as well. It just makes things more difficult; like using them in an object:</p><pre><pre><p><span></span><span>var</span><span> person </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>'first-name'</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Robin'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  </span><span>'last-name'</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Wieruch'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>var</span><span> firstName </span><span>=</span><span> person</span><span>[</span><span>'first-name'</span><span>]</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>var</span><span> person </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span></span></p><p><span>  firstName</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Robin'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span>  lastName</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>'Wieruch'</span><span>,</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>}</span><span>;</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>var</span><span> firstName </span><span>=</span><span> person</span><span>.</span><span>firstName</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>It's even not possible to use a dash directly for a variable declaration:</p><pre><pre><p><span>var</span><span> first</span><span>-</span><span>name </span><span>=</span><span> </span><span>'Robin'</span><span>;</span><span></span></p></pre></pre><p>That's why it's better to avoid them.</p><h2 id="javascript-naming-conventions-files"><a href="#javascript-naming-conventions-files" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="javascript naming conventions files permalink"><svg height="0" width="0"></svg></a>JavaScript Naming Conventions: Files</h2><p>There are two strategies of naming files in JavaScript: PascalCase and kebab-case. In JavaScript frontend applications, you will often see PascalCase for naming components (e.g. React components).</p><pre><pre><p><span>-</span><span> components</span><span>/</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>--</span><span>-</span><span> user</span><span>/</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>-</span><span> UserProfile</span><span>.</span><span>js</span></p><p><span></span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>-</span><span> UserList</span><span>.</span><span>js</span></p><p><span></span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>-</span><span> UserItem</span><span>.</span><span>js</span></p><p><span></span><span>--</span><span>-</span><span> ui</span><span>/</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>-</span><span> Dialog</span><span>.</span><span>js</span></p><p><span></span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>-</span><span> Dropdown</span><span>.</span><span>js</span></p><p><span></span><span>--</span><span>--</span><span>-</span><span> Table</span><span>.</span><span>js</span></p></pre></pre><p>In contrast, in JavaScript backend application, kebab-case is the common sense:</p><pre><pre><p><span>-</span><span> routing</span><span>/</span><span></span></p><p><span></span><span>--</span><span>-</span><span> user</span><span>-</span><span>route</span><span>.</span><span>js</span></p><p><span></span><span>--</span><span>-</span><span> messages</span><span>-</span><span>route</span><span>.</span><span>js</span></p></pre></pre><p>You will also see camelCase namings, but similar to PascalCase (sorry frontend applications), there is a risk that operating systems are handling them differently which may lead to bugs. That's why sticking to kebab-case should be the norm for file names in JavaScript.</p><hr><p>If you want to learn more about JavaScript code style and formatting, which isn't discussed here for the sake of naming conventions, you should definitely check out <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/webpack-eslint/">ESLint</a> and <a itemprop="url" href="https://www.robinwieruch.de/how-to-use-prettier-vscode/">Prettier</a> for JavaScript.</p></article></div>]]>

      <p>There's a well-known quote by author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan">Michael Pollan</a>:
        "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." I like it because it doesn't
        attempt to be dogmatic: it encapsulates some basic guiding principles that get
        you 90% of the way there 90% of the time. Wikipedia describes the book the quote
        is from (emphasis mine):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He explains...the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western
          framework through which we intellectualize the value of food <strong>is more a religious
and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and
reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That...sounds familiar.</p>
      <h2 id="write-code">Write code </h2>
      <p>Code, like food, has value. I think those of us who write it can (hopefully)
        agree on that. Some, though, are so afraid of writing/eating
        <em>too much</em> that they avoid writing/eating what they should.</p>
      <p>In the context of programming, I think this translates to an unhealthy fear
        (again, for some) of duplication. A little bit of duplication - writing
        something in a way that doesn't completely maximize conciseness - isn't the end
        of the world. Sometimes it's the best path forward. Sometimes it's okay to
        copy-and-modify here and there, especially when you're still figuring out what
        your application will end up being.</p>
      <h2 id="not-too-much">Not too much </h2>
      <p>Of course too much code, like too much food, can also be a bad thing. This is
        a well-trodden topic so I don't feel the need to go too far into it here.</p>
      <p>Just be aware of your project's "appetite": write what needs to be written,
        and then try not to over-indulge.</p>
      <h2 id="mostly-functions">Mostly functions </h2>
      <p>By "functions" here I mean "pure functions". You could make a case that pure
        functions aren't the "plants" of code, though I feel
        that they are. In my experience most codebases have a pure functional
        subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly
        always a win for the long-term health of the project.</p>
      <p>Of course the qualifier is "mostly": this isn't a dogma. Writing a 100%
        functional system ("going vegan", if you will) often requires you to jump
        through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need. Looking
        at it solely from the perspective of health, those extra complications may not
        be worth it.</p>
      <p>And then different projects have different needs: just as an athlete may need
        a larger percentage of protein, or individuals may have certain nutrient
        deficiencies, a project may only have a very small functional subset, or may not
        be able to afford to return new values each time due to data size or
        performance-sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with that.</p>
      <h2 id="%22real-code%22">"Real code" </h2>
      <p>Pollan later qualifies his snappy statement a bit further:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food
          stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat
          only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have
          recognized as food.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>At the risk of stretching the analogy, maybe the equivalent is
        "code only those things that people at a junior level would recognize for what
        they do". Code in simple, straightforward terms. Don't get too clever,
        "manufacturing artificial ingredients". Use the primitives that are there, when
        possible. Write what is simple, and natural, and human.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Federated Learning (FL) is catching traction and it is now being used in several commercial applications and services. For example, Google uses it for mobile <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1812.02903.pdf">keyboard prediction</a>, while Apple uses FL to <a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2019/12/11/131629/apple-ai-personalizes-siri-federated-learning/">improve Siri</a>. In this blog post, I will first give a primer on FL by comparing it against a standard datacenter setup. Then, I'll motivate the use of Federated Learning on embedded devices and, end this blog post by providing a walk-through on how you can set up and run FL applications on embedded devices using Flower.</p><p>By the end of this post, you will understand the key difference between distributed and federated learning as well as how to apply federated learning to a real problem.</p><h2>What is Federated Learning?</h2><p>We will start by giving a brief overview of what are the unique aspects of Federated Learning (FL) and how it differs from other forms of learning such as datacenter-based distributed learning.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Distributed learning:</strong> Under this setting clients are compute nodes (e.g. a server with a few GPUs) and the dataset is controller by whoever manages the datacenter, thus it can be shuffled and balanced across clients. All clients are almost always available and typically there are 1-1000 of them. The learning process is centrally orchestrated by another server in the datacenter.</p></li><li><p><strong>Federated learning:</strong> By contrast in an FL setting, the clients are independent and often much more constrained compute nodes (e.g your smartphone) that <strong>own</strong> the data and never send it to the central server. In this way, learning happens locally in each node using their own data and, once the on-device learning stage is completed, the nodes send their updates to the central server, where the results get aggregated. Finally, the central server generates a new <em>global model</em>. The number of clients in FL can reach millions of nodes, but only a fraction of them might be available for a given round of training. The amount and quality of data might vastly differ from client to client. Because clients own the data, FL can offer privacy guarantees that aren't possible in datacenter-based learning approach where privacy is mostly based on a trust agreement.</p></li></ul><p>The diagram bellow illustrates the key differences (left: federated learning, right: classical distributed training in datacenter):</p><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-b7d6672412df666c1cc1d865dcbeb644.webp" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-3717f1fd49de4f57238436b6834188a6.webp" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-a369975bc78b7ba6d4f503b3d8e10cb0.webp" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-7742c1738e0b8935883cb64f9de350ea.webp" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-682846e2e914876775cc51a6d7971561.png" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-45202bd75244e2af964f56d786bf6834.png" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-83386a049a9605e0a6a543d8d4822645.png" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-dae913420dfe5e5ec3e868d9287fa636.png" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><img src="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/intro_diagram-dae913420dfe5e5ec3e868d9287fa636.png" alt="Intro Diagram"></picture></div></div><blockquote><p>For a more in-depth analysis of different training setups please check <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1912.04977.pdf">Advances and Open Problems in Federated Learning, Kairouz et al.

Such service only requires you to (1) install a small camera with an embedded computer inside your fridge (we'll refer to this device as a "FridgeCam") and (2) connect the device to your WiFi network. Upon installation, the FridgeCam will download a pretrained model from the server offering the service of detecting and classifying the items in your fridge.</p><p>However, this initial classification model isn't very good. The main reason being that there are not publicly available datasets that capture the wide variety of items that can be found inside a fridge as well as the different levels of occlusion, viewing angles and, illumination conditions. Because of this, the service provider offers an opt-in program for users to collaborate with the images captured by their FridgeCams and use them to build a better classification model.</p><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-3e4885cd589d501ac7a08cd83f782911.webp" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-c437da742eac9221e9c23455edfb0113.webp" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-3581e47721403c07542c3039b03b26e4.webp" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-3fb3cfc661b335b882c9e83c811bf100.webp" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-50459349e7715d687e896e0b58deb2ba.png" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-de054442d7f2ee9a0cb2e1dbb549edab.png" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-6bfab7c98cb8e339fe6099181c14f9fe.png" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-7d66966788856236c27a8003121310d1.png" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><img src="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/fridgecam_diagram-7d66966788856236c27a8003121310d1.png" alt="FridgeCam Diagram"></picture></div></div><p>Privacy is an obvious concern here. As a result, many users might not want to share the content of their fridge. For example, some might not want to share images showing alcoholic drinks, others would be worried about sharing some medication that needs to be stored in the fridge. Whatever the reason is, Federated Learning with its privacy guarantees is currently the best way of training a better global model without sharing any data with the service provider.</p><p>If a sufficiently large pool of users with their FridgeCams joins the service and, if they are willing to contribute towards the FL learning process (which will also involve some regular image annotation effort from their side), this long-awaited service of keeping track of what's on your fridge could become a reality :relieved:.</p><h2>Using Flower on Embedded Devices</h2><p>Using embedded devices as FL clients could be cumbersome as it might require substantial configuration to get the machine learning framework (e.g. PyTorch or Tensorflow) running efficiently on these devices. How can I automate this process as well as setting up the communication with the server?</p><p>With Flower you can <a href="https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/embedded_devices">run FL on embedded devices</a> after a minimal setting up process. We have dockerized the Flower clients to make the process of adding them to the FL pool of clients as seamless as possible. This means that the only requirement to use Flower clients is to install Docker in your embedded device (e.g. a Raspberry Pi). We provide a step-by-step guide on how to do this <a href="https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/main/examples/embedded_devices">here</a>. Once Docker is up and running, everything is ready to launch an FL training pipeline that trains on-device an image classification model. The following diagram illustrates the setup for this example.</p><div><div data-rmiz-wrap="visible"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-3ae27e7892c0bbcbbe3b93a3105b2881.webp" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-035688095262cea6c213a03ea8520013.webp" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-625fba5beee330cebada9a0610fbe9ac.webp" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-b3383612702a6119acde5f4640bdacd3.webp" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-0fad80335f0842adfd9fbd3ec8897e2e.png" media="(max-width: 400px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-9814f1da2d7e15c2522882f7c63f6e9c.png" media="(min-width: 401px) and (max-width: 800px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-536fd0cf9c552493921f8c656c31311b.png" media="(min-width: 801px) and (max-width: 1200px)"><source type="image/png" srcset="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-aa32a501ac7d3a407b4e1ade63e08363.png" media="(min-width: 1201px)"><img src="https://flower.dev/_next/static/chunks/images/demo_diagram-aa32a501ac7d3a407b4e1ade63e08363.png" alt="Demo Diagram"></picture></div></div><p>In the example we provide, we present a simpler scenario from what was described in the previous section using FridgeCams. Instead, we will show how to train an image classifier for <a href="https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html">CIFAR-10 dataset</a> in a Federated Learning fashion. An equivalent setup could be used to make FridgeCams a reality so, if this idea sounds exciting to you, feel free to <a href="https://flower.dev/join-slack">join our Slack channel</a> to discuss it! In the meantime, you can run our CIFAR-10 example by:</p><p>First, launch the server in your machine (i.e. your laptop) by specifying your machine's IP address, the number of FL rounds and, the model to use: </p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span># launch your server. It will be waiting until two clients connect</span><span>
</span>$ python server.py --server_address &lt;YOUR_SERVER_IP:PORT&gt; --rounds 3 --model Net
</code></pre></article></div><blockquote><p>If you have just one device around to act as a client you can still run this demo by supplying <code>--min_num_clients=1</code> and <code>--min_sample_size=1</code> when you launch the server. Please refer to this example's repository for additional details.</p></blockquote><p>Then, launch the Raspberry Pi client:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span># where `cid` is your unique client id, and `model` is the architecture to use</span><span>
</span>$ ./run_pi.sh --server_address=&lt;SERVER_ADDRESS&gt; --cid=0 --model=Net
</code></pre></article></div><p>Then, launch the Jetson client:</p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span># make sure the --cid is unique</span><span>
</span>$ ./run_jetson.sh --server_address=&lt;SERVER_ADDRESS&gt; --cid=1 --model=Net
</code></pre></article></div><p>Internally, <code>run_pi.sh</code> and <code>run_jetson.sh</code> are identical with the exception that the former pulls a Docker image with PyTorch compiled for Arm CPUs and the latter pulls another with GPU support for NVIDIA-Jetson devices. Then, the Dockerfile recipe (see below) downloads the CIFAR-10 dataset. The last stage in the Docker build process copies the two scripts needed to run the Flower Client: <code>client.py</code> and <code>utils.py</code>. </p><div><article><p>Copy</p><pre><code><span>ARG</span><span> BASE_IMAGE_TYPE=cpu

<p>In the 1850s, San Francisco experienced a massive gold rush that brought people all around the world to the city. While the rush itself came from gold deposits discovered inland in Coloma, many started their journey in San Francisco, and many settled there after the boom ended in 1855.</p>
    
<p>The Gold Rush brought fame and fortune to many, and transformed San Francisco from a town of 500 to a city of 150,000 between 1847 and 1870. Local Indigenous groups, however suffered immensely from racial violence and territorial disputes. </p>

Three alt-cities (alternative cities) for key industries are quickly emerging: finance from New York to Miami, technology from San Francisco to Austin, and music from Los Angeles to Nashville.

<p>When I took my first real management role as <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/packback-engineering">Packback’s Head of Engineering back in 2015</a>, I inherited a great team of engineers who were hired before my promotion. Later that year, when the time came for me to do some of my own hiring, I had to quickly adopt a process for finding and onboarding new software engineers.</p>
<p>I started with the framework my predecessor used and brought in some heavy influences from <em><a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/peopleware">Peopleware</a></em> and Josh Tyler’s <em><a href="https://amzn.to/1XQAfT7">Building Great Software Engineering Teams</a></em>. Over the years, I’ve refined my hiring process - mostly through trial and error - to come up with the iteration described here.</p>
<p>My approach is a little unconventional, but I hope it inspires you to think outside the box. This is going to be a long read, so I’ve broken it down into five sections:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="#the-problem-with-hiring-software-engineers">The Problem with Hiring</a></li>
<li><a href="#skills-i-look-for-in-software-engineers">Skills I Look For</a></li>
<li><a href="#how-i-find-software-engineers">How I Find Candidates</a></li>
<li><a href="#how-i-hire-software-engineers">How I Hire Engineers</a></li>
<li><a href="#mistakes-ive-made-when-hiring-software-engineers">The Mistakes I’ve Made</a></li>
</ol>
<p><em>Note: If you’re looking for some books to help you on your journey as a software engineering manager, <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/reading-for-engineering-managers">here are some of my favorites</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-problem-with-hiring-software-engineers">The Problem with Hiring Software Engineers</h2>
<p>Any <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/engineering-manager">engineering manager</a> who’s hired people in the past will tell you that it’s hard.</p>
<p>There are lots of constraints, no way to fairly compare two candidates, and suitable candidates for one team may be horrible for another. Because it’s so hard, the process has evolved to favor people who think like the interviewers, who know someone at the company, or who perform well in high-pressure interviews. It leaves people with non-traditional backgrounds struggling, often works against diverse candidates, and is nothing like the day-to-day work that most engineers do.</p>
<p>For example, a typical interview may require a phone screen with a recruiter who tests for “soft skills.” Next, an engineering manager may screen for baseline technical skills, and then the candidate may be asked to complete an independent project or come into the office for a whiteboarding session. In either case, <strong>the interview is nothing like a typical day working as an engineer</strong> (although the “take-home” project may be the closest in some environments).</p>
<p>Soft skills are important, but “tell me about a time when…” questions favor people who are quick to make things up, and they <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizryan/2014/03/04/why-i-hate-behavioral-interviewing/#7229c954693c">don’t demonstrate real judgment or problem-solving skills</a>. It’s impossible to assess someone’s character in a 30-minute phone screen, so at best, you can weed people out who are completely unreliable or have poor verbal communication skills.</p>
<p>Similarly, it’s very hard to judge a person’s technical ability in all things during a 1-hour tech screening. The field of web development (and software engineering in general) is so vast that nobody is going to match your requirements perfectly. You can ask them what technologies they’re familiar with and see if they can have a coherent conversation about technical topics, but you probably can’t bump up against the edges of all of their knowledge, especially if it doesn’t overlap with your own.</p>
<p>Finally, I’ve never done whiteboarding or live coding sessions with candidates, but <a href="https://theoutline.com/post/1166/programmers-are-confessing-their-coding-sins-to-protest-a-broken-job-interview-process">a lot of people really hate them</a>, and I think there’s a good reason for that. In the real world, programmers pushed in front of an audience to solve a problem with an obscure algorithm, no time for independent research, and no access to resources. I would never do this job if that were my day-to-day.</p>
<p>Testing programmers at something they don’t need to be good at and expecting to learn something about how they would work at your company is delusional. These kinds of interviews only serve to make the hiring team feel superior and ensure better outcomes for engineers with traditional CS backgrounds.</p>
<h2 id="skills-i-look-for-in-software-engineers">Skills I Look for in Software Engineers</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FfOzjCZ.jpg" alt="Software Engineering Skills"></p>
<p>In an effort to redesign our hiring process around the skills that actually matter in software engineering, I took the problem down to <a href="https://fpt.guide/">first principles</a>. What skills do I need in a team of software engineers?</p>
<h3 id="initiative">Initiative</h3>
<p>I have never liked micromanaging people. I remember being a team lead at a restaurant in college and getting irrationally annoyed with people who would stand around while customers were lining up at the register. “Go, take an order or something!”</p>
<p>I digress.</p>
<p>Most software engineers who are looking for a job have a certain level of initiative, but great software engineering candidates go the extra mile all the time. For example, I worked with a guy at Packback who had built a website and extremely popular Twitter account to follow the chatter on police scanners. He did all this to learn new things for fun.</p>
<p>Software engineers who take initiative don’t wait for the hiring manager to email them back, they ask about next steps, and they read about the company before they show up for an interview. It’s not really that hard, but it does take time, and very few candidates do it.</p>
<h3 id="reliability">Reliability</h3>
<p>Initiative is a start, but <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/hero-myth">I don’t want a hero</a>. I want to build a team of consistently reliable engineers who improve over time.</p>
<p>Candidates with a history of staying in jobs for a long time, strong references, and commitment to projects usually make it to the top of my list when hiring.</p>
<h3 id="competency">Competency</h3>
<p>When I was a new engineering manager, I over-indexed on technical skills. It’s easy to fall into the trap of grading engineers based purely on their technical knowledge, but arcane trivia does not make a sound engineer.</p>
<p>I’ll talk more about how I gauge a candidate’s competency later in this post, but the key question I ask is, <strong>do I think this engineer can learn to solve the problems we are facing?</strong></p>
<p>It’s not about whether they know all the answers on day one, but instead, I look for curious people who are lifelong learners with a drive to improve themselves. If they have that, I’ll find a way to get them the information they need to succeed in this role.</p>
<h3 id="interest-in-the-mission">Interest in the Mission</h3>
<p>I used to call this “passion,” but after a <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/podcasts/exceptions-welcome/building-a-resilient-career-dea4tx69g32/">lively conversation on the Exceptions Welcome podcast</a> I decided to rebrand this skill.</p>
<p>Ultimately, I only want to hire software engineers who care about our industry, the problems we’re solving, and the method we’re using to get there. If we aren’t pointing in the same direction before they join, I don’t want to spend the first six weeks convincing them.</p>
<p>While I don’t want unquestioning loyalty or people who live at the office, I do think it’s important that software engineers are actually interested in the work they will be doing. It’ll make them happier, and that positivity rubs off on everyone.</p>
<h2 id="how-i-find-software-engineers">How I Find Software Engineers</h2>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/bTlxNvy.jpg" alt="Finding Software Engineers"></p>
<p>I’ve used several methods for finding and recruiting software engineers over the years. While I don’t have a ton of data to back up these methods, here’s what I’ve found works for me.</p>
<h3 id="job-listings">Job Listings</h3>
<p>Job listings are the <em><a href="https://unbounce.com/landing-page-articles/what-is-a-landing-page/">landing page</a></em> for job hunters.</p>
<p>A compelling job listing should outline the tools and languages the candidate should know, the projects the candidate will work on, and as much information about day-to-day expectations as is reasonable. I try to make job listings interesting and creative, so I typically use a GitHub repository with lots of information about our team, our company, and the job interview process (<a href="https://github.com/thegraidenetwork/job-openings">here’s an example of the repo I set up for The Graide Network</a>).</p>
<p>Remember that you won’t just share this listing with candidates. You’ll also be emailing it out to everyone in your network, sharing it on social media, and linking to it from your website. It’s a public-facing document that should be good looking and functional.</p>
<h3 id="networking">Networking</h3>
<p>I’ve never paid money to promote a job listing, but I doubt it’s worth it, and here’s why:</p>
<p><strong>The best software engineers are never <em>actively</em> looking for a job on job boards.</strong></p>
<p>They’re locked away behind gatekeepers called “their network,” which includes former managers and coworkers, friends, and people who know them from professional organizations. They jump ship when someone they trust tells them about a great opportunity or when they decide to ask around. Senior software engineers often laugh about how many Linkedin messages we get from naive recruiters.</p>
<p>So, what’s the trick to building a network full of software engineers?</p>
<p>Time.</p>
<p>People are surprised when I tell them that <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/the-key-to-networking-keeping-in-touch">I spend 4-8 hours per week building and maintaining my network</a>, but the dividends on that investment have been enormous. Whenever I have a new job opening, I write up a job listing and start passing it around. I keep a huge list of people I’d like to work with someday, so I go through it and find an excuse to get lunch.</p>
<p>If you’re not actively building your network right now, start <a href="https://ctocraft.com/blog/how-to-use-writing-to-build-a-solid-talent-pipeline/">writing</a>, <a href="https://www.karllhughes.com/posts/speaking-guide">speaking</a>, and taking meetings with interesting people. It’s the best investment you can make in your career.</p>
<h3 id="cold-outreach">Cold Outreach</h3>
<p>Another unpopular recruiting tool for finding software engineers is cold outreach. I’ve found that it can work, but you have to be careful. It’s easy to come off as spammy or annoying.</p>
<p>Treat cold outreach as an excuse to grow your network rather than jumping straight to “the ask.” Reach out to people, ask them genuine questions; do some research on their background; get to know them. You’re just having a conversation, and eventually, you might slide in a mention that you’re keeping an eye out for software engineers.</p>
<p>End each call by asking if you can follow up in a few months and (shocker!) actually do it. I’ve met some outstanding people this way, even if we never ended up working together.</p>
<h3 id="recruiters">Recruiters</h3>
<p>Recruiters get a bad name in the software engineering world because they can be pretty annoying. I’ve had junior recruiters cold call me at work or send job requests to my company email. Not a good look.</p>
<p>On the flip side, there are a few well-networked and honest tech recruiters out there. Just be ready to pay big bucks as the best likely work on a <a href="https://theundercoverrecruiter.com/contingency-vs-retained-recruiters-what-difference/">retainer rather than contingency</a>.</p>
<p>Even if you do get a recruiter, you need to keep recruiting too. If your recruiter doesn’t have any luck, you don’t want all your leads to dry up with them.</p>

Is there a correlation between business performance and Page Speed performance? What else might we find?</p><p>Using Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">PageSpeed Insights API</a> and 2020 Fortune 500 data, we compiled what we’re calling “The Performance 500”.</p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17qQh1zKpa5qwNBzXcCgkVbsy-YMHV0DB_doNgktcp8M/edit?usp=sharing"><picture><source srcset="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-performance-500-chart.avif" type="image/avif"><source srcset="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-performance-500-chart.webp" type="image/webp"><img src="https://reachlightspeed.com/img/blog/post-performance-500-chart.jpg" width="768" loading="lazy" alt="The Performance 500 (Google Sheets)"></picture></a></p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17qQh1zKpa5qwNBzXcCgkVbsy-YMHV0DB_doNgktcp8M/edit?usp=sharing">The Performance 500</a></p><h3>And the Winner Is</h3><p>You’ll notice a recognizable name in first place for the Performance 500: <a href="https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/">Berkshire Hathaway</a>. Its Chairman and CEO, Warren Buffet, famous for continuing to live in the same house he purchased in 1958, bested even Google’s parent company in page speed performance using a simple HTML site with minimal resources to deliver content.

We preferred this ranking order as FID is not assigned a weight in <a href="https://web.dev/performance-scoring/#lighthouse-6">Google’s weighting of the performance score</a>.</p><h3>Color Coding</h3><p>We chose to use the green, yellow and red labels using the same color coding scheme used by Page Speed Insights. These vary by metric and can be found in the <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/docs/insights/v5/about#categories">PageSpeed Insights documentation</a>.</p><h3>Device Type</h3><p>We also chose to only show the mobile rankings of these sites.

<p>In 2013 I decided to quit my career in astrophysics, move back “home” and become a data scientist. The <a href="http://www.marcelhaas.com/index.php/2018/03/30/leaving-the-field-becoming-an-extronomer/">blog post</a> I wrote about my decision was probably my best read publication as a professional astronomer and it was moving to read all the reactions from people who were struggling with similar decisions. I meant every word in that blog post and I still agree with most of what I said. Now, 7 years after the fact, it is time to confess: I deeply regret quitting.</p>



<p>This post is meant to give my point of view. Many people who left academia are very happy that they did. Here I present some arguments why one might not want to leave, which I hope will be of help for people facing decisions like these.</p>



<p><span>I miss being motivated.</span> In the first few years after jumping ship many people asked me why I would ever wanted to <em>not</em> be a professional astronomer. I have always said that my day-to-day work wasn’t too different, except that what I did with data was about financial services or some other business I was in, rather than about galaxies and the Universe, but that the “core activities” of work were quite similar. That is kind of true. On an hour by hour basis, often I’m just writing (Python) code to figure things out or build a useful software product. The motivation to do what you do, though, is very <em>very</em> different. The duty cycle and technical depth of projects are short and shallow and the emphasis of projects is much more on getting working products than on understanding. I am doing quite well (in my own humble opinion), but it is hard to get satisfaction out of my current job.</p>



<p><img loading="lazy" width="546" height="340" src="http://www.marcelhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/academic_hat.png" alt="" srcset="http://www.marcelhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/academic_hat.png 546w, http://www.marcelhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/academic_hat-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 546px) 100vw, 546px"></p>



<p><span>I miss academic research.</span> The seeds of astronomy were planted at very young age (8, if I remember correctly). The fascination for the wonders of the cosmos has changed somewhat in nature while growing up but hasn’t faded. Being at the forefront of figuring things out about the workings of the Universe is amazing, and unparalleled in any business setting. Having the freedom to pick up new techniques that may be useful for your research is something that happened to me only sporadically after the academic years. The freedom to learn and explore are valuable for creative and investigative minds and it doesn’t fit as well in most business settings that I have seen.</p>



<p><span>I miss working at academic institutions.</span> The vibe of being at a large research institute, surrounded by people who are intrinsically motivated to do what they do was of great value to me. Having visitors over from around the globe with interesting, perhaps related work was a big motivator. That journal clubs, coffee discussions, lunch talks, colloquiums etc. are all “part of the job” is something that even most scientists don’t always seem to fully appreciate. Teaching, at the depth of university level classes, as a part of the job is greatly rewarding (I do teach nowadays!).</p>



<p><span>I miss passion and being proud of what I do.</span> The <a href="https://www.google.nl/search?hl=nl&amp;q=sexiest+job+of+the+21st+century">internet </a>says I have ”the sexiest job of the 21<sup>st</sup> century”, but I think my previous job was more enjoyable to brag about at birthday parties. I can do astro as a hobby, but that simply doesn’t give you enough time to do something substantial enough.</p>



<p><span>I don’t miss …</span> Indeed, the academic career also had its downsides. There is strong competition and people typically experience quite some pressure to achieve. The culture wasn’t always very healthy and diversity and equality are in bad shape in academia. Success criteria of your projects and of you as a person are typically better motivated in business. The obligatory nomadic lifestyle that you are bound to have as an early career scientist were a very enjoyable and educational experience, but it can easily become a burden on your personal life. The drawbacks and benefits of any career path will balance out differently for everybody. If you get to such a point, don’t take the decision lightly.</p>



<div><figure><img loading="lazy" src="http://www.marcelhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/decision.png" alt="" width="89" height="89" srcset="http://www.marcelhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/decision.png 200w, http://www.marcelhaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/decision-150x150.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 89px) 100vw, 89px"></figure></div>



<p>The people who questioned my decision to become an extronomer were right. I was wrong. It seems too late to get back in. I think I have gained skills and experience that can be very valuable to the astronomical community, but I know that that is simply not what candidates for academic positions are selected on. On top of that, being geographically bound doesn’t help. At least I will try to stay close to the field and who knows what might once cross my path.</p>

December 16, 2020 | https://www.farfetchtechblog.com/en/blog/post/a-year-s-worth-of-learnings-from-adopting-mob-programming/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://www.farfetchtechblog.com/en/blog/post/a-year-s-worth-of-learnings-from-adopting-mob-programming/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At FARFETCH, teams are encouraged to try new development methodologies so that they can deliver even better results while also improving productivity. As a fairly new team, we have continuously been looking for different methodologies that best fit our needs, such as avoiding knowledge silos or a slow-paced reviewing process. Although not every approach that we have tried has worked, the ones that did are now part of our daily development workflow and play a key role in the outcome of the tasks that we deliver.</p><p>A year ago, our team was first introduced to <a href="https://mobprogramming.org/" target="_blank">Mob Programming</a>, and we have been using it since then. The concept that was once hard to fathom is now the go-to approach when dealing with most of our sprint tasks. Although being able to use Mob Programming daily has come with many different types of challenges, the results have been surprisingly good.&nbsp;</p><p>When using Mob Programming, instead of having each team element working on its own task, the whole team gathers together to tackle the same task. It includes using a single workstation and only one person typing - <span>the Driver</span> - while the remaining people are describing the path that should be taken.</p><blockquote><p><span>Itâ€™s a software development approach where the whole team works on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer. - Woody Zuill (2014)</span></p></blockquote><p>Mob Programming is somewhat similar to Pair Programming. While the latter consists of having two team members sharing the same workstation, Mob Programming goes a bit further and implies having the entire team focused on a single task. Even though Pair Programming is a great tool to share knowledge, improve communication and even bring better outcomes (as a consequence of having multiple people thinking about the same problem), it confines these advantages to only two elements on a team. On the other hand, Mob Programming can amplify these benefits to the whole team.</p><p>Yet, having an entire team working on the same problem brings its own challenges. It's imperative that the team establishes a set of well-defined procedures and rules. Furthermore, Mob Programming may not be suitable for all kinds of tasks or teams. Depending on the task the team is tackling, it should first be established whether Mob, Pair or Solo Programming is the appropriate methodology. None of the three is suitable for all situations. It's up to the teams to give them a try and figure out when to use them.</p><p>A typical Mob Programming setup consists of moving the team to an isolated space (e.g. a meeting room) and bringing one computer that should be connected to either a large monitor or a projector. Having a whiteboard to write down possible solutions and describe the next steps is great to empower collaborative brainstorming. Seats and tables for everyone is a must, as everyone should be comfortable during the session, this is particularly relevant as these sessions tend to be time-consuming. Since the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic, we have adapted our ways of working to facilitate Remote Mob Programming sessions - but more to come on that later.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://www.farfetchtechblog.com/fotos/editor2/Dinis_Peixoto/Image_01.png" alt=""></p><p>Two key roles must be considered when using Mob Programming: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the person at the keyboard, responsible for moving the codebase forward. The Navigator understands what the group has decided to aim for and provides instructions to the Driver. The Navigator shouldn't dictate the actual code that the Driver has to write down, only the expected solution. Sometimes, the Navigator role may not be needed. It is up to the Driver to opt-in or out. Nonetheless, when there's no Navigator, the Driver may get lost by having multiple people explaining what to do. These roles should rotate between all team members at regular intervals (usually monitored by a timer).</p><p>The session should be held continuously until the task is done. Quick breaks, like coffee or bathroom, are allowed and shouldn't require the session to stop. Some longer breaks like lunch must be agreed between the team so that everyone does it at the same time to prevent distractions and absences.</p><div><p>The first thing that may come to one's mind is that Mob Programming jeopardizes the team's overall productivity. After all, having an entire team working on the same task certainly means that both the team's velocity and throughput will be compromised, right?</p></div><div><p>More often than not, people tend to forget that delivering a task includes a lot more than just writing code. It's common that most of the time spent on a particular task is on coming up with the right solution or waiting for the team to review what was done. In our case, each task requires approval from 3 different people, which implies that they stop what they are doing, get up to speed, and finally review the result.</p></div><div><p>When using a development workflow like Solo Programming, once a developer puts the task up for review, the team has to understand all the requirements and review what was done, while also trying to identify what was the problem-solving process that the author took. The fact that the team has to go through someone elseâ€™s work without being completely aware of the decisions behind the proposed solution might take longer and prevent some mistakes from being identified.</p></div><p>Whereas when using Mob Programming, taking advantage of insights and knowledge from the whole team may lead to the task being delivered quicker while also with a better solution. When it comes to the review process, it will also be straightforward as everyone owns the decisions that were made and the solution path that was taken.&nbsp;</p><p>We have been using Mob Programming for over a year. Over this period, we have been trying to refine our methodology so that we can make the most out of our sessions. Some of the phases that have improved our workflow are described below.</p><ol><li><span>Task scouting:</span> each team member should, individually, check the task details prior to the session. Investing time on exploring the task beforehand will considerably shorten the time required on the next phase.</li><li><span>Purpose clarification: </span>at the beginning of the session, someone should present the problem at hand and make sure that everyone has a clear grasp of what the team is trying to achieve. Any questions about the purpose of the task should be raised at this time.</li><li><span>Work breakdown:</span> with the purpose of clarified, it's now time to identify the work blocks that have to be monitored during the session. The different tasks that result from this analysis should be prioritized and can be split into even smaller tasks if needed.</li><li><span>Execution:</span> based on the tasks identified previously, the team must try to work on each task by following the agreed order. The team should expect new tasks to surface throughout the session. If it happens, the order of the tasks can be adjusted.</li><li><span>Debriefing:</span> at the end of the session, the team will need to look at the initially defined tasks and check if everything was tackled. The solution should be carefully reviewed together before submitting it for team review. It's highly recommended to provide some time for an individual review to address groupthink problems.</li></ol><p>Equally important are the rules that our team has defined so far. Periodically, we revisit them and discuss whether or not some updates are required. Trying to make this an iterative process is extremely important to enhance the overall experience of our Mob Programming sessions over time.</p><ol><li><span>Driving/navigation time:</span> each team member will be in the Driver/Navigator role for 15 minutes. If a discussion comes up, the timer should stop so that both the Driver and Navigator can participate.</li><li><span>Complete focus on the session:</span> everyone in the room has to be focused on the session. If someone needs to work on something else, they must leave the room to avoid distracting the team.</li><li><span>Mandatory and optional breaks:</span> there are three mandatory breaks where the session must be stopped: morning coffee, lunch and afternoon coffee. Additional breaks are allowed but should be minimized to reduce the impact on focus. These sessions are very demanding on every team member so, if one cannot focus on the current tasks, taking a break is completely acceptable.</li><li><span>Research time:</span> whenever research is required, it should be done primarily by the Driver with the help of the team. Parallel research streams are allowed, as long as the team is aware of them.</li><li><span>Identify Mob Programming tasks ahead of time:</span> we always try to decide upon whether a specific task is going to be tackled through Mob Programming or not. It facilitates any coordination required during our sprint.</li></ol><p>Due to the COVID-19 global pandemic, we had a new challenge ahead of us: <a href="https://www.remotemobprogramming.org/" target="_blank">Remote Mob Programming</a>. As a consequence, we had to go through the rules above and update them as a means to adapt to the reality of having the whole team working remotely.</p><ol><li><span>Driving/navigation time:</span> this should be increased, in our case, we adjusted it to 45 minutes, due to the extra work required when changing the Driver (e.g. setting up the environment, sync with git's remote repository). It might take up to 5 minutes and wouldn't be worth it to do it every 15 minutes.</li><li><span>Video sharing:</span> everyone should keep the camera on during the session and, when possible, look directly at it. Itâ€™s as close as we can get to face-to-face interaction.</li><li><span>Driver handover:</span> every time a Driver handover is required, the current Driver has to ensure that changes made during their turn are properly committed and pushed to the remote repository. To have a better sense of the changes and their history, usually, the Driver's name is kept on the commit description.</li></ol><p>When it comes to the tools that we use during our mob sessions, it depends on if we are doing it in-person or remotely. When having in-person sessions, the only tool that we make use of is <a href="https://github.com/dillonkearns/mobster" target="_blank">Mobster</a>, which allows us to keep track of the Driver timer, the active and next up Drivers.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="page"><div id="content"><section id="primary"><main id="main" role="main"><article id="post-622"><div><p><a href="https://gnome.org/">The GNOME project</a> turned 23 this year, and despite equally persistent rumors to the contrary, it’s still alive and kicking.</p><p>Just how alive, though? All I know is this: Where the topic of GNOME’s health goes, accurate data rarely follows. Of course, there <em>is</em> data — lots of it in fact, in public source code repositories. Though flawed in many ways, it allows us to make comparisons to the past — and maybe predictions for the future: Are a few organizations carrying most of the workload, making them critical points of failure? Are new contributors able to pick up the slack from those who leave? Is the project graying (i.e. increasingly dominated by veterans)?</p><p>In one of my occasional fits of hubris, I set out to process this data to see if I could shake out anything meaningful. I’m usually fine with just satisfying my own curiosity and leaving it at that, but it’s one of those times where the results seem interesting enough for a blog post. So here we are.</p><p>I’m going to lead with the nice graphs and follow on with a <a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/2020/12/16/on-the-graying-of-gnome/#methodology">section on methodology</a>. The latter is long, boring, and mandatory reading.</p><h2 id="contributors">Active contributors</h2><h3>By generation</h3><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per year, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-year-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>The stacked histogram above shows the number of contributors who touched the project on a yearly basis. Each contributor is assigned to a generational cohort based on the year of their first contribution. The cohorts tend to shrink over time as people leave.</p><p>There’s a special “drive-by” cohort (in a fetching shade of off-white) for contributors who were only briefly involved, meaning all their activity fits in a three-month window. It’s a big group. In a typical year, it numbers 200-400 persons who were not seen before or since. Most of them contribute a single commit.</p><p>According to this, GNOME peaked at slightly above 1,400 contributors in 2010 and went into decline with the GNOME 3.0 release the following year. However, 2020 saw the most contributors in a long time, even with preliminary data — there’s still two weeks to go. Who knows if it’s an anomaly or not. It’s been an atypical year across the board.</p><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per month, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-firstyear-month-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>This is the same histogram, but with per-month bins. There’s a clear periodicity caused by the semiannual release cycle. The peak month was March 2011, right before the <a href="https://www.gnome.org/press/2011/04/gnome-3-0-released-better-for-users-developers-3/">GNOME 3.0 release</a>. About 450 contributors got involved that month.</p><p>The drive-by cohort is relatively smaller on a monthly basis. This makes sense, as it has little overlap from month to month, and the per-year bins tend to add them all up.</p><h3>By affiliation</h3><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Active GNOME authors per year, top-15 domain cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-authors-domain-year-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>Above, the top 15 affiliations of active contributors. I’ve excluded personal accounts. This is pretty flawed (details below), but interesting nonetheless. For what it’s worth, it mostly lines up with my memory of things.</p><p>The pattern tracks well with the total despite only capturing a minority portion of it. I think this means that paid and unpaid contributions are driven by the same underlying trends, or that there’s a lot of the former hiding in the latter.</p><h2 id="commitcount">Commit count</h2><h3>By generation</h3><figure><a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020.png"><img loading="lazy" width="1920" height="900" src="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png" alt="Number of GNOME commits per year, first-year cohorts" srcset="https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-1920x900.png 1920w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-300x141.png 300w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-768x360.png 768w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-1536x720.png 1536w, https://hpjansson.org/blag/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/gnome-commits-firstyear-year-2020-2048x960.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px"></a></figure><p>Here I’m counting the number of commits per year in the various cohorts.</p><p>At first glance, this looks much less dire.

It’s safe to say that GNOME is dependent on paid developers in a big way. Specifically, and to no one’s surprise, it leans heavily on Red Hat.</p><h2 id="observations">General observations</h2><p>A few observations can be made with confidence:</p><ul><li>By F/OSS standards, the project is not <em>un</em>healthy. It has hundreds of experienced and first-time contributors every year. It is well-organized and arguably well-funded compared to its peers. But:</li><li>Every metric has the project peaking around 2010.</li><li>A diminishing number of veterans is doing an increasing share of the work.</li><li>Although recruitment is stable, newcomers don’t seem to be hitting their stride in terms of commits.</li><li>Corporate sponsorship is probably necessary to keep the project going, but the field of sponsors has kept thinning.</li></ul><p>I think GNOME is addressing the risk factors competently by modernizing infrastructure (<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/">GitLab</a>, <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/">Discourse</a>). This has obvious value even in the absence of quantifiable results, but it’ll be interesting to see if the effect can be measured over the next couple of years.</p><p>Diminished enthusiasm may also be due to there being fewer ways for a new contributor to make their mark or assume a role of responsibility. GNOME has become more conservative, certainly much more so than it was a decade ago in the run-up to GNOME 3. The rationale and phrasing in <a href="https://discourse.gnome.org/t/new-gnome-versioning-scheme/4235">the announcement of the new versioning scheme</a> (e.g. <em>“Radical technological and design changes are too disruptive for maintainers, users, and developers”</em>) seems indicative of this trend<sup>1</sup>.</p><h2 id="methodology">Notes on methodology</h2><p>So what’s wrong with this analysis? If you’re so inclined, you can find the details under the next couple of subheadings and pass harsh, harsh judgement.</p><p>I’ve set the unscientific rigor bar high enough to hopefully yield something useful, but low enough that I could do it in my spare time and not get stuck in the dreaded state commonly known as “90% done”.</p><h3>Module selection</h3><p>I aggregated data from <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-repos">189 Git repositories</a>. The vast majority of these are hosted on <code>gnome.org</code>, with a handful from <code>freedesktop.org</code> and <code>github.com</code>. Commits are uniquely identified by their commit hash, meaning trivial duplicates are counted only once.</p><p>GNOME has always been a decentralized, big-tent project, so it’s not obvious how to delineate it. I’ve tried to be fair by including most of the repositories from a full meta-gnome-desktop jhbuild, including fairly low-level dependencies like Cairo, Pango, and Pipewire, as well as past, present and would-be flagship applications under the GNOME umbrella. Documentation and infrastructure is represented, as are many archived projects (e.g. ORBit2, Bonobo, Sabayon, GAL).</p><p>I was a little uncertain about what to do with X.Org and Wayland. In the end I decided to include the latter, but not the former, since Wayland has close ties to GNOME (it even references GTK+ in its TODO file), while X.Org has its roots in the much older XFree86.</p><p>Mono is another project I resisted including; its development was tangential to GNOME proper, diverging completely in the most recent decade. However, I did include GtkSharp and several GNOME-hosted C# applications common on desktops in the 2005-2010 time frame.</p><p>Since I haven’t established hard criteria for module selection, it’s subject to various biases. Older code is probably underrepresented, since providers of important functionality were more loosely attached to the project early on (e.g. GNOME Online Accounts and Telepathy got pulled in, should I have included Gaim or Pidgin too? How about XChat?).</p><p>Anyway, the list isn’t terrible, but there’s room for improvement.</p><h3>Contributor identities</h3><p>Similar studies often identify contributors by their e-mail addresses. I used full author names instead, since there’s good reason to think they’re more stable over a 20-year time span. We’re fairly consistent in spelling our own names, and we change them rarely (often never). On the other hand, e-mail addresses come and go with different hosting arrangements, employers, etc.</p><p>An added challenge with this approach is that sometimes different people have the exact same name. In practice, I’m not aware of any instances of this happening in GNOME. It seems to be rare enough that I doubt it’d introduce significant error in most projects.</p><p>I should add here that the drive-by cohort depends on a fair amount of hindsight (you never know when someone might come back with more contributions, but the likelihood drops off quickly as time passes). This means the cohorts for 2020 are preliminary. They’ll be a lot more accurate with another run late next year.</p><h3>Domain names</h3><p>I’m using e-mail domain names as a proxy for organizations in some of the graphs. This is a notoriously unreliable approach for at least three reasons:</p><ol><li>Contributors often use personal e-mail addresses for paid work, leading to significant undercounting in general.</li><li>Specific companies may require their employees (or ask them nicely) to use company e-mail for collaboration. Out of the listed companies, I know of at least one that definitely did this. However, there are many that don’t, and these will be comparatively less well represented.</li><li>The mapping between DNS and organizations isn’t one-to-one. A company may operate under multiple names or TLDs (e.g. <code>.co.uk</code> and <code>.com</code>).</li></ol><p>Despite these weaknesses, it’s common to slice the data this way. It’s difficult to do better without access to semi-closed data troves, and depending on your views on privacy and ability to handle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_data">PII</a> safely, it might not be something you’d want to get into anyway. But I bet you’d be well-positioned for it if you were, say, the corporate owner of both LinkedIn and GitHub.</p><p>When grouping by organization, the goal is to get an idea of which outside entities are sponsoring contributions. Therefore, I’ve filtered out addresses from the biggest mass e-mail providers like <code>@gmail.com</code> and project-centric providers of personal accounts (e.g. <code>@gnome.org</code>, <code>@gtk.org</code>).</p><p>I took the liberty of reassigning the personal domains of a few extra prolific authors who would’ve otherwise showed up as individual organizations. Since there’s no way I’m doing it for everyone, this introduces some bias. The full details are in <a href="https://github.com/hpjansson/fornalder/blob/45d4e9703dfa1fed1f9396b2cfc6f8425fae9389/projects/gnome-meta.json">the project’s metadata file</a> (see: <a href="https://hpjansson.org/blag/2020/12/16/on-the-graying-of-gnome/#code">code</a>).</p><h3>Version control systems</h3><p>Changeovers in version control systems divide GNOME’s VCS history into three eras with noticeable discontinuities between them.</p><h4>Before 1998: Dark ages</h4><p>In the Bad Old Days, Free Software would often use plain <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_Control_System">RCS</a> or no version control at all. I have basically no data for this era: The GIMP, being the ur-project from which …</p></div></article></main></section></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The global pandemic changed everything in 2020. Now it is going to change everything forever. This is part of "The Future of" series, in which BNN Bloomberg looks at what is next for our transformed economy and daily lives.</em></p>

<p>Before the COVID-19 pandemic, Max Zhu had what can only be described as a hellish commute. It started with a 10-minute drive from his Oshawa, Ont., home to the local commuter GO-Train station, then a 70-minute (if there were no delays) train ride to Torontoâ€™s Exhibition station, and finally a 10-minute walk to the Liberty Village offices of First Capital where he works as a senior financial analyst. Thatâ€™s an hour-and-a-half of travel each way from Monday to Friday â€” or a total of 15 hours in transit per week.</p>

<p>Working from home over the past nine months, Zhu says heâ€™s been happy to have those hours back and would like to continue the arrangement post-pandemic â€” but only on a part-time basis. He misses the water-cooler chat and collaboration that can only take place face-to-face, but would prefer to return to the office only two or three days a week.&nbsp;â€œWe had so many get-togethers and industry working groups where all this expertise could come together in one place and we could bounce ideas off each other â€” it was incredible,â€� says the 26-year-old Chartered Professional Accountant. â€œThat made the long commute worth it.â€�</p>

<p>Zhuâ€™s perspective reveals one of the major long-lasting changes expected to come out of the pandemic. While thereâ€™s still a need for workers to be physically present for the purposes of problem-solving and innovation, the days of everyone rushing into the city en masse at the same time each morning â€” only to sit in front of a computer or attend progress update meetings â€” are over.<br>
&nbsp;</p>



<p>â€œThatâ€™s a waste of time and energy on both the part of the employee and the employer,â€� says Richard Florida, a professor at the University of Torontoâ€™s Rotman School of Management and School of Cities, and one of the worldâ€™s leading urban theorists. â€œThe whole idea of separating work from home, the way we did in the industrial revolution, and enduring long commutes is starting to finally at long last decline.â€� He expects about 20 per cent of the workforce to continue to work from home full time post-pandemic, with another 30 per cent telecommuting part of the week.</p>

<p>Instead of the usual rat race, people will only come into the city when it provides an experience they canâ€™t get at home.&nbsp;â€œJust like retail has been transformed into an experience, the office will have to be transformed into an experience, in order to get people back into the office,â€� Florida says.</p>

<p>But the coming farewell to the harried commute downtown for all workers five days a week wonâ€™t only be felt within the walls of Canadaâ€™s urban workplaces. This shift will also usher in a transformation to our cities as a whole, allowing for more affordable housing, walkable neighbourhoods, multi-use public spaces and repurposed transportation routes. Here are the trends to watch.<br>

        <p>Banff Mayor Karen Sorenson joins BNN Bloomberg and says Alberta's new COVID-19 restrictions will be challenging to Banff but that mandating outdoor mask wearing downtown, creating winter pedestrian zones and opening more skating rinks are creative ways in which they are trying to keep the community safe.</p>

<p>Many urban experts, including Florida, expect the shift to working from home will reduce demand for office space in central business districts. But that could be a good thing for cities. â€œMany of those office towers can be turned into much-needed affordable housing,â€� he says. â€œInstead of being a 9-to-5 neighborhood, it can be a 24/7 neighbourhood.â€�</p>

<p>That sounds great to Zhu, who wouldnâ€™t hesitate to move to Toronto if he could afford it. He likes the concept of a 15-minute neighbourhood â€” in which shops, restaurants and services are all within a short walk or bike ride from where residents live and work. â€œWhere I live in Oshawa, Iâ€™d have to drive 20 minutes just to get to the gym,â€� he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Itâ€™s still unclear, however, whether a decline in demand for urban office space will truly come to pass. According to PwCâ€™s Emerging Trends in Real Estate 2021, thereâ€™s a fair bit of uncertainty about what commercial tenants will do long term. Some predict that everything will go back to the way it was pre-pandemic, while others expect a renewed interest in suburban office development, as some employees look to work closer to home.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That, in turn, would help create 15-minute neighbourhoods in suburbs, which have typically been a place where people live but not work. â€œOne can see a lot of those old, abandoned office parks and malls turned into much better versions of co-worker spaces, restaurants, cafÃ©s and workout facilities,â€� says Florida.</p>

<p>Right now, however, tenants are hedging their bets by taking short-term leases on office space, says Frank Magliocco, national real estate leader at PwC Canada. Magliocco also expects there will be a structural change in the way commercial real estate is used. â€œEmployers are going to take a hard look at their offices and ask themselves what role that space should serve going forward,â€� he says.</p>

<p><img alt="Embedded Image" height="349" src="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1536946!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/default/the-future-of-cities-working-from-home.png" width="640"></p>

<h2><strong>MORE COLLABORATIVE WORKPLACES</strong></h2>

<p><br>
Tonya Surman, CEO of the Centre for Social Innovation, says she thinks the office of the future will resemble the co-working model her organization first brought to Canada 15 years ago, which companies like WeWork have since taken mainstream.</p>

<p>â€œCommunity is going to become even more important,â€� she says. Smaller employers, in particular, will downsize but maintain enough space so staff can come in a few times a week, hold meetings, train staff and reconnect.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong><em>â€œThe whole idea of separating work from home, the way we did in the industrial revolution, and enduring long commutes is starting to finally at long last decline.â€�</em></strong></h2>

<p><br>
Florida agrees office designs will have more of a focus on common spaces and collaboration. â€œThe office as workspace â€” where you have a desk or a cubicle â€” will give way to the office as meeting space or interaction space,â€� he says, adding that there will be spaces for people to work out, do yoga or meditate, and more outdoor spaces for people to congregate.</p>

<p>And for those whose employer decides to go completely virtual or move to the suburbs to avoid the high cost of downtown commercial real estate, niche third-party co-working spaces such as CSI will fill the void, says Surman. Where CSI provides networking and business development opportunities for individuals who want to make the world better, other co-working spaces will become networking hubs for communities with other personal or professional interests, she says.<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>DEDICATED PUBLIC SPACES</strong></h2>

<div contenteditable="false" data-video-custom-description="" data-video-custom-title="" id="video-1536764-1608132387576-wrapper">

                    
                    

        

        

        

        <p>Growth to be driven by skilled people from around the world reaching their goals in Canada: CIBC CEO </p>
        <p>Victor Dodig, president and CEO of CIBC, joins BNN Bloomberg to discuss his business leadership style as the bank continues to navigate through the pandemic. Dodig also speaks to what he believes is needed to stimulate economic growth in Canada. </p>
            
</div>

<p>An end to the rat race commute could also lead to a permanent change in the way roads are used. With less traffic coming into the city, some road space could be dedicated to bike lanes, wider sidewalks for pedestrians, or additional outdoor dining, as was the case during the pandemic.</p>

<p>â€œThis could be done in a flexible manner, where the space is not permanent or fixed but reallocated depending on the day or time of day,â€� says Lawrence Frank, an affiliate professor at UBC's School of Community and Regional Planning and the School of Population and Public Health, and president of Urban Design 4 Health.</p>

<p>He even imagines a scenario in which municipalities designate specific commuting days â€” say, Tuesday through Thursday â€” and offer tax incentives to employers who demonstrate a reduction in their commuter base to maintain lower traffic levels.</p>

<p>â€œWhen itâ€™s a commute day, certain streets will have to be cleared for traffic and movement of goods. On weekends, high streets could get blocked off from traffic and be set up for pedestrians and urban living. On shoulder days, maybe there would be a kind of hybrid.â€�<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<h2><strong>TRANSIT MOVES LOCAL</strong></h2>

<p><br>
Public transit will be less about moving workers on a nine-to-five schedule from the suburbs to downtown office centres, and more about moving people between different kinds of activities within their neighbourhoods, says Florida.&nbsp; Even so, he expects that fears about the health risks of riding public transit will linger. â€œTransit will be an issue for a long time even post-vaccine,â€� he says.&nbsp;</p>

<p><img alt="Embedded Image" height="349" src="https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/polopoly_fs/1.1536947!/fileimage/httpImage/image.png_gen/derivatives/default/the-future-of-cities-transit-recovery.png" width="640"></p>

<p>Research by the University of Toronto Transportation Research Institute indicates a more optimistic view. In an online survey of 2,753 adults who rode public transit in Toronto at least twice a week pre-COVID, but stopped using the service during the outbreak, 87 per cent said they will come back once theyâ€™ve been vaccinated, and 100 per cent will return once the crisis is declared over. But because ridership has fallen drastically during the pandemic, public transit systems like the TTC that rely on fares for the bulk of revenue may not have the resources to return full force when riders are ready, says Frank.</p>

<p>â€œWill transit be there when the demand returns? And if service is poor â€” if itâ€™s too crowded and people canâ€™t get a seat â€” they might lose ridership permanently,â€� he says.</p>

<p>That, of course, would be disastrous for Zhu and others who rely on regional transit to get downtown â€” even if theyâ€™d only be making that commute two or three …</p></div></div>

              <p>In November 2020, DAGsHub gave a series of guest lectures to the excellent <a href="https://yandexdataschool.com/israel/">Y-DATA</a> course for aspiring data scientists, which we would now like to share with whoever finds it useful, in blog form!</p><h2 id="cut-to-the-chase-">Cut to the chase!</h2><ul><li><a href="#basics">Shell basics</a></li><li><a href="#the-shell">Background on shells</a></li><li><a href="#shell-variables">Shell variables</a></li><li><a href="#pipes">Pipes</a></li><li><a href="#redirects">Redirects</a></li><li><a href="#filesystem">Filesystem</a></li><li><a href="#runnable-files">Runnable files</a></li><li><a href="#package-managers">Package managers</a> (e.g. brew and apt)</li><li><a href="#shell-commands-inside-jupyter-notebooks">Shell commands inside Jupyter notebooks</a></li><li><a href="#text-editors-in-the-terminal">Text editors in the terminal</a></li><li><a href="#other-useful-commands">Other useful commands</a></li><li><a href="#ssh">SSH</a></li><li><a href="#tmux">tmux</a></li><li><a href="#running-commands-in-the-background">Running commands in the background</a></li><li><a href="#symbolic-links">Symbolic links</a></li><li><a href="#zsh-oh-my-zsh-powerlevel10k">Oh-my-zsh</a></li></ul><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><p>The topic - system, IT, DevOps, MLOps, whatever other name you want to call it - how do you make the computer do what you want, outside the context of Python (or R or Matlab etc., we don't discriminate)? How do you get that beautiful neural network of yours to run on an actual server in the cloud, so that it can serve actual users?</p><blockquote>What to do when the bubble bursts, and you have to step outside the Jupyter notebook to fix things?</blockquote><p>Of course, this is a wide open question which requires a lot of previous knowledge to answer. In our lectures, we wanted to start by building a solid foundation for the students to stand on. So, we went to the classics - what is Linux? Why do people use it? What is Bash? How to use the terminal? How to exit vim?!</p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507245921392-e902673ca772?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="It's all about that base, no trouble!" srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507245921392-e902673ca772?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507245921392-e902673ca772?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507245921392-e902673ca772?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1507245921392-e902673ca772?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDZ8fHxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>It's all about that base, no trouble!

Systems are designed by humans, and better designs lead to better performance, stability, and flexibility. <strong>Linux is simply a better designed operating system</strong>. It's super flexible and stable - "blue screens of death" are exceedingly rare in production Linux servers, and their performance is very reliable. <strong>Which is why a vast majority of production systems run on Linux</strong>, and that's also why it's good for anyone working in tech to be Linux literate. That includes you, dear reader.</p><p>Being open source leads to high quality, as bugs have fewer dark places to hide in. Developers can peer under the covers to make sure their Linux applications will work well, rather than guessing and relying on questionable documentation from closed source operating system developers.</p><p>But with great power and flexibility comes a great ability to shoot yourself in the foot. Linux makes that easy as well.</p><h3 id="what-do-the-different-types-of-linux-mean">What do the different types of Linux mean?</h3><p>One of the confusing things when entering the Linux world is the giant jargon which is thrown in your face. It feels like the explanations expect you to already know and understand a bunch of other terms, without building understanding step by step. So, I'd like to give you a very brief summary of terms you might come across and what they mean.</p><h3 id="linux-like-systems">Linux-like systems</h3><p>Mac and Unix are very similar to, but are not Linux technically. You will have a hard time telling the difference, unless you dive deep.</p><p>Unix is older than Linux and extremely similar - In fact, Linux is an open source re-implementation of Unix (which was closed source, but very good). This is pretty much historic trivia, as Unix is rarely seen nowadays, but know that some people use the words Unix and Linux interchangeably.</p><p>In general, there’s a name for operating systems that look and feel like Unix – POSIX compliant, or *nix. When you see these words, translate them as “follows the conventions of Linux, such as basic commands for file manipulation (ls, cd, mkdir) and "/" as the root of the file system etc.”</p><p>GNU is a large set of free software which is the foundation for much of Linux – compilers, C libraries, programs to zip files, and many others. It's also the name of an independent POSIX operating system, with more hardcore ideology around free software than Linux.</p><p>All of the above systems, as well as Linux itself, are examples of POSIX compliant or *nix systems.</p><h3 id="linux-distributions-distros">Linux Distributions / Distros</h3><p>There are (too?) many flavours of “real Linux”, called distros or distributions. It can be a headache to differentiate them.</p><p>A distribution is like a "company", which invents a new operating system. They wrap the Linux Kernel with a new bundle of peripheral programs - i.e. they may use a different mix of GUI programs, support different hardware by default, etc. They release new versions occasionally.</p><p><strong>The bottom line – unless you know what you’re doing, <a href="https://ubuntu.com/download/desktop">just use Ubuntu</a></strong>. It’s the most user friendly, widely supported, and easy to install.</p><p><a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/linux-platforms/enterprise-linux">Red Hat Enterprise Linux</a>, or RHEL, is a different distro which is used sometimes in heavy duty production servers. <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> is the desktop equivalent of RHEL - usually, developers aiming to run their applications on RHEL servers will use Fedora for their development computers, to avoid compatibility issues.</p><p><a href="https://alpinelinux.org/">Alpine</a> is a super minimal distro which is used for many Docker images. <a href="https://dagshub.com/blog/setting-up-data-science-workspace-with-docker/">Read our blog post about Docker for more information</a>.</p><h2 id="interfaces">Interfaces</h2><p>When people think of Linux, they usually associate it with a scary terminal (plus attached Anonymous hacker with a hoodie 👩‍💻).</p><p>Don't Panic – it’s not so scary! Today, it’s really easy to install Linux on a computer, with a regular GUI wizard, if you pick a distro that cares about that sort of thing (for example, Ubuntu).</p><p>We'll focus on terminals / shells in this lecture, since that is always available, and generally where "real work" is done. Production servers will rarely have GUIs. Don't let that discourage you - after you get used to it, using the shell can become much more convenient than GUIs!</p><figure><img src="https://dagshub.com/blog/content/images/2020/12/image.png" alt="The Wizard will now install your software."><figcaption>The Wizard will now install your software.</figcaption></figure><h2 id="basics">Basics</h2><p>The following actions are very basic file manipulation commands - moving, copying, deleting, viewing, etc.<br>I think there are enough sources online to learn these basic commands, and so I won't be re-explaining them here. Below the list, I provide my recommended way to learn about them, so don't worry!</p><ul><li>ls</li><li>mv</li><li>cp</li><li>rm</li><li>pwd</li><li>cd</li><li>mkdir</li><li>echo</li><li>cat</li></ul><p><strong>The most convenient way I found to learn about these commands, even if you don't have a Linux terminal available, is to follow these tutorials:</strong></p><ol><li><a href="https://www.webminal.org/terminal/">https://www.webminal.org/terminal/</a><br><strong>Do up to and including lesson 3.</strong><br>Webminal includes an interactive terminal in the browser, which you can play with and use for the next tutorial (which doesn't have an interactive shell, only text and quizzes).</li><li><a href="https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell">https://linuxjourney.com/lesson/the-shell</a></li></ol><h2 id="the-shell">The Shell</h2><p>The shell (AKA terminal) is itself a program! It's in charge of things like: </p><ul><li>Taking keystrokes from the user</li><li>Displaying text output to the user.</li><li>Remembering what directory you're in currently (changed using <code>cd</code>, shown using <code>pwd</code>)</li><li>Turning your commands into <strong>new</strong> <strong>running programs &nbsp;- processes,</strong> by sending appropriate messages to the kernel</li></ul><p>For example, what does the shell do when I type <code>python hello_world.py</code> and press enter?</p><ul><li>It's in charge of knowing where the actual program called "python" is located in the file system - probably something like <code>/usr/bin/python</code>. In the end, the kernel is the only thing that can run new programs, and it expects absolute paths to files.</li><li>I can check where the shell is actually finding "python" by running <code>which python</code>. &nbsp;The <code>which</code> command outputs the full path found by the shell. How does it know? More on that later, in the section on runnable scripts.</li><li><code>which</code> is a useful command!

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>You have a business idea but you're not sure if it solves a real pain point and there's a market of potential buyers out there?</p>
<p>You could move forward and build an MVP to validate your idea but should you really invest the time and money to do it?</p>
<p>Validating that there's enough demand for your solution later down the road is one of the most important steps you need to take in order to build a successful business. As it turns out there's a simple, yet elegant way to figure out if you're onto something.</p>
<p>In this blog post we'll walk through this process step-by-step so that you can make an informed decision whether you should double down or go back to the drawing board.</p>
<h2>Ideas and competition</h2>
<p>Most of us see competition as a sign of market saturation. If there are too many competitors it's tough to cut through the noise with our very own solution. Old Competitors have deep pockets and will certainly outspent you in their marketing efforts.</p>
<p>Furthermore categories are usually associated with their market leaders. Looking for a solid CRM (Customer Relationship Management) solution? That's what Salesforce is for. Real-time business chat software? Slack is the big player here. E-Mail Marketing? Go with Mailchimp.</p>
<p>While competing with Salesforce might be a bad idea, having competitors shouldn't turn you off as it comes with huge upsides you can exploit.</p>
<p>Having competitors means that the <strong>market is already validated</strong>. Companies are already spending money for a solution. If you try to enter, let alone define a brand new market you're spending most of your time and effort educating your future potential customers about your product and why it's important for their business to succeed.</p>
<p>It's likely that they're not aware of the severity of the problem you're trying to solve for them. Even if you succeed in educating your future users about your product you still have to raise awareness for the necessity to buy your product in higher management since they usually allocate budgets and therefore have to get onboard as well.</p>
<p>Raising such awareness is a grind which will cost you a lot of money spent on marketing and sales. Money you don't really have if you're starting from scratch with no VC funding. It's way easier to enter a well defined and understood category. A category where a lot of people are already spending money on solutions to solve their problems at hand.</p>
<h2>Validating demand</h2>
<p>Now that we know that we should embrace rather than avoid competition we can use this fact to do some market research and estimate if there's enough demand for our product. In addition to that we should also check if entering the market is sustainable long-term.</p>
<p>The following 3-step process is a simple, data-driven framework which helps you in answering those questions.</p>
<p>As an example let's say that we want to build a video conferencing tool specifically designed for job interviews done to hire remote employees. Imagine a tool which has built-in support for whiteboarding, code interviews, video playback for mocked-up "stress test" scenarios, facial emotional recognition, recordings, etc.</p>
<p>Should we move forward with that idea? Is there enough demand? Let's run through the process and figure it out!</p>
<h3>1. Identifying your competitors</h3>
<p>The very first step we need to take is to identify our key competitors. Let's think about how remote job interviews are primarily done these days? What usually happens is that after an initial screening the applicant walks through a series of video calls with various interviewers who vet the candidate based on different criteria.</p>
<p>The core technology used throughout this process is a reliable video conferencing software so let's see who the strongest players are in that market.</p>
<p>To identify the most widely used video conferencing softwares we start our research on a product reviews site called Capterra.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-1.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 1"></p>
<p>Let's enter "Video Conferencing" in the search bar as we're looking for video conferencing software.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-2.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 2"></p>
<p>As we can see there's an even more specific category called "Web Conferencing Software" which, based on its description, looks like exactly what we're after. Clicking on the link directs us to the page where we can explore all the web conferencing solutions in use by businesses these days.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-3.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 3"></p>
<p>The next thing we want to do is to sort the products by "Most Reviews" because the default ranking includes advertisements at the top.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-4.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 4"></p>
<p>Next up we take some time to scroll through the list to figure out who our main competitors would be. Skim through the reviews to see which product is often used in the context of the idea you're pursuing (remote job interviews in our example).</p>
<p>After digging deeper into the specifics we can identify the following tools as our competitors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whereby (a.k.a appear.in)</li>
<li>Wire</li>
<li>Livestorm</li>
</ul>
<p>The more time you spend on this step the more competitors you'll uncover. For the rest of this post we'll move forward with these three tools to keep things simple.</p>
<p><strong>A note on finding the main competitors:</strong></p>
<p>When following the aforementioned steps you'll usually find the big names at the very top of the list. In our case that's Zoom, GoToMeeting or Google Meet. That's totally fine and expected. What you want to do is to look for software which is more specialized and tailored towards the audience and niche you're about to serve.</p>
<p>Based on my own experience I can say that a huge advantage for remote job interviews would be a no-login, no-download and no-installation software package (it should be accessible from within the users browser with 1 click). In addition to that, built-in screen sharing and encryption is a must. Those are some of the problem specific characteristics you should take into account to narrow down your competition.</p>
<h3>2. The VC funding they raised</h3>
<p>Now that we know who our main competitors are it's time to do more research on the companies behind the toolings.</p>
<p>We do this via a website called Crunchbase. Crunchbase is a platform which collects, processes and serves business information about private and public companies with a main focus on venture-backed startups.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-5.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 5"></p>
<p>The next step in our research is pretty simple. We enter our competitors name in the search bar and pull up their organizations profile.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-6.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 6"></p>
<p>What we want to focus on specifically is whether they've raised money in the past and, if so, what amount. In the "Livestorm" example above we can see that they've raised a total of 4.6 Million EUR in 2 rounds (Seed Round and Series A).</p>
<p>We want to do this research for all the competitors we've identified. Simply search for their organizations profile and see if they've raised VC money.</p>
<p>"Wire" for example has raised 14.5 Million EUR and "Whereby" was even acquired by "Videonor".</p>
<p>The main goal with this step is to see if there's money invested in the market. The more money is already invested, the better. Ideally the majority of your competitors should've raised money in the past.</p>
<h3>3. Their website traffic</h3>
<p>The very next thing we should do is to figure out how much web traffic our competitors are getting.</p>
<p>The more visitors they get, the more demand there is for their product. The more demand, the easier it is for us to grab some of that traffic via paid ads or good content marketing and redirect it to our, more specialized solution.</p>
<p>Website traffic numbers are usually considered highly sensitive and kept behind closed doors. Luckily enough Crunchbase has us covered as they're partnering with SEMrush, a tool for professional SEOs and SEMs.</p>
<p>To get a rough estimate as to how much traffic our competitors are getting we can simply click on the "Technology" tab in their Crunchbase profile and look at the "Monthly Visits" number.</p>
<p><img src="https://philippmuens.com/assets/blog/how-to-conduct-a-competitive-analysis/comp-analysis-7.png" alt="Competitive Analysis 7"></p>
<p>Doing so reveals that "Livestorm" gets roughly ~305.255 visits per month. "Wire" sits at ~153.904 monthly visits while "Whereby" attracts ~1.365.524 visits every month.</p>
<p>Again, do this for each and every identified competitor. You should be looking at at least ~150.000 visits per month for each of your competitors. The more, the better.</p>
<h3>The results</h3>
<p>That wraps up your main market research process. The main objective in doing this research is to validate that there's enough demand such that your new, specialized solution can find its potential customers more easily.</p>
<p>The two signals you want to look for is invested interest in the market via VC funding and enough organic search traffic you can tap into later down the road.</p>
<p>You want to move forward with your idea if you can validate that at least ~4 of your competitors have received funding and are getting more than ~150.000 visits every month.</p>
<h2>Your challenge</h2>
<p>I'd like to invite you to take some time this week to run through this process with the product you have in mind.</p>
<p>Take the numbers you should be looking for outlined above as ballpark numbers and take other, niche-specific metrics into account (e.g. Facebook followers if you're working on a Social Media related solution).</p>
<p>This process might take quite a while and can feel laborious but trust me that investing this time upfront can save you months, if not years of wasted time and effort.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Starting a new business adventure is a risky endeavor. It takes years and a lot of learnings until success materializes. One of the most common reasons why startups fail is that they solve a problem nobody is willing to pay for.</p>
<p>In this blog post we've discovered a simple 3-step process you can apply to mitigate the risk of building something nobody wants. Via marked research you can validate that there's enough demand to enter the market and carve out your very own niche.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, there were many chat services. AOL Instant Messenger, Yahoo Messenger, ICQ and others. These messengers had their own desktop clients, and developers reverse engineered their protocol to build custom applications, both open and closed source. Trillian, Audium and Pidgin were applications that let people communicate across all these messengers with one program. Over time the old protocols died, and newer chat services like Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts started storing your entire history on their servers. People started using the web interfaces and mobile apps, no longer caring about desktop programs.</p>

<p>Matrix is an open source communication protocol. It’s similar to XMPP (formerly Jabber) in the sense that anyone can set up a Matrix server and communicate to people on other Matrix servers. It’s a federated protocol, just like e-mail. Google Hangouts used to support XMPP federation, but silently removed support in 2014. Matrix supports bridging other chat services, so they can appear in a unified view. With my current setup of Matrix and appropriate bridges, I’ve combined my view of Facebook Messenger, Google Hangouts, Telegram and native Matrix chats into one convenient user interface. The path to get to that integration was not as simple.</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The dedicated server I use for <a href="https://battlepenguin.com/tech/a-history-of-personal-and-professional-websites/">this website</a> and other self-hosted web applications, is located in Germany. Logging in to Facebook or Google’s chat system from a country I’m not currently in, can raise all sorts of security flags and lock me out of my account. For those bridges, I purchased a small virtual machine in a Chicago data center. I installed a proxy on that server, accessible only via VPN, to view both Google and Facebook, so they record the IP address I’m connecting from with my web browser. This helps minimize security lockouts. Telegram isn’t hostile to third party developers, and has an official API. It doesn’t care my bridge is connecting to it from Germany, so I host it on the dedicated server.</p>

</figure>

<p>The reference Matrix server is called Synapse. It, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-telegram">mautrix-telegram</a>, <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-hangouts">mautrix-hangouts</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tulir/mautrix-facebook">mautrix-facebook</a> bridges all have official Docker containers built by their developers. Each bridge must be able to communicate with the Synapse homeserver. Their instructions go through generating configuration and key pairs that are copied over to Synapse in order to form their authentication bridge. The bridges provide chat robots that guide you through getting OAuth tokens or cookies for those respective services.</p>

  <figcaption>

</figure>

<p>The wiki for each bridge also has instructions for enabling double-puppeting, making each chat look seamless between myself and the accounts on the other side of each respective bridge. Without double-puppeting, each conversation will be in a three person group with the Matrix user, the bridge user (e.g my Google Hangouts user) and the person I’m talking to.</p>

<figure>
  
  <img src="https://battlepenguin.com/images/tech/matrix/no-double-puppet.png" alt="Chat Without Double-Puppeting Enabled">
  
  
  <figcaption>
      

      Chat Without Double-Puppeting Enabled

      
  </figcaption>
  
</figure>

<p>Enabling double-puppeting via the <code>curl</code> command in the bridge documentation and calling <code>login-matrix</code> on the bot, removes the creation of three person rooms. The bridged accounts will now show up as regular, two-person conversations.</p>

<p>I use the Element desktop app to connect to my matrix server, but I also have a web version of Element running from its own official Docker container in case I need to access chat from another computer. There are other clients, such as <a href="https://github.com/mirukana/mirage">Mirage</a> which is built using Qt and <a href="https://fluffychat.im/">Fluffychat</a> for mobile. Although I use Synapse for my homeserver, there are other servers that support the Matrix protocol that are in use and under active development.</p>

<p>Setting up all the Matrix components wasn’t too difficult, but it does require knowledge or experience with running services. It took a considerable amount of work and debugging to get each bridge operational, compounded slightly by my complex networking setup. Most people would probably just run all of this on a Raspberry Pi at home. I feel that using Matrix with bridges is still somewhat inaccessible to people who aren’t interested in development or server administration. Still, the satisfaction of having unified chat, plus one more layer of abstraction between myself and Google or Facebook, feels like it was wroth the overall effort.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
      <h2><strong>Hi there! Who are you and whatâ€™s your background?</strong></h2>

<p>Hi! Iâ€™m Jessica Califano from New York and the newsletter I work on is called <a href="https://temboo.com/the-daily-breather?utm_campaign=the%20daily%20breather&amp;utm_medium=interview&amp;utm_source=rad%20letters">The Daily Breather</a>. I started my career in fashion PR and marketing but eventually moved into the tech industry, where Iâ€™ve been for the past eight years. I am currently Head of Marketing and Communications at <a href="https://temboo.com/">Temboo</a>, a no-code software startup that works with communities to help them improve their environment using sensor technology and environmental data plus grassroots involvement. </p>

<h2><strong>Whatâ€™s your newsletter about?</strong></h2>

<p>The Daily Breather is a free, beautifully designed email report that provides air quality information for whatever locations you want to monitor. Readers get an easy way to understand the effects that air pollution can have on their daily lives, actions they can take to help improve the air around them, and what they should do if the air quality near them is poor. </p>

<p>Our data comes from trusted sources, including the EPA (in the U.S.) and the EEA (in Europe). Having high quality data is vital: it allows for an accurate understanding of air quality, and it lets you compare your own sensor data to data known to be trustworthy. On Fridays we send a special version of the email that includes a graph of the weekâ€™s air quality so you can see how it changed each day. </p>

<p>It also explains what the air quality parameters mean because many people really donâ€™t understand what AQI, PM2.5, Ozone, etc are actually measuring. I find it really helpful to have the concepts explained right inside of the tool.</p>

<p><img src="https://rad-letters.s3.amazonaws.com/custom/daily-breather-tooltip.gif" alt="AQI explanation"></p>

<p>If youâ€™d like to monitor more than one location, weâ€™ll send you updates in the same email so you can check in on as many places as youâ€™d like. Itâ€™s a great way to keep an eye on friends and family who live in other locations.</p>

<p>One of my favorite things about The Daily Breather is the design. Our designer, Brett, came up with a great idea of changing the color of the body of the email based on the air quality. We use the same colors that the EPA uses to indicate air quality: green for good, yellow for moderate, orange for unhealthy for sensitive groups, and red for unhealthy. Besides just the colors, the illustrations in the email also change. The flowers wilt when the AQ is poor and you can see more haze in the air.</p>

<p>We also include interesting facts, long reads, videos, social media posts, and more as a fun bonus. They change every day and are curated by me with the help of the team at Temboo.</p>

<h2><strong>When did you get started writing your newsletter? What motivated you to get started?</strong></h2>

<p>The idea for the newsletter was actually from our CEO, Trisala. She thought it would be a good way to try to get people engaged and interested in their local environment. A big part of the work we do with communities is to offer a way for people to get local residents more informed about the environmental issues in their area and this is one way we are working to engage people.</p>

<p>The issue of air quality is important and timely. We wanted to raise awareness about the effects that air pollution can have on health, skin, cognitive function, and overall quality of life. The Daily Breather is designed to make it easy for people to monitor their air quality, because if something is easy, people are more likely to do it. Hopefully, this will encourage people to check their air quality daily, because it will be something that is more and more important as climate change wreaks havoc on the environment.</p>

<p>This isnâ€™t Tembooâ€™s first foray into newslettersâ€”we have a weekly newsletter that I write as well that includes our latest blog post each Friday. My team and I publish at least one article a week on the <a href="https://blog.temboo.com/">Temboo blog</a>, mostly about environmental issues, community building, technology, and sustainability. I do all of the editing for the blog and publish my own articles there as well. </p>

<h2><strong>What does the process of writing your newsletter look like for you?</strong></h2>

<p>The newsletter is sent daily through an automated process set up by our engineering team. It sends across time zones, so when you sign up it will send you the emails at 7:30 AM wherever you are located which makes it a great way to start your day. </p>

<p>The content part of the newsletter is set up by me. We have a rotating schedule of the types of content we share: facts, quotes, trivia questions, long reads, podcast recommendations, interactive content, social media posts, newsletters to subscribe to, and what to stream. Weâ€™re planning to add more in the future too like short interviews, events, polls, etc.</p>

<p>Putting together this content is a really fun process. We have a giant spreadsheet with the different categories listed above and so itâ€™s my job to make sure we donâ€™t ever run out of one type. Since the newsletter is sent daily, I usually spend some time each week adding in content to the list. Sometimes Iâ€™ll come across an article or video that I think would be a good fit and add it in then. Other times, I seek out content to include, which is usually the case for the facts.</p>

<h2><strong>What have you learned through writing your newsletter?</strong></h2>

<p>Iâ€™ve learned a lot about air quality in general because of The Daily Breather and the research Iâ€™ve had to do for it. I think about air pollution constantly nowâ€”if I see a truck idling somewhere or smoke from a fire. Even just checking that the air quality is good before exercising outside is a new thing for me. But it also makes me feel a lot more connected to the environment that I live in and more motivated to make sure Iâ€™m not contributing to any pollution in the air around me.</p>

<h2><strong>Whatâ€™s your favorite part about writing your newsletter?</strong></h2>

<p>My favorite part is finding all the content. I am constantly consuming media, so curating the recommendations and other things we include helps me to take a step back and really consider what I am reading, listening to, or watching and ask myself if I think it would be interesting to a lot of other people. And hearing back from people who are enjoying it is always great too.</p>

<h2><strong>What do you wish you had known when you first started writing?</strong></h2>

<p>When I first started working on the newsletter I was really focused on finding content about air quality and the environment in general. Our click through rate was ok but I was surprised that it wasnâ€™t better than where it was. So I thought we should start trying out different types of content, including things like cool artists that I follow on social media or videos about futurism, just stuff that is interesting in any category. And the numbers went way up. So I learned not to box myself in, in terms of the content Iâ€™m sharing. People arenâ€™t only interested in one type of thing, so why limit myself to that? Itâ€™s become a lot more fun to work on now, because I can just find and share cool stuff that I like. I definitely wish Iâ€™d known that from the start.</p>

<h2><strong>What are some of your favorite newsletters, books, and podcasts?</strong></h2>

<p>I probably subscribe to more newsletters than anyone in the world, so Iâ€™ll just share some of my favorites from various categories. </p>

</ul>

<p>As far as books, I mostly read novels. I recently read <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Leave-World-Behind-Rumaan-Alam-ebook/dp/B083JKGK15">Leave the World Behind</a> by Rumaan Alam and it was excellent. Kind of scary given the times we are in but itâ€™s still a fun and distracting page turner. Ottessa Moshfegh is one of my favorite writers so I recommend any of her novels. Same with Lauren Groff and Rachel Kushner. </p>

<p>For podcasts, I really enjoy <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all">Reply All</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/youre-wrong-about/id1380008439">Youâ€™re Wrong About</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/slow-burn/id1315040130">Slow Burn</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-dream/id1435743296">The Dream</a>, <a href="https://features.apmreports.org/in-the-dark/">In The Dark</a>, <a href="https://www.kcrw.com/culture/shows/welcome-to-la">Welcome to LA</a>, and <a href="https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet">How to Save a Planet</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>What goals do you have for the future?</strong></h2>

<p>Weâ€™re working on putting together a version of the email that sends information from local air quality sensors that a group we are working with in the Bronx has set up. Weâ€™ll be doing this with more and more groups that we do air quality monitoring projects with too, so the data will be hyperlocal, providing a clearer picture of the air quality in those locations. Weâ€™re also thinking about including other types of environmental data like water quality for example. </p>

<p>The goal is to build out a resource for anyone to find out what the environment they live, work, and play in is like, with the hope of spurring action and engagement to protect and sustain that environment. </p>

<p>I was reading the
<a href="https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_5.10">Linux 5.10 release summary on KernelNewbies</a>, and a
section stood out to me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>1.6. Static calls for improved post-Spectre performance</p>

  <p>Static calls are a replacement for global function pointers. They use code patching to allow
direct calls to be used instead of indirect calls. They give the flexibility of function pointers,
but with improved performance. This is especially important for cases where retpolines would
otherwise be used, as retpolines can significantly impact performance.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve spent a lot of time looking at the Linux kernel, but never directly at its indirect call
setup or post-<a href="https://spectreattack.com/">Spectre</a> mitigations. These changes sound very cool,
so I’m going to use this post to try and explain and understand them (both to myself and others).</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: One of the original authors of the patchset has emailed me with some corrections
and answers to the questions that I ask below. I’ve marked each with either “Correction” or
“Update.” Thanks, Peter!</p>

<h2 id="background-indirect-calls-spectre-and-retpolines">Background: indirect calls, Spectre, and retpolines</h2>

<h3 id="indirect-calls">Indirect calls</h3>

<p>Indirect calls are one of C’s most powerful language features, and are critical for writing
higher-order code without a supplementary object or function/method dispatch system.</p>

<p>Most C programmers are familiar with the basics of indirect calls, thanks to standard and POSIX
functions like <code>qsort</code> and <code>pthread_create</code>: each takes a <em>function pointer</em>, which it then
calls internally to complete the functionality of the surrounding call:</p>

<p><em>(View it on <a href="https://godbolt.org/z/P44Ghq">Godbolt</a>).</em></p>

<p>Observe: our <code>call</code> goes through a memory or register operand (<code>[rbp - 8]</code>)<sup id="fnref:opt" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:opt">1</a></sup> to get the target,
instead of a direct target specified by the operand value itself (like, say,
<code>call 0xacabacab ; @good_rand</code>). That’s what makes it indirect.</p>

<p>But we can go even further than this! Indeed, a common pattern in C is to declare
entire <em>structures</em> of operations, using each to parametrize a lower level set of behaviors
(for example, the core POSIX I/O APIs) over independent implementations.</p>

<p>This is exactly how <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse">FUSE</a> works: every FUSE client
creates its own <a href="https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse/blob/cd4aae2de6aacad31a15791bbb52adf173561a6d/include/fuse.h#L299-L790"><code>fuse_operations</code></a>:</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, this technique isn’t limited to userspace: the Linux kernel itself makes
aggressive use of indirect calls, particularly in architecture-agnostic interfaces
(like the <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/filesystems/vfs.html">VFS</a> and sub-specializations
like <code>procfs</code>) and the architecture-specific internals of subsystems like
<a href="https://perf.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page"><code>perf_events</code></a>.</p>

<p>So that’s neat. It’s so neat that CPU engineers got all
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_predictor#Indirect_branch_predictor">hot in the pants</a> trying
to squeeze extra performance out of them<sup id="fnref:perf" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:perf">2</a></sup>, and we ended up with
<a href="https://spectreattack.com/spectre.pdf">Spectre v2</a>.</p>

<h3 id="spectre-v2">Spectre (v2)</h3>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/spectre.png" alt="The Spectre logo"></p>

<p>The exact mechanism that Spectre v2 (also known as
<a href="https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-5715">CVE-2017-5715</a>) exploits is
<em>slightly</em> out of scope of this post, but at a high level:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Modern (x86) CPUs contain an <em>indirect branch predictor</em>, which attempts to guess the target
of an indirect call or jump.</p>

    <p>To actually speed things up, the CPU <strong>speculatively executes</strong> the
 predicted branch:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A correct prediction means that the indirect call completes significantly faster
 (since it’s already executing or has finished executing speculatively);</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A misprediction <strong>should</strong> result in a slower (but still
 successful) indirect call with <strong>no side effects from the incorrect speculation.</strong></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>In other words: the CPU is responsible for <strong>rolling back</strong> any side effects associated
 with any misprediction and subsequent speculation. Mis-speculation is a <em>microarchitectural</em>
 detail that should not manifest in <em>architectural</em> changes, like modified registers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Rolling back</strong> any mis-speculated state is a relatively expensive operation, with a lot of
microarchitectural implications: cache lines and other bits of state need to be fixed up so that
the <em>actual</em> program control flow isn’t tainted by failed speculations.</p>

    <p>In practice, rolling back the entire speculated state would undo most of the advantages
 of speculating in the first place. Instead of doing that, x86 and other ISAs will just mark
 (many) of the bits of speculated state (like cache lines) as stale.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>This fixup behavior (either reverting or marking speculated state) results in a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Side-channel_attack"><em>side-channel</em></a>: an attacker can
<em>train</em> the branch predictor to speculatively execute a bit of code
(not unlike a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming">ROP gadget</a>) that modifies
a piece of microarchitectural state in a data-dependent manner, such as a cache entry
whose address is dependent on a secret value that was speculatively fetched.</p>

    <p>The attacker can then <em>probe</em> that microarchitectural state by <strong>timing</strong> access to it:
 fast accesses indicate a speculatively modified state, disclosing the secret.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The original Spectre v2 attack focused on cache lines since they’re relatively easy to time, even
from high level (and sandboxed!) languages that don’t have access to
<a href="https://c9x.me/x86/html/file_module_x86_id_30.html"><code>clflush</code></a> or other cache-line
primitives on x86. But the concept is a general one: it’s difficult to execute speculatively without
leaking <em>some</em> information, and subsequent vulnerabilities (like <a href="https://mdsattacks.com/">MDS</a> and
<a href="https://zombieloadattack.com/">ZombieLoad</a>) have exposed information leaks in other
microarchitectural features.</p>

<p>This is bad news: an attacker running one of the <strong>safest</strong> contexts (JavaScript or other managed
code, in a sandbox, in userspace) can conceivably train the indirect branch predictor to
speculatively execute a gadget in kernelspace, potentially
<a href="https://cyber.wtf/2017/07/28/negative-result-reading-kernel-memory-from-user-mode/">disclosing kernel memory</a>.</p>

<p>So, the kernel needed a new mitigation. That mitigation is <em>retpolines</em>.</p>

<h3 id="retpolines">Retpolines</h3>

<p>To mitigate Spectre v2, the kernel needs to prevent the CPU from speculating on an attacker
controlled indirect branch.</p>

<p>A retpoline (short for <em>ret</em>urn
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trampoline_(computing)"><em>trampoline</em></a>) does exactly that: indirect
jumps and calls are surrounded by a little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunk">thunk</a> that
effectively traps the speculated execution in an infinite loop, spinning it until the misprediction
is resolved.</p>

<p>Intel’s
<a href="https://software.intel.com/security-software-guidance/api-app/sites/default/files/Retpoline-A-Branch-Target-Injection-Mitigation.pdf">Retpoline whitepaper</a>
has some helpful illustrations:</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.yossarian.net/assets/retpoline.png" alt="A visualization of speculative execution with and without a retpoline."></p>

<p>This works by converting the indirect control flow from an <em>indirect branch</em> to an
<em>indirect return</em><sup id="fnref:allreturns" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:allreturns">3</a></sup>, hence the “ret” in retpoline. Returns are <em>also</em> predicted,
but with an additional mechanism given priority: the
<a href="https://blog.stuffedcow.net/2018/04/ras-microbenchmarks/">Return Stack Buffer</a><sup id="fnref:rsb" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:rsb">4</a></sup>. To ensure that
the RSB can’t be maliciously trained away from the infinite loop, the retpoline begins with a
direct <code>CALL</code> that primes the RSB to always<sup id="fnref:notalways" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:notalways">5</a></sup> predict the infinite loop.</p>

<p>Here’s what an indirect call retpoline <em>actually</em> looks like<sup id="fnref:ool" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:ool">6</a></sup>, simplified significantly from
the <a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.14/source/arch/x86/lib/retpoline.S">kernel</a>
<a href="https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v5.9.14/source/arch/x86/include/asm/nospec-branch.h">source</a>:</p>

<p>…all of that to replace a simple <code>call [rax]</code>!</p>

<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>

<p>There are repercussions for this kind of trickery:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It’s slow when correctly predicted: we’ve replaced a single indirect <code>CALL</code> with at least two
direct <code>CALL</code>s, plus a <code>RET</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s <em>really</em> slow when mispredicted: we <em>literally</em> spin in place using <code>PAUSE</code> and <code>LFENCE</code>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It’s a ROP gadget, so it <em>looks</em> like an exploit primitive. That means it screws with Intel’s
<a href="https://software.intel.com/sites/default/files/managed/4d/2a/control-flow-enforcement-technology-preview.pdf">CET</a>
and similar protections on other platforms. Intel claims that newer hardware will support “enhanced

<p>We were recently challenged by&nbsp;Ali El-Sharif from <a href="https://ai.science/">Aggregate Intellect</a> to run some benchmarks on GRANT, and thought that one of the most interesting direct comparisons would be to compare <a href="https://wagtaillabs.com/2020/11/17/introducing-grant-pt-1/">Amalgamate</a> with Cost Complexity Pruning (CCP).</p>



<p>Cost Complexity Pruning applies a similar philosophy to Amalgamate, aiming to remove parts of each decision tree that don’t carry their weight. There are many descriptions of how CCP works on the web, but <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/cost-complexity-pruning-decision-trees/">this is a good, quick introduction</a>.</p>



<p>First up we tried pruning a Random Forest using Amalgamate with increasing&nbsp;<em>threshold</em> values&nbsp;and compared that to pruning with increasing CCP <em>alpha</em> values. Here’s the result plot comparing Validation Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) against the number of rules in the model (as found by <a href="https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2020/10/cost-complexity-pruning-decision-trees/">Graft</a>):</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="735" height="425" src="https://wagtaillabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EIMS-1-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://wagtaillabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EIMS-1-1.png 735w, https://wagtaillabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EIMS-1-1-300x173.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 735px) 100vw, 735px"></figure>



<p>What’s interesting here is that Amalgamate has a significant early advantage, up to 20% fewer rules for the same Validation RMSE, but that eventually CCP finds a better, ultra-low complexity model. This suggests that CCP misses some easy simplifications because it only works on each decision tree individually, and that these can be found using Amalgamate.</p>



<p>To test this theory we tried running Amalgamate (with a fixed <em>threshold</em> for simplicity) on each CCP pruned model:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="723" height="428" src="https://wagtaillabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EIMS-2-1.png" alt="" srcset="https://wagtaillabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EIMS-2-1.png 723w, https://wagtaillabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/EIMS-2-1-300x178.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 723px) 100vw, 723px"></figure>



<p>These results show us that Amalgamate always found rules to eliminate, often (but not always) improving Validation RMSE. Overall our experiments showed that Amalgamate can be reduce the number of rules in a model by an average of 5% with no impact on Validation RMSE. This mightn’t sound like a lot, but anything that can be done to reduce the cognitive load required to understand the model without impacting on the results is useful.</p>



<p>By using both CCP and Amalgamate it is possible to find better simple models, and let stakeholders decide where the tradeoff between accuracy and complexity should be.</p>

                    <h2 id="what-could-go-wrong-when-your-employees-commit-internal-information-to-public-github-repos">What could go wrong when your employees commit internal information to public GitHub repos? </h2><p>While <a href="https://savebreach.com/solarwinds-credentials-exposure-led-to-us-government-fireye-breach/">we were the first to report on the SolarWinds security vulnerability that possibly could have exposed their Downloads FTP server</a> credentials letting attackers to push malicious binaries and attack the US government and <a href="https://solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a>' other high profile clients, some more information has surfaced regarding the SolarWinds security vulnerability since then, that gives more insight into what possibly was exposed and whether it could have led to this massive breach of the US government. While majority of security researchers are of the opinion that this wasn't the main reason of the breach, and that there was a complex and sophisticated supply chain attack targeting <a href="https://solarwinds.com/">SolarWinds</a>, we believe<strong> these small security lapses could have given the attackers a larger attack surface to carry out their attacks</strong> and eventually might have helped strengthen their foothold into the SolarWinds infrastructure, to perform reconnaissance and evade detection.</p><h3 id="plain-old-ftp-to-the-blame">Plain old FTP to the blame?</h3><p>As per the screenshot posted by Vinoth, which we wrote about in our previous <a href="https://savebreach.com/solarwinds-credentials-exposure-led-to-us-government-fireye-breach/">post</a>, SolarWinds were possibly using unencrypted plain FTP server for their Downloads server in the age of global CDN technologies. However, not a direct attack vector its very likely that the FTP server had more vulnerabilities and unencrypted communication can always be intercepted, and modified. But we don't believe this maybe something as concerning as the FTP password leak.</p><h2 id="solarwinds-credentials-were-possibly-leaking-since-2018">SolarWinds Credentials were possibly leaking since 2018</h2><p>Security researcher Vinoth Kumar, told us that "SolarWinds had been possibly exposing the FTP credentials to the Download server since at least 2018". To corroborate his claim, Vinoth shared the the following link to the Configuration file exposed that was exposed in the mib-importer GitHub repo possibly belonging to a <a href="https://github.com/xkozus00">SolarWinds employee</a>, <a href="https://github.com/xkozus00/mib-importer/blob/master/Src/Lib/PurgeApp/PurgeApp.exe.config">https://github.com/xkozus00/mib-importer/blob/master/Src/Lib/PurgeApp/PurgeApp.exe.config</a> and he further added that, upon supplying the <a href="https://github.com/xkozus00/mib-importer">repo base url</a> to the Web Archive, it shows Web Archive had first archived the page back in June 2018, and that was the last time the page was archived. So we concluded that the credentials to the FTP server and other potentially sensitive information in that exposed repository possibly existed for more than 1 year in the public domain until Vinoth reported it to the SolarWinds PSIRT.</p><figure><img src="https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png" alt="" srcset="https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/image-3.png 600w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/image-3.png 1000w, https://savebreach.com/content/images/2020/12/image-3.png 1411w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Screenshot of the SolarWinds GitHub repository archived by Web Archive</figcaption></figure><p>This shows that SolarWinds might have been exposing their sensitive internal credentials since a fairly long time before it was brought to their notice, which in turn might have given its attackers an opportunity to steal certificates and other valuable internal information about SolarWinds to carry out the large scale attack against US government and other top organizations using the backdoored SolarWinds Orion software.</p><h2 id="the-mib-importer-github-repository">The mib-importer GitHub repository</h2><p>A "mib-importer" public GitHub repository, possibly belonging to a SolarWinds employee with secrets (like FTP username and password) exposed, was found on GitHub by the security researcher in November 2019, which is said to have existed from around June 2018</p><p>Upon analyzing, the SaveBreach team found out that SolarWinds Orion lets users import MIB files into it. MIB files are used for monitoring network devices. Apparently, the mib-importer tool was developed by SolarWinds to import MIB files into Orion. We found the following data from the <strong><a href="https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Add-MIBs-to-the-SolarWinds-MIB-database">SolarWinds documentation pages</a> </strong>regarding importing &nbsp;MIB files (Reference – <a href="https://support.solarwinds.com/SuccessCenter/s/article/Upload-MIB-in-Orion-Universal-Device-Poller">1</a>, <a href="https://thwack.solarwinds.com/t5/NPM-Discussions/Adding-MIBs-to-Orion/m-p/113474">2</a>, <a href="https://thwack.solarwinds.com/t5/NPM-Discussions/Adding-MIBs-to-Orion/m-p/113474">3</a>)</p><p><a href="https://documentation.solarwinds.com/en/Success_Center/orionplatform/Content/Core-Management-Information-Base--MIB--sw1730.htm">From SolarWinds website</a> – </p><blockquote>Management Information Base (MIB) is a structure that describes all objects a device can report on, such as CPU, fan, or temperature. MIB contains the name, datatype, and the object identifier (OID). MIB is a hierarchical structure, displayed as a navigation tree. Every entry in the MIB tree is a value for a specific component on a specific device.</blockquote><blockquote>SolarWinds maintains a MIB database that serves as a repository for the OIDs used to monitor a wide variety of network devices. The MIB database is updated regularly.</blockquote><h2 id="qa-with-cybersecurity-researcher-vinoth">Q&amp;A with cybersecurity researcher Vinoth</h2><p>From our most recent conversation with Vinoth, it appears that the credentials and possibly more sensitive data about SolarWinds was lying in public domain for a long time before finally being taken down. Vinoth doubts that the data might have also included certificates and not just FTP credentials, which was alone sufficient to sign the malicious binaries and upload them to the FTP server while passing off as legitimate software.</p><p><strong>Q: Since when do you think the GitHub repo might have been exposed? Do you think the attackers could have gained persistence into their infrastructure for almost 3 years to carry out the attack?</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">Vinoth</a></strong>: I’m not sure, even on June 2018, 40 commits were there (in that repo). There was only one page available on archive couldn’t find anything else.</p><p><strong>Q: The Attackers had put signed binaries on the Download server. What was the process the attackers might have followed after getting access to the file upload server to sign the binaries?</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow">Vinoth</a></strong>: Not sure, but I could have missed checking the repo which could have had the certificate in it.</p><p><strong>Vinoth had tweeted that the GitHub repo was open to public since 17th June, 2018</strong></p><figure><blockquote data-width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">That Github repo was open to the public since 17 Jun 2018 😱 <a href="https://t.co/SHUWaPXIeK">pic.twitter.com/SHUWaPXIeK</a></p>— Vinoth Kumar (@vinodsparrow) <a href="https://twitter.com/vinodsparrow/status/1338956534147993601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 15, 2020</a></blockquote>

<figcaption>Tweet by Vinod about the web archived GitHub repository page</figcaption></figure><h2 id="certificates-used-to-sign-malicious-binaries-exposed-through-github-repo">Certificates used to sign malicious binaries exposed through GitHub repo?</h2><p>This raises many questions. Were the certificates used to sign the binaries obtained from that public GitHub repository or, from any other information leaked publicly? &nbsp;Exposed certificate could have allowed hackers to sign their malicious SolarWinds Orion binaries and pass them off as legitimate software developed by SolarWinds, subsequently uploading them to the Downloads server with the previously found leaked FTP credentials.</p><h2 id="was-this-how-solarwinds-got-hacked">Was this How SolarWinds got hacked?</h2><p>We can come to a partial conclusion that the internal information exposed on GitHub was there for a sufficiently long time for the attackers to have already exploited them to gain their initial foothold. Although unclear at this point, as there maybe a more sophisticated and complex attack chain with evasion techniques as being claimed by FireEye and security researchers, but we do feel this might have been a precursor to the SolarWinds breach and the widespread cyber attack against the US Government.</p>

At YouTube, we understand the important role our open platform plays and we will continue to make decisions to nourish and protect this ecosystem.</p><p><br>Over the past few months, we have been thoroughly analysing Turkey’s recently amended Internet Law No. 5651, which provides new requirements for social media platforms such as appointing a local representative, complying with removal &amp; response turnaround times and publishing semi-annual transparency reports. YouTube respects the laws and regulations in the countries where we operate, while maintaining our commitments to freedom of expression, access to information, and transparency. We have been able to find a way forward and will commence the process of appointing a local representative legal entity in compliance with the law, without compromising our values.&nbsp;</p><p><br>YouTube will set up a legal entity in Turkey to serve as a local representative, providing a local point of contact for the government. This step toward compliance will not change how YouTube reviews content removal requests, nor will it change how YouTube handles or holds user data. Currently, we review government removal requests when notified through the correct legal processes and disclose these requests in our <a href="https://transparencyreport.google.com/government-removals/by-country/TR">transparency report</a>, in keeping with our stance on transparency.

<p>Slow websites are frustrating—and Google doesn’t like them either. In May 2021, Google is releasing a set of new ranking metrics known as <a href="https://moz.com/blog/core-web-vitals">Core Web Vitals</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The core web vitals are a set of metrics used to determine how fast webpages load. The three metrics are:</p>

<p>Throughout this tutorial, you will learn how to optimize your Django templates for faster page load speeds to get your website ready for the new Google updates. Plus, it will make your visitors happy too! Let’s get started!</p>



<h2>Bundling and Minifying CSS with Django Compressor</h2>



<p>CSS is a render-blocking asset, meaning that it blocks the browser from rendering our webpage until the CSS has been completely downloaded and parsed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>We can optimize this process in our Django templates using <a href="https://django-compressor.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Django Compressor</a> to minify and bundle our stylesheets. Thus, reducing the CSS’s file size and the amount of network requests the browser has to make. Awesome, let’s see how we can do this.</p>



<p>First, let’s install and configure Django Compressor.</p>



<pre><code lang="python">pip install django_compressor</code></pre>



<p>After installing, add <code>"compressor"</code> to your <code>INSTALLED_APPS</code> in your project settings.</p>



<pre><code lang="python"># myproject/settings.py

INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # apps
    'compressor',
]</code></pre>



<p>Perfect, since we are using Django’s staticfiles contrib app, we have to add Django Compressor’s file finder to our <code>STATICFILES_FINDERS</code> setting. Inside your <code>settings.py</code> file, add:</p>



<pre><code lang="python"># myproject/settings.py 

STATICFILES_FINDERS = (
    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.FileSystemFinder',
    'django.contrib.staticfiles.finders.AppDirectoriesFinder',
    'compressor.finders.CompressorFinder',
)</code></pre>



<p>Now Django Compressor can find our static files. By default, Django Compressor will bundle our CSS files but not minify them. To minify the bundled CSS file, we need to pass the bundled file through a CSS filter. Let’s configure our CSS filters. Inside your <code>settings.py</code> file, add:</p>



<pre><code lang="python"># myproject/settings.py

COMPRESS_ENABLED = True
COMPRESS_FILTERS = {
        "css": [
            'compressor.filters.css_default.CssAbsoluteFilter',  
            'compressor.filters.cssmin.CSSMinFilter',
        ]
}</code></pre>



<p>Let’s break down what’s happening here. First, we set <code>COMPRESS_ENABLED</code> to <code>True</code>—this tells Django Compressor to compress our CSS files while in development mode.</p>



<p>Next, we define a list of filters to pass the bundled CSS through. The <code>CssAbsoluteFilter</code> normalizes the URLs in your CSS files to absolute URLs, like the URLs in the CSS <code>url()</code> function, and the <code>CSSMinFilter</code> minifies the bundled CSS.</p>



<p>Perfect, that takes care of the configuration. Let’s set up our templates and start using Django Compressor to minify and bundle our CSS files in the next section.</p>



<h3>Setting Up Templates</h3>



<p>Inside our Django app, let’s create our template folder structure.</p>



<pre><code lang="bash">+-- myapp
    +-- migrations
    +-- templates
        -- base.html
        +-- myapp
            -- mytemplate.html</code></pre>



<p>That takes care of the folder structure. Let’s create our <code>base.html</code> template now. Inside the <code>base.html</code> template, add:</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">{% <em>load</em> compress static %}
&lt;!DOCTYPE <em>html</em>&gt;
&lt;html <em>lang</em>="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;!-- Global StyleSheets --&gt;
        {% <em>compress</em> css %}
           &lt;link <em>rel</em>="stylesheet" <em>href</em>="{% static 'css/base.css' %}"&gt;
        {% <em>endcompress</em> %}

        {% <em>compress</em> css %}
        {% <em>block</em> styles %}
            &lt;!-- Child Template StyleSheets Go Here --&gt;
        {% <em>endblock</em> %}
        {% <em>endcompress</em> %}

        &lt;title&gt;Tutorial&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
   ....
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>



<p>We load in the compressor template tags and place the files we want to bundle and minify inside the <code>{% compress %}</code> template tag to use Django Compressor. The compress template tag takes one required argument: The filter key from the <code>COMPRESS_FILTERS </code>dictionary that tells Django Compressor which filters to use for these files. </p>



<p>Notice, I placed a style block inside the compressor template tag—this will put the child template stylesheets inside the compressor to be bundled and minified. </p>



<p>Lastly, let’s create a child template and add some stylesheets to it.</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">{% <em>extends</em> 'base.html' %}

{% <em>load</em> static %}

{% <em>block</em> styles %}
&lt;link <em>rel</em>="stylesheet" <em>href</em>="{% static 'css/index.css' %}"&gt;
&lt;link <em>rel</em>="stylesheet" <em>href</em>="{% static 'css/additional.css' %}"&gt;
{% <em>endblock</em> %}

{% <em>block</em> content %}
&lt;h1&gt;Index&lt;/h1&gt;
{% <em>endblock</em> %}</code></pre>



<p>Perfect, now we can test it out in the browser. Save your files and navigate over to <code>localhost:8000</code> in your browser. Inside your developer tools network tab, you should see something similar to this:</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="201" src="https://engineertodeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-9.07.23-PM-1024x201.png" alt="Compressed CSS file shown in the network tab of the developer tools." srcset="https://engineertodeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-9.07.23-PM-1024x201.png 1024w, https://engineertodeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-9.07.23-PM-980x192.png 980w, https://engineertodeveloper.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-14-at-9.07.23-PM-480x94.png 480w" sizes="(min-width: 0px) and (max-width: 480px) 480px, (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 980px) 980px, (min-width: 981px) 1024px, 100vw"></figure>



<p>The bundled and minified CSS file <code>output.9a3d8d8fb748.css</code> is on line two. Awesome, Django compressor took our two child template CSS files, bundled them, and minified them—this will reduce network requests and speed up browser download and parsing times!</p>



<p>We can use Django Compressor to do the same with our JavaScript files too. In the next section, let’s learn how we can further optimize our template’s CSS files.</p>



<h2>Reducing Render-Blocking CSS with Media Attributes</h2>



<p>CSS files can quickly become bloated with a bunch of rules our page doesn’t need. For example, if someone accesses your site on a mobile device, they don’t need to parse the tablet and desktop styles before using the webpage. They only need the mobile styles.</p>



<p>Thankfully, we have a way around this with the <code>media</code> attribute. We can add a <code>media</code> attribute to the link tag to conditionally parse styles before rendering, depending on screen size. The other CSS files are still downloaded, but they are no longer render-blocking, meaning the browser doesn’t wait for them to load before rendering the webpage.</p>



<p>Let’s look at an example using our child template and base template. Inside the base template, define a new block called <code>mobile_styles</code>.</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">&lt;head&gt;
    {% <em>compress</em> css %}
    {% <em>block</em> mobile_styles %}

    {% <em>endblock</em> %}
    {% <em>endcompress</em> %}
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>



<p>Now, let’s add the mobile stylesheet in the child template.</p>



<pre><code lang="markup">{% <em>block</em> mobile_styles %}
&lt;link <em>rel</em>="stylesheet" <em>href</em>="{% static 'css/index-mobile.css' %}" <em>media</em>="(max-width: 520px)"&gt;
{% <em>endblock</em> %}</code></pre>



<p>If we test this out in the browser, we see that both mobile and desktop stylesheet are still downloaded, but only one was render-blocking depending on our screen size. If we resize the browser window, we will see the mobile stylesheet affect screen sizes below 520px.</p>



<p>Perfect, we are now loading less render-blocking CSS—this will improve our largest contentful paint and first input delay metrics.</p>



<h2>Conclusion</h2>



<p>Congrats on finishing the tutorial! You should now know how to optimize your Django template’s CSS and JavaScript using Django Compressor and reducing render-blocking CSS. </p>



<p>In the <a href="https://engineertodeveloper.com/faster-django-apps-optimizing-templates-part-2/">next tutorial</a>, we will look at optimizing images in our Django templates—images have a massive impact on page load speed performance.</p>

        <p>Published on: 2020-12-16</p>
        
<p>I'm going to consider a fairly unpopular idea: most efforts towards "explainable AI" are essentially pointless. Useful as an academic pursuit and topic for philosophical debate, but not much else.</p>
<p>Consider this article a generator of interesting intuitions and viewpoints, rather than an authoritative take-down of explainability techniques.</p>
<p>That disclaimer aside:</p>
<hr>
<p>What if almost every problem for which it is desirable to use machine learning is unexplainable?</p>
<p>At least unexplainable in an efficient-enough way to be worth explaining. Whether it is an algorithm or a human that is doing the explanation.</p>
<p>Let's define "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Explainable_artificial_intelligence">explainable AI</a>" in a semi-narrow sense, inspired by the DARPA definition, as an inference system that can answer the questions:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why was that prediction made as a function of our inputs and their interactions?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Under what conditions would the outcome differ?</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>How confident can we be in this prediction and why is the confidence such?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Why might we be unable to answer the above questions in a satisfactory manner for most machine learning algorithms? I think I can name four chief reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>Some problems are just too complex to explain. Often enough, these are perfect problems for machine learning, it's exactly their intractability to our brains that makes them ideal for equation-generating algorithms to solve.</li>
<li>Some problems, while not that complex, are really boring and no human wants or should be forced to understand them.</li>
<li>Some problems can be understood, but understanding in itself is different for every single one of us, and people's culture and background often influence what "understanding" means. So explainable for one person is not explainable for another.</li>
<li>Even given an explanation that everyone agrees on, this usually puts us no closer to most of what we want to achieve with said explanation, things like gathering better data or removing "biases" from our models.</li>
</ol>
<h2>I - Unexplainable due to complexity</h2>
<p>Let's say, physicists, take in 100 PetaBytes of experimental data, reduce them using equations, and claim with a high probability that there exists this thing called a "Higgs Boson" with implications for how gravity works, among other things.</p>
<p>The resulting Boson can probably be defined within a few pages of text via things such as mass, the things it decays into, its charge, its spin, the various interactions it can have with other particles, and so on.</p>
<p>But if a luddite like myself asks the physicists:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why did you predict this fundamental particle exists?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I will either get a "press conference answer" which carries no meaning other than providing a "satisfying" feeling, but it doesn't answer any of the above questions.</p>
<p>It doesn't tell me why the data shows the existence of the Higgs Boson, it doesn't tell me how the data could have been different in order for this not to be the case, and it doesn't tell me how confident they are in this inference and why.</p>
<p>If I press for an answer that roughly satisfies the explainability criteria I mentioned above, I will at best get them to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, the standard model is a fairly advanced concept in physics, so you first have to understand that and why it came to be. Then you have to understand the experimental statistics needed to interpret the kind of data we work with here. In the process, you'll obviously learn quantum mechanics, but to understands the significance of the Higgs boson specifically it's very important that you have an amazing grasp of general relativity, since part of the reason we defined it as is and why it's so relevant is because it might be a unifying link between the two theories. Depending on how smart you are this might take 6 to 20 years to wrap your head around, really you won't even be the same person by the time you're done with this. And oh, once you get your Ph.D. and work with us for half a decade there's a chance you'll disagree with your statistics and our model and might think that we are wrong, which is fine, but in that case, you will find the explanation unsatisfactory.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We are fine with this, since physics is bound to be complex, it earns its keep by being useful and making predictions about very specific things with very tight error margins, its fundamental to all other areas of scientific inquiry.</p>
<p>When we say that we "understand" physics what we really mean is that there are a few dozen of thousands of blokes that spent half their lives turning their brains into hyper-optimized physics-thinking machines and they assure us that they "understand" it.</p>
<p>For the rest of us, the edges of physics are a black box, I know physics works because Nvidia sells me GPUs with more VRAM each year and I'm able to watch videos of nuclear reactors glowing on youtube while patients in the nearby oncology ward are getting treated with radiation therapy.</p>
<p>This is true for many complex areas, we "understand" them because a few specialists say they do, and the knowledge that trickles down from those specialists has results that are obvious to all. Or, more realistically, because a dozen-domain long chain of specialists combined, each relying on the other, is able to produce results that are obvious to all.</p>
<p>As long as there is a group of specialist that understands the field, as long as those specialists can prove to us that their discoveries can affect the real world (thus excluding groups of well-synchronized insane people) and as long as they can teach other people to understand the field... we claim that it's "understood".</p>
<hr>
<p>But what about a credit risk analysis "AI" making a prediction that we should loan Steve at most 14,200$?</p>
<p>The model making this prediction might be operating with TBs worth of data about Steve, his browsing history, his transaction history, his music preferences, a video of him walking into the bank... each time he walked into the bank for the last 20 years, various things data aggregators tell us about him, from his preference about clothing to the likelihood he wants to buy an SUV, and of course, the actual stated purpose Steve gave us for the credit, both in text and as a video recording.</p>
<p>Not only that, but the "AI" has been trained on previous data from millions of people similar to Steve and the outcomes of the loans handed to then, thus working with petabytes of data in order to draw the 1-line conclusion of "You should loan steve, at most, 14,200$, if you want to probabilistically make a profit".</p>
<p>If we ask the AI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Why is the maximum loan 14,200$? How did the various inputs and their interactions contribute to coming up with this number?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, the real answer is probably something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Look, I can explain this to you, but 314,667,344,401 parameters had a significant role in coming up with this number, and if you want to "truly" understand that then you'd have to understand my other 696,333,744,001 parameters and the ways they related to each other in the equation. In order to do this, you have to gain an understanding of human-gate analysis as well as how its progress over time relates to life-satisfaction, credit history analysis, shopping preference analysis, error theory behind the certainty of said shopping preferences, and about 100 other mini-models that end up coalescing into the broader model that gave this prediction. And the way they "coalesce" is even more complex than any of the individual models. You can probably do this given 10 or 20 years, but basically, you'd have to re-train your brain from scratch to be like an automated risk analyst, you'd only be able to explain this to another automated risk analysts, and the "you" "understanding" my decision will be quite different from the "you" that is currently asking.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And even the above is an optimist take assuming the "AI" is made of multiple modules that are somewhat explainable.</p>
<p>So, is the "AI" unexplainable here?</p>
<p>Well, not more so than the physicists are. Both of them can, in theory, explain the reasoning behind their choice. But in both cases, the reasoning is not simple, there's no single data point that is crucial, if even a few inputs were to change slightly the outcome might be completely different, but the input space is so fast it's impossible to reason about all significant changes to it.</p>
<p>This is just the way things are in physics and it might be just the way things are in credit risk analysis. After all, there's no fundamental rule of the universe saying it should be easy to comprehend by the human mind. The reason this is more obvious in physics is simply because physicists have been gathering loads of data for a long time. But it might be equally true in all other fields of inquiry, based on current models, it probably is. It's just that those other fields didn't have enough data nor the intelligence required to grok through it until recently.</p>
<h2>II - Some problems are boring</h2>
<p>There is a class of problems that is complex, but not as complex as to be impenetrable to the vast majority of human minds.</p>
<p>To harken back to the physics example, think classical mechanics. Given the observations made by Galileo and some training in analysis, most of us could, in principle, understand classical mechanics.</p>
<p>But this is still difficult, it requires a lot of background knowledge, although fairly common and useful background knowledge and a significant amount of times. Ranging from, say, a day to several months depending on the person.</p>
<p>This is time well spent learning classical mechanics, but what if the problem domain was something else, say:</p>
<ul>
<li>Figuring out if a blotch on a dental CT scan is more likely to indicate a streptococcus or a lactobacillus infection.</li>
<li>Understanding what makes an image used to advertise a hiking pole attractive to middle-class Slovenians over the age of 54.</li>
<li>Figuring out, using l2 data, if the spread for the price of soybean oil is too wide, and whether the bias is towards the sell or buy.</li>
<li>Finding the optimal price at which to pre-sell a new brand of luxury sparkling water based on yet uncertain …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>Instructions&nbsp;for&nbsp;three operating systems are provided: macOS, Ubuntu Linux and
Windows. The selected tools are personal favorites and were hand picked to allow the
fastest development and to allow identical development flows (and thus seamless
environment switching) on the three operating systems. All tools used in this tutorial are
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software" target="_blank">free, open source software</a>
and can be downloaded and used without any issues. No programming experience is required,
as this tutorial is for absolute beginners.</p>

<h3 id="before-we-start-terminals">Before we start: terminals</h3>

<p>There are a few notes for absolute beginners that will make our path easier and faster to
understand: to stay short, the tutorial will only guide through the setup process, but
will not teach the C language; references for next steps will be given at the end; some
program downloads may be large and take some time.</p>

<p>Programming languages and textual commands are very different from spoken languages:
programs must be written in a very strict way. Miss a comma and the program will stop
working. The most important rule for a beginner is that the C language, like most other
programming languages, is case sensitive, that is, upper case letters are considered
distinct from lower case letters and one can’t be swapped for the other. Keep this in mind
when typing the code and when in doubt copy and paste it to make sure all symbols are
correctly written.</p>

    (typewriter-style terminal).
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’ll&nbsp;use&nbsp;the terminal emulator application to type textual commands. I’ll
succintly explain what each command does and will show each command written after a dollar
sign. The dollar sign represents the terminal emulator’s prompt symbol, and that’s the
usual symbol that the command line input program, called the shell, displays when waiting
for a command. For example:</p>

<pre><code>$ ls -l
</code></pre>

<p>In the above example, we type after the prompt symbol: <code>ls[space][minus]l</code>, then press
<code>[enter]</code> to execute. In this example, we execute the <code>ls</code> program (list directory) with
the <code>-l</code> parameter (a specific parameter for the program, changes the output mode to long,
or more descriptive). Same example, but also showing the resulting output in my computer:</p>

<pre>$ ls -l
total 7344
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users    9999 set 19 19:12 coffee-34251.svg
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users     347 set 19 19:12 coffee-34251.svg.license
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users   16805 set 19 19:12 favicon.ico
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users    3253 set 19 19:12 favicon.svg
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users   11665 out  2 18:49 index.html
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users   17833 set 19 19:12 not-coffee.svg
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users 2372085 set 19 19:12 radio.caf
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users 2656465 set 19 19:12 radio.mka
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users 2401864 set 19 19:12 radio.opus
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users    3263 out  2 16:48 site.css
-rw-r--r-- 1 hdante users    2166 set 19 19:12 square.svg
$ </pre>

<p>So,&nbsp;after&nbsp;running the <code>ls</code> program with the <code>-l</code> parameter, it shows the long
description of current directory and another dollar symbol appears at the end, it’s
waiting for a new command. Don’t worry about understanding this example, I’ll also add
references at the end for learning more about using Unix-style command-line tools.</p>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator" target="_blank">terminal emulator</a>.
    Modern terminals are software that emulate physical terminals.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Different&nbsp;procedures&nbsp;are required for each operating system. Pick the best one
for you. After installing, writing and running code will work the same way. We’ll write a
single cross-platform program that works on all three systems and build it using the same
cross-platform build tools.</p>

<h4 id="macos">macOS</h4>

<p>For macOS, only the terminal emulator comes installed with the operating system. The Apple
provided C compiler is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang" target="_blank">LLVM clang compiler</a>,
contained in the “Xcode command line tools” package. To install it, open the Terminal
application by opening the Spotlight search input, then typing Terminal (or find it in the
Utilities folder inside Applications). In the terminal emulator, type:</p>

<pre><code>$ xcode-select --install
</code></pre>

<p>The Xcode installation program will start. Follow the instructions that will appear and in
the end, the LLVM clang C compiler will be installed. You can check if it’s working by
executing it with the <code>--version</code> parameter:</p>

<pre><code>$ clang --version
</code></pre>

<p>For installing packages like build tools, text editors and libraries, we’ll install the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homebrew_(package_manager)" target="_blank">Homebrew package manager</a>,
which is the main Linux-style package manager for macOS. The package manager allows
single-command installing, configuring, upgrading and removing of packages from the
command line. Go to <a href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank">brew.sh</a> and access the
instructions there, or simply execute this command to download and install it:</p>

<pre><code>$ /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
</code></pre>

<p>Notice that this command is already more complex than the previous ones, downloading and
executing the install script from the Homebrew source code repository, and gives a hint on
the power and efficiency of the command line. Don’t worry trying to understand it, we’re
installing Homebrew exactly to make it easy to execute complex package installations.
[<strong>edit 20201214</strong>: It might be necessary to restart the Terminal App and configure the
search path after installing <code>brew</code> to be able to use it. When in doubt, check the
<a href="https://docs.brew.sh/">Homebrew documentation</a>.]</p>

<p>Now that Homebrew is installed, you may install packages with <code>brew install</code> and search
packages with <code>brew search</code>. Search and install the GNU nano text editor with:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew search nano
$ brew install nano
</code></pre>

<h4 id="linux">Linux</h4>

<figure>
  <a href="https://not.cafe/assets/2020/gcc-on-ubuntu.png" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://not.cafe/assets/2020/gcc-on-ubuntu.png" alt="gcc on Ubuntu">
  </a>
  <figcaption>
    Installing gcc on Ubuntu Linux.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We’ll&nbsp;use&nbsp;the apt package manager available in
<a href="https://ubuntu.com/" target="_blank">Ubuntu Linux</a> from the Debian family, but
other Linux distributions using, for example,
<a href="https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/how-manage-packages" target="_blank">yum</a>,
<a href="https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf/" target="_blank">dnf</a>,
<a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman" target="_blank">pacman</a>,
etc. will work in pretty much the same way. On Linux the
<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_blank">GNU Compiler Collection</a>
usually comes preinstalled, so we’ll use it instead of clang, but they work the same way.
Open a terminal by clicking the activities menu on the top left of the screen and writing
terminal in the search input (or click on the terminal icon in the favorites bar). In the
terminal emulator, write:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install gcc
</code></pre>

<p>Ubuntu Linux and most other distributions require switching to administrator (root) mode
to install programs, so we use the <code>sudo</code> program to execute <code>apt-get</code> in root mode (you
may also use the <code>su</code> program, if <code>sudo</code> is not installed). Type your password and follow
the instructions. In the end, check gcc:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcc --version
</code></pre>

<p>You may install packages with <code>sudo apt-get install</code> and search packages with <code>apt-cache
search</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ apt-cache search nano
$ sudo apt-get install nano
</code></pre>

<p>For other Linux distributions, use the appropriate package manager:</p>

<pre><code>$ yum search nano         # for RedHat Linux/CentOS
$ sudo yum install nano   # for RedHat Linux/CentOS
</code></pre>

<h4 id="windows">Windows</h4>

<figure>
  <a href="https://www.msys2.org/" target="_blank">
    <img src="https://not.cafe/assets/2020/msys2-website.jpeg" alt="MSYS2 website">

  <figcaption>
    <a href="https://www.msys2.org/" target="_blank">MSYS2 website</a>. MSYS2 is a
    toolkit for Windows development that contains Unix-style tools.
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For Windows we’ll use the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mingw-w64#MSYS2" target="_blank">MSYS2 toolkit</a>,
which provides a terminal emulator, the pacman package manager and a complete set of
Unix-style command line tools. Download the MSYS2 installer from
<a href="https://www.msys2.org/" target="_blank">www.msys2.org</a> and follow the
instructions to install the package. When installed, MSYS2 will provide three sets of
programs, which are selected whenever opening the terminal emulator. They are called the
MSYS2 shell, the MINGW64 shell (pronounced mingwee 64) and the MINGW32 shell. The MINGW64
shell is the appropriate one to develop Windows programs. The MSYS2 is appropriate for
managing MSYS2 itself and the MINGW32 is the 32-bit version that shouldn’t be used
anymore. After installing MSYS2 it’s necessary to immediatelly upgrade it. Open the MSYS2
shell and type:</p>

<pre><code>$ pacman -Syu
</code></pre>

<p>Follow the instructions and if requested restart the terminal emulator. On Windows we’ll
use the <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/" target="_blank">GNU Compiler Collection</a> C
compiler (gcc):</p>

<pre><code>$ pacman -S mingw-w64-x86_64-toolchain
</code></pre>

<p>After installing, to test gcc, you must use a MINGW64 shell. If you’re running the MSYS2
shell for executing pacman, open another terminal running the MINGW64 shell and type:</p>

<pre><code>$ gcc --version
</code></pre>

<p>From now on, we’ll assume that the MINGW64 shell is being used. Notice that pacman runs
normally both on MSYS2 and MINGW64 shells. You may install packages with <code>pacman -S</code> and
search packages with <code>pacman -Ss</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$ pacman -Ss nano
$ pacman -S nano
</code></pre>

<p>After installing the compilers, remember installing the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_nano" target="_blank">GNU nano</a> text editor:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install nano    # (or apt-get, or pacman)
</code></pre>

<p>Now, let’s create a new root directory to store this project and all future code:</p>

<pre><code>$ mkdir code
$ cd code
</code></pre>

<p>The first command above creates a new directory called <code>code</code>. If it already exists, it
will complain. Change the name if you prefer something else. The second command changes
the current directory to the <code>code</code> directory (the current directory is the directory used

December 16, 2020 | https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/the-tech-revolution-in-the-beauty-industry | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://codecoda.com/en/blog/entry/the-tech-revolution-in-the-beauty-industry">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="description">
<p>The beauty industry covers a wide range of submarkets – skincare, spas, fragrance, haircare, cosmetics, and makeup. For over two decades, the beauty industry has noted a drastic change in the way things run and how users get the products they want.</p>
<p>As technology evolves, beauty brands carry the burden of developing and fitting in products that are very tangible yet psychological to users. They adjust to users” personal preferences as commodities become more customized, and they move with tech trends to stay relevant.<br>You could wonder, how can the beauty industry use tech to their advantage? Beauty products are physical, sold in retail stores, and people physically apply them to their bodies. As the world leaped into new technological grounds, the beauty industry adapted gracefully. From <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/shopware-ecommerce">eCommerce</a></strong> to AI, outstanding innovations and entrepreneurship have swept across this industry during the last couple of decades. In this article, we would look at what in that period revolutionized the beauty industry.</p>
<div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>Social media</h4><p>We can’t talk about the revolution of the beauty industry without talking about social media. The penetration of social media into the daily lives of people is one of the major catalysts to the online boom of beauty products and lifestyle.<br>Social media brought the “influencer” and “following” culture, paving the way for a new form of brand marketing and beauty entrepreneurs. Social media platforms like Instagram helped brands cultivate a strong visual online presence to promote their products. The rise of influencers, who have turned into full-fledged entrepreneurs, has changed the way users engage with brands and discover new products. With YouTube, influencers showed consumers how to apply makeup, use each product, and recommend the best ones.<br>Some brands focus solely on online marketing, brand ambassadorship, and influencer power, shunning traditional marketing to push products that sell in hours. One such <em>internetpreneur</em> is one of the world’s most famous influencers and former youngest billionaire, Kylie Jenner. By focusing on her online power, Kylie Jenner created an extensively successful lipstick brand named after her – Kylie Cosmetics. A brand she built into a billion-dollar business and which earned her “the youngest billionaire” status.<br>Social media platforms like Instagram and Pinterest are tapping into the consumer culture trajectory, making influencers’ provisions to get consumers to their page and sell to them immediately. Instagram came up with the addition of Instagram Shopping, an option that provides a storefront for consumers to explore ‘best’ and ‘featured’ products. The option also allows consumers to make purchases directly from the Instagram platform. This opportunity means that everyone, including visual artists of all kinds, can quickly turn all their photos into product images.<br>Another interesting approach is the Pinterest’s <em>Shoppable Pin</em>, an option that lets consumers find a product pin and then tap it to visit the retailer"s website.<br>Social media platforms allow consumers to do reviews and add comments. Talking about their personal experiences on a particular feature or product provides an easy source of feedback for brands that need to connect to their consumers. Users could also rate a product, which is exceptionally important since most potential buyers actively seek it before making a significant and long-term investment in a purchase.</p>
</div></div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>E-Commerce</h4><p>COVID pandemic and lockdown issues immensely affected the beauty industry since the world couldn’t focus on beauty while people are more concerned with survival matters. But somehow, the industry pulled through and still clocks good revenue.<br>One of the beauty industry"s biggest strengths is using strong visuals to create digital experiences for users. Leveraging on this and <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/services/ui-ux-design">great UX</a></strong> (user experience), they create smooth digital experiences for users by making products available on online stores.<br>These online stores showcase as many products as possible for consumers to choose from. Customers can compare, analyze, and pay for the product right on the spot. Filters allow users to compare products based on price, ingredients, core technology, delivery time, and brand.<br>Detailed product descriptions allow users to read in-depth about a brand product and transparent customer reviews could be the push a consumer needs to lock on a product. With e-commerce, consumers have all the information they need to buy a product from the comfort of their homes.<br>Ecommerce platforms like Alibaba are tapping into the beauty industry by collaborating with big brands to create digital apps inclined towards beauty and skincare. In 2019, the collaboration between L’Oreal China and Alibaba led to the launch of the first AI mobile-based application for acne diagnosis. They also created Midnight Cream, the first consumer-to-business reverse innovation product.&nbsp; </p>
</div></div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>Augmented Reality (AR)</h4><p>Consumers are usually unsure about which products to try. They might also be worried if a particular product fits their skin tone and how it will look on them. Augmented reality is mostly seen as a technology for gamers, but beauty brands have incorporated this technology into mobile apps and e-commerce.<br>This technology allows users to see how products would look like on them. There is an entire collection of clothes, jewelry, eyewear, and makeup that users can try on without even leaving the screen.<br>Applications like Cosmia Makeup, developed by Skywell Software and Modiface owned by L’Oreal, Sephora Virtual Artists, are popular apps that use AR. They are a perfect blend of AI, and virtual assistance, tailored to meet users’ preferred tastes. They work in real-time, taking accurate face measurements so cosmetics can fit in the right spots.<br>AR isn’t just a cool technology. Driven by current digital styles, it works well with e-commerce and online engagement. It is an excellent way for brands to engage their users, letting them try out products before purchase. It boosts the buyers’ confidence to make purchases and reduces the possibility they experience remorse.</p>
</div></div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>Artificial Intelligence (AI)</h4><p>One of the issues consumers of beauty products have is finding <strong>the right fit</strong>. Skin tone, color, texture, age, and type are crucial factors when selecting the perfect match. Some brands like Rihanna’s Fenty Beauty have capitalized on the lack of skin color diversity inclusion to create and sell products with shades for all skin colors.<br>AI technology in the beauty industry has opened doors to more consumer personalization. This technology promises to find the ‘exact match’ to users. AI-powered beauty apps scan the skin and recommend the perfect beauty formula using powerful algorithms. Skincare routine, makeup combination, and other beauty routines can be set for particular consumers, using information from the person’s image.<br>Modiface Skin AI, an app owned by Modiface, detects skin changes such as dryness, dark spots, and discoloration.<br>L’Oreal and Alibaba’s Effaclar Spotscan is an AI-powered app that scans the face for acne. The application uses thousands of images of people with different skin types and acne issues. Thanks to the extensive database, the AI can effectively narrow down to the exact problem a person is experiencing. They also provide professional advice from an expert dermatologist on how best to treat that type of acne.<br>AI personalization isn’t just limited to skincare. There are smart mirrors like HiMirror, a skin detector, and a skin tracking mirror. A perfect blend of AR and AI stimulates up to five different lighting scenarios for various settings – office, mall, party, etc. These settings allow you to apply the right makeup for each occasion. You could also use AR to stimulate what your makeup would look like before you apply it.<br>Tmall Genie Queen is also an AI-powered mirror from Alibaba that auto-adjusts it’s lighting, recreating different makeup application modes. These smart mirrors also have a 3D effect, allowing you to see your makeup from different angles or a 360 rotation.<br>Haircare is not falling behind when it comes to <strong><a href="https://codecoda.com/en/tech-expertise/machine-learning-ai">AI tech</a></strong>. Choicify is an app from Henkel Beauty Care in Germany that allows users to choose the right hair color. The app is personalized to each consumer and provides the right solutions for hair affairs, recommending suitable products and customizations.</p>
</div></div><div data-appear-animation="fadeInUpShorter" data-appear-animation-delay="200"><div><h4>Virtual Assistants</h4><p>Virtual assistants for beauty brands can come in different forms, but notable are voice assistants who help users find the perfect product. They could also work through an entire makeup or skin routine with consumers, acting as guides.<br>Virtual assistants are AI-powered, allowing them to store personalized information about a user and using that information when needed. Because of their wide range of expert knowledge, they are quick resources for users who have challenges or need some questions answered immediately. They are a perfect way for brands to provide instant, around-the-clock customer solutions for their users.<br>Coty, a global beauty brand, worked with Google Assistant to launch a Clairol Color Expert. Clairol Color Expert is a hands-free, voice-activated guide at home for the hair color process. It helps users find the right hair shade product and care. Like all voice assistants, it activates when just saying ‘Hey Google, talk to Clairol.’<br>By creating this technology, Coty has provided a resource for consumers on all google enabled devices, speakers, and smartphones, thereby widening the reach of technology and innovation in the beauty industry.</p>
</div></div>
</div>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The beauty industry has catered to the needs of women for a very long time. They will also be catering to the needs of people for a long time to come. We must note that big beauty brands are not interested in diving into tech; neither do they see themselves as tech companies. But an industry or brand that is to stay relevant must work with current trends and technology, and the beauty industry is no different.<br>By incorporating …</p></div></div>

<p>Bad air is bad for you. The air purifier market, though, is a mess. Every purifier uses incompatible proprietary filters, presumably to lock you into buying replacements. How do we know these actually work? Few seem to publish lab tests. And why does it cost $100-$300 for a big plastic box with a fan and a filter inside?</p>

<p>It’s common to build DIY air purifiers by basically strapping a filter to a fan. I like the idea of these, but again, it’s hard to be confident they really work. There’s a few experiments out there, but not enough to make me comfortable. So I decided to do some experimenting of my own. I made a purifier, generated smoke, and measured how well it removes tiny particles.</p>



<p>If you’re in a hurry, this post says that if you strap two HEPA filters to a box fan, it will clear the air of basically all the particles we can measure, and it will do it faster than a commercial filter that costs twice as much.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_log.jpg" alt="in a large room the DIY filter does slightly better than the commercial filter"></p>



<h3 id="diy-purifier">DIY purifier</h3>

<p>My DIY purifier was <em>very</em> simple. (I don’t want to promote any particular brands here. Contact me if you want the exact products.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>A standard box fan. (Cost: $19)</li>
  <li>Two HEPA air filters, each approximately 32 cm x 22 cm and 5cm thick. (Cost: $35 for both)</li>
  <li>A bungie cord. (Cost: Free)</li>
</ul>

<p>Assembly takes about 30s. You put the filters on the intake side of the fan and strap them on with the bungie cord. Here’s a picture:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/filter_notape.jpg" alt="DIY purifier" max-width="60%" min-width="35%"></p>

<p>Timeless elegance and grace, it is not. I get the shakes just looking at that bit of crinkled filter.</p>

<h3 id="commercial-purifier">Commercial purifier</h3>

<p>As a comparison, I got a $100 air purifier from a well-known brand that’s intended for small rooms. It uses uses a single HEPA filter that’s about 25cm x 12cm and 4cm thick. Replacement filters currently cost around $25.</p>

<h3 id="smoke">Smoke</h3>

<p>It’s surprisingly hard to repeatedly generate a consistent amount of smoke. I tried burning various things (paper, cardboard) and found that the number of particles generated can vary by an order of magnitude, depending on the burn pattern. This is difficult to control and effectively random.</p>

<p>Ideally, I’d have liked to burn some food product like oil, since the kitchen is usually the biggest source of indoor air pollution. I couldn’t figure out a good way of doing this, either: You’d need to have the same amount of oil distributed in the same way and heated to the same temperature.</p>

<p>I finally settled on using incense. I cut sticks to the length of a standard credit card and then attached the ends horizontal to the ground. This seemed to be pretty consistent. In retrospect, I bet that burning toast in a toaster would work well. (I didn’t have one on hand.)</p>

<h3 id="measurements">Measurements</h3>

<p>I borrowed a cheap-ish ($100) air quality monitor from a friend. I think it’s made by some company in China and then re-sold by various white-label brands. I can’t figure out who the original manufacturer is. Based on data I’ve seen for the reliability of other air quality monitors, I wouldn’t trust the absolute numbers, but the I think the <em>relative</em> measurements should still be OK.</p>

<p>The typical measurement for particulate pollution is “PM 2.5” which is in units of μg/m³. This is intended to measure what you’d get if you did the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take a cubic meter of air.</li>
  <li>Filter all the solid particles out of the air.</li>
  <li>Keep only the solid particles that are are 2.5 micrometers (μm) or smaller.</li>
  <li>Weigh all the particles you kept in micrograms (μg).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some ways to interpret these numbers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The EPA says yearly averages should be below 12 and daily averages below 35.</li>
  <li>The average outdoor level ranges from 6 in Finland to almost 100 in Nepal. Rich countries are typically under 15. The highest levels are typically found in Asia and Africa.</li>
  <li>Cooking can easily cause PM 2.5 measurements to spike into the hundreds. I’ve observed myself that this can happen with only a small amount of visible smoke.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>

<p>Since the air quality monitor doesn’t log data, I used an ultra-hacky alternative: I set the monitor next to a laptop running a stopwatch. I then aimed a tabet at both of those screens and took a timelapse video. Finally, I manually transcribed the data by going to each minute marker in the data. (This was even more tedious than it sounds.)</p>



<p>I ran a first experiment in a tiny room of around 8 ㎥. Due to worries that wind from the purifiers might change the speed the incense burned, I placed it on the opposite side of a wall, with a gap of around 20 cm near the ceiling.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/setup_tinyroom.jpg" alt="tiny room setup"></p>

<p>I repeated the experiment once with no filter, once with a commercial filter, and once with the DIY filter. Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_linear.jpg" alt="smallroom measurements in linear space"></p>

<p>Things are a bit random around the beginning, probably due to the drifting of the smoke before it’s equalized in the room. With no filter at all, this spikes all the way to 1000 μg/m³, the maximum the instrument can show.</p>

<p>If we make the y-axis logarithmic, it becomes quite clear that the DIY filter is cleaning the air at a better rate. (This is the picture from the top of this page.)</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_log.jpg" alt="smallroom measurements in log space"></p>

<p>If we take the EPA’s threshold of 12 μg/m³, the DIY filter gets there in around 15 minutes, while the commercial filter take around 25 minutes.</p>



<p>Thankfully, I don’t spend most of my time in an 8 ㎥ room. Thus, I repeated the experiment in a large room of around 100 ㎥. Here there was no wall between incense and purifier. Instead I left around a meter of distance between the incense and purifier and the purifier and the monitor.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/setup_largeroom.jpg" alt="large room setup"></p>

<p>Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/largeroom_linear.jpg" alt="large room measurements in linear space"></p>

<p>There’s even more randomness around the beginning, probably just due to how the smoke drifts around. Based on the room volume we’d expect a peak concentration with no filter of around 80 μg/m³ = 1000 μg/m³ * (8/100). Reassuringly, this is pretty close to what we see.</p>

<p>The DIY purifier looks a bit better. If we plot in log space, it’s more clear that it is indeed filtering at a better rate:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/largeroom_log.jpg" alt="large room measurements in log space"></p>



<p>It’s common advice for DIY purifiers like this to seal around the edges of the filter so that all air must pass through it.  I share the intuition that this would help, but it’s hard to be sure: If you block airflow, you slow down the fan. This could be counterproductive.</p>

<p>In this case at least, experiment is easier than theory. I took packing tape and carefully sealed around the intake side.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/filter_tape.jpg" alt="DIY purifier with tape" max-width="60%" min-width="35%"></p>

<p>And the results are…</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/taping.jpg" alt="taping around the filter has no effect"></p>

<p>…nothing!?</p>

<p>This was unexpected. I thought the tape would help, but I wouldn’t have been surprised if it hurt instead. Instead, there’s basically no difference at all. I don’t know enough about fluid dynamics to even speculate about what’s happening here, so I won’t try.</p>

<p>There could be some weird quirk in how I ran this experiment. This doesn’t necessarily mean that all the advice to tape around the filter is <em>wrong</em>. However, I’ve never seen any experriments that show taping helps either.</p>



<p><strong>Cost.</strong> The DIY purifier isn’t dramatically cheaper than the commercial one, but I expect the filters would need to be replaced much less often. The commercial purifier uses a single filter with an area of 300 cm², whereas the DIY purifier uses two filters with a total area of around 1400 cm², and also slightly thicker. It’s reasonable to assume the DIY filters could remove ~4 times as many particles before replacement.</p>

<p><strong>Durability.</strong> One concern is that box fans aren’t meant to be used with filters attached and could wear out. This is reasonable. However, box fans are much cheaper than commercial purifiers, and I’ve been using this particular fan with various filters attached for several years now without issue.</p>

<p><strong>Electricity.</strong> The cost of electricity is another factor. Typical box fans seem to use around 55W, whereas commercial purifiers typically use 30-45W. If electricity costs $0.13 / kWh, the box fan would cost around $62 to operate 24 hours a day for a year, while a 30-watt purifier would cost around $34. Obviously, these numbers decrease if you run the purifier less. Some (more expensive) commercial purifiers have air quality sensors built in and automatically turn on only when needed.</p>

<p><strong>MERV or HEPA?</strong> Most people who build box-fan purifiers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_efficiency_reporting_value">MERV</a>-rated filters intended for furnaces. Commercial air purifiers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA">HEPA</a>-rated filters. Roughly speaking, HEPA filters are “better” in that they are rated to remove a higher percentage of particles in one pass. It’s not clear that HEPA filter will actual perform better when attached to a fan, though: A filter that catches fewer particles in one pass might still be better if it allows for faster airflow.</p>

<p><strong>That one video.</strong> If you’re reading this article after it was linked from some forum, I’d bet you that someone in the comments links to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH5APw_SLUU">this video</a> from the Michigan Sinus Center. I found this inspirational, but note a couple of things: First, while the description says they use HEPA filter, the video clearly indicates a MERV filter. Again, that’s not necessarily bad! They claim that around 90% of particles sized 0.3 microns are larger are eliminated in a single pass. That’s good, but not totally reassuring. The question is, does it remove 99% in two passes? If 90% of the particles in the ambient air were large and the filter only catches large particles, then additional passes would never get rid of the most dangerous small particles. This is why I trust HEPA filters a bit more: since they remove almost all particles in one pass, I’m confident they should remove almost all particles eventually. This is also why I strongly prefer experiments that actually measure particles removed from the air in a room, rather than just the air coming out of the purifier.</p>

<p><strong>Further questions.</strong> There’s a lot of things that further experiments could look at:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does the fan speed make a huge difference?</li>
  <li>How does the purifier compare to larger commercial purifiers?</li>
  <li>How do MERV-rated furnace-type filters compare under the same conditions?</li>
  <li>How can it not matter if there’s tape around the filters!?</li>
  <li>Does fan speed matter? (I always ran the box fan at maximum speed.)</li>
  <li>Is it better to put the filters on the intake or outtake side of the …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

                <p>
                    Before the digital revolution and user-centric approach, the concept of accessible, new forms of
                    transportation was the future vision of what life could be like. With the rapid growth of
                    technology, mobile devices, enhanced battery capacities, wide Internet connection, investments in
                    new unexplored forms of service delivery, and quick social adaptation in the last ten years we have
                    witnessed a great transformation.

                <p>
                    Raising enthusiasm boosted consumption and proved that rapid adaptation is possible and widely
                    accepted. New economic models have begun to take into account sharing concepts and value the
                    tangible benefits of such solutions. In a sharing economy, not used assets such as parked cars and
                    extra bedrooms can be rented out. We transferred from owning to renting. And this concept widely
                    approved first by Uber users moved to other transport areas offering new possibilities. In the

                    described as a clearly urban phenomenon. To achieve economies of scale for shared economy services
                    satisfactory population density is required. Moreover, these services are seen as an extra option,
                    not a replacement for traditional sectors. Ridesharing is used along with public transportation in
                    cities.

                    With the growing success of rented items and services, new forms of transportation options come to
                    the market. The mobility concept grew to form a comprehensive ecosystem offering numerous moving
                    variants, such as city bikes, electric scooters, car rides, ticket purchasing options, city traffic
                    monitoring, planning the most convenient route, parking options, integrated payments, and available
                    charging options for ‘e’ users. All available in real-time from the mobile app on one’s phone. This
                    progress developed the term

                    On a high-level, the MaaS ecosystem includes transport infrastructure, transportation services,
                    transport information, and payment services. Within the ecosystem, the common objective is the
                    delivery of a seamless mobility experience and transportation network improvement by utilizing the
                    benefits of each service - public and private. Besides, other participants such as local authorities
                    or data administration companies can collaborate to smooth the operation of the services and improve
                    their profitability.

                <p>
                    MaaS as a definition is described as

                <p>
                    One of the MaaS ecosystem examples was presented by the Siemens Mobility Division in 2016 for
                    Tampere City, Finland. The ecosystem is build of 4 main elements: service providers; a
                    business-to-business (B2B) platform; mobility retailers; and the users. The intention of the project
                    was to unite the existing and upcoming transport services with the operations of the local
                    paratransit services.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A similar approach on a high level was presented by König project ‘Mobility As A Service for Linking
                    Europe’. Four different levels define the public and regulatory level, the transport and logistics
                    service providers level, the mobility service level, and the end-user level. On the basis of similar
                    concepts and definitions, a framework for Mobility as a service was developed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From a business perspective, MaaS is described by Kamargianni and Matyas in the paper ‘The Business
                    Ecosystem of Mobility-as-a-Service’[1](2017) as ‘the wider network of enterprises that influences how a
                    dominant company, in this case, the MaaS provider, creates and capture value’.

                <p>
                    To support theoretical premises on shared mobility, a survey conducted by McKinsey&amp;Company (2017)
                    provides some insight into the consumer’s opinion on ride-hailing and car-sharing. Respondents were
                    asked how their usage of ride-hailing and car-sharing services will change within the next two
                    years. In both cases, over 60% responded that it will increase or increase significantly. Shared
                    mobility is mostly favored in urban areas, but seems to be less attractive for running errands or
                    multi-stop shopping trips.

                <h3 id="what-is-e">What is ‘e’ all about?</h3>

                <p>
                    We are an integral part of the next global transformation, where alternative fuels and green energy
                    takes charge. The concept explained above has been extended with ‘e’ - a possibility to travel in an
                    eco-friendly way, where ‘e’ stands for electric solutions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Electric Mobility as a service combines Mobility as a Service (MaaS), Electric Mobility Systems
                    (EMS), and Shared Electric Mobility Services (SEMS) [2]. As a concept eMaaS operates upon MaaS,
                    where the last one became one of the complementary components. With that defined, all MaaS
                    participants become, as a consequence, eMaaS attendees. Providing they offer electric mobility
                    solutions.

                </p>

                <p>
                    Electric Mobility System (EMS) covers technologies (batteries, charging technologies, drivetrains,
                    and EVs), infrastructure (physical and organizational of charging stations, electricity grid,
                    information and communication technology), and users (manufacturers, suppliers, end-users, service
                    providers, governments, and agents).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Shared Electric Mobility Services’ (SEMS) applies to a new economy implementation, where instead of
                    ownership there is an on-a-need basis share connected by the technology with users and providers.
                    SEMS replies to the environmental, social, financial, and transportation-related benefits that had
                    already been correlated to emobility and shared mobility practice connecting both. Five business
                    approaches are proposed:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Membership-based (e.g. e-bike sharing, e-car sharing, e-ridesharing, e-ride hailing, e-scooter
                        sharing, e-bus sharing),
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Peer-to-Peer(e.g. e-car sharing, e-bike sharing, e-scooter sharing),
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Non-membership-based (e.g. e-car rental, elimousine rental),
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        For-hire (e.g. e-car/bike/scooter sharing, e-ridesharing e-carpooling),
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mass transit systems (e.g. e-Public Transport, airport autonomous shuttles).
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    As a part of a wider concept, combined with two other components MaaS &amp; EMS, together provides
                    multiple eco-friendly transportation possibilities. Successful implementation of such a concept
                    requires multi-level support, well-designed system architecture, and an extensive network in public
                    structures.
                </p>

                <h3 id="user-centric">User-centric approach</h3>

                <p>
                    The user-centric approach will always be foreground. It applies to the development of the widely
                    recognized concept of e-mobility as a service. From accessible payment methods for single ticket
                    purchasing, subscriptions, to well-developed charging networks and various means of transport
                    access. At each stage of the proposition should be declared value.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are still in the early stages of what could be called e-Mobility as a service. Most customer
                    journeys are under development, and achieving overall flow is still in its infancy. There is a lot
                    of research to be done, but there is room for the general necessary approaches. Each of the

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>I’ve been considering these concepts for a few years, and after spending a few years living in a small, economically-challenged community - I started to develop some ideas on how to power food sovereignty alongside traditional food sources like foraging, hunting, and fishing.</p>

<h2 id="distributed-small-scale-food-production-a-potential-solution">Distributed small-scale food production: A potential solution</h2>

<p>I realize this may be an idealistic approach, assuming people will be willing to take on the burden of learning new skills like animal husbandry, the many aspects of gardening, and the inevitable food preparation skills that are required to manage the outputs of such a system.</p>

<p>This being said, I think this could work for a minority of interested folks, and allow a more refined approach to a more accessible, possibly larger and possibly communal systems.</p>

<p><img src="https://permapeople.org/blog/assets/veg-garden-stella-de-smit.jpg" alt="Vegetable garden by Stella de Smit"></p>

<h2 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h2>

<h3 id="requirements">Requirements</h3>

<p>This list will need to be specific to each region such a system would be rolled out in. For this system to work, we should define each required <em>_niche_</em> or <em>_zone_</em> (medicine, staple, protein, etc) as well as the <em>_method_</em> (intensive row-based or food-forest style) based on an amount of land/space available.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>The system should</strong> <strong><em>not</em>:</strong></li>
  <li>Be a replacement for the grocery store</li>
  <li>
    <p>Be expected to feed a whole family exclusively</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>The system should:</strong></li>
  <li>Follow the principles of permaculture</li>
  <li>Be supplementary to regular food purchasing/foraging/consumption</li>
  <li>Be easy to set up and get rolling (beginner crops for beginners)</li>
  <li>Maintenance should decrease year-over-year</li>
  <li>Material inputs should be free and should utilize waste products (compost, greywater) whenever possible</li>
  <li>Output should increase year-over-year</li>
  <li>Be scalable and easy to replicate</li>
  <li>Be easy to substitute items based on personal preference/needs</li>
  <li>Should support a range of diets</li>
  <li>Each element should serve two or more functions</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="elements">Elements</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Staples - Something that is substantial, and worthy of being a main course. At least 2 crops in case of failure, most often annuals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Medicine - Teas, herbs, healthful foods. Can easily grow 3+, often perennials</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Fertilizer/Mulching - Beneficial to growth or maintenance of the entire system (preferably edible)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Greens - Important for health, and fulfilling an important niche in western diets</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Supplementary - Snacking foods, processable foods for jams or sauces</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Protein - Most likely and accessible item is egg production, but not legal everywhere</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Surplus - For use in feeding animals, wildlife, crafting, or trading with neighbours</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 id="example-system">Example system</h3>

<p>Based on my experiences living and growing in the temperate coastal rainforests (zone 7b), I’ve developed this example/conceptual list to complement the locally available forage:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Staples (2+)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Spaghetti squash / Acorn / butternut - for its many benefits (groundcover, mulch, seed production, hardiness)</li>
      <li>Potatoes - would require creative integration if using <em>_food forest_</em> method</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Medicine (2+)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Mint / lemonbalm / lavender / rosemary</li>
      <li>Currants / Seabuckthorn</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Fertilizer/Mulching (1 per season)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Comfrey</li>
      <li>Clover / alfalfa</li>
      <li>Pigeon peas / siberian peas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Greens (2+)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Arugula</li>
      <li>Kale</li>
      <li>Giant red mustard</li>
      <li>Bok choi</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Supplementary (2)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Cucumber</li>
      <li>Apple tree (on Pacific crab-apple stock) / currant / blueberries / strawberry / raspberry</li>
      <li>Tomatoes</li>
      <li>Chives</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Protein (either/or)</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>3x hens / ducks</li>
      <li>Chickpeas / beans</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Surplus</strong></li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Double-up on at least 2 choices from above</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-considerations-to-be-developed-further">Other considerations (to be developed further)</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How can we empower economically-challenged communities through the use of food sovereignty?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would it take to convert the average non-gardener to start growing a sufficient amount of food?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What would it take for the average non-gardener to benefit (enough to support) from an intensive, cooperative, multi-cultured field-cropping or food forest system?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How far can we scale such a system if it does exist?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the required inputs —  like space, water, and fertilizer?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What are the minimal outputs to make this a worthwhile endeavor?</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>

<p>Get creating! As they say:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The best time to plant a tree, is 10 years ago. The second best time is now.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Unknown</li>
  </ul>

<p>Your beautiful app deserves more subscribers, do you agree? If so, there's good news. Offer Codes can help you convert more of your free users into paying. If you're interested in streamlining the money-making part of your engineering marvel, I invite you to dive into a few ways how to achieve it with me below.</p><p><strong>In the next 15 minutes, you’ll find out how to maximize visibility of your app by…</strong></p><p>1. Making students your best ambassadors<br>2. Leveling up your PR<br>3. Getting more attention with Giveaways<br>4. Rewarding loyal customers<br>5. Cross-promoting your apps</p><p>But first, let's quickly clarify the code diversity:</p><p>It's alright to be confused. I was too. There are 4 different App Store code types as of now, and they serve different purposes. I studied Apple's maze of docs, so you don't have to, and explained it in simple words.</p><h3 id="what-are-offer-codes-first-of-all">What are Offer Codes, First of All?</h3><p>They look like this: FMWPN78P7TTHLW3MKE (quite long, yep). You can share them with a prospective subscriber, so they redeem the code, and get your subscription with a time-limited discount.</p><p>What's particularly great about offer codes is that you can adjust literally everything: how much $$$ off your regular subscription price you want to offer, for how long they'll be paying the discounted price, and finally, for how long your offer will be redeemable.</p><p>It’s safe to call Offer Codes the most versatile marketing tool offered by the App Store since its release in November 2020. You can use them to attract new subscribers, win back the churned, or retain the existing. Limited at 150K codes per quarter per subscription, you'll barely feel a shortage. I doubt those who will are reading this 😁 And, Tokens will help you carefully dispense those codes—one per user—so you squeeze the most revenue out of that quarterly limit.</p><h3 id="but-we-ve-already-had-promo-codes-">But we've already had promo codes...</h3><p>Not quite the same thing. The difference is as vast as that between Apple Calendar and <a href="https://flexibits.com/fantastical">Fantastical</a>. Both offer and promo codes can be distributed outside the app via QR codes, on blogs, in ads, on social media, etc. Users can redeem them via App Store or convenient <a href="https://tokn.co/_0zRVOgLO">tokn.co</a> links. Promo codes always give a 100% discount, i.e. if you give away a promo code, a person will get your subscription for free for its entire duration. Say, you have a $9.99/year sub. Give a promo code to this sub, and they will get 1 year for free. That's it—no other options. </p><p>With offer codes, you set your own rules. 30% off your $3.99/month subscription for 2 months? You got it. Free access to an annual subscription for 1 month? Not a problem. </p><p>You can generate just up to 100 promo codes per subscription per 6 months, whereas <strong>offer codes are limited to 150,000 per quarter per subscription</strong>! </p><p>Such a steep difference is easily justifiable by what you want to use these two for. Promo codes are good for driving extra sales indirectly. Send out free copies of your app to influencers and journalists. If they like and mention it, you'll get extra downloads that are yet to be converted into subscriptions. Offer codes are more about helping you to convert potential subscribers directly, without the influencer middleman. You wouldn't reach out to 150K journalists, would you? However, you may have that many potential customers.</p><p>Last but not least: promo codes expire in 28 days after generation, and offer codes—when you decide (max. 180 days).</p><h3 id="i-ve-also-heard-something-about-introductory-and-promotional-codes-">"I've also heard something about Introductory and Promotional Codes..."</h3><p>Yes, that's a thing, too. However, their marketing potential is rather limited as they can only be distributed within your app, so forget about running a 50% off giveaway or sending a free copy to that Italian Apple journalist using these two.</p><p><strong>If you're more into comparison tables, here's one from Apple itself:</strong></p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/0-5RklpeUMNfQ-gqaa.png" alt="iOS App Store's Offer vs Introductory vs Promotional Codes comparison table"></figure><h2 id="let-s-translate-those-codes-into-revenue">Let's Translate Those Codes into Revenue</h2><p>Although I'm not a business mastermind who created apps that would be making billions of dollars like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/2/4/21123057/tinder-1-billion-dollars-match-group-revenue-earnings">Tinder</a>, I hope that a few strategies from my arsenal may be handy for fellow developers. They helped us at Gikken grow our best-in-class Mac and iOS translator app—<a href="https://gikken.co/mate-translate/mac/?ref=blog-oc">Mate</a>—4x in the last 2 years. We're a bootstrapped <a href="https://gikken.co/about?ref=blog-oc">three-person company</a> and we're careful about every dollar we make and spend. I'll be very happy if any of my takeaways will help you make more off of your awesome app!</p><p><em><strong>Note: I'll be using <a href="https://gikken.co/tokens/?ref=blog-oc">Tokens</a> in my examples—the app that we made to help you generate offer and promo codes faster, and your users redeem them with ease—by just clicking on a link.</strong></em></p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/oc-article-3-1.png"><figcaption><strong>Left: promo code. Right: offer code. </strong>Don't make your users google how to redeem a code—Tokens wraps codes in tokn.co links that are easy to redeem.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="1-making-students-your-best-ambassadors">1. Making students your best ambassadors</h3><p>Many of us know firsthand that students are on a tight budget. However, it doesn't mean they don't deserve good software. For years, companies have been adjusting their regional prices according to purchasing power. You can think of student discounts as an even more caring income-based price adjustment.</p><p>On the upside for your app business, students are some of the most socially active folks out there. They meet a lot of people in classes, their dorm, at parties, etc. Make them your loyal users and you may get your best ambassadors. That surrendered 30% of your sub price will pay off over and above in new users they'll bring in. People love bragging with things they love. If your app is good (and I'm sure it is!), take down the price hurdle for students, so they can start loving it, and spreading the word.</p><p>When we launched a 50% discount for students and teachers on <a href="https://gikken.co/mate-translate/mac/?ref=blog-oc">Mate</a>, it took off instantly. Many students were discovering Mate but couldn't afford it. An easy-to-get discount took out this barrier. Now, edu sales account for around 15% of our revenue.</p><p>It's worth mentioning that in order to make it work like a charm, you need to automate it. It makes sense to test whether there's interest for your app among students by just directing them to your support email first, but it won't scale. It will hold back too many from claiming it (too much effort: come up with a message, write it, attach a student ID, wait for a reply, redeem a code). On the opposite, typing in a student discount and instantly getting a discount is totally frictionless and as fast as it just could be. No emailing or waiting involved. You sell it to them the moment they want it. Also, you certainly don't want even more emails in your support inbox.</p><p>Here's how we made it with Mate: user enters their student email, we validate it using <a href="https://github.com/leereilly/swot">this</a> fabulous library from GitHub, and if it's actually .edu, send a discount code to that address.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/xScreenshot-2020-12-14-at-17.06.06.png.pagespeed.ic.N8tvf_WQxR.png"><figcaption>Claim your 50% in 5 seconds by just using your student email.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether you go the easy way, and offer discounts via email support, or the harder but more efficient way—automate it. You may find Tokens helpful in dispensing those discounts. </p><p>Apple made creating offer codes a two-step story: they are stored in campaigns, or just offers. You set up an offer once and then you generate codes for it. You can top it up with more codes at any time. </p><p>First, I want to include one static link into my student emails, so it dispenses codes automatically—one per student. On the screenshot below, I create an offer that gives 50% off my subscription for 1 year:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-09-at-14.19.20.png"><figcaption>Select a subscription you want to offer a discount on in the sidebar → and select Create an Offer from the pull-down next to the + button.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Then, I want to add 1,500 codes using that + button:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/xScreenshot-2020-12-14-at-22.03.10.png.pagespeed.ic.mXwOSbmOAK.jpg"></figure><p>Now, I can copy the offer link and include it in my student emails:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-14-at-17.36.41.png"></figure><p>I don't have to mingle with managing a database of codes, picking unused ones for each email, generating and re-uploading new codes every now and then. It all runs smoothly without my attention now. Using Tokens's redemption status, I will know when I need to top up my student campaign. Then, I'll just hit that + button and add a few more thousands of codes. </p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/xScreenshot-2020-12-14-at-22.06.03.png.pagespeed.ic.Ralj58wSp7.png"><figcaption>Thanks, Gikken.</figcaption></figure><h3 id="2-level-up-your-pr">2. Level up your PR</h3><p>It's old news that a few powerful folks can multiply your reach by thousands. In other words, get an influencer to like your app, and they might share it with hundreds of thousands of their readers. How do you get them to like it? You show it to them. If you can run into them at WWDC, perfect—do it in person. If you can't (and in 2020, you can't), send them a friendly email (aka pitch) explaining why their readers must love your app.</p><p>The key to any good pitch is playing up how easy it is to test the product. Influencers and journalists get dozens of requests like yours. Even if the pitch is half-baked but it's super easy to play around with the actual product and the product is super good, you up your chances by a lot. Since subscription-based apps are technically free, they can test drive it for free, true. If they seriously want to write about you, they'll need access to all features, though. Including a promo code when sending out a pitch has always been a good tone. And offer codes aren't changing anything fundamentally here. The good part is that you have 15,000 times more offer codes than promo codes, so you'll barely feel short of them. Also, giving a promo code meant that the journalist would get your premium version for the entire duration of the subscription. With offer codes, you can easily adjust it.</p><p>My jaw dropped after we made <a href="https://gikken.co/tokens/talking-tokens/ryan-jones-from-flighty-and-weather-line/?ref=blog-oc">our interview</a> with Ryan Jones who 50x'ed traffic for Weather Line with Tokens. The power of doing good PR is often undervalued.</p><p>To start blasting out my pitches, I want to create an offer—free 1 month trial:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/xScreenshot-2020-12-14-at-18.22.37.png.pagespeed.ic.iTgwAMT01R.jpg"></figure><p>Add a bunch of codes by clicking that +, and then I can copy a code, and even name it not to forget who it went out to:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/xScreenshot-2020-12-14-at-21.51.50.png.pagespeed.ic.P87CPgfQcm.jpg"></figure><p>Let's keep the fingers crossed:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/Screenshot-2020-12-14-at-22.21.01.png"><figcaption>Disclaimer: I discourage you from using this pitch template if you actually want to get reviewed.</figcaption></figure><p>OK, actually, I'll know for sure whether my titanic pitching efforts have paid off:</p><figure><img src="https://blog.gikken.co/content/images/2020/12/xScreenshot-2020-12-14-at-21.53.52.png.pagespeed.ic.rEqXU3GyQ2.jpg"></figure><h3 id="3-get-more-attention-with-giveaways">3. Get more attention with Giveaways</h3><p>It's no big news that people love free or discounted stuff. They stand in hour-long lines, click links for it, upvote and repost it. Remember Black Friday: people hoard discounted goods while …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div target="_blank"><p>A couple of words about Blender. Simply put, Blender is a 3D creation suite. However, it’s also free and open-source, which provides more transparency and reliability to its professional users.</p><p>Today, many UX/UI designers require animation and 3D creation tools to deliver stunning designs for various software. Just like for any other software development agency, web design and visual content are what can be easily demonstrated and makes us stand out on the market. So we’re constantly working to keep it that way.&nbsp; That’s why our designers also study 3D animation and video editing.&nbsp;</p><p>A couple of years ago, I made research and found out Blender is mature enough for professional use. Since then I've been studying and using it in my work and now pass my knowledge to the colleagues in the design department.</p><p>The tutorial below is the first in the series, and below I present a short crib to keep at hand after watching.</p><figure id="w-node-bfe8ff51f8a7-7a0a8b78"><p><iframe allowfullscreen="true" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tcU_iZT-hbQ"></iframe></p></figure><p>With this video and blog post you’ll be able to create the next image:</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd3487994dd492353e2a0aa_4Ne1fdFQqqlsnFhKBt0AaFOF6awoxIa6P5i5yVstKtRWffCyrCdJrLSf07nwgaQIh1HFr-sZk6GycDTfT5sVqtorVtv7OVf13wPB6QW8ilNvIUEYSoli8MlhXhLbCgSQjrFKHQNB.png" alt=""></p></figure><h2>Working With Views in Blender</h2><p>Press and hold the&nbsp; Tilde (~) symbol on your keyboard and a menu will pop up, where you can choose a view: just point at it and release the button. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd34878d85fdc54a45caeda_GVbVGpaBsoe4f10p-xCjlAj23VPt3f3KJYPMtYICwSTCdScKdgPYt5xSmX_7i0myUH9ajdDJS5kycxXeHgAnlAKtwy93zDzNPFP9MhGd2aTV5kaAXVdshMgJW8OPGBI45nnVnPg7.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>You can also quickly switch the views by switching numbers 1, 2, 3 on the nav pad. They are already programmed for changing the view, but usually, it’s more convenient to use the mouse to change views.</p><p>By the way, there is also a 5th button on the navpad. It is a switch button to perspective or orthography. You can also switch to an orthographic view. That is, it has no perspective deformations. You might need it to fully understand the shape of an object without distortion.&nbsp;</p><p>Upon clicking it again, it returns to the previous view.&nbsp;</p><p>Orthography lets you work in the isometric view, but don’t forget that the camera is at the top left, and you’ll be rendering what the camera is showing.&nbsp;</p><h2>Camera view control</h2><p>To control the camera, you use the middle mouse button (the wheel). Press it and move the mouse to rotate the camera. If you’re going to hold the SHIFT button in addition, the camera will be moved around instead of rotating. If you’re going to hold the Ctrl button instead, the scene will be zoomed in or out on mouse movement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, you can press SHIFT + ~. Then, configure the camera view as you wish by rotating the mouse and using keys W, A, S, D, Q, E:</p><ul role="list"><li>W – forward</li><li>A - backward</li><li>S - left</li><li>D - right</li><li>Q - up</li><li>E - down</li></ul><p>As for our practice, we usually set the camera location and angle to zero, then we move it along the Y-axis – that’s the most convenient way of working with simple scenes. If you’re doing, say, animation, details for the depth of field might force you to use the camera in other ways.</p><h2>Working with objects</h2><p>Adding objects can be done through Shift+A or through the Add button at the top.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd34878081db5b6853166a7_TbhfjutbIieqsQE4EENTyesttgBkPDrlDGNIl5CBSTBLMZB0TjF4Ngv6d6D9p2sJh2sudM6U-Ad3LGnE0bJbUEZw2N9uZ_1Feccg5OfcKgVQLYF88jSLHwErILyqmIkkU6m82fhj.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Use “G” to move objects, “R” to rotate them, and “S” to scale them. If you press “G” or “R” or “S” + the axis button (X, Y, Z), the movement, rotation or scaling will be linked to the selected axis. Linking to an axis is useful when you need to move or rotate objects with precision.&nbsp;</p><h3>Modeling 101</h3><p>Blender has a few modes. For the basic modeling purposes, let’s review two of them.&nbsp;</p><p>In the object mode, you can select an object or a few, and in edit mode you, well, you edit it.&nbsp;</p><p>Use the “TAB” key to switch to the editing mode.</p><p>Vertices and edges together make a surface. In the editing mode, you can press “1”, “2”, or “3” to switch to vertices, edges, and surfaces correspondingly.</p><p>Sometimes it is easier to edit an object when it’s transparent – for that, press Shift+Z.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd34878d85fdc79385caedb_mp92e1FMHuvpgtDGTSUA279cCw0ZeyRlcS1CwX10PdvzGsJzZdsYrhIlyz75xIFnjj4QeNXFeun3lVl-eE99yxVaXRLW9YumuRHOaQ0mPsPAiqtej-zrA7vfFTo62QyJOHRAEZDt.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Here you can also move, rotate and scale any vertex, edge, or surface using the “G”, “R”, and “S” buttons and the axis button. Or use the corresponding buttons on the panel on the left.</p><p>Note: check out extrusion: press “3” to switch to the surface mode and press “E” to squeeze the object out.</p><p>If you need more geometry, select the object and press Ctrl+R in the edit mode. This command will make a cut and add geometry.&nbsp;</p><p>To delete the object, press Tab, exit the edit mode and move to the object mode. Then, simply press Delete. If you’re in the edit mode, you can also press A to select everything and then press Delete.</p><p>The combination of Ctrl+R and scrolling allows adding more segments to the object.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd34878988e80bcac873b83_Ge8YwQHclsLGD3_cIjSP8Up298Wzvty3q2zeLAlAlN1HOhjtalKWzj5wnQ46o5RO45-GAOfRAoaPPd68T5hd0bRrVCkCiqkBsXTevGZfD4mNxFP1_DtrLb_59-ynG4DTEPL6Ztjv.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>When you’re adding an object – say, a torus, – an object setup panel will appear. It is important to set parameters in it right away. Otherwise, if you do some other modifications, the panel will disappear and any changes won’t be saved.</p><h3>Example: how to make a donut-shaped object</h3><p>Place a torus. Switch to the top view. Select half of all the vertices as shown in the picture below. For that, make the object transparent with Shift+Z, otherwise, only the top vertices will be selected. Delete them. Use Shift+Z to cancel the transparent mode and you’ll see that you have a half-torus now. </p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd3487827b70d6b8e7d60e4_TC4Rjxm0Ld1766CnxTFRd6CacKHtL6IUvXMlKu5qW0IIYB1IeL4EMRFxe1Q3mbXOIfiiwSJZhETcvoVNjIvjTVhw140q4CEo0Lr6X6j5gQ6nH0mHVn7EUs7xwg5IveYXk72HJJgf.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>If you find it too low-poly, you can go into the editing mode, select everything (A), and then enable subdivision with the right mouse button.&nbsp;</p><p>However, simply doing it won’t be enough to make an object smooth. When you have your object selected, find and press the wrench icon on the menubar. You’ll see object modifiers, among which you’ll want to select the subdivision surface to edit its parameters.&nbsp;</p><p>The Render parameter is visible only during rendering.</p><p>The Levels Viewport parameter is responsible for what is seen now.&nbsp;</p><p>When you adjust smoothing, don’t go too far with your experiments. In our case, initially, we had only 420 rectangles. However, with smoothing equal to 3 there were already 26,000 rectangles. Increasing smoothing even more will probably make your computer lag or even unresponsive at all.&nbsp;</p><p>So when you do smoothing, complicating the mesh, or changing geometry, don’t overdo it.&nbsp;</p><p>Notice: when you’re working with modifiers, you can adjust them as long as you don’t have the Apply button pressed. After that, you can only undo your action and change the necessary modifiers again.&nbsp;</p><p>When you click on a wrench and add a modifier, you can also find the Solidify modifier as well. It works properly only in the object mode. With Solidify, the main parameter is thickness. You can add random thickness. For instance, applying to a cylinder will turn it into a pipe.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd3487918d56c00f3046deb_uAxv4TtLIR1-csxJqTF99f0PHXDFJVhlfnwu8QyO9r09r2Ozslk6Y_MbwzP3XjguVzQs2W5QXNcb4CqDjN-7a_7BlNHu3eywTY_mM5EVUealeWc6JM_S0kkCD7uhXKgfB6kt1wl9.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>These are the basics of making really simple objects.</p><h2>Introduction to materials</h2><p>Let’s first create a sphere via Shift+A &gt; Mesh.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, enable shade smooth via using the right mouse button click to display it normally.</p><p>When you’re in the viewport, you can hold the Z button to see the solid display, or press Shift+Z to switch to the wireframe.</p><p>Press Shift+A and add light. You can select from multiple types of light sources, and then manipulate them just like ordinary objects to put them wherever you need.&nbsp;</p><p>When you render them, your computer may slow down.&nbsp;</p><p>Notice: if you notice squares around your object when you rotate it, that’s fine. To hide them, select the Solid mode.&nbsp;</p><p>Click World, a red button with a red planet on it on the right of the interface. The Color option defines the color of your world, which will also affect your objects. Note that the color will be seen only in the Rendered mode, so you might want to split the screen in order to see the Render and a perspective of the object simultaneously.</p><p>Click the sphere, and in the bottom right corner, you’ll find a menu with a ball icon. It refers to material properties. Click New. Then in the parameters list, choose a contrasting color so that the object could be visible. There are many other parameters that you can learn on your own; we won’t pay our attention to it now.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5c755d7d6fa90e6b6027e74c/5fd34879d15acb30e049def9_PLZ3_Fndy2UA-3mwwLOWFeZGsOS3_KsPF1U0EJ5GtJLRov_H6XHkXP-x2eCfY-b4nCk0qDYQtJVCzT2dm2GytqrkFdA4Uq04XSdHFD4cUAAtFMOBsUWDI4GRIwG6DPn23IFjwosS.png" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now you can use the Shader editor to add anything you want, from generated textures to gradients.

               <div id="richtextcss"><p>While Iâ€™m no expert in the matter at all (I took art classes in Grades 7-9 if that counts for anything), I have, on more than one occasion, engaged in friendly debate over what constitutes art. Mona Lisa? art. <a href="https://i.redd.it/5ugttvttk3a31.jpg">SrGrafoâ€™s</a><span> comic strips? art. This stupid red square?Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/xoLRCSD.png"></p><p>Okay, now youâ€™re really pushing it. I wouldnâ€™t call this art per seâ€¦ maybe more like a colored shape. Of course, you might disagree. But hear me out! For I think Iâ€™ve reached a pretty foolproof classification system. You see, there are primarily two things to consider in distinguishing whether something is art:Â&nbsp;</p><ol>
<li>The intention</li>
<li>The affirmation</li>
</ol><h3>The Intention</h3><p>In other words, was it the intention of the artist to create a work of art in the first place? If not, then it shouldnâ€™t be considered art. I find it hard to believe that a passerby could possess such authority as to claim the contrary. What a load of hubris to believe that they know better than the person who made it as to what that thing is in the first place. For instance, an artistâ€™s rough sketch, uneaten banana, or slab of marble, donâ€™t qualify as art. They are but a roadmap, a light snack, and a slab of marble in that order. It may be called art only <em>after</em><span> the artist chooses to declare it so. Not</span><em><span> before. </span></em><span>Of course, itâ€™s all in the </span><a href="https://youtu.be/3YFeE1eDlD0?t=5"><span>branding</span></a><span>. Until something is branded as art, weâ€™d likely not even know it exists. The art that we see and hear about, are precisely those things that the artist has chosen to brand as such.</span></p><p>Ok, so we have just established that for an artist, art is something to be declared, just like <a href="https://youtu.be/C-m3RtoguAQ?t=67">bankruptcy</a><span>. But what happens after they claim something to be art? Well, we can agree, but we donâ€™t have to.</span></p><h3>The Affirmation</h3><p>Art is transactional in nature. Someone creates what they claim as art, and someone affirms that fact. Since the one claiming and affirming are one and the same in the special case of the artist, they are indeed correct when they label it art. It is art <em>to them, </em><span>but this might not be the case for me, for you, or Winnie the Pooh. Â&nbsp;</span></p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/YgQ4LwX.png"></p><p>Just as the artist reserves the right to declare it, we (individually) reserve the right to reject it. We donâ€™t have to take their word for it, they could be crazy for all we know! They could call their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/06/arts/design/banana-art-basel-miami.html">banana taped to a wall</a><span> art. But, no. Theyâ€™re wrong. Itâ€™s just a banana - thatâ€™s a light snack remember? Regardless of what modern/contemporary art museums may wish to suggest, we alone decide whatâ€™s art, and whatâ€™s not (woohoo title drop). It is not up to them to tell us what to think. The people in this video for instance seem to suggest those white paintings to be art.Â&nbsp;</span></p><div><p><iframe frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="true" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9aGRHOpMRUg?showinfo=0"></iframe></p></div><p>But they are not the definitive authority. They are merely an intermediary facilitating this discourse on behalf of the artist. This is often the source of disagreement when it comes to recognizing art: when someone presumes their beliefs regarding art more valid. Those people are what I like to call <a href="https://youtu.be/S_k2BXefHNc?t=4">wrong</a>.</p><p>No one elseâ€™s opinion matters. Not the art dealersâ€™, the museum curatorsâ€™ or the money launderersâ€™. Just your opinion, and the artistâ€™s. When there is an apparent consensus between you and the artist, then it <em>is art</em>. On the contrary, although we may respect the artist, if what was displayed merely an abundant lack of skill, then we may concede it to be in fact really, <strong>really</strong> bad art. So bad in fact that it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptote">asymptotically</a> reaches a threshold known as <em><u>an eyesore</u></em> in the limiting case as x approaches infinity, where x is my apathy for figuring out how to continue this math metaphor.Â&nbsp;Â&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/33HEwLL.png"></p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>For something to be considered art, the artist has to intend it, and we have to accept it (until then, it exists in an indeterminate state of limbo). This generally means that we need to recognize some level of skill, however minimal, by judging the effort required to create it. People may suggest otherwise, but you have the final say when it comes to art: it is your right. So stop worrying about what others think. Donâ€™t let someone else tell you what is and what isnâ€™t art.Â&nbsp;</p><p>Â&nbsp;</p><h3>Appendix: examples of what is and what isnâ€™t art</h3><p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KmeDZqO.png"></p><p>P.S. As general rule of thumb, if you canâ€™t find it in an art class, itâ€™s not art!</p></div>

			<p>I’ll never forget my first Sloan Sports Analytics Conference. &nbsp;It was an event I’d wanted to go to since I first heard about it as the nerve center of the sports analytics world. &nbsp;I walked the halls with people whose articles and algorithms I read&nbsp;religiously. &nbsp;But that is not what made it memorable. &nbsp;No, what made it memorable was the horde of undergrads following Jeff Luhnow around like he was the Pied Piper.</p><p>I don’t get paid by anyone to do sports analytics, so I suppose it’s a bit presumptuous for me to write a post about getting a job in sports analytics. &nbsp;But I have worked for many years in the analytics space more broadly, and I know a thing or two about labor markets.</p><p>So if you are an aspiring GM, I hope these tips can help you to pursue your dreams in the most efficient way possible. &nbsp;And if you are Jeff Luhnow, I hope this will help you avoid&nbsp;paper cuts from resumes whipped at you&nbsp;by the horde.</p>
<h3>Do some analytics using publicly available data</h3><p>Go&nbsp;analyze it. &nbsp;Like right now. &nbsp;Finish reading this post, subscribe to our newsletter, follow Lacrosse Reference on Twitter, and then go do it.</p><p>The most disappointing thing about Sloan for me was the lack of novel analytics. &nbsp;The student presentations were great because they demonstrated new ways of looking at old things. &nbsp;But the teams, the ones who actually pay people to do this stuff, were conspicuously quiet. &nbsp;Which makes sense; why tell the whole world, and all your competitors, what you are doing to gain an advantage?</p><p>And it was even more disappointing because the people that those teams employ are, in many cases, the ones that advanced the field in the first place. &nbsp;John Hollinger is a great example, but I can point to a dozen people in front offices who were hired because they did great work in their spare time. &nbsp;Such is the draw of doing analytics within the front office that most teams simply hired the best amateur analytics minds because they were the ones doing the best work. &nbsp;For their part, I suspect they wanted to work for the teams because they could be involved in decision-making and have access to internal-only data sets. &nbsp;Certainly nothing wrong with that.</p><p>So to sum up the history of sports analytics: 1) nobodies made a name for themselves using public data and publishing online and 2) teams hired said nobodies. &nbsp;If you aren’t on GoDaddy right now registering a domain name, I have no more advice for you. &nbsp;Do some analytics, write about what you did, post it on the internet. &nbsp;If you create interesting stuff, people will see it, and if you are dogged/clever, the right people will see it. &nbsp;And if it’s going to help them gain an edge against their competitors, they will hire you. &nbsp;(How’s that for grossest oversimplification ever?)</p><p>When I’ve hired people into analytics roles (albeit not in sports), I didn’t want to hear about degrees, GPAs, or other resume elements. &nbsp;I wanted to hear about side projects that demonstrate passion and capability. &nbsp;Publishing your own work hits both of these boxes.</p><p>(And be thankful that you are dealing with such clean data <strong><em>(1)</em></strong>)</p>
<h3>Focus on storytelling and writing skills, not machine learning</h3><p>Don’t get me wrong, machine learning is great. &nbsp;And deep learning is even greater. Powered by a huge explosion of annotated data, these techniques enable truly awesome new capabilities. &nbsp;But you have to be smart about when to apply advanced statistical techniques and when to use…algebra. &nbsp;I’d bet that 99% of the sports analytics that will confer any sort of competitive advantage are basic averages and regressions. &nbsp;We are simply not trying to solve the sort of classification problems that the more sophisticated techniques excel at <em><strong>(2)</strong></em>.</p><p>So if not advanced statistical modeling, what is the skill set should you hone? &nbsp;The simple answer is storytelling.</p><p>Throughout my consulting career,&nbsp;the most important lesson I’ve learned is that the success of an analytic is wholly dependent on the story that it is packaged in. Put another way, I’d rather have a simple, less insightful, model that is packaged in an effective story than a model that nails some sort of prediction but can’t be communicated easily. &nbsp;Unless you are already the GM, you are going to have to convince someone to act based on the insight that your models have generated. &nbsp;You cannot do this unless you are an effective storyteller.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is not something that you can take a Coursera course to learn. &nbsp;Storytelling is the poster-child for soft skills. &nbsp;Fortunately, it’s something where practice makes perfect. &nbsp;Explain to your grandparents what PER or WAR means. &nbsp;Think about how you would translate analytical content to&nbsp;someone who didn’t know what numbers are. &nbsp;Draw a sketch representing an analytical concept. &nbsp;Incorporate analytical insights into James Harden fan-fiction.</p><p>Just don’t assume that the people you need to convince will inherently understand what you’ve done, even if it seems obvious to you.</p>
<h3>Make sure you are solid with SQL, Python, R, and some sort of data viz</h3><p>Statistical modeling is the sexy skill (how crazy is that?) within the analytics space. &nbsp;That’s how people build self driving cars and beat world champions in Go. &nbsp;But successful analytics have to stand on three legs: data, algorithms, and storytelling/visualization. &nbsp;In truth, you can get away without having sophisticated algorithms, but you can’t get away with a poor data foundation or a poorly packaged insight. &nbsp;Don’t skimp on the plumbing of your analysis!</p><p>And unless you are joining a massive data organization, you’ll probably be responsible for all three things. &nbsp;They want you to be Ben Zobrist, not Mark Trumbo. &nbsp;That could mean using SQL to store&nbsp;and clean data on Monday. &nbsp;Then writing an R model on Tuesday. &nbsp;Then taking the results of that and using&nbsp;Python&nbsp;to format&nbsp;the results into a Tableau-ready input file so that you can build a visualization dashboard on Thursday. &nbsp;And you’d better be able to 1) do all those things or 2) be familiar enough that you can figure them out via StackOverflow.</p><p>I’m not suggesting that you must be an expert in all of these areas, but you have to be competent enough to know how to tackle a given problem or requirement. &nbsp;If you are someone who has a strong background in modeling, you should focus your learning cycles on the data engineering piece or the storytelling piece on the backend. &nbsp;If you are a data engineer, make sure you are considering whether there is a better algorithm out there relative to you hacking something together. &nbsp;And as we discussed above, don’t sleep on the importance of packaging your insights into a story that makes them easy to digest and act on.</p><p>In other words, to get a job in sports analytics, you’ve got to be a jack-of-all-trades.&nbsp; I realize that is still somewhat vague. And that is why I have started the Sports Analytics Academy. If you think you would benefit from some help in getting started, <a href="https://lacrossereference.com/sports-analytics-academy/">check it out</a>.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ol>
<li>The biggest challenge in consulting projects that include modeling is data availability/quality, by far. &nbsp;Even when the data is system generated, it’s often unclear what each field means. &nbsp;Sometimes they give you a data set that is only a subset of the population. &nbsp;Or the company changed how they collected the data half way through. &nbsp;Awareness of these pitfalls is crucial to being an effective advisor because if you ignore them, it’s easy to create an analysis that is misleading. &nbsp;But you, aspiring data-GM, are lucky because sports data doesn’t typically suffer from these same issues. &nbsp;For one, almost every relevant piece of game information is posted on the internet, where millions of people can alert providers to data quality issues. &nbsp;The simple fact that the data is public is a huge advantage because you don’t need to ask permission to analyze it. &nbsp;(You’d be surprised how unhelpful data people are&nbsp;when they think you are upstaging them.)</li>
<li>&nbsp;One of the most frustrating things about deep learning, and machine learning more broadly, is the requirement that you have a lot of annotated training data to teach the models with. &nbsp;To be fair, I’m not frustrated with the techniques, but with the fact that people consistently gloss over this requirement when they talk about using deep learning in models. &nbsp;Facebook can develop these great models because they have a decade and a half worth of data from billions of users uploading photos and tagging them. &nbsp;Google was able to make advances with their speech recognition because their models are amazing, but also because every time they got a dictation wrong, users would correct it before hitting send. &nbsp;You shouldn’t say yes when someone asks you whether machine learning could help predict something unless they are also committing to providing the money or people/time to annotate a sufficiently large data set.</li>
</ol>

December 16, 2020 | https://confused.ai/posts/rust-bpf-target | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://confused.ai/posts/rust-bpf-target">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="__next"><section><div><article><div><p>When I created this blog back in September my goal was to post at least once
a month. It's December now and you're reading my second post, so I'm not exactly
off to a great start. 🤔</p><p>Things have been busy on the Rust BPF front though! At the end of October I
began working on a blog about the current state of things, exactly one year
after I started getting involved. While doing that I finally started feeling
inspired enough to try and add a BPF target to rustc, something that had been
on my todo list for a very long time but never managed to find the time to work
on.  (<em>Aah... if only someone wanted to sponsor all this work... wink wink!</em>)</p><p>A couple of weeks ago I finally sent a <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/79608">pull request</a>
to get the new target(s) merged. The changes were pretty straightforward, with the
only unexpected thing being that I ended up having to write
<a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker">https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker</a> - a partial linker needed to enable
rustc to output BPF bytecode.</p><p>I'm going to tell you why I had to write the linker in a moment, but first,
let's start with looking at how clang - the de facto standard BPF compiler -
compiles C code to BPF.</p><h2>How BPF projects are compiled with clang</h2><p>BPF doesn't have things like shared libraries and executables. Programs are
compiled as object files, then at run-time they're relocated and loaded in the
kernel where they get JIT-ted and executed.</p><p>Because of that, and because for a long time function calls were not allowed so
everything had to be inlined, BPF programs written in C are typically compiled
as a <strong>single compilation unit</strong>, with library code written in <a href="https://github.com/cilium/cilium/tree/master/bpf/lib">header
files</a> and included with
<code>#include</code> directives.</p><p><img alt="clang BPF compilation model" src="https://confused.ai/static/bpf-linker-clang.svg"></p><p>This compilation model is simple and effective: <strong>one compilation unit</strong> goes
in, <strong>one object file</strong> comes out. Because BPF programs tend to be small,
recompiling the whole source code on every change is generally not an issue.
Since everything gets compiled together, there's <strong>no need for linking</strong>
separate compilation artifacts. <em>(You see where this is going?)</em></p><h2>How Rust projects are compiled</h2><p>Rust uses a different compilation model. Code is split into crates. Crates
can't be lumped together with <code>#include</code> directives, they are always compiled
independently as <strong>one or more compilation units</strong>.</p><p>Consider the following example:</p><pre><code><span>alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ cargo tree
</span>app v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/app)
<!-- -->└── dep v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/dep)
<!-- -->
<!-- -->alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ cargo build
<!-- -->   Compiling dep v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/dep)
<!-- -->   Compiling app v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/app)
<!-- -->    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.19s
</code></pre><p><code>app</code> is an application crate that depends on a library <code>dep</code>. When building,
the following happens:</p><p><img alt="Rust compilation model" src="https://confused.ai/static/bpf-linker-rustc.svg"></p><p>The rust compiler is invoked twice: first to compile the <code>dep</code> crate as a rust
library, then to compile the <code>app</code> crate as an executable. When the <code>app</code> crate
is compiled, the <strong>pre-compiled</strong> <code>dep</code> crate is provided as input to the
compiler via the <code>--extern</code> option.</p><p>This compilation model always produces <strong>multiple object files</strong>, which then
must be <strong>linked</strong> together to produce the final output. The rust compiler uses an
internal linker abstraction, whose implementations spawn to external linkers
like <code>ld</code>, <code>lld</code>, <code>link.exe</code> and
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#linker-flavor">others</a>.</p><p>Therefore, to add a new target with this model we need a linker for the target.
Since clang never links anything when targeting BPF though, it turns out that <code>lld</code> -
the LLVM linker - can't link BPF at all. So I wrote a new linker.</p><h2>A new (partial) BPF linker</h2><p><a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker">bpf-linker</a> takes LLVM bitcode as
input, optionally applies target-specific optimizations, and outputs a single
BPF object file. The inputs can be bitcode files (<code>.bc</code>), object files
with embedded bitcode (eg <code>.o</code> files produced compiling with
<a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#embed-bitcode">-C embed-bitcode=yes</a>),
or archive files (<code>.a</code> or <code>.rlib</code>).</p><p>The linker works with anything that can output LLVM bitcode, including clang.
There are a couple of reasons for taking bitcode as input instead of object
files.</p><p>Only a subset of Rust (just like only a subset of C) can be compiled to BPF
bytecode. Therefore bpf-linker tries to push code generation as late as
possible in the compilation process, after link-time optimizations have been
applied and dead code has been eliminated. This avoids hitting potential
failures generating bytecode for unsupported Rust code that is actually
unused (eg, parts of the <code>core</code> crate that are never used in a BPF context).</p><p>Another reason is that the linker might need to apply extra optimizations like
<a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker/blob/d890b113ffe612dcba51cc7d23a14fabd8198318/src/bin/bpf-linker.rs#L104">--unroll-loops</a>
and
<a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/bpf-linker/blob/d890b113ffe612dcba51cc7d23a14fabd8198318/src/bin/bpf-linker.rs#L108">--ignore-inline-never</a>
when targeting older kernel versions that don't support loops and calls.</p><h2>Not one but two BPF targets!</h2><p>The rustc fork at <a href="https://github.com/alessandrod/rust/tree/bpf">https://github.com/alessandrod/rust/tree/bpf</a> includes two new
targets, <code>bpfel-unknown-none</code> and <code>bpfeb-unknown-none</code> which generate little
endian and big endian BPF respectively. The targets automatically invoke
bpf-linker so with that fork, compiling a BPF project with Rust is finally as
easy as:</p><pre><code><span>alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ cargo build --target=bpfel-unknown-none
</span>   Compiling dep v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/dep)
<!-- -->   Compiling app v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/app)
<!-- -->    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.98s
<!-- -->alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ file target/bpfel-unknown-none/debug/app
<!-- -->target/bpfel-unknown-none/debug/app: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, eBPF, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped
</code></pre><p>Getting the targets merged will probably take a while, but worry not! With a
little trick, you can use the linker to <em>compile BPF code with stable Rust
already today!</em></p><p>I made bpf-linker implement a <code>wasm-ld</code> compatible command line. Since rustc
already knows how to invoke <code>wasm-ld</code> when targeting webassembly, it can be
made to use <code>bpf-linker</code> with the following options:</p><pre><code><span>alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ cargo rustc -- \
</span>        -C linker-flavor=wasm-ld \
<!-- -->        -C linker=bpf-linker \
<!-- -->        -C linker-plugin-lto 
<!-- -->   Compiling dep v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/dep)
<!-- -->   Compiling app v0.1.0 (/home/alessandro/src/app)
<!-- -->    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.68s
<!-- -->alessandro@ubvm:~/src/app$ file target/debug/app
<!-- -->target/debug/app: ELF 64-bit LSB relocatable, eBPF, version 1 (SYSV), not stripped
</code></pre><p>Let's see what those options do:</p><ul><li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#linker-flavor">-C linker-flavor=wasm-ld</a>
tells the compiler that the linker supports the same command line options as <code>wasm-ld</code></li><li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/codegen-options/index.html#linker">-C linker=bpf-linker</a>
configures bpf-linker as the linker to spawn</li><li><a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustc/linker-plugin-lto.html#linker-plugin-lto">-C linker-plugin-lto</a>
tells rustc to pass LLVM bitcode to the linker</li></ul><p>And voilà! Go compile some BPF with stable rust now 🎉</p><h2>What's next</h2><p>bpf-linker is obviously new and needs more testing. Over the next few weeks I'm
going to add more unit tests and try it on more Rust code. I'm also thinking of
trying to link the whole Cilium BPF code with it just to test with a large,
complex code base.</p><p>While working on the rustc target, at some point I went off on a bit of a
tangent and ended up making some changes to LLVM and the kernel so I'm going to
try and finish those off. They are needed to implement the
<a href="https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html#llvm-trap-intrinsic">llvm.trap</a> intrinsic
so <code>panic!()</code> can be implemented in a generic way, instead of having to resort
to program-specific hacks like jumping to an empty program with
<code>bpf_tail_call()</code>. I'll probably do a whole separate post about that.</p><p>Finally, after my <a href="https://confused.ai/posts/intercepting-zoom-tls-encryption-bpf-uprobes">last post</a> I
received some truly great feedback! I was especially pleased to hear from a
couple of companies that are using BPF and that are considering using it with
Rust.</p><p>I was equally pleased to see that there's a group of people developing BPF in C
that feel strongly that I'm wasting my time and that Rust brings nothing over
C, being BPF statically verified, not needing the borrow checker etc.  They gave
me inspiration for a post I'm hoping to publish soon, which will cover why I
think that Rust has the potential to become as central to the BPF ecosystem as it
is central to WebAssembly development today. Until next time!</p></div></article></div></section></div></div>]]>

<p>Web and browsers are evolving fast!</p>



<p>Many optimizations we did few years are ago now outdated or not recommended.</p>



<p>Delivering Google Fonts to get maximum performance has also changed recently as browsers implemented new features. </p>



<p>I’ve already written a blog post on optimizing Google Fonts. This post is specifically on why you should self-host Google Fonts.</p>

<h2 id="outdated-performance-arguments">Outdated Performance Arguments</h2>



<h3 id="argument-browsers-will-already-have-google-fonts-cached">Argument: Browsers will already have Google Fonts cached</h3>



<p>When you embed a Google Font, it first downloads a CSS file from “fonts.googleapis.com” and then downloads font files mentioned in that CSS file from “fonts.gstatic.com”.</p>



<p>Only font files downloaded from “fonts.gstatic.com” has a cache period of 1 year. The main CSS file only has 24 hours of cache lifespan.</p>



<p>“Browsers will already have Google Fonts cached”, yes, but<strong> to serve that cached font, the browser needs to download a CSS file every 24 hours</strong>, that too is render-blocking in most websites!</p>



<p>If that didn’t convince you enough, here is one more 😉.</p>



<h4 id="new-cache-partitioning-in-browsers-for-privacy">New “Cache Partitioning” in browsers for privacy</h4>



<p>Chrome and Safari have implemented something called “Cache Partitioning” or “double key caching”.</p>



<p><strong>In simple words, files cached by website A will not be available for website B</strong>. When a <strong>website A </strong>downloads a resource from “example.com/script.js”, cache it, and another <strong>website B</strong> tries to download the same file, it will have to download it again.</p>



<p>So a Google Font downloaded by a website will not be available for another website in the browser cache.</p>



<p>Under the hood, the browser uses a key to cache files. Usually, the cache key is the URL of the file. But with cache partitioning, the URL of the website which requested the file is also included in the cache key.</p>

<p><strong>Without Cache Partitioning</strong></p>

</div>



<div>
<p><strong>With Cache Partitioning</strong></p>

</div>
</div>



<p>You can read more about cache partitioning in Chrome here: <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/10/http-cache-partitioning" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaining security and privacy by partitioning the cache.</a></p>



<h5 id="browser-implementation-of-cache-partitioning">Browser implementation of Cache Partitioning</h5>



<p>✅ Chrome: since v86 (October 2020)<br>✅ Safari: since 2013<br>🚫 Firefox: from v85 (January 2021)</p>



<p>Browsers like Edge, Opera, Brave uses Chromium engine, so expect this feature in other browsers soon.</p>



<p>Also, note that <strong>Chrome and Safari alone has a market share of ~80% in browsers.</strong></p>



<h3 id="argument-google-fonts-delivers-optimized-fonts-based-on-device-browser">Argument: Google Fonts delivers optimized fonts based on device/browser</h3>



<p>Yes, Google delivers different fonts based on the user-agent.</p>



<p>But as long as you deliver self-hosted Google Font in<strong> “woff2” format, you’re targeting ~96% of the browsers.</strong></p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="321" src="https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1024x321.png" alt="image 2" srcset="https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1024x321.png 1024w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-300x94.png 300w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-768x241.png 768w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1536x482.png 1536w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-380x119.png 380w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-800x251.png 800w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2-1160x364.png 1160w, https://cdn.wpspeedmatters.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/image-2.png 2029w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px"></figure>



<p><strong>Only Internet Explorer and Opera Mini don’t support “woff2”</strong>. In that case, you can add <strong>“eot” as a fallback</strong> and still get all advantages of self-hosting.</p>



<p>Here is the sample code:</p>



<pre><code>@font-face {
  font-family: 'Poppins';
  font-style: normal;
  font-weight: 400;
  src: url('../fonts/poppins-v15-latin-regular.eot?#iefix') format('embedded-opentype'), /* IE6-IE8 */
       url('../fonts/poppins-v15-latin-regular.woff2') format('woff2'), /* Super Modern Browsers */
}</code></pre>



<h3 id="argument-google-cdn-is-faster">Argument: Google CDN is faster</h3>



<p>If your website on good hosting or has CDN and has enabled HTTP/2, self-hosting will outperform Google CDN. Because the browser doesn’t have to make extra DNS lookups, SSL handshakes etc and reuse existing HTTP/2 connection.</p>



<p>When you self-host and inline Google Fonts, the browser can immediately start to download the font after receiving the first HTML. You can also leverage preload functionality.</p>



<p><a href="https://medium.com/@thegreengreek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sia Karamalegos</a> has written a great post on comparing the difference: <a href="https://medium.com/clio-calliope/making-google-fonts-faster-aadf3c02a36d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Making Google Fonts Faster⚡</a>.</p>

<figure><img src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2802/1*JPlj6igUcBeqfGUul4hIUA.png" alt="Image for post" loading="lazy"><figcaption>With Self-Hosting</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="is-it-legal-to-self-host-google-fonts">Is it Legal to Self-Host Google Fonts?</h2>



<blockquote><p>“Yes. The open-source fonts in the Google Fonts catalogue are published under licenses that allow you to use them on any website, whether it’s commercial or personal.”</p><cite>Google Fonts – <a href="https://developers.google.com/fonts/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FAQ</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>In fact, Google itself recommends to self-host Google Fonts for complete control like preloading. It’s mentioned in one of their YouTube videos:</p>



<figure><div>
<p><iframe title="Web performance made easy (Google I/O '18)" width="1200" height="675" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mv-l3-tJgGk?start=1490&amp;feature=oembed" data-lazy-method="viewport" data-lazy-attributes="src"></iframe></p>
</div></figure>



<h2 id="how-to-self-host-google-fonts-in-wordpress">How to Self-Host Google Fonts in WordPress</h2>



<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/host-webfonts-local/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OMGF</a> plugin can self-host Google Fonts. But I found it hard to use. We’ve to search the fonts or auto-detect by opening pages manually.</p>



<p>If you’re using <a href="https://flying-press.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FlyingPress</a>, turn on “Optimize Google Fonts”. It will take care of self-hosting, combining and everything for you!</p>

<p>The sound emitted by keystrokes can potentially be used to perform a side channel attack for guessing the text being
typed. This page runs a program that demonstrates such type of an attack.</p>

<p>First, type some text in the canvas below to train the prediction model. Don’t type super fast - it’s recommended to try
a <em>Hunt and Peck</em> style of typing first to at least get some positive results. The program will try to predict keys
which have been pressed at least 3 times.</p>

<p>When ready with typing the training data, click the <em>Pedict</em> button, wait for the model to train and continue typing
outside the browser window. The program will continuously try to guess what is being typed by only analyzing the audio
capture from the page.</p>

<p>Currently, the code is not very portable, so please read the requirements below and make sure you meet them.  Also, this
is a proof-of-concept and probably won’t work effectively in all environments.  It does work pretty good on my setup
though - iMac, Filco mechanical keyboard, built-in mic.</p>

<p>Sometimes, when I’m waiting on trains, I imagine myself jumping onto the tracks, hitting the third rail, and frying to a crisp, just before the train arrives to crush my smoldering corpse.</p>
<p>Or </p>
<p>When my car passes over a bridge and I feel the urge to jump in the river or even throw my phone over the bridge.</p>
<p>But that’s just me…</p>
<p>Right?</p>
<p>Or do you have those thoughts, too?</p>
<p>There have been many names for it throughout time.</p>
<p>Edgar Allen Poe called it, “The imp of the perverse.”</p>
<p>Freud called it, “The Death Drive.”</p>
<p>Others have referred to it as the “High Place Phenomenon.”</p>
<p>But it’s more commonly referred to as the “Call of the Void” – or “L’appel du vide,” if you want to sound awesome when you say it:</p>
<p>It’s possible that this is actually a miscommunication of our survival instinct – i.e., instead of taking these thoughts as a warning that we wish to harm ourselves, the “Call of the Void” may actually be affirming your own will to live.</p>
<p>I mean, I’ve thought through the train scenario I described above more than a thousand times (give or take). And I can’t tell you how many times that feeling has manifested when I’ve been near a cliff or on top of a skyscraper.</p>
<p>And I am definitely not alone.</p>
<p>And yet, if you’re reading this right now, it’s highly unlikely that you’ve ever followed through on any of those “calls.”</p>
<p>Neither have I.</p>
<p>Though sometimes I do get this rush of adrenaline right after.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s the reaffirmation of the will to live they speak of – or at least a manifestation of it…</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5563" role="main"><div><div><div><p>A <a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/371/bmj.m4381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new study has found</a> that elderly patients who underwent emergency surgery on their surgeon’s birthday had significantly higher 30-day mortality rates than patients whose surgery took place on any other day of the year. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>The 30-day mortality rate (defined as death within 30 days after surgery)&nbsp;for the “surgeon’s birthday” group was 6.9%. This was 23% higher than the 5.6% rate for the “other day” group.</p><p>The study, which appears today in the <em>British Medical Journal</em> (<a href="https://www.bmj.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BMJ</a>),&nbsp;looked at 980,876 procedures performed in US hospitals by 47,489 surgeons.&nbsp;Of those procedures, 2,064 (0.2%) took place on a surgeon’s birthday.&nbsp;The patients were all Medicare beneficiaries aged 65 to 99. They had all undergone one of 17 common emergency surgical procedures between 2011 and 2014.</p><h2>Distractions during the most common emergency surgery types</h2><p>Examples of those 17 procedures included cardiovascular surgeries, hip and femur fracture, appendectomy, and small bowel resection. The study focused on&nbsp;emergency surgery, so as to&nbsp;minimize the potential selection bias. For example, surgeons might otherwise choose patients based on their illness severity, or patients might choose their surgeon.</p><p>As the authors write, “The effect size of surgeons’ birthday observed in our analysis (1.3 percentage point increase or a 23% increase in mortality), though substantial, is comparable to the impact of other events, including holidays (e.g., Christmas and New Year) and weekends.” <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><p>In fact, the <a href="https://amzn.to/3m5rimG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">history of surgery</a> has often demonstrated that external factors can influence surgical outcomes. The authors refer to a 2014 study showing that <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23345314/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patients admitted to Scottish emergency rooms on&nbsp;public holidays had a 27% increase</a> in 30-day mortality.&nbsp;Other research has found, for example,&nbsp;that doctors are more likely to <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/fullarticle/1910546" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prescribe antibiotics</a> and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2749268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opioids</a> — and <a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2733171" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less likely to order&nbsp;cancer screening tests</a> — as the workday progresses. This is most likely because the “cumulative cognitive demand” of such decisions gradually takes its toll.&nbsp;</p><p>Research on judges has yielded similar results. It has found, for example, that external factors as diverse as outdoor temperatures and sports results can influence judges’ decisions.&nbsp;</p><h2>A natural experiment: ER surgery on the doctor’s birthday</h2><p>But the authors say the “natural experiment” in the present study is more revealing than, for example, holiday-related mortality rates. That is because “those events not only affect physicians’ performance but also influence patients’ decision to seek care (i.e., patients seeking care on these special days might be sicker than those seeking care on other days), as well as hospital staffing.” Unless, of course, the patients know their surgeon’s birthday, which is unlikely (though that may change if this study becomes widely known).&nbsp;</p><p>The 1.3% effect size was the result after a very through series of controls. These included, for example, excluding those surgeons with the highest patient mortality rates. Other controls included assigning a random “pseudo-birthday” to surgeons to see whether the results still held up, or checking whether the surgeon did an above-average number of procedures on their birthday. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>Likewise, the researchers controlled for “milestone” birthdays (such as 40 or 50). They also controlled for whether a birthday fell on a Friday, which might make after-work birthday festivities more likely.&nbsp;Their findings also held up when the analysis was restricted to procedures with the highest average mortality, or to only the most ill patients.&nbsp;In fact, without these adjustments, the 30-day mortality rate difference between the birthday and non-birthday groups (the unadjusted rate) was even higher (7.0% vs. 5.6%, or a 1.4% difference).</p><h2><strong>Why</strong> does emergency surgery suffer on surgeon’s birthday?</h2><p>The authors propose a few potential explanations for this “birthday effect.”&nbsp;</p><p>These include hurrying through an emergency surgery to be on time for after-work birthday events; <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/study-finds-users-not-notifications-initiate-89-of-smartphone-interactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">distracting</a> birthday-related phone calls or text messages; more conversations with well-wishing staff members; and a decreased likelihood to go back to the hospital that evening if a patient’s condition deteriorates.</p><p>They also found that some surgeons did not work on their birthdays. While 2,144 surgeons in this study performed procedures one day before their birthday, and 2,027 did so one day after their birthday, only 1,805 surgeons carried out procedures on their actual birthday. This does not affect the results of the study’s analyses. But it does suggest “that birthdays are an important enough factor for some surgeons to choose not to operate on that day, which supports the credibility of our assumption that a birthday could be a distracting factor for those surgeons who choose to operate on that day,” the authors write.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Limitations</strong> <strong>and future directions</strong></h2><p>The researchers emphasized that this study focused on common procedures, and on older Medicare patients. This means that the findings may not apply to other types of patients, or to other surgical procedures.</p><p>Still, the authors write, these results may lead to “additional support for surgeons who have potentially distracting events,” such as birthdays, “to make sure that patients receive high quality surgical care regardless of when undergo surgery.”</p><hr><p><strong>Study: </strong>“<a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m4381" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patient mortality after surgery on the surgeon’s birthday: observational study</a>“<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Hirotaka Kato, Anupam B.

<article>
  
  <div><p>It has been quite a year, I hope everyone is well and staying safe. This is my first and probably only post for the year, and covers a fun privilege escalation vulnerability I found in Postgresql. This affects all supported versions of Postgresql going back to 9.5, it is likely it affects most earlier versions as well.</p>
<p>The vulnerability is similar to a time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU) issue, however in this case it relates to state not being fully cleared/reset before exiting a security restricted operation.</p>
<p>Tested versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>13.0 – PostgreSQL 13.0 (Debian 13.0-1.pgdg100+1)</li>
<li>12.4 – PostgreSQL 12.4 (Debian 12.4-1.pgdg100+1)</li>
<li>12.3 – PostgreSQL 12.3 (Debian 12.3-1.pgdg100+1)</li>
<li>11.9 – PostgreSQL 11.9 (Debian 11.9-1.pgdg90+1)</li>
</ul>
<p>Release notes and updates: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/about/news/postgresql-131-125-1110-1015-9620-and-9524-released-2111/">https://www.postgresql.org/</a></p>

<p>I set out with the goal of finding a vulnerability which would allow an unprivileged user to elevate their privileges to that of <code>superuser</code>.</p>
<p>There are some legitimate ways to provide users with elevated persmissions in Postgresql, without giving those users full <code>superuser</code> rights. This is typically done using <code>SECURITY DEFINER</code> functions.</p>
<p>When misconfigured, a badly written <code>SECURITY DEFINER</code> function and controllable <code>search_path</code> can be used to elevate privileges (<a href="https://www.cybertec-postgresql.com/en/abusing-security-definer-functions/">Cybertec Blog</a>).</p>
<p>This functionality is explicitely called out in the Postgresql documentation in <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createfunction.html#SQL-CREATEFUNCTION-SECURITY">how to safely write security definer functions</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because a SECURITY DEFINER function is executed with the privileges of the user that owns it, care is needed to ensure that the function cannot be misused.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though this is legitimate functionality, it still provided a good starting point, as it gave me an idea of where I should looking in the source code. Maybe there would be a way to use <code>SECURITY DEFINER</code> in another context.</p>

<p>I started off by looking into security definer functions and other locations where Postgresql switches user permissions, I noticed mention of <code>security-restricted operations</code>. This immediately triggered that spidey sense that there might be something to find in these. Out came grep and a search for locations where <code>security-restricted operations</code> are mentioned.</p>
<p>Two places where this term occurs are <code>src/backend/commands/analyze.c</code> (<code>ANALYZE</code> directive) and <code>src/backend/commands/vacuum.c</code> (<code>VACUUM</code> directive), with the same code comment in both:</p>
<pre><code>/*
* Switch to the table owner's userid, so that any index functions are run
* as that user.  Also lock down security-restricted operations and
* arrange to make GUC variable changes local to this command.
*/
</code></pre><p>This leads into the next section;</p>
<h2 id="indexes-and-functions">Indexes and Functions</h2>
<p>This seemed interesting, I didn’t know that an index could run functions. Now it was time to first figure out how to make indexes run user functions.</p>
<p>Turns out this is pretty easy to do, the <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createindex.html">documentation</a> has a bunch of examples of indexes calling functions (even if these aren’t user defined, it shows the syntax on how to structure the sql query.)</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> <span>ON</span> films ((<span>lower</span>(title)));
</code></pre></div><p>In this, an index is created on the <code>films</code> table, using the <code>title</code> column, cast to lowercase using the <code>lower</code> function. It should be pretty straight forward to simply supply a user created function instead of <code>lower</code>.</p>
<p>I’m skipping a few debugging steps I had to go through, but it boiled down to reading the error messages thrown when trying to use the function. The main thing to note at this point is that an <code>INDEX</code> requires an <code>IMMUTABLE</code> function, meaning the function will always return the same result for a given input. This makes sense, an <code>INDEX</code> is trying to optimise on uniqueness.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> sfunc(integer) 
  <span>RETURNS</span> integer
  <span>LANGUAGE</span> <span>sql</span> <span>IMMUTABLE</span> <span>AS</span>
  <span>'SELECT $1'</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>And now create a table, and an index on that table:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> blah (a int, b int);
<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> blah <span>VALUES</span> (<span>1</span>,<span>1</span>);

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> indy <span>ON</span> blah (sfunc(a));
</code></pre></div><p>This isn’t really helpful, I wanted a function that does something more useful, like inserting values into another table. The reason being that I wanted to retrieve the user which was executing to index function. The train of thought I had at this point was:</p>
<pre><code>create index as unpriv --&gt; privileged user executes ANALYZE/VACUUM --&gt; index function executes as privileged user 
</code></pre><p>In this scenario I was planning on using <code>SECURITY INVOKER</code> to trick Postgres into executing the function as the privileged user.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>-- create the table to insert the user into
</span><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> t0 (s varchar);

<span>-- create the security invoker function
</span><span></span><span>CREATE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> sfunc(integer) <span>RETURNS</span> integer
   <span>LANGUAGE</span> <span>sql</span> 
   <span>SECURITY</span> <span>INVOKER</span> <span>AS</span>
   <span>'INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (current_user); SELECT $1'</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>As mentioned earlier, the index requires an <code>IMMUTABLE</code> function. So trying to use the function in an index, would throw an error:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql">tmp<span>=#</span> <span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> indy <span>ON</span> blah (sfunc(a));
ERROR:  functions <span>in</span> <span>index</span> expression must be marked <span>IMMUTABLE</span>
</code></pre></div><p>This seemed like a dead-end. Then it occurred to me that functions can be recreated/redefined. As long as you use <code>CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION</code>, any existing function will be overridden. Maybe the <code>INDEX</code> doesn’t check if an assigned function has become mutable since it was initially defined (spoiler, it doesn’t!).</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> sfunc(integer) 
  <span>RETURNS</span> integer
  <span>LANGUAGE</span> <span>sql</span> <span>IMMUTABLE</span> <span>AS</span>
  <span>'SELECT $1'</span>;

<span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> indy <span>ON</span> blah (sfunc(a));

<span>CREATE</span> <span>OR</span> <span>REPLACE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> sfunc(integer) <span>RETURNS</span> integer
   <span>LANGUAGE</span> <span>sql</span> 
   <span>SECURITY</span> <span>INVOKER</span> <span>AS</span>
<span>'INSERT INTO t0 VALUES (current_user); SELECT $1'</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Now when the index is run the <code>current_user</code> will be inserted into table <code>t0</code>. To check this, I switched to a privileged user (postgres) and executed the <code>ANALYZE</code> function.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql">tmp<span>=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> t0;
 s
<span>---
</span><span></span>(<span>0</span> <span>rows</span>)

tmp<span>=#</span> <span>ANALYZE</span>;
<span>ANALYZE</span>
tmp<span>=#</span> <span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> t0;
  s
<span>-----
</span><span></span> foo
(<span>1</span> <span>row</span>)

tmp<span>=#</span>

</code></pre></div><p>The triggering of the function worked, but we inserted the user <code>foo</code> instead of <code>postgres</code>. This means the <code>SECURITY INVOKER</code> didn’t have an effect. Looking back at the source-code comment from earlier, we can recall that a switch is done to the owner’s uid in security-restricted functions. Yay, we proven that this functionality works, sure we found a nice bypass for the <code>IMMUTABLE</code> check, but this isn’t really a security or world ender.</p>
<h2 id="ill-get-to-it-later---deferred">I’ll get to it later - deferred</h2>
<p>Diving back into the source-code, I had a look at how the security-restricted operation was entered, and subsequently exited.</p>
<p>In the <code>vacuum.c</code> file, there were some interesting comments. Maybe you can spot the bit that caught my eye immediately.</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="c">
<span>/*
</span><span>  * Switch to the table owner's userid, so that any index functions are run
</span><span>  * as that user.  Also lock down security-restricted operations and
</span><span>  * arrange to make GUC variable changes local to this command. (This is
</span><span>  * unnecessary, but harmless, for lazy VACUUM.)
</span><span>  */</span>
GetUserIdAndSecContext(<span>&amp;</span>save_userid, <span>&amp;</span>save_sec_context);
SetUserIdAndSecContext(onerel<span>-&gt;</span>rd_rel<span>-&gt;</span>relowner,
                                            save_sec_context <span>|</span> SECURITY_RESTRICTED_OPERATION);
save_nestlevel <span>=</span> NewGUCNestLevel();

<span>// DO LOTS OF WORK
</span><span>// &lt;--- SNIP ---&gt;
</span><span></span>
<span>/* Restore userid and security context */</span>
SetUserIdAndSecContext(save_userid, save_sec_context);

<span>/* all done with this class, but hold lock until commit */</span>
<span>if</span> (onerel)
        relation_close(onerel, NoLock);

<span>/*
</span><span>  * Complete the transaction and free all temporary memory used.
</span><span>  */</span>
PopActiveSnapshot();
CommitTransactionCommand();
</code></pre></div><p>See that last comment and function calls? The <code>CommitTransactionCommand()</code> is executed after the <code>SetUserAndSecContext</code>, which resets the context userid to that of the executing user. In SQL you have transactions and a transaction isn’t final until the commit happens. This gives you room to execute some SQL, have part of it fail and then seamlessly rollback any changes to the state before the transaction was entered. The fact that in this code the user is restored before the transaction is committed made me wonder if it would be possible to sneak in some additional commands to execute before the commit is done.</p>
<p>Next ensued a long time of reading documentation and looking for ways to delay execution of SQL commands. I finally happened on <code>INITIALLY DEFERRED</code>, which held the key to unlocking this puzzle. This was part of the documentation for <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtrigger.html">TRIGGERS</a> which further set the spidey senses tingling.</p>
<p>What is <code>INITIALLY DEFERRED</code>?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>INITIALLY DEFERRED
The default timing of the trigger. See the CREATE TABLE documentation for details of these constraint options. This can only be specified for constraint triggers.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Going into the <code>CREATE TABLE</code> reference you find:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If a constraint is deferrable, this clause specifies the default time to check the constraint. If the constraint is INITIALLY IMMEDIATE, it is checked after each statement. This is the default. If the constraint is INITIALLY DEFERRED, it is checked only at the end of the transaction. The constraint check time can be altered with the SET CONSTRAINTS command.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That sounds exactly like what we want! An initially deferred constraint is only checked at the “<em>end of the transaction</em>”. This indicated that it would happen just before the <code>commit</code> but after the security context switch.</p>
<h2 id="gymnastics">Gymnastics</h2>
<p>The next trick was to figure out how to use the constraint trigger and where this should be placed so that it triggers at the right moment.</p>
<p>Firstly, a <code>CONSTRAINT TRIGGER</code> needs a function to execute. This will be our “final” step, and should thus be executing in the privileged user context. Therefore we should insert our privileged actions into this function. The other trick is that the <code>CONSTRAINT TRIGGER</code> needs to be triggered somehow. Fortunately we’ve already got the initial bits ready. Since the index calls our custom function, which inserts into table <code>t0</code>, we have an action which will cause a constraint trigger to execute.</p>
<pre><code>Index runs --&gt; sfunc inserts into t0 --&gt; constraint trigger fires --&gt; strig function is executed
</code></pre><p>This leaves us with the following SQL:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="sql">
<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> t1 (s varchar);

<span>-- create a function for inserting current user into another table
</span><span></span>
<span>CREATE</span> <span>OR</span> <span>REPLACE</span> <span>FUNCTION</span> snfunc(integer) <span>RETURNS</span> integer
   <span>LANGUAGE</span> <span>sql</span> 
   <span>SECU…</span></code></pre></div></div></article></div></div>

<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think "I know, I'll use AWS Lambda." Now they have thousands of concurrent problems.</p>

<p>If you want to know how to build a sanely-architected url-shortener using AWS Lambda on top of a datastore like Postgres, this is not the post for you.  We're going to build a Rube-Goldberg url-shortener using <em>just</em> Lambda.</p>

<!--break-->


<p>And since it may not be clear to everyone, this post contains Bad Ideas™ and Extremely Inappropriate Uses of Tools®.  Don't try this in production.</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinkuchta.com/files/lambda_diagram.png" width="600" alt=""></p>



<p>As a brief background, AWS Lambda is a "Function as a Service" service.  You give amazon some code (a function) and they'll run it for you — once, 1000 times, 1000 times <em>at</em> once, whatever you need.  It's a way of running certain kinds of code in the cloud without needing to manage your own server, not even a virtual one.</p>

<p>Lambda is a very specific kind of hammer that's extremely good at hammering a very specific kind of nail.  This blog post will not be discussing that nail.  This blog post will not discuss anything close.  Because it turns out you can use a hammer to drive a wing-nut into silly putty if you swing hard enough and are willing to get messy.</p>



<p>Ok, so the first thing any url-shortener needs is link mapping.  Somewhere you need to store that <code>/123</code> maps to <code>html5zombo.com</code>.  Well, you've got an input and an output - that sounds like a Lambda function!  What if we just create a new Lambda function for every link mapping!  Millions of separate Lambda functions.  After a quick check to make sure there's no limit on the number of Lambda functions you can have (besides an upper limit of 75GB of storage space), we're off to the races.</p>

<p>As an example, the function <code>read_123</code> will just be hardcoded to return <code>html5zombo.com</code>:</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
    return { 'url': 'html5zombo.com' }
</code></pre>

<p>However, a url-shortener needs to produce links, not Lambda functions.  We want the url <code>/123</code> to trigger this function and return the url as a 301 redirect.  For that we turn to API Gateway.  It's a poweful, flexible tool with a million options, but we're just going to use it to hot-glue urls to lambda functions.  For our read function, we can configure a resource (<code>123</code>) and a method on that resource (<code>GET</code>) to trigger our Lambda function.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Api Gateway wasn't built to support thousands and thousands of separate endpoints like <code>/123</code>, <code>/124</code>, <code>/125</code>, etc.  There's a limit of 300 resources per api.  You can request an increase on that limit, but I suspect "because I thought it would be funny" won't be a compelling justification.</p>

<p>We're not stuck, though—we can fix this problem the way we fix all problems: more Lambda functions!  We'll just define one new endpoint that takes a url parameter: <code>/{id}</code> in api gateway.  That'll execute a single Lambda function (call it <code>read(id)</code>) that will, in turn, execute the specific read function (eg <code>read_123</code>) we want.</p>

<p>In pseudocode, <code>read(123)</code> would look like:</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
    read_result = AWS.lambda.invoke('read_' + event.id)
    return {
        'statusCode': 301,
        'headers': { 'Location': read_result['url'] }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Alright, so using two different types of read functions, <code>read(id)</code> and <code>read_123</code> (and <code>_124</code>, etc), we've got shortened links working.  Loading up <code>/123</code> in your browser tells ApiGateway to run <code>read(123)</code>, which runs <code>read_123</code>, which returns <code>html5zombo.com</code>.</p>



<p>Soon we'll want to put together a function to generate these short links.  There's another hurdle first, though.  We need a global counter!  When a user goes to shorten a new link, we need to know what the next id (eg <code>124</code>) is.  We need to store a global counter somewhere.</p>

<p>Now, saner developers might tell you that Lambda is stateless and you can't use it to store data.  You and I know those people just lack strength of character.  Remember: if Lambda functions don't solve your problem, you're not using enough of them.</p>

<p>As it turns out, all you need to do to store a global counter is write a self-updating Lambda function!  Let's call this function <code>iterator</code>, and in pseudocode it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
  i = 0
  myCode = load the code for this function from the filesystem
  myCode = myCode.replace('i = ' + i, 'i = ' + (i+1))
  AWS.lambda.updateCode('iterator', myCode)
  return i
</code></pre>

<p>Self-updating code: what could go wrong?</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/960x0/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fmarkhughes%2Ffiles%2F2016%2F01%2FTerminator-2-1200x873.jpg" width="600" alt=""></p>

<p>Now, the observant among you might be noticing a problem (besides the obvious one that this is all horrifying):  concurrent requests to this function might overwrite each other.  A good fix for this would be to use literally anything else in technology as a datastore.  But since obviously that's not the fix we're going to use, we'll just tell Lambda to limit the maximum concurrency on this function to 1 so it can never run twice in a row!</p>

<p><img src="https://kevinkuchta.com/files/lambda_concurrency.png" width="600" alt=""></p>

<p>And now we've got our massively overcomplicated way of storing one number in the cloud!  Here I am using <code>apex</code>, a handy Lambda cli tool, to run the <code>iterator</code> function repeatedly.</p>

<pre><code>$ apex invoke iterator -a '$LATEST'
{"statusCode": 200, "body": "74"}
$ apex invoke iterator -a '$LATEST'
{"statusCode": 200, "body": "75"}
$ apex invoke iterator -a '$LATEST'
{"statusCode": 200, "body": "76"}
</code></pre>



<p>Alright, we now have everything we need to create a write function - the one that actually shortens links for us.  We want to be able to send an HTTP POST request with a body like <code>{ url: 'hamsterdance.com' }</code> and receive a shortened url like <code>kmk.party/123</code> in return.  In yet more pseudocode:</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
  # Grab the url we're given
  url = json.parse(event.body).url
  nextI = AWS.lambda.invoke('iterator')

  newFunctionBody = """
    def handle(event, context):
      return { url: ${url} }
  """
  newFunctionName = 'read_' + nextI
  AWS.lambda.createFunction(newFunctionName, newFunctionBody)
  return 'kmk.party/' + nextI
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, every time you use this <code>write</code> function to create a new shortened link, we make an api call to generate an entirely new Lambda function with unique code.  This is totally reasonable and not at all a ridiculous misuse of an amazing tool.</p>

<p>As a brief aside, I should mention that this is a horrible security hole.  <code>url</code> is untrusted user input, but we're just interpolating it into code and <em>running</em> that code.  We can work around that, though, by <a href="https://github.com/kkuchta/url_shortener/blob/master/functions/write/main.py#L21">base-64 encoding and decoding the url</a>.</p>



<p><img src="https://kevinkuchta.com/files/lambda_diagram.png" width="600" alt=""></p>

<p>All the pieces of this abomination are in place.</p>

<p>Now the only thing left for a proper url-shortener is a frontend!  There are plenty of simple and nearly free places to host a flat file with a bit of JS to act as that frontend so obviously we're not going to use any of those.  Hosting a flat file is, though pointless and bizarre, quite easy on Lambda (pseudocode):</p>

<pre><code>def handle(event, context):
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': file.read('./index.html'),
        'headers': { 'Content-Type': 'text/html' }
    }
</code></pre>

<p>Index.html just contains some JS to make an HTTP POST to our write function and display the resulting short link.</p>

<p>And there it is: a url-shortener using only Lambda.  We've abused AWS's api to make self-updating functions.  We've flooded our AWS account with single-purpose functions whose output is hardcoded.  We've used the wrongest possible tool to serve flat files, slowly.  We stopped <em>just</em> short of a publicly-available arbitrary code execution bug on my personal AWS account.  Let's call it a day!  Here it is live at <a href="https://kmk.party/">kmk.party</a> and here's the <a href="https://github.com/kkuchta/url_shortener">full, non-pseudocode</a>.</p>

<p>FAQ:</p>

<p>This is really neat <strong>Yes it is thank you</strong></p>

<p>This is absolutely horrifying <strong>See previous answer</strong></p>

<p>Should I use this in production? <strong>Only if you video tape it for posterity</strong></p>

<p>WHY? <strong>Because someone said I couldn't do it</strong></p>

<p>How would you actually go about building a url-shortener? <strong>The inspiration for this post was one called <a href="https://outcrawl.com/go-url-shortener-lambda/">Building a URL Shortener with Go and AWS Lambda</a>.  I got really excited in the moments between reading that title and realizing it was really building a shortener using Go and Lambda <em>and</em> DynamoDB.  When I get overexcited, things like this happen.</strong></p>

<p>Why python? <strong>I wrote half of this in node, but creating/updating Lambda functions requires creating a zip file which node doesn't do natively.  Using a node library requires a huge node_modules folder that must itself get zipped up when you're making a self-updating function like some kind of crazy person.  Switching to python, with its built-in Zipfile module, saved a lot of time and made the iterator run in under a second instead of around 5.</strong></p>

<p>I very much enjoy Code That Should Not Be <strong>Then you might like <a href="https://kevinkuchta.com/2017/07/disguising-ruby-as-javascript/">Disguising Ruby as Javascript</a> where I wield ruby metaprogramming like a hacksaw in a horror film.</strong></p>

<p>I know a way to make this whole thing even more ridiculous <strong>Tweet at me (<a href="https://twitter.com/kkuchta">@kkuchta</a>)! The world-fire can always use more fuel.</strong></p>

						<p><strong>Is there still research to be done in Programming Languages?</strong> This essay touches both on the topic of programming languages and on the nature of research work. I am mostly concerned in analyzing this question in the context of Academia, i.e. within the expectations of academic programs and research funding agencies that support research work in the STEM disciplines (<span>Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics</span>). This is not the only possible perspective, but it is the one I am taking here.</p>
<p><span id="more-416"></span>PLs are dear to my heart, and a considerable chunk of my career was made in that area. As a designer, there is something fundamentally interesting in designing a language of any kind. It’s even more interesting and gratifying when people actually start exercising those languages to create non-trivial software systems. As a user, I love to use programming languages that I haven’t used before, even when the languages in question make me curse every other line.</p>
<p>But the truth of the matter is that ever since I finished <a href="ftp://ftp.ccs.neu.edu/pub/people/crista/publications/thesis/index.html">my Ph.D.</a> in the late 90s, and especially since I joined the ranks of Academia, I have been having a hard time convincing myself that research in PLs is a worthy endeavor. I feel really bad about my rational arguments against it, though. Hence this essay. Perhaps by the time I am done with it I will have come to terms with this dilemma.</p>
<p>Back in the 50s, 60s and 70s, programming languages were a BigDeal, with large investments, upfront planning, and big drama on standardization committees (Ada was the epitome of that model). Things have changed dramatically during the 80s. Since the 90s, a considerable percentage of new languages that ended up being very popular were designed by lone programmers, some of them kids with no research inclination, some as a side hobby, and without any grand goal other than either making some routine activities easier or for plain hacking fun. Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP, by Rasmus Lerdorf circa 1994, “originally used for tracking visits to his online resume, he named the suite of scripts ‘Personal Home Page Tools,’ more frequently referenced as ‘PHP Tools.’ ” [<a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/history.php.php">1</a>] PHP is a marvel of how a horrible language can become the foundation of large numbers of applications… for a second time! <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html">Worse is Better</a> redux. According one <a href="http://langpop.com/">informal but interesting survey</a>, PHP is now the 4th most popular programming language out there, losing only to C, Java and C++.</li>
<li>JavaScript, by Brendan Eich circa 1995, “Plus, I had to be done in ten days or something worse than JS would have happened.” [<a href="http://www.jwz.org/blog/2010/10/every-day-i-learn-something-new-and-stupid/#comment-1021">2</a>] According to that same survey, JavaScript is the 5th most popular language, and I suspect it is climbing up that rank really fast. It may be #1 by now.</li>
<li>Python, by Guido van Rossum circa 1990, “I was looking for a ‘hobby’ programming project that would keep me occupied during the week around Christmas.” [<a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/foreword/">3</a>] Python comes at #6, and its strong adoption by scientific computing communities is well know.</li>
<li>Ruby, by Yukihiro “Matz” Matsumoto circa 1994, “I wanted a scripting language that was more powerful than Perl, and more object-oriented than Python. That’s why I decided to design my own language.” [<a href="http://linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2001/11/29/ruby.html">4</a>] At #10 in that survey.</li>
</ul>
<p>Compare this mindset with the context in which the the older well-known programming languages emerged:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fortran, 50s, originally developed by IBM as part of their core business in computing machines.</li>
<li>Cobol, late 50s, designed by a large committee from the onset, sponsored by the DoD.</li>
<li>Lisp, late 50s, main project occupying 2 professors at MIT and their students, with the grand goal of producing an algebraic list processing language for artificial intelligence work, also funded by the DoD.</li>
<li>C, early 70s, part of the large investment that Bell Labs was doing in the development of Unix.</li>
<li>Smalltalk, early 70s, part of a large investment that Xerox did in “inventing the future” of computers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Back then, developing a language processor was, indeed, a very big deal. Computers were slow, didn’t have a lot of memory, the language processors had to be written in low-level assembly languages… it wasn’t something someone would do in their rooms as a hobby, to put it mildly. Since the 90s, however, with the emergence of PCs and of decent low-level languages like C, developing a language processor is no longer a BigDeal. Hence, languages like PHP and JavaScript.</p>
<p>There is a lot of fun in designing new languages, but this fun is not an exclusive right of researchers with, or working towards, Ph.Ds. Given all the knowledge about programming languages these days, anyone can do it. And many do. And here’s the first itchy point: <em>there appears to be no correlation between the success of a programming language and its emergence in the form of someone’s doctoral or post-doctoral work. </em>This bothers me a lot, as an academic. It appears that deep thoughts, consistency, rigor and all other things we value as scientists aren’t that important for mass adoption of programming languages. But then again, <a href="http://www.dreamsongs.com/RiseOfWorseIsBetter.html">I’m not the first to say it</a>. It’s just that this phenomenon is hard to digest, and if you really grasp it, it has tremendous consequences. If people (the potential users) don’t care about conceptual consistency, why do we keep on trying to achieve that?</p>
<p>To be fair, some of those languages designed in the 90s as side projects, as they became important, eventually became more rigorous and consistent, and attracted a fair amount of academic attention and industry investment. For example, the Netscape JavaScript hacks quickly fell on Guy Steele’s lap resulting in the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript">ECMAScript specification</a>. Python was never a hack even if it started as a Christmas hobby. Ruby is a fun language and quite elegant from the beginning. PHP… well… it’s fun for possibly the wrong reasons. But the core of the matter is that “the right thing” was not the goal. It seems that <span><em>a reliable implementation of a language that addresses an important practical need</em></span> is the key for the popularity of a programming language. But being opportunistic isn’t what research is supposed to be about… (or is it?)</p>
<p>Also to be fair, not all languages designed in the 90s and later started as side projects. For example, Java was a relatively large investment by Sun Microsystems. So was .NET later by Microsoft.</p>
<p>And, finally, all of these new languages, even when created over a week as someone’s pet project, sit on the shoulders of all things that existed before. This leads me to the second itch: <em>one striking commonality in all modern programming languages, especially the popular ones, is how little innovation there is in them</em>! Without exception, including the languages developed in research groups, they all feel like mashups of concepts that already existed in programming languages in 1979, wrapped up in their own idiosyncratic syntax. (I lied: exceptions go to aspects and monads both of which came in the 90s)</p>
<p><a href="http://tagide.com/blog/?attachment_id=544" rel="attachment wp-att-544"><img title="PLs" src="http://tagide.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/PLs-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225"></a>So one pertinent question is: given that not much seems to have emerged since 1979 (that’s 30+ years!), is there still anything to <em>innovate</em> in programming languages? Or have we reached the asymptotic plateau of innovation in this area?</p>
<p>I need to make an important detour here on the nature of research.</p>
<h3>&lt;Begin Detour&gt;</h3>
<p>Perhaps I’m completely off; perhaps <em>producing innovative new software</em> <em>is not a goal of [STEM] research</em>. Under this approach, any software work is dismissed from STEM pursuits, unless it is necessary for some specific goal — like if you want to study some far-off galaxy and you need an IT infrastructure to collect the data and make simulations (S for Science); or if you need some glue code for piecing existing systems together (T for Technology); or if you need to improve the performance of something that already exists (E for Engineering); or if you are a working on some Mathematical model of computation and want to make your ideas come to life in the form of a language (M for Mathematics). This is an extreme submissive view of software systems, one that places software in the back sit of STEM and that denies the existence of value in research in/by software itself. If we want to lead something on our own, let’s just… do empirical studies of technology or become biologists/physicists/chemists/mathematicians or make existing things perform better or do theoretical/statistical models of universes that already exist or that are created by others. Right?</p>
<p>I confess I have a dysfunctional relationship with this idea. Personally, I can’t be happy without creating software things, but I have been able to make my scientist-self function both as a cold-minded analyst and, at times, as an expert passenger in someone else’s research project. The design work, for me, has moved to sabbatical time, evenings and weekends; I don’t publish it [much] other than the code itself and some informal descriptions. And yet, I loathe this situation.</p>
<p>I loathe it because it’s is clear to me that software systems are something very, <em>very</em> special. Software revolutionized everything in unexpected ways, including the methods and practices that our esteemed colleagues in the “hard” sciences hold near and dear for a very long time. The evolution of information technology in the past 60 years has been _way_ off from what our colleagues thought they needed. Over and over again, software systems have been created that weren’t part of any scientific project, as such, and that ended up playing a central role in Science. Instead of trying to mimic our colleagues’ traditional practices, “computer scientists” ought to be showing the way to a new kind of science — maybe <em>that </em><a href="http://www.wolframscience.com/nksonline/page-1?firstview=1">new kind of science</a> or <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sciences-Artificial-Herbert-Simon/dp/0262691914">that one</a> or maybe something else. I dare to suggest that the something else is related to the design of things that have software in them. It should not be called Science. It is a bit like Engineering, but it’s not it either because we’re not dealing [just] with physical things. Technology doesn’t cut it either. It needs a new name, something that denotes “the design of things with software in them.” I will call it Design for short, …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="content-pane">
  <div>
    <p>Throughout my career, I’ve crossed paths with quite a few developers whose
chief expertise has run the gamut of programming languages: C, Python,
Java, Ruby, JavaScript, and so on. The programming language(s) in which you
build expertise undoubtedly influence the way you think about problems and
what solutions you’re likely to reach for, and they do so in a big way.
The common thread I’ve noticed, though, is that developers on average lack
competency in their operating system shell. That lack of competency often
manifests as an <em>aversion</em> to the shell.</p>
<p>You may see that a developer prefers to use point-and-click interfaces
when a shell can get the job done more quickly and with exponentially
more flexibility. You might find that they write scripts in their native
language rather than struggle with the intricacies of <code>bash</code>. At one of
my previous workplaces, I uncovered a 30 line Ruby script that could
have been replaced by one pipeline in <code>bash</code>. Yes, a single pipeline.</p>
<p>This shell aversion is a real shame, because the shell can be a very powerful
tool in one’s technical arsenal. The shell is <em>the</em> textual interface to your
computer.  Regardless of familiarity, every developer will be forced to use a
shell in some ongoing capacity. That use may be to invoke <code>git</code>, grab a quick
snapshot of what is happening in the cloud with <code>aws</code>, or start a container
with <code>docker</code> or <code>docker-compose</code>. The uses are there, and they are many.</p>
<p>Because my experience has largely been infrastructure focused, the shell is more
often a sensible tool for me to reach for than it is for other developers.
Consequently, I learned many hard lessons about shell, best practices,
patterns, and anti-patterns.</p>
<p>And that brings us to the topic at hand today. A friend sent me a blog post
claiming to implement a “safe” template for bash. Just insert your shell
into the provided blank. It’s a fairly hefty template too, weighing in at
just under 100 lines.</p>

<p>I won’t sugar coat it. There’s a <em>lot</em> wrong with this. Let’s start
from the top.</p>
<h2 id="the-airing-of-grievances">The Airing of Grievances</h2>
<h3 id="the-shebang">The Shebang</h3>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
</code></pre><p>In case you don’t know what a shebang is for, here’s the quick
rundown: generally, when you execute a file on your computer, it’s a raw
binary that your operating system understands and can execute natively.
Being that scripts aren’t binaries, a file starting with <code>#!</code> signals
that instead, the command that follows should be executed and the the
file path passed to the interpreter.</p>
<p>In this case, we’ve got <code>env</code> searching a user’s <code>PATH</code> and executing
<code>bash</code>. Proponents of this method would tell you that it smooths over
file system hierarchy differences between machines. That’s technically
true.</p>
<p>But there’s a big problem here: if you’re at the level of experience
where you’re copy/pasting a template, your <code>bash</code> script isn’t
going to run on any machine other than the one you wrote it on (or
other very similar systems where <code>bash</code> can be found at the same
place). Using <code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code> as the shebang gives the
<em>misleading</em> impression that you can just take the script and
run it somewhere else. And that’s just not true unless your script does
almost nothing of interest, or you actually understand the differences
between various platforms and can account for them when writing
your script. Furthermore, as the author, you probably originally
wrote the script with the system-wide <code>bash</code> in mind - so why
shouldn’t you just use that one?</p>
<p>“But John,” you say. “When I use <code>python</code> and <code>ruby</code> and other scripting
languages, I always use <code>#!/usr/bin/env</code>.” You sure do. The difference
between <code>bash</code> and those other languages is that those other ones
have tooling built around them, like <code>pyenv</code>, <code>poetry</code>, <code>rbenv</code> and <code>bundler</code>,
to facilitate running at a non-standard location with a particular
interpreter version and collection of libraries.</p>
<p>Don’t misrepresent your script from the outset. Just use <code>#!/bin/bash</code>
unless you can actually handle running in another environment.</p>
<h3 id="the-set-smorgasbord">The <code>set</code> Smorgasbord</h3>
<pre><code>set -Eeuo pipefail
</code></pre><p>Here we’ve got a smattering of shell options that are commonly used, but
are not universal. Here’s what <code>bash</code> has to say about those options,
with irrelevant options removed for brevity:</p>
<pre><code>$ help set
      -e  Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
      -u  Treat unset variables as an error when substituting.
      -o option-name
          Set the variable corresponding to option-name:
              pipefail     the return value of a pipeline is the status of
                           the last command to exit with a non-zero status,
                           or zero if no command exited with a non-zero status
      -E  If set, the ERR trap is inherited by shell functions.
</code></pre><p>Right off the bat, <code>set -e</code> is a giant landmine. What happens when you pipe
some text to <code>grep</code> and nothing matches? Well, <code>grep</code> exits with a non-zero
status. Oops!</p>
<p>You can work around this with an <code>if</code> statement, or slapping an <code>|| true</code>
on the end, but it creates an entirely new problem. It’s still something you
have to remember to do everywhere, but only for very few binaries.</p>
<p><code>grep</code> is not the only binary that uses its exit code informatively.
<code>terraform plan -detailed-exitcode</code>, for example, will let you know whether
the plan showed a diff or not, or if there was an error during the plan
process. In this sort of case, you’d probably want to capture the exit code
with something like <code>rc="$?"</code> immediately after so that you can deal with it
as appropriate.</p>
<p><code>set -u</code> is fine, and I would recommend it generally. That said, you’ve got to
be responsible and initialize anything you’re going expecting to get via the
environment. If you don’t, your program will bomb with a canned error message
and exit code. Your users (or future you) will appreciate a reminder regarding
expected environment variables and what their values ought to be. For example,
you might write something like:</p>
<div><div>
<table><tbody><tr><td>
<pre><code><span> 1
</span><span> 2
</span><span> 3
</span><span> 4
</span><span> 5
</span><span> 6
</span><span> 7
</span><span> 8
</span><span> 9
</span><span>10
</span></code></pre></td>
<td>
<pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>#!/bin/bash
</span><span></span>
<span>set</span> -uo pipefail

<span>MY_SECRET_PASSWORD</span><span>=</span><span>${</span><span>MY_SECRET_PASSWORD</span><span>:-</span><span>}</span>

<span>if</span> <span>[[</span> -z <span>"</span><span>$MY_SECRET_PASSWORD</span><span>"</span> <span>]]</span><span>;</span> <span>then</span>
    <span>echo</span> <span>'you forgot to provide your secret password'</span> &gt;<span>&amp;</span><span>2</span>
    <span>exit</span> <span>1</span>
<span>fi</span></code></pre></td></tr></tbody></table>
</div>
</div>
<p>I don’t take any exceptions with <code>set -o pipefail</code>.</p>
<p>The biggest problem I have with <code>set -E</code> is that its only usefulness comes
from catching unhandled errors in your script. Unhandled errors are
a deficiency with the script as written, and should be corrected. And, like
<code>set -e</code>, you run into the same sort of problem where executables
might use the exit code to communicate some information that is not
necessarily a fatal error.</p>
<h3 id="an-immediate-directory-change">An Immediate Directory Change</h3>
<p>On line 5, before any script logic has been executed, this template will
change the current directory:</p>
<pre><code>cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;&amp;1
</code></pre><p>Want to pass the script a relative file path? Not on my watch.</p>
<p>Don’t change directories in your script unless you are ready to deal with
the consequences of that.</p>
<p>Additionally, this displays another anti-pattern: the use of <code>$BASH_SOURCE</code>.
It only works in <code>bash</code>, not in any other shell. The manual says that:</p>
<pre><code>BASH_SOURCE
    An array variable whose members are the source filenames where the
    corresponding shell function names in the FUNCNAME array variable are
    defined.  The shell function ${FUNCNAME[$i]} is defined in the file
    ${BASH_SOURCE[$i]} and called from ${BASH_SOURCE[$i+1]}.
</code></pre><p>Proponents of the use of <code>$BASH_SOURCE</code> would argue that <code>$BASH_SOURCE</code> works
both when a script is sourced and when it is executed. That is true,
but also only useful in the rarest of circumstances.</p>
<p>Sourcing functions like an include or import in other programming languages.
The sourced script is effectively inlined. Unless both the sourcing script
and sourced script are built with that in mind, you’re signing up for chaos.</p>
<p>I have been writing bash …</p></div></section></div>

</p><p><strong>EDIT: The update has been available since last Friday. You can check it out by downloading the latest update from FreeSO servers, then following the instructions later in this post!</strong></p>
<p>Three years ago, any chance of anyone reviving The Sims Online looked very slim. Any existing project seemed to either fall off in activity, be a hoax in the first place, or burn hopeful fans with controversial donations for a server that was never meant to be. Despite all the ruckus, three years ago is when we got the first glimmer of hope that TSO would be back again – a convincing UI recreation of the initial few screens of the game including Create A Sim, with a lot of backend work to load important game content. Developed by Afr0 and ddfczm, this recreation was called Project Dollhouse, and it’s what inspired me to work towards this same goal. Despite exciting developments in SimAntics emulation by me and ddfczm, with ingame footage of TSO objects somewhat working, this community stayed at only a few members – nobody believed anymore in TSO ever returning. Our community slowly grew as I implemented the online sandbox mode and split into FreeSO, and people finally started believing that it was possible. The launch into beta was a spectacular surprise.</p>
<p>Today, we’ve almost done it. It has been a heck of a long journey, and finally people don’t have to <em>believe</em> in something anymore – it’s right here. A fully re-implemented TSO client and server is available for all to use, with source available so it can be developed further by anyone in the future, maybe tens of years from now. The ability to play TSO will never truly disappear, thanks to the efforts of its community.</p>
<p>Recently, I attempted to port The Sims 1 to mobile by myself, something many users never would have believed would work until recently. Unfortunately this was not meant to be, but I demonstrated that it was never impossible, and that it can even be done well by an independent developer.</p>
<p>To keep up with my trend of doing stupid things nobody believes in, I decided to make good on a crazy idea I shared three years ago, and have even mocked on one april fools since it felt so unfeasible at the time. I had an idea that The Sims and The Sims Online could potentially be rendered and playable in 3D, in real time, using mesh reconstruction techniques. Our next update will have an experimental mode showing that this is indeed possible!</p>
<p>I’m guessing your immediate thoughts from seeing our header image is, “how is this even remotely possible? the objects in this game are 2D sprites”. This article will also explain how it wasn’t as impossible as it seemed, and explain how it was achieved.</p>


<p>The update will release within the week. It will include the 3D mode shown in the video (see later in this post for more info), but also several critical bug fixes including fixes for interactions, disappearing purchased objects, lot save mishaps and many common SimAntics exceptions.</p>
<p>Note that in 3D mode, the first time you see each drawgroup the game will freeze or stutter heavily. This is because it is generating the 3D meshes the game uses from the sprites – these are not included with the FreeSO client!</p>
<p>The update also includes two enhancements for 2D mode. You can now use the mouse wheel to zoom in and out, and our new 3D wall component can be used in 2D mode to generate 3D wall shadows. You’ll find a toggle for this in the options menu.</p>

<p>Though Simitone can no longer be developed for mobile devices, the source is still available and buildable on windows desktop. Since Simitone runs on the FreeSO engine, these changes work in it as well. Gameplay is still in the same state as seen in the last video, so it’s not entirely playable.</p>

<p>The idea of converting TS1/TSO objects to 3D was actually something I was interested in even before I started working on Project Dollhouse or FreeSO. While Niotso and PD were still active, I frequented the Niotso IRC on hackint, where we discussed the various formats in the game.</p>
<p>Most other isometric games simply draw sprites from back to front, which works well for most games, assuming that the sprites are never meant to intersect each other. The Sims is a rather special case, since object sprites intersecting with avatars is a key requirement for most of the objects – specific parts of a shower, for example, must appear over the sim while they are in it. For this purpose, all object sprites in The Sims have a little extra depth… in that they literally store a depth value for each pixel in the sprite, as it was when it was originally rendered from a 3D model. This is called its z-buffer, and allows per pixel depth comparison between objects and avatars.</p>
<p>I created a javascript tool for experimenting with TS1 sprite rendering, which mostly served as a way to tweak and examine how the z-buffers stored in object sprites should be used to perform depth ordering between objects and avatars that might intersect.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.niotso.org/zbuffer/">http://www.niotso.org/zbuffer/</a></p>
<p>This was not the only function of this renderer, though. A custom version I made was actually able to render objects from non-standard angles, using the z buffers and some vector math to offset their pixels to a new position in 3D space. (press 1, 2 to rotate)</p>
<p><a href="http://freeso.org/zbuffer/index.html">http://freeso.org/zbuffer/index.html</a></p>
<p>This was a good proof of concept, but obviously this kind of 2D per-pixel transformation is too slow to run in real-time on a lot. It was clear a true solution would need to generate a 3D model which could be transformed and rendered on the GPU.</p>
<p>You could say that this has always been the secondary goal of this project, though obviously I never like to get people’s expectations up if they might be disappointed. It’s always been on my mind, either way.</p>

<p>Developing the whole thing into a playable state took about a week. Not kidding – since the entire game was already there, and terrain was already in 3D, it didn’t take long to get a prototype working. The first steps were simply generating meshes for existing objects in the game and displaying them by themselves in volcanic. This was done to test how viable applying such a technique to the whole game might be, on a per object basis.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.gyazo.com/5c9cf87d8aa7c062064c705da94f853e.gif" width="187" height="225"></p>
<p>These triangle meshes were literally generated as heightmaps of the z-buffers, without any tricks. It became clear that these meshes would have too many triangles to render 1000-fold on a typical TSO lot, so the next step was to obtain and adapt a mesh simplification algorithm to create meshes with managable triangle counts. This worked incredibly well – typical reductions were usually 50-fold. Additional techniques were applied after this to remove duplicate triangles, but that will be discussed in the next section.</p>

<p>Two days after starting, I’d written an alternate implementation of the world that attempted to render with a 3D camera. This was weird enough in itself – seeing TS1 graphics from another angle, even without objects, was really surreal. This mode immediately used a modified shader for drawing grass and build mode gridlines, but was completely unplayable. Ground and object clicking completely relied on the isometric perspective – and had to be re-implemented later in a more universal fashion.</p>
<p>Later that night, I got the game rendering objects too, and off the bat it ran surprisingly well. Some of the objects had clear z issues, and there was no way to render walls in 3d, but the game looked like it could potentially function at some point.<img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/268515111520567296/346818287176515594/unknown.png"></p>
<p>Objects quickly gained their own shader to function with our custom lighting, and using a simple bounding box + raycast I was able to make objects clickable as well.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/268515111520567296/347048707633577985/unknown.png"></p>
<p>Walls were quite tricky, since the original wall component generated a 2D sprite list, I had to re-implement wall rendering from scratch to generate 3D wall geometry with cuts and thick walls. This only took a day, but the recompile time for that single class is a testament to its complexity (though it is surprisingly simpler than the original 2D wall component).</p>
<p>One notable thing is that walls in The Sims 1 make no physical sense – no matter what direction you look at them from, the “front” of it appears to be dead on the edge of the tile, while the thickness of the wall extends back away from the camera. To represent this in 3D and avoid clipping issues with doors, walls and paintings, the wall actually has to shift away from the camera depending on the view direction. Thankfully this effect is subtle.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/344299697394941963/347489987803086848/unknown.png"></p>
<p>From this point, I added experimented with rendering the city view as part of the sandbox, and the result quickly became very cool. Around this point I also replaced our old mouse -&gt; terrain position estimation with a more robust raycasting solution too, which allows objects to be placed in 3d, go here to work correctly and a few more core game features to work correctly. This change will actually also benefit the 2D engine – complex terrain will no longer be impossible to click on.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/268515111520567296/347766234219020288/unknown.png"></p>
<p>(these are development screenshots, the meshes for the objects, wall shad0ws and the skybox will look slightly different now)</p>
<p>This past week has been writing tweaks for the mesh reconstruction, playtesting, visual improvements, robust camera controls and 3D wall shadows.</p>

<p>Any single graphical state for an object in The Sims is called a Drawgroup (DGRP). These contain information for positioning sprites in 3D space, for multiple zooms and rotations. We wish to create 3D meshes for each of these graphical states, which we can then render in place of the 2D sprites.</p>
<ul>
<li>A heightmap-like mesh is generated directly from each sprite in the DGRP, and appropriately transformed from the isometric sprite (x, y, z) into object space. Meshes for “dynamic sprites” – toggleable sprites for each DGRP are kept as separate meshes to make them easier to toggle.
<ul>
<li>This can possibly be improved by omitting triangles that …</li></ul></li></ul></div></div>

<p>For much of 2020, Vicente Zavarce has been running Yummy, the delivery app he founded last year in Venezuela, from San Francisco. When the coronavirus pandemic hit, Venezuela shut its borders, leaving him stranded thousands of miles away from his Caracas-based team. Zavarce, who previously worked at Postmates, started Yummy in the hopes of bringing a similar delivery app model to his home country — a market most investors and tech companies have been unwilling to touch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Thanks to vast oil reserves, Venezuela was among the richest countries in Latin America. But in <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2014/12/01/falling-crude-oil-prices-crush-venezuelas-ailing-economy.html">2014</a>, as oil prices fell, the country’s economy began collapsing. President Nicolás Maduro cracked down on the civil unrest that followed, leading the United States and other countries to impose sanctions on Venezuela. In September, the Trump administration levied a <a href="https://www.state.gov/the-united-states-responds-to-the-maduro-regimes-attempts-to-corrupt-democratic-elections-in-venezuela/">new round</a> of penalties on the country, accusing the government of depriving citizens of “free and fair elections.” The International Monetary Fund estimates that the country’s GDP will <a href="https://www.imf.org/en/Countries/VEN">drop by 25%</a> this year and that inflation will remain at its breathtaking high of 6,500%. Since 2015, around <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-venezuela-security-un/venezuela-exodus-set-to-top-5-million-as-long-term-needs-grow-officials-say-idUSKBN1X21MM">5 million</a> Venezuelans have fled the country, and of those who remain, nearly <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/venezuela-poverty/venezuela-poverty-rate-surges-amid-economic-collapse-inflation-study-idUSL1N2EE1MG">65% live in poverty</a>.</p>



<p>Zavarce says those circumstances didn’t deter him from starting a company in the country where he grew up. His gamble on Venezuela, one of the last untouched markets for delivery and e-commerce in the region, paid off. Yummy raised $450,000 from investors and now employs 50 people. The platform has more than 250 delivery drivers, and more than 200 merchants have signed up. In October, just six months after it formally launched, Yummy was acquired by the Central American super-app Hugo.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In October, <em>Rest of World</em> spoke with Zavarce about how he built Yummy. The following interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p>



<h3><strong>Venezuela is a market other tech companies have avoided. Can you talk about why you started Yummy in what you knew would be a really difficult environment?</strong></h3>



<p>Everyone — my friends from [delivery app] Rappi, my friends from Uber Eats, my friends from Postmates — told me I was insane, but they supported me.</p>



<p>I am from Venezuela. I grew up in the streets of Caracas until I was 18 and then went to college in the U.S. Regardless of being abroad, my heart is still Venezuelan. At Postmates, I was in charge of user acquisitions, and I helped lead our expansion into Mexico City, where we were not the biggest player. I faced challenges that I overcame, and it gave me great experience. At a certain point, it felt almost irresponsible not to use my experience to start something in my home country.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We started working on Yummy in October 2019. We thought it was ridiculous that this kind of thing didn’t exist in Venezuela. I knew there was a market because there was already a lot of restaurant e-commerce happening on WhatsApp and Instagram. People would message a restaurant on Instagram to get its WhatsApp number, and then they would call them and have a ten-minute conversation just to place a delivery order. It was happening in this very hacky way because there wasn’t a platform to aggregate the restaurants and provide a fleet of drivers.</p>



<h3><strong>Knowing that Yummy was really the first service of its kind in Venezuela, what things did you have to think about that you wouldn’t have to at a company like Uber Eats or Postmates?</strong></h3>



<p>We really had to teach drivers about the service. In the U.S., people know what Uber Eats is, and if you want to work for them, you can just download the app. Because we were starting from scratch, we created a three-day training course for applicants to get certified as Yummy drivers. We cover things like how to interact with restaurants and customers and how to properly store food. A lot of our customers pay in cash, and we don’t want our drivers becoming targets for robbery. Once a driver collects a certain amount of cash, they’re instructed to go to one of Yummy’s offices to drop it off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Connectivity is also a huge issue. To ensure some of the restaurants we worked with had consistent Wi-Fi, we actually had to buy them hotspots, which they paid us back for in installments. When we were designing the app, we were very conscious about its size, to be sure that images and menus could load without eating up too much data. Because cell signals can be unreliable in urban areas, we also acquired a company called Dingo. It built a way for people to place and receive orders over WhatsApp using a chatbot; you don’t need the fanciest phone to order from Yummy. So you can order in the app itself or over WhatsApp.</p>



<h3><strong>Were investors worried about supporting a company working in Venezuela?</strong></h3>



<p>If I were to start a business in the U.S., as someone with experience, a strong team, and a good idea, I probably would have raised money before launching. That wasn’t the case for us because no one really believed that we would succeed, at least not enough to dip into their own pockets to support us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Whenever we would talk to investors, the conversation would go something like: There’s no competition there. You have the advantage of being first. Your team is fantastic. You have experience with a larger food-delivery company — but Venezuela is very risky.</p>



<p>We launched with our own money and by raising capital from family and friends. Once we had three months of results that showed hypergrowth, then I could approach investors with a different story. We grew at a rate that made us one of the fastest-growing food-delivery apps in history. That was attractive to investors, despite the risks of the Venezuelan market.</p>

<h3><strong>How did you take into consideration wealth inequality in Venezuela when you thought about who your ideal customers would be?</strong></h3>



<p>At the beginning, we were more of a luxury service. We had to think strategically because we wanted to capture wealthy individuals first. When we started, we didn’t have any funding, so the service wasn’t cheap. In cities, the wealth divide is really geographical, and the wealthier neighborhoods were also safer for our drivers.</p>



<p>But our goal was always to make Yummy cheaper once we had funding, and that’s essentially what we did. Now, we’re focused on having options for everyone. For instance, you can order from McDonald’s now. There’s much more diversity in the neighborhoods where we’re receiving orders from — it’s definitely no longer relegated to only the wealthy communities.</p>



<h3>The pandemic has been a boon to a lot of delivery apps globally. Did that hold true for Yummy?</h3>



<p>I’d say that, overall, we netted zero, between the positives and negatives. All the high schools and universities are closed in Venezuela, which are historically hot zip codes for food delivery no matter where you are in the world. Offices are also closed, which is another big user base. Venezuela has a huge party scene — clubs stay open until 6 in the morning. Late-night food and drinks were a big portion of our business model, and then suddenly all of that was gone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We started focusing more on breakfast orders and also delivering from supermarkets. We also tweaked the app so that you can get food from multiple restaurants in the same order. Parents can order sushi, and kids can get pizza.</p>



<p>On the positive side, it really drove merchant adoption. When the pandemic started, the government mandated that restaurants operate with only pickup or delivery. So that gave us the opportunity to introduce this business model right on time. We approached restaurants and convinced them to open “dark” kitchens [restaurants optimized for delivery with no front-of-house service] and sell through us. Some restaurants ended up making essentially what they were making before the pandemic.</p>



<h3><strong>Are you worried about competition?</strong></h3>



<p>We knew that if we proved this could be done, a big company might move into the country within 10 months. We have continued trying to quickly expand. One way we’ve guarded against competition is by having about 50% of the restaurants we work with sign exclusivity agreements. That’s also part of why we began expanding to grocery-store delivery and delivery from other kinds of shops, and it’s why we want to go beyond food. We want to be the app where people go for everything.</p>



<h3><strong>You’ve just been acquired by the El Salvadoran app Hugo, only six months into Yummy’s operation. How is that changing the company’s future?</strong></h3>



<p>We really felt that the team at Hugo, which is a super-app expanding throughout the Caribbean, really understood our vision. They started out in their home country, El Salvador, which is also a risky market. They had some of the same challenges we did. They really understood underserved economies, connectivity issues, the culture; what they built is oriented around what we were trying to build. We can use their technology and really focus on growth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Caracas, there are maybe 500 restaurants you would want to order from, whereas, in New York City, there are thousands. If you focus on only one vertical — like food delivery — there’s a limit there that might not exist in the U.S. Once we raised a seed round from AngelList, we decided we were going to expand and become a super-app. In a smaller economy where there is no e-commerce, we have the opportunity to become a one-stop shop for our customers.</p>



<p>As part of the deal, we will be staying on for at least the next four years and continuing to build the company. That was really important for Hugo and us.</p>

				<p>Remember when we used to joke around, debate about politics, have a drink afterwards and hug your  friend with a  different political view. Remember when we would switch on the news and just casually criticize whatever dumb shit both the  political parties were doing. Ahh those were the days.</p>
<p>Remember when we used to hug our friends with a slightly different political view than us. Remember when we switch on the news and make fun of whatever dumb shit those politicians were pulling of. Remember when opinions were objective and not personal.</p>
<p>Now everyone and their grandmother has a political opinion that is so well formed, so true,  that neither of them is going to entertain any counter argument. I have seen decade old friendships end, careers destroyed, families torn apart because of differing political opinions.</p>
<p>We do have faint memories  of  a time before this, where everyone didn’t make everything a part of their identity. Where you could have a reasonable discussion with someone without it ending in a fist fight. Those times are long gone, but how the hell did we arrive here.</p>

<p>There is point on the slope where shit goes downhill, and for us it was that point when Social Media appeared. Social Media in all it’s glorious forms aren’t  inherently bad, it’s when you add big data magic and billions of dollars of advertisement budget to the mix that messes everything up. Suddenly  the thing  that you use to keep tabs of your friends and family, start to keep tabs on you.</p>
<p>Advertisement has always been about attention, that’s why big billboards are lit up in the middle of the  night showing scantily clad women with legs pointing to some shit your won’t need. The sole purpose is to turn your head and to make you take notice. They don’t care who sees it, they just care a lot of us do.</p>
<p>A lot of advertisement on the early days of the internet were similar, they would put banner ads on the  most busiest sites hoping to gather the most eyeballs. It worked  like that for some time  until they  realized rather than billboards  on the side of the  road,  you could target your users. Rather than  advertising on a generic forum about the world, you could advertise on a blog about cars for your new useless engine oil. The people who would be visiting the car blog would probably be the ones who would be most interested in buying your shitty snake oil. Hence targeting was born. The ROI of Internet advertisement skyrocketed, and everyone wanted a piece of the pie.</p>
<p>Then Social Media came along with a totally different game. They started  to  track your each and every move  building up intricate profiles of you neatly kept on an offshore data-center, opening up an even better gold mine for those sleazy salesmen. Rather than waiting for someone to show up for that stupid  blog post  about that broken down car, they could put the ad for the snake oil right in the feed of a person who loves clicking on car pictures. It was all christmas  in ad town from  then on, and the companies  who had the best  tracking profiles  started swimming in money, and the ones who didn’t started dying out. (Too far ? yeah too far)</p>
<p>After spending a couple of billions and tracking every sneeze and every turn of everyone  who ever set foot in their world,  they started to  realize some thing else. The people who bought the snake oil on the first impression was not the normal person who kind  of loved cars, but the obsessed ones who believed that snake oil was the best oil in the  world and that the best way to save the world was to buy more snake oil. Those were the people that had the most ROI ever, and  the people who wore nice suits in big office buildings decided they wanted more of these obsessed fanatics, and Big Social gladly served them up on a plate.</p>
<p>But even in a large  enough population pool  the people who are obsessed about a lot of shit is really hard to find, and to keep the money flowing they needed more of them. So they did what anyone with a degree in Operations would do, they started manufacturing them.</p>
<p>Big Social realized that the people who  engage  most, who  drive the most revenue are the ones obsessed with the content. They are the most  revenue generating cattle of the ranch, and since everything is a numbers game they started to maximize obsessiveness. Well how do you manufacture people who would die for their views ? How do you manufacture obsessiveness ? Bubbles.</p>
<h2 id="enter-bubbles">Enter Bubbles</h2>
<p>The more the number of positive reinforcement that a person receives about their already existing viewpoints and the more number  of negative reinforcements they see around the opposing ones, the more likely they are to believe their beliefs are true. The more they are engrossed in their bubbles the more they are susceptible to being obsessed.</p>
<p>The  first  time we sign-up for it, they don’t know anything about us. So they ask us for our interests and to add our closest friends. Based on that they show us some generic content  based on our and  our friends interests. Then we start interacting with them, each and every interaction, each and  every pause is recorded and measured and converted  to a  data point. Initially the content is neutral, leaning just to the side  of our interests and our beliefs. The more we interact with it, the more the virtual  profile of ourselves get optimized. With our likes and shares and comments  we build an echo chamber around ourselves, with help from a  black box algorithm designed to optimize  for obsessiveness.</p>
<p>But an echo chamber doesn’t make you and obsessed radical, what makes you one is shock.</p>
<h2 id="enter-shock">Enter Shock</h2>
<p>Shock is what pushes your towards the edge of obsessiveness. Content that has high shock value are borderline impossible to believe. They rock your belief system and lingers on the edge of possibility. It’s purpose is not to make you believe the content right away, but to expand and reinforce your viewpoint so much so that you believe a little more polarized content than what you are used to. That is how you manufacture obsessiveness, that’s how your manufacture  polarization. The cycle is repeated indefinitely nudging you little by little to the edge, until you fall  o ver. Is  it  intentional or  a  byproduct  of an algorithm optimized for profit and engagement maximization is up for debate.</p>
<p>Consider me and Youtube. Like every teenager I had trouble with the ladies and like any other teenager I turned  to the internet for help. I started with dating videos, content which I  was looking for. Then slowly my recommended feed stared to show just one or two videos on how women were the problem of modern society, not enough to turn me to a believer but just enough to shock me. Having been exposed to that I started to normalize videos that bash feminism, SJW’s being owned and rants about how women are the problem. Then my feed started to get populated with  even more  anti-women and videos around red-pill and the manosphere. I am not saying these viewpoints are right or  wrong, but they were shocking  and normalized  a lot  of stuff that I would never have accepted if I was shown then from the start. After a while I started believing a lot of the what was being said, I was starting to suffocate in my own bubble. Luckily I used to read a lot outside the internet and hence had access to contrasting view points. That’s when I realized how deep in the rabbit hole I was. This prompted me to seek out alternate viewpoints and form my own opinions.  If I had kept going I would most probably have turned  into an angry fanatic thirsty for blood on the internet, shouting on some obscure forum on the edge of the internet.</p>
<p>That’s what  the algorithms are designed to do. They have the maximum engagement and attention from how obsessed their users  are. For being obsessed it’s not only vital that you  push the view point forward but also to demean and dehumanize the opposing one, so much so to the point that you believe the views that they hold are clearly wrong.  It pushes us into an us vs them mentality, where we are on right ones  and they are the wrong ones.</p>
<p>After a while we start to internalize what we interact with, it becomes a part of your identity.You start to believe the extreme content that you are exposed to as your own, you start to defend it with all your might.  You can’t entertain an  argument  because it is no  longer an argument  against your opinion,but one against  your identity. To entertain any argument is to acknowledge you are wrong and to prove everything you have interacted with for a long time to be wrong. This is  what  polarizes  us, this is what makes having a friendly conversation about opposing  views impossible in this  day and age. This is what is being done to us. We are divided  by opinions cocooned in our own bubbles, our own  echo chambers which enforce our beliefs and makes us immune to any counter  argument no matter how right or wrong.</p>
<h2 id="breaking-out">Breaking Out</h2>
<p>It’s not easy and fun getting out once you are inside. It’s like the matrix you see and hear and interact with an artificial world designed to hook you in, and like Neo it’s one hell of a ride to unplug. It’s hard but it’s possible, this is how I  did it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Clear the data that they have on you, take away the data and take away the power.</li>
<li>Humanize the opposing view points and the people who make  them. Realize they too have a valid point and that they believe it enough to defend it with all their heart.</li>
<li>Seek out alternate view points, it’s kind of a fun exercise. When you start everything looks stupid and dumb, persist and after a while you will feel a switch inside your brain, when you realize they also have a valid point.</li>
<li>Take some time off and  think deeply about everything and put together a version of the reality and form your own opinions based on them.</li>
<li>Refine those opinions  as you learn more about reality.</li>
</ul>
<p>OR</p>
<ul>
<li>Logout of all your Social Media, it’s not that useful anyway</li>
<li>Get a Flip Phone,  looks cooler than  a dumb phone</li>
<li>Life life  as  nature …</li></ul></div></div>

<p>You might recall that my Twitter account was <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/11/16/i-lost-my-twitter-account/" data-type="post" data-id="15196">hijacked</a> and then <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2020/12/03/twitter-lockout-again/" data-type="post" data-id="15287">again</a> just two weeks later.</p>



<h2>The first: brute-force</h2>



<p>The  first take-over was most likely a case of brute-forcing my weak password while not having 2FA enabled. I have no excuse for either of those lapses. I had convinced myself I had 2fa enabled which made me take a (too) lax attitude to my short 8-character password that was possible to remember. Clearly, 2fa was not enabled and then the only remaining wall against the evil world was that weak password.</p>



<h2>The second time</h2>



<p>After that first hijack, I immediately changed password to a strong many-character one and I made really sure I enabled 2fa with an authenticator app and I felt safe again. Yet it would only take seventeen days until I <em><strong>again</strong></em> was locked out from my account. This second time, I could see how <em>someone had managed to change the email address</em> associated with my account (displayed when I wanted to reset my password). With the password not working and the account not having the correct email address anymore, I could not reset the password, and my 2fa status had no effect. I was locked out. Again.</p>



<p>It felt related to the first case because I’ve had my Twitter account since May 2008. I had never lost it before and then suddenly after 12+ years, within a period of three weeks, it happens twice?</p>



<h2>Why and how</h2>



<p>How this happened was a complete mystery to me. The account was restored fairly swiftly but I learned nothing from that.</p>



<p>Then someone at Twitter contacted me. After they investigated what had happened and how, I had a chat with a responsible person there and he explained for me exactly how this went down.</p>



<p>Had Twitter been hacked? Is there a way to circumvent 2FA? Were my local computer or phone compromised? No, no and no.</p>



<p>Apparently, an agent at Twitter who were going through the backlog of issues, where my previous hijack issue was still present, accidentally changed the email on my account by mistake, probably confusing it with another account in another browser tab.</p>



<p><strong>There was no outside intruder, it was just a user error.</strong></p>



<p>Okay, the cynics will say, this is what he <em>told</em> me and there is no evidence to back it up. That’s right, I’m taking his words as truth here but I also think the description matches my observations. There’s just no way for me or any outsider to verify or fact-check this.</p>



<h2>A brighter future</h2>



<p>They seem to already have identified things to improve to reduce the risk of this happening again and Michael also mentioned a few other items on their agenda that should make hijacks harder to do and help them detect suspicious behavior earlier and faster going forward. I was also happy to provide my feedback on how I think they could’ve made my lost-account experience a little better.</p>



<p>I’m relieved that the second time at least wasn’t my fault and neither of my systems are breached  or hacked (as far as I know).</p>



<p>I’ve also now properly and thoroughly gone over all my accounts on practically all online services I use and made really sure that I have 2fa enabled on them. On some of them I’ve also changed my registered email address to one with 30 random letters to make it truly impossible for any outsider to guess what I use.</p>



<p>(I’m also positively surprised by this extra level of customer care Twitter showed for me and my case.)</p>



<h2>Am I a target?</h2>



<p>I don’t think I am. I think maybe my Twitter account could be interesting to scammers since I have almost 25K followers and I have a verified account. Me personally, I work primarily with open source and most of my works is already made public. I don’t deal in business secrets. I don’t think my personal stuff attracts attackers more than anyone else does.</p>

<p>What about the risk or the temptation for bad guys in trying to backdoor curl? It is after all installed in some 10 <em>billion</em> systems world-wide. I’ve <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2017/09/12/the-backdoor-threat/">elaborated on that before</a>. Summary: I think it is terribly hard for someone to actually manage to do it. Not because of the security of my personal systems perhaps, but because of the entire setup and all processes, signings, reviews, testing and scanning that are involved.</p>



<p>So no. I don’t think my personal systems are a valued singled out target to attackers.</p>



<p>Now, back to work!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div property="content:encoded"><p>The ACCC has instituted proceedings in the Federal Court against Facebook, Inc. and two of its subsidiaries for false, misleading or deceptive conduct when promoting Facebook’s Onavo Protect mobile app to Australian consumers.</p>

<p>Onavo Protect was a free downloadable software application providing a virtual private network (VPN) service.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ACCC alleges that, between 1 February 2016 to October 2017, Facebook and its subsidiaries Facebook Israel Ltd and Onavo, Inc. misled Australian consumers by representing that the Onavo Protect app would keep users’ personal activity data private, protected and secret, and that the data would not be used for any purpose other than providing Onavo Protect’s products.</p>

<p>In fact, the ACCC alleges, Onavo Protect collected, aggregated and used significant amounts of users’ personal activity data for Facebook’s commercial benefit. This included details about Onavo Protect users’ internet and app activity, such as records of every app they accessed and the number of seconds each day they spent using those apps.</p>

<p>This data was used to support Facebook’s market research activities, including identifying potential future acquisition targets.</p>

<p>“Through Onavo Protect, Facebook was collecting and using the very detailed and valuable personal activity data of thousands of Australian consumers for its own commercial purposes, which we believe is completely contrary to the promise of protection, secrecy and privacy that was central to Facebook’s promotion of this app,” ACCC Chair Rod Sims said.</p>

<p>“Consumers often use VPN services because they care about their online privacy, and that is what this Facebook product claimed to offer. In fact, Onavo Protect channelled significant volumes of their personal activity data straight back to Facebook.”</p>

<p>“We believe that the conduct deprived Australian consumers of the opportunity to make an informed choice about the collection and use of their personal activity data by Facebook and Onavo,” Mr Sims said.</p>

<p>The Onavo Protect website stated that the app would “save, measure and protect” users’ mobile data, while advertisements on Facebook’s website and app included statements such as “Keep it secret. Keep it safe… Onavo Protect, from Facebook”.</p>

<p>The ACCC is seeking declarations and pecuniary penalties.</p>





<p><em>The attached document below contains the ACCC’s initiating court document in relation to this matter. We will not be uploading further documents in the event this initial document is subsequently amended.</em></p>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>

<p>US-based Facebook, Inc. owns global social media and private messaging platforms including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.</p>

<p>US-based Onavo, Inc. and Onavo Mobile Ltd, based in Israel, were mobile analytics companies that were acquired by Facebook in October 2013. After the acquisition Onavo Mobile became Facebook Israel Ltd.</p>

<p>Apple removed Onavo Protect from its App store in 2018 for non-compliance with its developer terms such as, among other things, collecting information about other apps installed on a user’s device for the purposes of analytics. It was later also removed from the Google Play store and was discontinued in 2019.</p>

<p>The ACCC’s <a href="https://www.accc.gov.au/publications/digital-platforms-inquiry-final-report">Digital platforms inquiry final report</a> examined a range of issues involving digital platforms and consumers, including concerns about Onavo Protect and how its users’ data was being collected and used.</p>

<p>In December 2020, in an unrelated action, the US Federal Trade Commission (US FTC) brought proceedings against Facebook, alleging that the company is illegally maintaining its personal social networking monopoly through a years-long course of anticompetitive conduct. The US FTC alleges that Facebook engaged in a systematic strategy including its 2012 acquisition of Instagram and 2014 acquisition of WhatsApp, and the imposition of anticompetitive conditions on software developers to eliminate threats to its monopoly. The court documents filed by the US FTC refer to Facebook’s use of Onavo Protect data to identify future acquisitions as part of the allegation that Facebook is illegally maintaining a monopoly.</p>

<![CDATA[Empirical Estimates of Golden Handcuffs]]>

December 15, 2020 | https://applieddivinitystudies.com/handcuffs-empirical/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://applieddivinitystudies.com/handcuffs-empirical/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody">
       <p><a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/handcuffs/">Last post</a>, I argued against common explanations for Golden Handcuffs.</p>
<p>Before we dive deeper, it’s worth asking, are they even real? Are employees of elite companies actually pathologically unable to leave? Is it just a stereotype with no grounding in reality?</p>
<p>Here are a variety of attempts to estimate the Golden Handcuffs effect empirically.</p>
<h3 id="YC-Founders-Join-Elite-Universities-but-Not-Elite-Companies"><a href="#YC-Founders-Join-Elite-Universities-but-Not-Elite-Companies" title="YC Founders Join Elite Universities, but Not Elite Companies"></a>YC Founders Join Elite Universities, but Not Elite Companies</h3><p>Rather than examining the psychology of employees, let’s just work backwards and count how many founders have big company experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://applieddivinitystudies.com/wilbin-rationalists/">A while back</a>, I published a dataset of the top Y Combinator founders and noticed something odd.</p>
<p>Of the 26 founders, only 1 had held a full-time role at a FAANG company. [2] Two others had worked at Facebook, but only as interns. Outside of FAANG, only 3 founders had worked at companies I recognized at all. [3]</p>
<p>One explanation is the founder-as-monomaniacal-hero. Founders are totally single minded in their devotion, and would never do something as stupid as get sidetracked by prestige or status.</p>
<p>Except that they absolutely do. Of the 26 founders, 21 attended elite universities, mostly MIT and Stanford [1]. So maybe those universities are just incredibly good at fostering entrepreneurs, but more likely, they’re just good at attracting and selecting them. I take this as evidence that founders are not allergic to jumping through conventional hoops, pursuing instrumental goods, sitting down to take the SAT and so on.</p>
<p>It gets weirder when you consider population sizes. Google has around 100,000 employees, whereas MIT and Stanford undergrad programs are just 11,500 combined! And since average tenure at Google is under 4 years, each unit of headcount produces more alumni than a full degree program. [4]</p>
<p>All else equal, we should expect to sample many more founders from Google than from elite universities, but this doesn’t seem to be the case.</p>
<p>What’s going on?</p>
<h3 id="Golden-Handcuffs-as-Selection-Effects"><a href="#Golden-Handcuffs-as-Selection-Effects" title="Golden Handcuffs as Selection Effects"></a>Golden Handcuffs as Selection Effects</h3><p>One explanation is that there are no golden handcuffs and it’s all selection effects. The kinds of people who work for Google are the ones who never intended to leave in the first place. The kinds of people who want to start great companies don’t have any interest in working for somebody else.</p>
<p>This is a reasonable explanation, but applies to less than half of the founders I looked at.</p>
<p>Only 11 of the 26 founders started a company right out of school. 14 have confirmed work experience, and another 2 have scrubbed the employment history, but have long gaps between graduating from school and founding their company.</p>
<p>Maybe working for a small startup shows that you’re less risk averse than a Google employee, but I don’t totally buy this. Brandon Leonardo (Instacart) worked at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/webs/">Webs</a>, a company I’ve never heard of that claims to make “small business marketing simple”. Dan Kan (Cruise) worked at <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/uservoice/">UserVoice</a>, “the leading product feedback management software”. What exactly do these experiences select for?</p>
<p>In contrast, if you do want to start a company, working at Google seems like a great first step! You can meet co-founders and potential early employees, save money to fund yourself, gain legitimacy for investors and so on.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s possible the kinds of people who think about “gaining legitimacy for investors” are not going to start great companies. Maybe “real founders” don’t pursue instrumental goods.</p>
<h3 id="A-Third-Perspective-Ex-Google-Founded-Companies"><a href="#A-Third-Perspective-Ex-Google-Founded-Companies" title="A Third Perspective: Ex-Google Founded Companies"></a>A Third Perspective: Ex-Google Founded Companies</h3><p>We’ve been dancing around the issue, but why not just go straight to the source and look at outcomes for the population we care about?</p>
<p>Are Google employees actually bad at starting companies?</p>
<p>Looking directly at startups founded by ex-Google employees valued over a billion dollars, we get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nutanix $5.8B</li>
<li>Cohesity $2.5B</li>
<li>Asana $4.3B</li>
<li>Lucidchart $1B+</li>
<li>Rubrik $3.3B</li>
<li>Instagram (sold for $1B, valued at $100B in 2018)</li>
<li>Pinterest $43B</li>
<li>Flatiron Health $1.9B</li>
<li>Xiaomi $46B</li>
<li>Affirm $2.9B</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s a super impressive list! It doesn’t seem like ex-Google employees are bad at starting companies and pathologically incapable of quitting their jobs. Instead, the oddity is merely that they don’t attend Y Combinator.</p>
<p>That’s a different skew, and much easier to explain. Unlike regular YC founders, ex-Google employees may just be:</p>
<ul>
<li>So wealthy that they self-fund until they can raise a Series A and aren’t willing to sell 7% of their company for $125k.</li>
<li>So tired of bureaucracy that they refuse to join an accelerator.</li>
<li>So credentialed that they don’t feel a need to go through Y Combinator to gain further credibility.</li>
<li>So well connected that they raise a Series A without going through Y Combinator.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whatever the explanation, the fact remains that ex-Google employees do in fact leave to start companies.</p>
<h3 id="Adjustments-and-Proportionality"><a href="#Adjustments-and-Proportionality" title="Adjustments and Proportionality"></a>Adjustments and Proportionality</h3><p>Of course, we now have to ask if they do so proportionally. Even if Google has produced the founders of nearly a dozen billion dollar companies, we shouldn’t be impressed until we’re confident that they’re actually hitting above their weight.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_unicorn_startup_companies">Wikipedia lists</a> 495 startups worth over a billion dollars, putting Google at 2%. But if you only include US based startups, Google is at 9 out of 122, or 7%.</p>
<p>To figure out the appropriate reference class, we’ll start with the number of software engineers in the US (4 million), then identify how many ex-Google employees there were 10 years ago when most of these founders started their companies.</p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://medium.com/gabor/timeline-employee-count-growth-for-microsoft-yahoo-google-and-facebook-9ede22a37824">A partner at google</a> has compiled and released <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1L0M0u0-C_LoFrGLw0H-9nkgN9wqUhl4bUTcVI0fDZuU/edit#gid=793191479">historical headcount data</a>. This is a good starting point, but remember that we’re actually interested in the total alumni population rathern than point-in-time headcount.</p>
<p>To make this estimate, I assume 3 year average tenure and run a simplified simulation where 33% of the workforce quits at the end of each year, then Google rehires up to next year’s headcount. </p>
<p>Running this simulation from 2000 to 2010, we get that there were 50,000 ex-Google employees in 2010. They’ve <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.quora.com/How-many-software-engineers-does-Google-have">previously said the workforce is 40% technical</a>, so that’s equivalent to 20,000 engineers. [5]</p>
<p>Pitting that against the 4 million software engineers in the US [6], we get that ex-Google engineers were around 0.5% of the relevant population, but started 7% of the US based billion dollar startups. That’s a mulitple of 14x, and fairly good evidence that Google employees are not particularly bad at starting companies. [7]</p>
<h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Taking a step back, recall that what we’re actually curious about is not whether Google engineers are disproportionately successful at starting companies, but whether they even try in the first place. In other words, do they appear irrationally bound by Golden Handcuffs?</p>
<p>Compared to a randomly selected US based engineer, Google engineers have all sorts of benefits. They’re well credentialed, well connected, largely based in Silicon Valley, and supposedly smarter than average.</p>
<p>It’s entirely possible that their success rate is 140x that of a typical engineer, but they only try one tenth as often. The fact that Google engineers start successful companies doesn’t preclude the possibility that Golden Handcuffs are holding them back.</p>
<p>Further, consider that “rationality” in this case is really a function of both odds of success and opportunity cost. Even if Google engineers are less likely to start companies, it could be a perfectly reasonable choice given their relatively high opportunity cost.</p>
<p>So at the end of the day, the empirical data tells us a few interesting things, but can’t present a decisive conclusion.</p>
<hr>
<p>[1] The other universities I count as “elite” are:</p>
<ul>
<li>RISD</li>
<li>Joint RISD/MIT</li>
<li>2 x Harvard</li>
<li>University of Waterloo</li>
<li>Berkeley, Columbia MBA</li>
</ul>
<p>The ones I don’t include are:</p>
<ul>
<li>USD</li>
<li>San Jose State University</li>
<li>Rice</li>
<li>Duke</li>
<li>Claremont McKenna College</li>
</ul>
<p>I do include 4 founders who attended Stanford for grad school, but did not attend an elite undergraduate institution.</p>
<p>[2] Apoorva Mehta of Instacart spent 2 years at Amazon.</p>
<p>[3] Tony Xu of DoorDash was an intern at Square, and worked full time at McKinsey for 2 years, and eBay for another 2. Fred Ehrsam of Coinbase had spent 2 years at Goldman Sachs. Brian Armstrong of same had interned at IBM and Deloitte, then spent a year at Airbnb. Though notably, this was in May 2011, back when Airbnb was a small Series A startup with under $10 million in total funding.</p>
<p>[4] This ends up being a bit complicated. Reportedly, Google has an average tenure of 3.2 years with a median of 1.1. This is possible, but odd, and I’m not sure how they got these numbers. It’s tricky because at any given time, some population of employees has not left and you don’t know how long they’ll stay. If you count their tenure as their tenure-to-date, you’re undercounting how long they’ll actually end up staying. If you only count employees who have left, you’re skewed toward employees with short tenure. Also, Google has grown over the years, and we’re looking at founders who are successful now but started out 10 years ago when Google was around 25,000 employees.</p>
<p>[5] Data <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FeDDGo_SWeDMMZlTrJ_P2TifyJoOqAuOD8klBKQpUdA/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>. And yes, it’s possible the proportion of engineers has changed over time and this analysis is off.</p>
<p>This also helps explain why there are relatively so many founders from top universities. In the same 10 year time span, Stanford and MIT undergrad graduated around 115,000 alumni.</p>
<p>[6] Maybe we should be looking at the number of people who have been software engineers from 2000 to 2010 including retirements, and this number is actually higher. Assuming 40 year careers, and a constantly total number of engineers, it should be something like 25% higher, and Google is proportionately 25% better than it appears in the main text.</p>
<p>[7] There are lots of over corrections you could apply here, so don’t take this too literally. Maybe the relevant population is all people, not just engineers. In that case, Google ends up looking way better since the general population is much less than 40% engineers. </p>

<p>Alchemy gets a bad press. It has done for centuries. Changing base metal into gold is, at best, a delusional dream and at worst a con-trick, a shyster’s brag. In Ben Jonson’s play&nbsp;<em>The Alchemist,&nbsp;</em>Subtle is an unashamed charlatan who promises his clients limitless wealth through access to the Philosopher’s Stone. One of&nbsp;<em>The Canterbury Tales – The Canon’s Yeoman’s Tale</em>&nbsp;– revolves around the story of a canon selling a pot capable of producing silver at will. Recent scholarship has suggested that Chaucer was familiar with a real case where a chaplain claimed, through alchemical practice, to be able to conjure coins of silver and gold which he then sold to the Mint for a tidy profit.</p>



<p>Isaac Newton’s interest in alchemy is well-known. His work on physics was dwarfed by the vast corpus of unpublishable material on alchemy and the occult. In 1936, John Maynard Keynes bought a sheaf of his manuscripts and spent years trying to unravel their arcane weavings. His conclusion challenged Newton’s pre-eminent position in the scientific pantheon: ‘Newton was not the first of the age of reason. He was the last of the magicians, the last of the Babylonians and Sumerians, the last great mind which looked out on the visible and intellectual world with the same eyes as those who began to build our intellectual inheritance rather less than 10,000 years ago.’&nbsp;Newton’s early biographers suppressed this less empirical side of his work, lest it undermine his authority. Newton himself kept it quiet – as well he might. Many alchemical practices were banned at the time and punishment for conviction reputedly included hanging from a gallows wrapped with silvery tinsel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In Russia, Peter the Great’s favourite scientist was Count Iakov Brius – son of a Scottish immigrant. They travelled together to London on Peter’s notorious Grand Embassy, and Brius stayed on for six months to study science and collect scientific instruments. Back in Moscow, he set up an observatory in the Sukharev Tower, ran a School of Navigation, built Russia’s first Newtonian telescope, promoted Copernican astronomy, and commissioned and wrote a good deal of science and mathematics. Yet he is remembered in Russia as&nbsp;<em>Koldun na Sukharevoi bashne&nbsp;</em>‘the wizard in the Sukharev Tower’ (the title of a nineteenth-century novel about him by Ivan Lazhechnikov) – the man who turned silver into gold and owned a book written by the devil himself. In 1934, Stalin demanded the tower be destroyed, and everything in it brought to him. As the demolition took place, so the story goes, a tall man in a powdered wig was spotted in the crowd, jabbing an accusing finger at the work.</p>



<p>The popular image of alchemy, of the transmutation of metals, is a misunderstanding, a corrupt simplification. Alchemy embraces a hugely sophisticated set of beliefs and practices, and a high-minded cosmology. The universe is not static but a dynamic system on a very slow trajectory towards ultimate perfection. At the heart of all matter lies the&nbsp;<em>prima materia.&nbsp;</em>&nbsp;The natural world is struggling to restore it, to shake off all the impurities and return Creation to its harmonious state. What alchemy offers is a participation in this process, an acceleration of it, requiring only the discovery of&nbsp;<em>lapis philosophorum</em>&nbsp;as agent to convert substances into the&nbsp;<em>prima materia.</em>&nbsp;The quest for the Philosopher’s Stone was not so different from the cathartic promises of most religions<em>&nbsp;–</em>&nbsp;but rather than temple and priest, it involved furnaces and alembics and distillation vessels, all the paraphernalia of a laboratory.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In recent years, the study of alchemy has enjoyed something of a revival. Its importance in the history of science is becoming much more widely understood. Serious scholarship and international symposia are conducted in its name. Newton’s esoterica are now on-line, through the Cambridge Digital Library. Yet overturning centuries of prejudice does not come easily. One of the principal revisionists, Lawrence Principe of John Hopkins University, was recently ‘yelled at’ in a conference for discussing alchemy and accused of taking ‘hallucinatory drugs’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alchemy has its origins in the great ferment of Alexandria in the early Christian centuries. The ideas of Gnostics and Neoplatonists were combined with those of Babylon and ancient Egypt. One of the earliest texts, written by a pupil of Democritus, is the&nbsp;<em>Physika kai Mystika – ‘Of Natural and Hidden Questions’.&nbsp;</em>It is the adventure of hidden questions that really drove the alchemists, the Platonic idea that we live in a world that is only partially visible. To try and glean the veiled elements of our world was the&nbsp;<em>Opus Magnum&nbsp;</em>of alchemy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The great fifteenth-century alchemist, Sir George Ripley, was not alone in recognizing the mysterious nature of his enthusiasm. The Philosopher’s Stone would enable the ultimate reduction of matter. It was substance, but spirit too. It was elusive, but ubiquitous: ‘The philosophers say that the birds and fishes bring the Stone to us, each man possesses it, it is everywhere, in you, in me, in all things’. Reach the heart of things and you find enigma, paradox, ambiguity. That is the legacy of the alchemists. It is also what Einstein discovered, and what the pioneers of particle physics and mathematics are discovering too. The zealots of the Enlightenment did their best to purge it from the new scientific tradition; now that tradition has matured, the role of alchemy can be properly examined.</p>

  <blockquote>
  <p>This article is the result of my latest obsession with software virtualization. After years of just skipping virtualized routines, I was finally inspired by <a href="https://blog.can.ac/" target="_blank">Can</a> and started work on this complex topic. What ensued was months of reverse engineering, functional programming, and a LOT of learning. Now that I finally feel comfortable publishing some information on the things I learned in the process, I present unto you the first installment in my devirtualization series, focusing on how virtualization works and the methodology of how we can lift a VM. The aim of this series is to tear down the curtains behind virtualization and hopefully inspire more reverse engineers to research this interesting topic!</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>

<p>Over the last 10 years or so, virtualization based obfuscation has become the de-facto standard in defensive and offensive software alike. As the complexity and power of disassembling tools has improved, software security solutions have kept up rather well. Packers and code mutation tools, being easily defeated by even newbie attackers, have been replaced by these virtual machine based protectors. Today, the two main ‘pioneers’ in this field, controlling the vast majority of the market are <a href="https://vmpsoft.com/" target="_blank">VMProtect</a> and <a href="https://www.oreans.com/" target="_blank">Themida</a>. While we will be looking into analyzing (and breaking) them specifically in some future articles, today we’ll just be looking into how we can lift <em>any</em> VM into <a href="https://blog.can.ac/" target="_blank">Can</a>’s promising <a href="https://vtil.io/" target="_blank">VTIL</a>.</p>

<h2 id="but-first-what-actually-is-virtualization">But first, what actually is virtualization?</h2>
<p>Virtualization is the <strong>recompilation</strong> of instructions to a <strong>custom proprietary architecture</strong>, and the generation of <strong>handler routines</strong> to emulate said architecture. Let’s look at an example of the life of just one simple instruction, <code>push rcx</code>:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://0xnobody.github.io/assets/virtualization-1/vm-flowchart.png" alt="alt text" title="Life of a push rcx instruction"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>The mystical adventure <code>push rcx</code> undertakes when you press ‘Protect’</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>The <code>push rcx</code> instruction is decoded, and interpreted by the virtualizer. A handler is generated (or fetched, if it has already been generated and is being reused), which is responsible for executing this instruction in a way that the CPU understands. In our example, I called this handler <code>VPUSH</code> just for explanation’s sake, but obviously they don’t come with names attached to them.</p>

<p>Following this, a ‘virtual instruction’ is then assembled, which contains bytes to identify its handler (in this case, just a table offset) and any operands that are needed for execution. You can see in the diagram above, that the bytes corresponding to the instruction’s <strong>handler offset</strong> are in <strong>green</strong>, whereas the ones corresponding to the <strong>operand</strong> (ie. the <strong>target register</strong>) are in <strong>blue</strong>. This is also reflected in the handler with the corresponding colours.</p>

<p>It’s worth noting, that on handler execution, the virtual instruction pointer (VIP) actually points to the beginning of the <strong>blue</strong> operand bytes. This is because the previous handler has to read (and consume) the next handler’s offset in order to pass control over to it.</p>

<p>Anyways, let’s take a closer look at this <code>VPUSH</code> handler:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>movzx</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[rbp]</span> 
<span>; - rbp is the virtual instruction pointer (VIP) in this case, which contains the pushed register (blue)</span>
<span>; - the pushed register is fetched and stored in ax. In our case this is 0x30</span>

<span>mov</span> <span>rax</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rsi</span> <span>+</span> <span>rax</span><span>]</span> 
<span>; - rsi is the virtual context; it holds each of the virtual registers. Think of a CONTEXT structure on </span>
<span>; windows.</span>
<span>; - the lower word in rax holds the register offset in the context. The register is fetched from the</span>
<span>; context and stored in rax.</span>

<span>push</span> <span>rax</span>
<span>; - the stored register is pushed to the stack.</span>

<span>movzx</span> <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>word</span> <span>ptr</span> <span>[</span><span>rbp</span><span>+</span><span>0x2</span><span>]</span>
<span>mov</span> <span>rdx</span><span>,</span> <span>[</span><span>rdi</span><span>+</span><span>rdx</span><span>]</span>
<span>; - VIP + 0x2 contains the next handler's offset (green). It is fetched and stored in rdx</span>
<span>; - rdi is the handler table base. The next handler is fetched by offseting it by rdx and storing the</span>
<span>; handler address</span>

<span>add</span> <span>rbp</span><span>,</span> <span>0x4</span>
<span>; - the instruction pointer is incremented by the size of bytes consumed</span>

<span>jmp</span> <span>rdx</span>
<span>; - jump to the next handler, held by rdx, to execute the next instruction's handler</span>
<span>; - the execution loop continues...</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Virtual machines are basically just very <strong>very</strong> long chains of these handlers, each doing quite rudimentary operations.
It must be said, however, that the example I gave above is an extremely simple one. Modern virtualizers have integrated encryption and obfuscation techniques, and some feature quite advanced custom architectures. Many stray far away from the x86 instruction set to make the analyst’s life harder.</p>

<p>Well, how does this impact analysis, you ask? Well, since you’re reading this article, you must already know ;)
But to name a few:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The original instructions are lost, forever. Only the behaviour is retained, in a proprietary, usually randomized architecture. For example, even after full devirtualization, we can’t for 100% say that the original register used for the push is <code>rcx</code>.</li>
  <li>The VM’s architecture can differ significantly from the original. For example, a single VM instruction could push 3 registers, exchange 2 registers, and write to one register. All in a <em>single</em> virtual instruction!</li>
  <li>Other obfuscation techniques (such as mutation) can now be applied on both the host level (real x86 instructions executing on the PC) and on the guest level (the virtual instructions represented by the handlers).</li>
  <li>Control flow is in most cases highly obscured. Often conditional jumps are manually emulated. This makes tracking basic blocks difficult.</li>
  <li>The VM cannot be statically analyzed in tools like IDA, as it does not function like a conventional program.</li>
</ul>

<p>Needless to say, virtualization is an extremely powerful and effective software protection method.</p>

<h2 id="lets-break-it">Let’s break it!</h2>
<p>In order to break and reverse this protection, we really just need to do three things: gather information in order to determine exactly what each handler does in which order, somehow convert this information into a language that the CPU and disassemblers understand (in our case, x86), and then finally repackage the binary.
This is called <em>lifting</em>, <em>translation</em>, and <em>repackaging</em> respectively, and it is what needs to be done to devirtualize any VM.
Today, we’re just gonna be looking at <em>lifting</em> in particular.</p>

<h2 id="lifting">Lifting</h2>
<p>The dictionary definition for lifting is “raise to a higher position or level”. This is entirely true. We are performing analyis on the virtual routines, in order to determine what each handler does on the instruction level, and then converting this information into a higher level, easy-to-understand representation. This is done in a few steps.</p>

<h3 id="navigation">Navigation</h3>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th><img src="https://0xnobody.github.io/assets/virtualization-1/virt-starter-pack.png" alt="alt text" title="Ha ha xd"></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><em>After analyzing VMs for a few hours (or days), you do begin to notice certain things.</em></td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Before we can perform any handler analysis, we must first be able to navigate our way around the VM. Although this step varies greatly for each VM, certain parts always remain the same.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Every VM routine must begin by saving the value of each register, usually by pushing them to the stack. This is done because the VM needs to use the registers to run its handlers, and it must restore the registers after exiting the VM.</li>
  <li>Each VM must also have some sort of context structure. This is where current executing information about the VM is held, such as register values. It can easily be identified as it is accessed very often in every handler.</li>
  <li>Each VM must have an instruction pointer (VIP) used to determine which handler to execute next and to provide that handler with operands. It is also easy to identify, as it much be adjusted after each handler.</li>
  <li>Many VMs have some sort of stack representation. For example, VMProtect uses a nominated register to access the stack, whereas Themida just uses RSP.</li>
  <li>Code flow must somehow be passed from one handler to the next. This can just be an index in a handler table, an offset to some point in the code, or something entirely different. It is worth noting that the next handler <em>must</em> be computed from the VIP.</li>
</ul>

<p>In order to properly analyze and decode each handler, we must be able to follow the VM’s execution. We must follow the VM’s <em>fetch-&gt;decode-&gt;execute</em> loop, so we are able to determine which handler will be executed next. Once the basics of the VM are reversed and we can step through the handler instructions, the next step is to identify these handlers.</p>

<h3 id="identification">Identification</h3>
<p>Now we need to determine what each handler does. We can achieve this via <em>pattern matching</em> the instructions. Of course, we must remember to keep these patterns balanced, ensuring we match all the relevant instructions but make them generic enough so that we can match with all instances of the handler.</p>

<p><em>Pattern matching</em> is quite a generic method, and can be used in various different flavours alongside many other algorithms depending on the complexity of the VM. But in this example we’re gonna take it easy, and just look at a simple forward matching algorithm. This allows us to specify the patterns we want to match, and the order we want to match them in.</p>

<p>Let’s use the above <code>push</code> handler as an example:</p>

<div><div><pre><code><span>// this class contains templates to pattern match against</span>
<span>//</span>
<span>auto</span> <span>matcher</span> <span>=</span> <span>new</span> <span>pattern_matcher</span><span>(</span><span>stream</span><span>);</span>

<span>// these are the constant registers</span>
<span>// they are hardcoded here for simplicity's sake</span>
<span>//</span>
<span>x86_reg</span> <span>vip_reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>X86_REG_RBP</span><span>;</span>
<span>x86_reg</span> <span>vcontext_reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>X86_REG_RSI</span><span>;</span>

<span>// these values will be set as the patterns are found</span>
<span>// they allow us to ensure that the same register is used for more than one pattern</span>
<span>// they also allow us to retrieve specific information about the handler eg. operand sizes</span>
<span>//</span>
<span>x86_reg</span> <span>pushed_reg_idx_reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>X86_REG_INVALID</span><span>;</span>
<span>uint64_t</span> <span>pushed_reg_idx_offs</span> <span>=</span> <span>-</span><span>1</span><span>;</span>

<span>x86_reg</span> <span>pushed_reg</span> <span>=</span> <span>X86_REG_INVALID</span><span>;</span>
 
<span>auto</span> <span>result</span> <span>=</span> <span>matcher</span>
    <span>// match for `mov %0, [%vip + %1]`</span>
    <span>// %0 is written to pushed_reg_idx_reg, %1 is written to pushed_reg_idx_offs</span>

    <span>// match for `mov %2, [%ctx + %0]`</span>
    <span>// %2 is written to pushed_reg</span>

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Static quantization allows the user to generate quantized integer model that is highly efficient during inference. However, sometimes, even with careful post-training calibration, the model accuracies might be sacrificed to some extent that is not acceptable. If this is the case, post-training calibration is not sufficient to generate a quantized integer model. We would have train the model in a way so that the quantization effect has been taken into account. Quantization aware training is capable of modeling the quantization effect during training.</p>



<p>The mechanism of quantization aware training is simple, it places fake quantization modules, i.e., quantization and dequantization modules, at the places where quantization happens during floating-point model to quantized integer model conversion, to simulate the effects of clamping and rounding brought by integer quantization. The fake quantization modules will also monitor scales and zero points of the weights and activations. Once the quantization aware training is finished, the floating point model could be converted to quantized integer model immediately using the information stored in the fake quantization modules.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to show how to use PyTorch to do quantization aware training. More details about the mathematical foundations of quantization for neural networks could be found in my article <a href="https://leimao.github.io/article/Neural-Networks-Quantization/">â€œQuantization for Neural Networksâ€�</a>.</p>

<h3 id="pytorch-quantization-aware-training">PyTorch Quantization Aware Training</h3>

<p>Unlike TensorFlow 2.3.0 which supports integer quantization using arbitrary bitwidth from 2 to 16, PyTorch 1.7.0 only supports 8-bit integer quantization. The workflow could be as easy as loading a pre-trained floating point model and apply a quantization aware training wrapper. However, without doing layer fusion, sometimes such kind of easy manipulation would not result in good model performances.</p>



<p>In this case, I will also use the ResNet18 from <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torchvision/models.html">TorchVision models</a> as an example. All the steps prior, to the quantization aware training steps, including layer fusion and skip connections replacement, are exactly the same as to the ones used in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/PyTorch-Static-Quantization/">â€œPyTorch Static Quantizationâ€�</a>. The source code could also be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/leimao/PyTorch-Quantization-Aware-Training">GitHub</a>.</p>



<p>The quantization aware training steps are also very similar to post-training calibration:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Train a floating point model or load a pre-trained floating point model.</li>
  <li>Move the model to CPU and switch model to training mode.</li>
  <li>Apply layer fusion.</li>
  <li>Switch model to evaluation mode, check if the layer fusion results in correct model, and switch back to training mode.</li>
  <li>Apply <code>torch.quantization.QuantStub()</code> and <code>torch.quantization.QuantStub()</code> to the inputs and outputs, respectively.</li>
  <li>Specify quantization configurations, such as symmetric quantization or asymmetric quantization, etc.</li>
  <li>Prepare quantization model for quantization aware training.</li>
  <li>Move the model to CUDA and run quantization aware training using CUDA.</li>
  <li>Move the model to CPU and convert the quantization aware trained floating point model to quantized integer model.</li>
  <li>[Optional] Verify accuracies and inference performance gain.</li>
  <li>Save the quantized integer model.</li>
</ol>

<p>The quantization aware training script is very similar to the one used in <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/PyTorch-Static-Quantization/">â€œPyTorch Static Quantizationâ€�</a>:</p>

<h2>INTRO</h2>



<p>A few years ago, I got the opportunity to architect and code the fire propagation system in Far Cry 2. &nbsp;At that time, &nbsp;it was a gigantic task and it scared the hell out of me. Luckily, it turned out well enough.</p>



<p>With the upcoming Far Cry 3, several people recently asked me how the system worked. I realized that I never took the time to write it down. So, before I forget and also because it might be useful to somebody out there, here’s a high level overview of its inner workings. &nbsp;Pretty programmer art included as a bonus.</p>



<p><em>Disclaimer: Although Far Cry 3 uses the same system I wrote, I was not involved in the project. They may or may not have changed / adapted or modified the algorithms. What I describe below is accurate for Far Cry 2.</em></p>

<h2>BASE STRUCTURE</h2>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACell1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACell1.jpg 600w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACell1-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>A 2D Grid good for grass fire. &nbsp;Here, a fire cell has 50 hitpoints</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>At the core, the fire propagation system is quite simple. Since gameplay is what’s important, we&nbsp;sacrifice some of the realism for fun. The fire propagation in&nbsp;Far Cry 2 &nbsp;(and Far Cry 3) has just enough realism to maintain the player’s&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_of_disbelief">suspension of disbelief</a>,&nbsp;but certainly not enough to get published anytime soon. Because I like to&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">keep things simple</a>, it doesn’t involve any complicated mathematics, physics or fluid dynamics. That has the additional advantage to be fast to simulate and easy to understand.</p>



<p>The secret sauce is an&nbsp;equally spaced grid. It is true for grass, for objects as well as for trees. The only difference is that we use a 2D grid for grass and a 3D grid for objects and trees.</p>



<p>Each cell of the grid has a position in the world, a radius and&nbsp;<strong>hitpoints</strong>. The cells have a plethora of&nbsp;properties, but these three are the bare minimum to propagate fire.</p>



<h2>LIGHT MY FIRE! HOW TO START ONE?</h2>



<p>The game engine tracks all damage done in the game, might it be bullet shots, impacts or fire damage. When a game entity is damaged, it is notified by an event. The damage event includes how much damage was done, what kind it was and what caused it.&nbsp;&nbsp;If the kind of damage was fire based and the entity is flammable, then at least two things happen:</p>



<ul><li>Firstly, the fire grid is dynamically created for the damaged entity. We create them dynamically because we don’t want those grids&nbsp;to exist in the wild for no reasons. That would take memory, disk space, etc, so we create them as we go. But, once created, it remains as long as the game entity exists.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Secondly, we figure out which cell in the grid is closest to the damage source. That cell then takes the damage and its hitpoints are reduced accordingly.</li></ul>



<p>That’s where things get interesting – When a cell has been damaged by fire and has lost all its hitpoints;&nbsp;<strong>it catches fire</strong>.</p>



<p>While burning, the cell becomes a damager itself. It deals damage to its neighbour cells on the grid; cells that share an edge with it. By doing so, it reduces their hitpoints and when in turns these cells have lost all their hitpoints, they catch fire. That’s how the propagation is created.<br></p>

The cells on the fire front are being damaged.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>Lastly, a cell from the grid as a finite lifetime. Otherwise, it would burn forever. It can be seen as the amount of energy given by the material that is burning. &nbsp;For instance,&nbsp;a piece of paper would most likely burn faster than a wood log, so it would be given a shorter lifetime value.</p>



<p>That’s it. A fully functional fire propagation system good enough for a AAA game!</p>



<h2>TECHNICALITIES</h2>



<p><strong>Simulate wet jungle VS dry patch of grass</strong><br>How to simulate a wet jungle versus a dry patch of grass? They behave differently. Quite easily!<br>Increase the fire cell’s hitpoints and it’s difficult to set it on fire and it’s slow to propagate.&nbsp;Decrease its burning lifetime and the fire dies out quickly. There, you just simulated a wet jungle environment.</p>



<p><strong>How to create the propagation grids</strong></p>



<p><strong><em>Grass / Land</em></strong><br>For grass wildfire, &nbsp;an axis-aligned 2D grid is built in realtime and projected on a 3D terrain. For each of the cell, we take care to determine if the cell position is underwater, or under an object such as a rock or a building. In which case, we disable that cell and it can no longer catch fire. We wouldn’t want to have fire propagating under rock, would we?<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDisabled.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDisabled.jpg 512w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDisabled-300x220.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 512px) 100vw, 512px"><figcaption>2D grid projected on a terrain. The cells under the rock are disabled.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong><em>Objects</em></strong><br>For objects, it’s a little bit more complicated. First, we create an&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bounding_volume">AABB</a>&nbsp;that entirely surrounds the object. &nbsp;Second, we somehow&nbsp;need to detect the shape of that object. After all, it could be a chair, an oil barrel or a whole house for all we know. To accomplish that, the &nbsp;bounding box is divided in equally spaced cubes.&nbsp;The size of each cube depends of the object size, the number of fire emitter we want to have, performance, memory, etc.</p>



<p>An iterative algorithm then go through all those cubes and test their location against the collision shape of the object.&nbsp;If the test return a positive result, this cube is kept, otherwise it is discarded. At the end, we have a collection of cubes that approximately&nbsp;represent the shape of the object to be burned. That’s our propagation grid.<br></p>

<h2><strong>WIND EFFECT</strong></h2>



<p>The wind is an important disruptive factor for a wildfire and it adds a great layer of realism for the player. &nbsp;Here it could be tempting to&nbsp;over-think&nbsp;the design and go with a very complicated system. After all, it’s an active area of research and&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1540748912001988">several</a>&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378475407002030">papers</a>&nbsp;on the subject are available online.</p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-s2.0-S0378475407002030-gr3-300x235-1.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/1-s2.0-S1540748912001988-gr3.jpg" alt=""></figure></div>



<p>Luckily, with what have been explained thus far, it’s quite easy to simulate if we accept to cut corners a bit.</p>



<p>In our system, the fire propagates by damaging the&nbsp;neighbor&nbsp;cells on a grid. And it is generally accepted that a fire should spread faster in the direction of the wind than against&nbsp;the wind? Then, with that in mind, we can create a rule where a burning cell deals more damage to its&nbsp;neighbor&nbsp;cells if that neighbor is in the direction of the wind.</p>



<p>We do that by getting the&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product">dot product</a>&nbsp;between the wind direction&nbsp;vector and the direction of the&nbsp;neighbor&nbsp;cell to damage.&nbsp;If the result is greater than zero, then that node is dealt greater damage. &nbsp;Likewise, if the result is negative, &nbsp;the node is against the wind and should be dealt less damage. To be fancy, the amount of damage is interpolated with the dot product result as shown in the picture below.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACellWindEffect1.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACellWindEffect1.jpg 600w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/ACellWindEffect1-300x206.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>The cell on fire causes more damage to its neighbor cells if they are in the direction of the wind.</figcaption></figure></div>



<p>With that rule alone, you will get a nice bell shaped fire front that propagates in the direction of the wind. Simple, yet believable&nbsp;enough to get the player’s stamp of approval.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that we simulate gravity the exact same way.</p>



<h2>PROPAGATING TO THINGS AROUND AND CHAIN REACTIONS</h2>



<p>When a cell burns, it sends a “I’m on fire and I burn this much in this radius” message down&nbsp;the game event pipeline. This event is caught by objects, AI and other game systems that are in that area. They react&nbsp;to this message their own specific ways. The AI freaks out, the flammable objects get damaged and eventually catch fire. And, &nbsp;it is also true for dynamic objects. &nbsp;For example, if a burning oil barrel goes flying through the map, every step of the way, &nbsp;it will send that “i’m burning” message and a lot of things around might hear it.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDmgZone.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDmgZone.jpg 719w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/2DGridDmgZone-300x284.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 719px) 100vw, 719px"><figcaption>In the absence of wind, a cell on fire damages equally all its neighbors.</figcaption></figure></div>







<p>This causes a chain reaction effect where trees, explosive items, &nbsp;objects and patches of grass set each others on fire. &nbsp;It’s completely&nbsp;systemic and it makes it much more believable. It &nbsp;also scores pretty high on the&nbsp;player’s&nbsp;fun meter because it behaves as one would expect, yet as real fire, it sometimes gets totally out of control.</p>



<h2>OPTIMISATION</h2>



<p><strong>The Hair Transplant Strategy</strong></p>



<p>In an ideal world, we would have access to enough memory to hold&nbsp;an infinite number of particle emitters and we could display an infinite number of particles on screen.&nbsp;Unfortunately, the reality is that those numbers are actually pretty low.</p>



<p>To do more with less, we have to put our emitters where it really counts. Enters the hair transplant strategy! &nbsp;In Far Cry 2, the fire emitters are constantly being teleported around, most importantly, from the back of the camera to the front. The player’s point of view is monitored at all time and emitters that are burning out of sight are moved to a better location where they are also needed.</p>



<p>In addition, the emitters’s density is higher in close proximity of the player and lower as the distance increases. A kind of fire&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_detail">LOD&nbsp;</a>if you will.&nbsp;If things are getting bad and we still need more emitters but none are available, we increase the particle sizes to give them more volume and fill more space on screen.</p>



<p>With this strategy, and some others, we can simulate a wildfire that is several meters wide with a relatively low number of particle emitters.<br></p>



<div><figure><img src="http://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/farc2.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/farc2.jpg 600w, https://jflevesque.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/farc2-300x169.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px"><figcaption>Credits: http://www.rockpapershotgun.com</figcaption></figure></div>



<p><strong>Event Pipeline</strong><br>Since the described system tried to avoid all complicated maths, generally speaking we will be GPU bound before being&nbsp;CPU bound.</p>



<p>That being said, the event pipeline could be a bottleneck. It works well when you have just a few cells on fire. But, it’s another story when you have thousands of them burning and&nbsp;advertising&nbsp;their state to the world. That will likely clog your CPU’s arteries.</p>



<p>The trick for me was to regroup the cells that were burning into&nbsp;<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20160114121147/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis-aligned_bounding_box#Axis-aligned_minimum_bounding_box" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AABB</a>&nbsp;groups. These groups would constantly merge, split and&nbsp;change shape to follow the evolution of the fire. The events would then be sent per AABB instead of per cell, which saves&nbsp;a significant amount of processing power. Additionally, the events would be spread out across several frames in order to distribute the load and avoid framerate spikes.</p>



<p><strong>Keeping things under control.</strong><br>In your game, if you don’t constrain the propagation somehow, it will either</p>

      <p>There's a well-known quote by author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Pollan">Michael Pollan</a>:
        "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants." I like it because it doesn't
        attempt to be dogmatic: it encapsulates some basic guiding principles that get
        you 90% of the way there 90% of the time. Wikipedia describes the book the quote
        is from (emphasis mine):</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He explains...the notion that nutritionism and, therefore, the whole Western
          framework through which we intellectualize the value of food <strong>is more a religious
and faddish devotion to the mythology of simple solutions than a convincing and
reliable conclusion of incontrovertible scientific research</strong>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>That...sounds familiar.</p>
      <h2 id="write-code">Write code </h2>
      <p>Code, like food, has value. I think those of us who write it can (hopefully)
        agree on that. Some, though, are so afraid of writing/eating
        <em>too much</em> that they avoid writing/eating what they should.</p>
      <p>In the context of programming, I think this translates to an unhealthy fear
        (again, for some) of duplication. A little bit of duplication - writing
        something in a way that doesn't completely maximize conciseness - isn't the end
        of the world. Sometimes it's the best path forward. Sometimes it's okay to
        copy-and-modify here and there, especially when you're still figuring out what
        your application will end up being.</p>
      <h2 id="not-too-much">Not too much </h2>
      <p>Of course too much code, like too much food, can also be a bad thing. This is
        a well-trodden topic so I don't feel the need to go too far into it here.</p>
      <p>Just be aware of your project's "appetite": write what needs to be written,
        and then try not to over-indulge.</p>
      <h2 id="mostly-functions">Mostly functions </h2>
      <p>By "functions" here I mean "pure functions". You could make a case that pure
        functions aren't the "plants" of code, though I feel
        that they are. In my experience most codebases have a pure functional
        subset, and I believe writing that subset in a pure-functional style is nearly
        always a win for the long-term health of the project.</p>
      <p>Of course the qualifier is "mostly": this isn't a dogma. Writing a 100%
        functional system ("going vegan", if you will) often requires you to jump
        through a bunch of extra hoops to get all the functionality you need. Looking
        at it solely from the perspective of health, those extra complications may not
        be worth it.</p>
      <p>And then different projects have different needs: just as an athlete may need
        a larger percentage of protein, or individuals may have certain nutrient
        deficiencies, a project may only have a very small functional subset, or may not
        be able to afford to return new values each time due to data size or
        performance-sensitivity. There's nothing wrong with that.</p>
      <h2 id="%22real-code%22">"Real code" </h2>
      <p>Pollan later qualifies his snappy statement a bit further:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>He contends that most of what Americans now buy in supermarkets, fast food
          stores, and restaurants is not in fact food, and that a practical tip is to eat
          only those things that people of his grandmother's generation would have
          recognized as food.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>At the risk of stretching the analogy, maybe the equivalent is
        "code only those things that people at a junior level would recognize for what
        they do". Code in simple, straightforward terms. Don't get too clever,
        "manufacturing artificial ingredients". Use the primitives that are there, when
        possible. Write what is simple, and natural, and human.</p>

										Your Brain Doesn't Work the Way You Think It Does									</a>
									 &nbsp;by Clay Skipper									<br>
								</h5>
								
								<p>
									Takeaways
								</p>
								<div>
									<p><span>Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett is a neuroscientist, psychology distinguished professor at Northeastern, and an author of several books including (most recent) </span><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/48930266"><i><span>Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Clay’s review of the book: “It’s like lifting up the hood of a car to see an engine, except that the car is you and you find an engine that doesn’t work at all like you thought it did.”&nbsp; — Clay Skipper&nbsp;</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>This piece was a condensed interview between Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett and Clay Skipper on sense data, reality, body budgets, and much more! Read the entire article if you’d like or here were my favorite takeaways/quotes from the piece:</span></p>
<p><span>“The actions and the experiences that your brain makes today become your brain’s predictions for tomorrow. So making an effort to cultivate new experiences and learn new things today is an investment in who you will be tomorrow.” — Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett</span></p>
<p><span>Our brain’s main job is running a budget for our body. The technical term for body budgets is allostasis. “…Every thought you have, every emotion you feel, every action you take is ultimately in the service of regulating your body.” — Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>If we keep the budget analogy going, sometimes our bodies can go into debt. Uncertainty, stress, anxiety, and other things can cause this debt. Try and pay off the debt by getting enough sleep, eating healthfully, giving and receiving support to loved ones, and so on.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Our brains are constantly digging into our backlog of experiences and memory to construct what it believes to be our realities. As we move about the world and experience reality, our brains are predicting constantly.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>“Those predictions come from not just your own past experiences, but what you read and what you see in the news and what you watch on television and the social media that you’re exposed to.” — Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>Predictions and sense data combined make up how our brains make sense of the world/reality. “…Your brain gives meaning to the sensory inputs from your body and from the world (called sense data), and you’re almost always unaware that it’s happening.” — Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett</span></p>
								</div>
								<p><img src="https://gradually.co/wp-content/themes/gradually/img/two-cents.png">
								</p><!-- end half sqaure arrow -->
								<p><b><i>My two cents</i></b><span>: Our brains are so weird. And it’s even weirder that we still know so little about them and how they work. Dr. Lisa Feldman Barrett does a really good job of explaining her understanding of them. The takeaway that stuck out to me the most was on body budgets and debt. It aligns perfectly with the importance of self-care.</span></p>

Please unenroll me. Thank you.”” in response to “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/technicaldebtgames/">technicaldebtgames</a>1 point·<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LambdaSchool/comments/kdxf3k/why_im_enrolling_in_lambda_schools_full_time_web/gg02qmm/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank">24 minutes ago</a></p>
<p>Jesus this is a… thing.</p>
<p>Listen, don’t go to LS. It’s a waste of money. If you think you will be working on team projects, you won’t. That was my assumption, too, but the truth is that you are too busy doing course busywork to work on actual projects, and when you finally DO work on a group project, 75% of your group is so unequipped to handle working on literally ANYTHING, that if you are experienced in ANY way, you will be holding everyone’s hand teaching them basic shit that the course should have taught them.</p>
<p>All I got for my time in LS was a github account that looked awful, with half-assed project repos clogging up everything. You will come out of it all and literally remove ALL of them, because they are THAT shameful.</p>
<p>Do not go to this school. Go literally anywhere else.</p>
<p>And in all honesty, if you actually HAVE some experience like your linkedin says, you should just work on your own stuff. Don’t get suckered into this place by slick marketing that sounds like they’re high-speed. They’re just a terrible version of a votech school, except every class will have 200 students and 1 instructor.</p>
<p>HARD PASS on LS. Take Udemy courses and network on slack/discord servers instead, and save yourself months of your life and 10k’s of $.”</p>
<p><strong>Original post: </strong>My mission is to solve the world’s most pressing problems using technology. I’m 30 and haven’t solved a single world pressing problem. So it’s time to stop wasting my time web surfing and go head to head with Bill Gates (put a computer on every desktop running Microsoft software and now reducing inequities and improving lives around the world), Elon Musk (Starlink fast worldwide satellite internet and electric transportation and solar energy generation and storage), John Krafcik (Waymo’s CEO eliminating fatal car crashes with already live self driving cars with no employees inside picking up paying public customers). So my game plan is to spend 15 hours a day starting 12/16/20 going to web development school (starts 1/11/21), reading software development and business books, creating highly profitable startups, writing well researched informative blog posts and daily journal blog posts about my journey, and applying to software development jobs at early stage product market fit companies.</p>

</div></figure>
<p>I applied to every school I matched with on <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://careerkarma.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://careerkarma.com" target="_blank">CareeerKarma</a> which I found about from <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://techcrunch.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://techcrunch.com" target="_blank">TechCrunch</a>. I got so pissed off with failing a basic math/logic, verbal skills, and pattern recognition test and being told I needed a high credit score for income sharing agreements that I decided not to enroll in a school. Then I came across <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://lambdaschool.com" target="_blank">Lambda School</a> while surfing <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://youtube.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://youtube.com" target="_blank">Youtube</a>. The video that pooped up on my homepage is “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqnwwlQuh3U&amp;ab_channel=CodeDripbyAaronJack" data-type="URL" target="_blank" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqnwwlQuh3U&amp;ab_channel=CodeDripbyAaronJack">Disappointing news about code bootcamps in 2020.</a>” by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRLEADhMcb8WUdnQ5_Alk7g" data-type="URL" target="_blank" data-id="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRLEADhMcb8WUdnQ5_Alk7g">Aaron Jack</a>. I printed out and read the video’s source material, the article “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2020/02/lambda-schools-job-placement-rate-is-lower-than-claimed.html">Lambda School’s Misleading Promises</a>” by <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://vincentwoo.com/about/" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://vincentwoo.com/about/">Vincent Woo</a>, founder of the successful site <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://coderpad.io/" target="_blank" data-type="URL">CodePad.io</a>, and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22366474" target="_blank" data-type="URL" data-id="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22366474">the Hacker News comments</a>. Then I went to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://lambdaschool.com/" target="_blank">Lambda School’s website</a> and downloaded their <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://assets-global.website-files.com/5cd091cfb5499f22bdf72905/5fc95f2bb39ee0c8b064088b_Lambda%20School%20H2%202019%20Outcomes%20Report.pdf" data-type="URL" target="_blank">H2 2019 Outcomes report (PDF)</a>. The H2 2019 graduation rate of people who withdrew or graduated is 72% (439/609), 170 students withdrew. The job placement rate for job seeking H2 2019 web development graduates is 73% (181/247) with 66 unemployed when the report’s data was analyzed. 8% got jobs paying $100K+ year which is what I’m aiming for. The annual median salary of employed H2 2019 web development graduates is $60K. I’m convinced I have the work ethic to learn and code at a high skill level needed by small team high growth startups.</p>
<p>There’s absolutely no way I would do a loan even if I qualified for one and I’m not going to wait around trying to get a full tuition scholarship. I have zero interest in trying to go to a community college or university where I would have to take a ton of courses that I don’t need. And again would need a loan, pay up front, or get a scholarship. </p>
<p>While I do write code and learn on my own I don’t get the feedback or experience working in a team that I need. </p>
<p>Some unknowns: do placement rates include those hired as Lambda School TAs? <strong>Edit: </strong>they no longer have TAs “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LambdaSchool/comments/kdxf3k/why_im_enrolling_in_lambda_schools_full_time_web/gfzwpma?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.reddit.com/r/LambdaSchool/comments/kdxf3k/why_im_enrolling_in_lambda_schools_full_time_web/gfzwpma?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">To answer your question: no one is hired as a “TA” anymore, but when they existed they were not counted by LS as getting a job. (That would be absurd)</a>” </p>

Ultimately the aim of any quantitative thinker should be to see modeling as a holistic process that extends our mathematical reasoning to its fullest. Especially in an age of easy computation, the process of modeling should be a highly interactive one that extends beyond the synthesis of these two ideas.</p><h2>Our Example Problem: Modeling Click Through Rate</h2><p>One of the most common problems in industry is modeling <strong>Click Through Rate</strong> (CTR). Generally CTR problems show up whenever we care about a user performing some task, usually 'clicking' on some piece of content. Common CTR problems include: a user signing up for a service via a form, clicking on an ad, looking at an item description in a catalog, purchasing that item, reading a post on an new aggregator, etc. </p><p>In a previous post we talked about the process of <a href="https://www.countbayesie.com/blog/2020/9/26/learn-thompson-sampling-by-building-an-ad-auction">Thompson Sampling to optimize an ad auction</a> . One of the key parts of this article was estimating the CTR using the Beta Distribution with only data about previous clicks per view. While this approach worked great for that example we often have a lot more information at hand that we would like to use to better understand when a user will click.</p><p>In this example we'll be using information about the CTR for job postings on a job board. The data is derived from this <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/animeshgoyal9/predict-click-through-rate-ctr-for-a-website">Kaggle data set</a>. Using this data set we are going to attempt to learn whether or not a user will apply for a job given we know information about what category that job is in, and how similar various parts of the job title are to the user’s original search query.</p><p>In my career in data science I have been shocked by the number of time that CTR problems are treated as pure prediction problem. As we will see in this post, treating CTR as a prediction problem leads to a limited view of how to solve various common problems related to CTR (namely how do we improve it!). To start we'll treat this problem from the perpsective of Machine Learning, building a simple perceptron model from scratch using Python and JAX and then, in the next part, learn how we can naturally extend this model to cover inference.</p><h3>A look at our data</h3><p>Before we begin here's a look at the cleaned up version of our data set.

We now have a couple of things we need to add.</p><p>The first step is to represent all of those lines in the network diagram numerically.

Unlike standard Numpy, JAX always needs a key in order to create random values. This means that our random variables are always predictable. This is very convenient for debugging our model since even though we will be doing many random actions, they can always be repeated exactly.

December 15, 2020 | https://xtrp.io/blog/2020/12/15/how-to-use-the-html5-gamepad-api/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://xtrp.io/blog/2020/12/15/how-to-use-the-html5-gamepad-api/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The HTML5 Gamepad API is one of the more exciting HTML5 APIs in my opinion. It allows a website to pretty easily take input from a game controller that is connected to the user’s machine. The API supports <a href="https://gamepad-tester.com/codes">hundreds of game controllers</a>, both wireless and wired, including Xbox One controllers and PS4 controllers to name a few.</p>
<p>Before we begin, note that <strong>the gamepad API may not detect a gamepad until you press a button or move a stick on the controller.</strong> So, make sure to press some of the buttons when you test any sites or programs that use the Gamepad API.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: controllers and other game inputs are referred to as ‘gamepads’ throughout this article and in the gamepad API documentation.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Checking if Your Gamepad is Connected and Troubleshooting Potential Issues</h2>
<p>To check if your gamepad is successfully connected, run <code>navigator.getGamepads()</code> in the JavaScript console and check if the result has a Gamepad object, and is not an array of null elements.</p>
<p>If your gamepad isn’t working with the API, here are a few things to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>check if the device is connected to your machine via bluetooth, USB, or other method</li>
<li>try restarting your computer or web browser</li>
<li>try pressing some of the buttons or moving one of the sticks on the controller so that it is detected</li>
<li>try closing any other games or apps that are using the gamepad</li>
</ul>
<h2>Get a List of Connected Gamepads</h2>
<p>The Gamepad API allows up to four gamepads to be connected at once.</p>
<p>To get an array of connected gamepads, use the <code>navigator.getGamepads()</code> method. The array is always of length four, where unused gamepad slots are <code>null</code>. The element(s) of connected gamepad(s) are <code>Gamepad</code> object(s). Here’s an example value of the <code>navigator.getGamepads()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code>console.log(navigator.getGamepads());
// --&gt; [Gamepad Object, null, null, null]
// Here, only one gamepad is connected, and the other three gamepad slots are null.</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Before trying to use a the functionality of the Gamepad API, make sure a gamepad is connected using the instructions in the previous section.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>The <code>Gamepad</code> Object</h2>
<p>The <code>Gamepad</code> object includes two important properties that are available in the vast majority of all gamepads and controllers: <code>buttons</code> and <code>axes</code>.</p>
<p><code>axes</code> is an array of length four which represents the position of the left and right sticks in the gamepad. The first two elements in <code>axes</code> are the (x, y) coordinates of the position of the left stick, whereas the third and fourth elements in <code>axes</code> are the (x, y) coordinates of the position of the right stick. (x, y) values are numbers between -1 and 1 where the (0, 0) means the stick is has not moved.</p>
<p>In the horizontal axes (first and third elements in <code>axes</code>), <code>-1</code> would indicate the stick is moved fully to the left, and 1 would mean the stick is moved fully to the right. In the vertical axes (second and fourth elements in <code>axes</code>), <code>-1</code> would indicate the stick is moved fully to the top, and 1 would mean the stick is moved fully to the bottom. </p>
<p>Here’s an example value of <code>axes</code> with explanations in the comments:</p>
<pre><code>setInterval(() =&gt; {
    const myGamepad = navigator.getGamepads()[0]; // use the first gamepad
    console.log(`Left stick at (${myGamepad.axes[0]}, ${myGamepad.axes[1]})` );
    console.log(`Right stick at (${myGamepad.axes[2]}, ${myGamepad.axes[3]})` );
}, 100) // print axes 10 times per second</code></pre>
<p>Contrary to buttons in HTML, <strong>event listeners cannot be added to gamepad buttons</strong>. Instead, you can check if a button is currently pressed by using the boolean <code>pressed</code> property in the element in the <code>buttons</code> array.</p>
<p>Here’s a list of button indexes are their Xbox and PS4 Equivalents in the HTML5 Gamepad API:</p>

<p>Here's an example of checking if Button One (A on Xbox, X on PS4) is pressed:</p>
<pre><code>const myGamepad = navigator.getGamepads()[0]; // use the first gamepad

setInterval(() =&gt; { 
    console.log(`Is Button One Pressed? ${myGamepad.buttons[0].pressed}`);
}, 1000 / 10) // check 10 times per second if the button one is pressed</code></pre>
<h2>Detect When a Gamepad Has Been Connected</h2>
<p>The name of the event when a gamepad has been connected to the user’s machine is <code>gamepadconnected</code>. The event argument that is passed into the event function includes a <code>gamepad</code> property, which is a <code>Gamepad</code> object for the gamepad the has been connected.</p>
<p>Instead of accessing this gamepad directly, it is more common to get the index of this gamepad in the <code>navigator.getGamepads()</code> array by using the <code>Gamepad.index</code>. For example:</p>
<pre><code>// global gamepad object
let gamepadIndex;
window.addEventListener('gamepadconnected', (event) =&gt; {
    gamepadIndex = event.gamepad.index;
});

// now print the axes on the connected gamepad, for example: 
setInterval(() =&gt; {
    if(gamepadIndex !== undefined) {
        // a gamepad is connected and has an index
        const myGamepad = navigator.getGamepads()[gamepadIndex];
        console.log(`Left stick at (${myGamepad.axes[0]}, ${myGamepad.axes[1]})` );
        console.log(`Right stick at (${myGamepad.axes[2]}, ${myGamepad.axes[3]})` ); 
    }
}, 100) // print axes 10 times per second</code></pre>
<h2>A More Complicated Example</h2>
<p>Here's an example program that displays which buttons on a controller are pressed at a given time. Try running this code and pressing buttons on your gamepad; you should see that the indexes of the buttons that are pressed is displayed.</p>
<pre><code>&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;h1&gt;No Controller Connected&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;

&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;
// global gamepad object
let gamepadIndex;
window.addEventListener('gamepadconnected', (event) =&gt; {
    gamepadIndex = event.gamepad.index;
});

setInterval(() =&gt; {
    if(gamepadIndex !== undefined) {
        // a gamepad is connected and has an index
        const myGamepad = navigator.getGamepads()[gamepadIndex];
        document.body.innerHTML = ""; // reset page
        myGamepad.buttons.map(e =&gt; e.pressed).forEach((isPressed, buttonIndex) =&gt; {
            if(isPressed) {
                // button is pressed; indicate this on the page
                document.body.innerHTML += `&lt;h1&gt;Button ${buttonIndex} is pressed&lt;/h1&gt;`;
            }
        })
    }
}, 100) // print buttons that are pressed 10 times per second
&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
<h2>Browser Support</h2>
<p>The HTML5 Gamepad API has complete support in most modern web browsers today. However, there are a few browsers that don't yet support it as of December 2020, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>IE (11)</li>
<li>Opera Mini</li>
<li>Opera Mobile</li>
<li>Android Browser</li>
<li>KaiOS Browser</li>
</ul>
<p>For more up-to-date information on browser support, see the <a href="https://caniuse.com/gamepad">Gamepad API's CanIUse Page</a>.</p>
<p>To check if the browser supports the Gamepad API in JavaScript, the following code can be used:</p>
<pre><code>const hasGamepadAPI = () =&gt; "getGamepads" in navigator;</code></pre>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I hope this helps in learning how to use the HTML5 Gamepad API. While the API is not yet widely used in online games at the moment, it can still be useful for a number of projects and can be fun to try out.</p>
<p>Thanks for scrolling.</p>

						<p>A saliva-based smartphone platform can provide COVID-19 testing results within 15 minutes without the resource-intensive laboratory tests the current gold standard requires. This news comes from a study in The Americna Association for the Advancement of Science. </p><p>Most COVID-19 tests currently require swabbing the upper part of the throat behind the nose. A future version of the chip used in this technique could contain pre-loaded reagents and sample controls, and a custom smartphone app could enable secure, wireless test data reporting. The approach was tested in 12 people infected with COVIid-19 and 6 healthy controls.</p><p>Salt collected from twelve patients with COVID-19 and six healthy controls was analyzed in this design and it was found that the method has been effective among patients with and without virus. The scientists have compared swabs from non-human primates before and after infection in the nose and saliva. </p><figure><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598346653523-10a11538b971?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDExOHx8c21hcnRwaG9uZXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2000" alt="CAT S42 rugged outdoor work smartphone showing waterproof USB port with cover " srcset="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598346653523-10a11538b971?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDExOHx8c21hcnRwaG9uZXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=600 600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598346653523-10a11538b971?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDExOHx8c21hcnRwaG9uZXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1000 1000w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598346653523-10a11538b971?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDExOHx8c21hcnRwaG9uZXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=1600 1600w, https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1598346653523-10a11538b971?crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;fit=max&amp;fm=jpg&amp;ixid=MXwxMTc3M3wwfDF8c2VhcmNofDExOHx8c21hcnRwaG9uZXxlbnwwfHx8&amp;ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;q=80&amp;w=2400 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>The authors have designed a prototype test chip that utilizes the CRISPR/Cas12a enzyme to enhance the signal of an amplified viral load.

However, recent studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 can also be present in early infection in the nasopharynx and saliva, indicating that COVID-19 saliva tests could make testing comparatively accurate, but easier and safer. </p><p>The authors have designed a prototype test chip that utilizes the CRISPR/Cas12a enzyme to enhance the signal of an amplified Viral RNA target in a sample of saliva to establish a widely available platform for research. They have incorporated the chip in a fluorescence smartphone-based reader that collects and analyzes images to determine if the virus crosses a threshold. </p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><div><p>Umeå University has processed special categories of personal data concerning sexual life and health through, amongst other, storage in a cloud service, without sufficiently protecting the data. The Swedish Data Protection Authority is therefore issuing a fine of SEK 550,000 against the university.</p>
<p>The Swedish Data Protection Authority has now completed an audit of Umeå University, concluding that the University has violated the General Data Protection Regulation by processing special categories of personal data without applying appropriate technical and organisational measures to protect the data.</p>
<p>A research group at the University had requested from the police preliminary investigation reports concerning cases of male rape and, upon receiving such reports, proceeded to scanning and storing them digitally. The reports contained information on, among other things, suspicion of crime, name, personal identity number and contact details, as well as sensitive data about sexual life and health.</p>
<p>The Swedish Data Protection Authority’s investigation shows that the research group stored over a hundred scanned preliminary investigation reports in an American cloud service, despite the University having informed via its intranet that special categories of data should not be stored in the cloud service in question.</p>
<p>— The cloud service and the way the university uses it does not provide sufficient protection for this type of personal data, says Linda Hamidi, who led the Swedish Data Protection Authority’s audit.</p>
<p>When the research group sent an e-mail to the police requesting further information, one of the scanned reports was attached as a reference, a practice that the research group later repeated despite the fact that the police pointed out the inappropriateness in sending sensitive material in unencrypted e-mails.</p>
<p>— These events show that the University has not taken necessary measures to ensure a level of security appropriate in relation to the risk.</p>
<p>The Swedish Data Protection Authority also criticises the University for failing to report the incident as a personal data breach. Since 25 May 2018, organisations are obliged to report personal data breaches to the Swedish Data Protection Authority.</p>
<p>— The controller is obliged to notify the DPA of data breaches and furthermore to present to us what has been done to mitigate the effects of the incident and to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.</p>
<p>The overall assessment of concluded infringements led to the Swedish Data Protection Authority issuing an administrative fine of SEK 550,000 against the University.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"> <article>   <h2>Current page color is <span id="color">loading...</span></h2> <p>As you have probably noticed by the title, and the likely jarring background color, this page’s background is controlled by the users. Not through an obvious interface either, it is controlled by encoding hexadecimal RGB colors into an IPv6 address. I have a server listening for HTTP requests to port 80 on the IPv6 subnet <code>2001:470:8d76:bbbb::/80</code>, where the last 3 hextets encode the RGB color. For instance a HTTP request to <code>2001:470:8d76:bbbb::ff:0:0</code> would make the background of this page full red. The page is updated every second to match the new background color.</p> <div><div><pre><code>hammy /data : curl http://\[2001:470:8d76:bbbb::ca:ca:ca\]:80
Setting to color #cacaca
</code></pre></div></div> <p>If the current background is a horrible color, do us all a favour and run <code>curl http://\[2001:470:8d76:bbbb::cc:fb:fb\]:80</code> changing the last 3 hex numbers to be something else good-looking. Alternatively just go to the following link, <a href="http://[2001:470:8d76:bbbb:0:cc:fb:fb]/">http://[2001:470:8d76:bbbb:0:cc:fb:fb]/</a>. If it says you can not connect it is because you likely do not have IPv6 support, check that at <a href="https://ipv6-test.com/">https://ipv6-test.com/</a>.</p> <h3 id="how">How</h3> <p>This was actually pretty simple to pull off. I setup an ip6tables rule to route everything to the <code>2001:470:8d76:bbbb::/80</code> subnet to a local port, because listening on the entire /80 would be insane.</p> <div><div><pre><code>ip6tables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 2001:470:8d76:bbbb::/80 -i eth0 -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-ports 6969
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Then on that port I have an express app running, this app recieves the request, checks <code>/proc/net/nf_conntrack</code> to get the IP that this request was originally for and parses out the color from the IP. The conntrack searching is done by matching the source IP and the source port, I wanted to use the socket’s <code>SO_ORIGINAL_DST</code> option, but could not figure out a way to access it from NodeJS. That new color is then written to disk, with this page making a HTTP request for that file every second and updating the background color accordingly.</p> <p>You might also notice all those IPs are pingable, that is from testing when I setup the following rule and just do not feel like removing it.</p> <div><div><pre><code>ip6tables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 2001:470:8d76:bbbb::/80 -i eth0 -p ipv6-icmp -j REDIRECT
</code></pre></div></div>   </article>   </div></div>]]>

<p>There has been a lot of good content on regenerative agriculture practices being adopted in the past decade. In the book, “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Revolution-Bringing-Soil-Back/dp/0393608328" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.amazon.com/Growing-Revolution-Bringing-Soil-Back/dp/0393608328" target="_blank">Growing a Revolution</a>“, David R. Montgomery discusses many of the core ideas of regenerative agriculture, but the central theme of the book is stopping the mining of our soils for monoculture agriculture and instead start to adapt practices that <em>grow</em> or repair soil through organic matter and related compounds. A core argument made is that these ‘regenerative’ practices can not only be sustainable (for the environment), but they can also be profitable (for the farmer) so it is implied the difficult part is <em>convincing</em> and <em>educating</em> modern farmers on these practices so they can <em>see it to believe it</em>. </p>



<p>I think most of the arguments are correct, but I don’t think regenerative agriculture will scale unless its properly incentivized. The book posits, correctly, that fertilizer companies (such as <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="http://www.mosaicco.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="http://www.mosaicco.com/" target="_blank">Mosaic</a> and <a href="https://www.kochind.com/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.kochind.com/">Koch Industries</a>) and other inputs companies will do as much as possible to avoid losing revenue and try to rally farmers around using high rates of inputs. It is not a hard sell as farmers are businessmen themselves and need to be profitable in the short-term (whatever their long-term goals may be). Therefore modern agriculture can be crudely summarized as turning natural resources into money catalyzed by synthetic fertilizer and chemicals. Most parties admit this is not sustainable long-term, so agriculture finds itself trying to shoe-horn in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://cropwatch.unl.edu/2019/cover-crops-and-carbon-sequestration-benefits-producer-and-planet" data-type="URL" data-id="https://cropwatch.unl.edu/2019/cover-crops-and-carbon-sequestration-benefits-producer-and-planet" target="_blank">sustainable practices</a> into the status-quo with mixed success. The fact remains modern agriculture has a double whammy of depleting soil resources and adding carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere.</p>



<p>This blog has made the argument the government <em>should </em>have a<em> </em>vested interest in long-term sustainability of its agriculture (a national security asset as well) and has historically proven to fund it as such–<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fy2020-budget-summary.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/fy2020-budget-summary.pdf" target="_blank">the USDA budget circa 2020 is ~145B</a>. At issue is the large majority of agriculture subsidies go toward maize, soybeans, wheat, and cotton in some way shape or form (<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/12/31/790261705/farmers-got-billions-from-taxpayers-in-2019-and-hardly-anyone-objected" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/12/31/790261705/farmers-got-billions-from-taxpayers-in-2019-and-hardly-anyone-objected" target="_blank">about ~20B worth in 2019</a>). The path of least resistance to getting regenerative agriculture practices scaled up to the United States ~330M acres of cropland is via the government. We <span>cannot</span> ask farmers to adapt economically risky (but environmentally healthy) ‘unconventional’ practices. To be clear, ‘unconventional’ means they are unconventional in profitable modern row crop agriculture operations, not in any historic agronomic sense. Montgomery’s book highlights several farmers that show you can be profitable adopting these practices, but I would argue these first adopters would be successful in virtually any farming scheme and likely represent top 10% ‘performers’.</p>



<p>This chart below from the USDA describes the major uses of land. The two biggest changes that <span>can</span> be incentivized through USDA subsidies (again, the money is already there we just need to redirect it) are <em>paying</em> <em>farmers directly</em> to put marginal ground or high-risk ground (e.g. highly eroded, highly sloped, within <em>X</em> feet of waterways) into the ‘Idle Cropland’ category. We cannot simply take the land and profit generated from a farming operation and pull a rug out. This is a lose-lose for the farmer. <span>All</span> parties should win (farmers by making profit on marginal/high-risk ground, the government protecting it soil and water resources, U.S. citizens by sequestering carbon emissions, and rural communities who rely on agriculture land tax dollars). Many communities in those states with yellow circles in the second chart rely on agriculture land for it tax purposes; if we want the farmers to change their practices, it must be incentivized. USDA subsidies are a natural thought experiment. For this reason, an eminent domain approach is a non-starter. The government cannot take away the only resource many of these states have and leave them holding the bag without serious civil unrest ensuing.</p>

<p>Most people generally scoff at suggesting this can be solved via the USDA.

One of the principles of regenerative agriculture is to <em>reduce</em> your input cost, and this is at odds with for-profit companies (who rely on <em>increases</em> in input cost to grow). This is why I continue to argue existing multinational input companies will not solve agriculture’s sustainability problems–if done right, they will end up cutting themselves off at the knees. A new business model will be needed, or the government simply admits protecting it agriculture land it important and adapts the <span>profit-neutral, benefit-positive</span> stance of subsidizing these regenerative practices.</p>



<p>We are seeing this play out in real-time. A flurry of <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agfundernews.com/fbn-launches-free-membership-and-its-answer-to-ag-carbon-credit-markets.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://agfundernews.com/fbn-launches-free-membership-and-its-answer-to-ag-carbon-credit-markets.html" target="_blank">startups</a> are pivoting to ‘carbon markets’ and established <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://agfundernews.com/cargill-wants-to-help-farmers-turn-over-10-miilion-acres-to-regenerative-ag-by-2030.html" data-type="URL" data-id="https://agfundernews.com/cargill-wants-to-help-farmers-turn-over-10-miilion-acres-to-regenerative-ag-by-2030.html" target="_blank">big players</a> are in the game. The <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/technical/emkts/?cid=nrcseprd1396024" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/portal/nrcs/detail/national/technical/emkts/?cid=nrcseprd1396024" target="_blank">government</a> to its credit is also trying to understand the market (albeit slowly) and <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USDATB1939_07072014.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.usda.gov/sites/default/files/documents/USDATB1939_07072014.pdf" target="_blank">measurement</a> of some these climate friendly practices. One key problem is the quantification of measuring carbon and how much one is sequestering versus hypothetical alternate scenarios. This hang-up is missing the point and partly why I think <span>no current approach will be the winner</span>. Everyone wants to use ‘their model’ in ‘their system’ matched in ‘their marketplace’ so that they can continue to use that customer interaction (and all the data collected) to generate additional revenue streams. This is a smart business decision for individual companies, but it will absolutely prevent a true market from forming due to severe fragmentation. But from a common sense and societal point of view, it is easy to see the asymmetric differences in acres to target to protect our land and water. The highest value acres to take out of annual production are next to waterways and those with high water tables along with acres that contain soil that is susceptible to leeching nitrates. These acres play major roles in protecting our water systems but are replacement-level acres for generic maize or soy production. Targeting these acres results in a win-win situation for sequestering emissions <em>and</em> protecting water resources. The USDA (and probably most large multi-national agriculture input companies) <em>already</em> knows who owns and farms these acres (along with how long they’ve been farming, and what crops have been planted, etc.). From the above graph, a simple plan would be to target 30M of our most at risk acres, <span>pay</span> the farmers and landowners $250 per acre to plant a perennial native species for a total cost of only 7.5B. The system could be more fair by relying on county level averages for cash rent prices instead of a static $250. The money already exists in either the private or public sector or a joint effort. There would be little argument from farmers and landowners because they would be generating income on these acres. We’ll figure out the exact equation in time, but common sense tells us this can be a good starting point.</p>



<p>The simple fact remains that <a href="https://secondnature.org/climate-action-guidance/purchasing-carbon-offsets-faqs/" data-type="URL" data-id="https://secondnature.org/climate-action-guidance/purchasing-carbon-offsets-faqs/">current markets are pricing carbon at $1-10 an acre</a>, with the majority being in the $3-$6 range. This will <span>not</span> compete with modern agriculture where landowners can simply collect cash rent <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Highlights/2018/2018LandValuesCashRents_Highlights.pdf" data-type="URL" data-id="https://www.nass.usda.gov/Publications/Highlights/2018/2018LandValuesCashRents_Highlights.pdf" target="_blank">ranging from $150-300</a>. Land that is highly sloped, highly eroded, near important waterways needs to be priced competitively to accomplish 2 tasks: offset carbon and improve water quality. Until we get carbon buyers to understand this, verification methods, and ‘walled garden’ carbon marketplaces are merely noise on the scale of United State agriculture.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Addressing the Hype</h2><p>There’s no denying the design community has fallen <em>hard </em>for design systems. It’s graduated from popular trend to fully fledged movement. We’re at a point where you can apply for specific design systems jobs and statements like, “<a href="https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969" target="_blank">in the future, every brand and every product will use a Design System</a>”, appear perfectly reasonable.</p><p>I feel the same way about design systems as I did about design thinking before Natasha Jen gave a talk in 2018 entitled, <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/videos/55967/natasha-jen-design-thinking-is-bullshit" target="_blank">Design Thinking Is Bullsh*t</a>. Namely, why is no one talking about the downsides? </p><p>It turns out that isn’t entirely true. In searching over 200 articles on Medium and other blogs online, I picked up on an undercurrent beneath all the praise that is beginning to check the design systems movement. But it still feels like the criticism has been nervously muted, unnecessarily qualified and caveated. In the name of critical thinking and a healthy debate, I believe it’s time to make the case in no uncertain terms that design systems are, in fact, bullshi*t.</p><h2>Defining Design Systems</h2><p>The root of the problem with design systems can be found in the definition. Here’s a simple description from a popular article on the subject:</p><blockquote>“A Design System is the single source of truth which groups all the elements that will allow the teams to design, realize and develop a product.”<br>~ <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/everything-you-need-to-know-about-design-systems-54b109851969" target="_blank">Everything you need to know about Design Systems</a></blockquote><p>It’s this attempt to take existing tools and practices, like style guides and patterns, and add other less tangible assets such as values and ways or working that, taken together, present a design system as a complete process from start to finish. This is a mistake. The very phrase “design <em>system</em>” should have alarm bells ringing.</p><p>In this quote from Brad Frost defining design systems, we can see further problematic thinking:</p><blockquote>“A kit of UI components without accompanying philosophy, principles, guidelines, processes, and documentation is like dumping a bunch of IKEA components on the floor and saying ‘Here, build a dresser!’ The guidelines and documentation accompanying the UI components serve as the instruction manual that come with the IKEA components to help the user properly and successfully build furniture.”<br>~ <a href="https://bradfrost.com/blog/link/design-systems/" target="_blank">Design Systems</a></blockquote><p>It’s a neat sounding analogy, but it’s like saying we need a design system so our customers know how to assemble their own app from our react components. It reveals the suggestion that anyone should be able to build a design regardless of expertise. It also surfaces the idea that while some designers (presumably a minority) will have the responsibility for creating the principles and processes, the others will be handed the design system Allen key and charged with the robotic, rote assembly. Hardly an inspiring vision.</p><h2>Design Systems Turn Design Into a Check Box</h2><blockquote>“In today’s world design has become this box that people just want to check off.”<br>~ <a href="https://99u.adobe.com/videos/55967/natasha-jen-design-thinking-is-bullshit" target="_blank">Natasha Jen: Design Thinking Is Bullsh*t</a></blockquote><p>There’s a fair amount of crossover in Jen’s critique of design thinking and the issues we can find with design systems. The biggest crossover is at the core of this idea that the design process should be simplified, sped up and accessible to non-designers.</p><p>By attempting to catalogue and rationalise everything, the result of the design system is to atomise and codify a designer’s process in a way that makes it appear understandable and, worryingly, actionable by anyone regardless of their design competence.</p><p>This devalues design and undermines designers.</p><blockquote>“You cannot hold design in high regard while relegating so much of it to a centrally controlled system.”<br>~ <a href="https://modus.medium.com/suburban-tract-housing-and-the-death-of-craftsmanship-a-critique-of-digital-design-systems-34c0fc1e106f" target="_blank">Design Systems Create Bad Designers</a></blockquote><p>We create systems to automate low-level tasks where the pursuit of efficiency is the driving objective. The underlying perspective in the thinking behind design systems, whether deliberate or not, is that design is in the way of more critical work.</p><h2>Design Systems Waste Time</h2><blockquote>“We’ve been developing the contribution model for the GOV.UK Design System for the best part of 2 years, and we’re not done yet. Not even close.”<br>~ <a href="https://amyhupe.co.uk/articles/the-myth-that-design-systems-solve-easy-problems/" target="_blank">The myth that design systems solve easy problems</a></blockquote><p>Design systems take a massive amount of time and effort to create, and require constant work to maintain, update and evolve. The bigger, the more comprehensive, a design system is, the harder it is to reference quickly and keep relevant. Time must be invested to not only update the system but communicate any changes across teams. The deeper you go down the design system rabbit hole, the more quick sand you lay out for your company to wade through in the future.</p><p>Once the design system is up and running, design is now entangled in development. Making changes to the design system will not be straightforward, potentially requiring sign off from people who may not share the same concerns as design. When design is fused with code, it slows down, and even discourages, changes to the product, as engineering is now needed to maintain and evolve the system. </p><p>Many product designers work for startups who undergo rebranding, product pivots and overhauls of their codebase on a dizzying frequency. I’ve worked at a startup that went through multiple rebrands and product pivots in its first three years. Why bother with a design system in this context? No one will thank you for wasting time on an internal product when you could have been working on the actual product, getting feature validation, finding product market fit or helping marketing and sales achieve broader business objectives.</p><p>It’s true that design systems allow you to go faster in one context — when you’re heading in the wrong direction. Once you finally have your design system ready to go, you can have that design request wrapped up before the day’s out. But by truncating the design process and placing too much emphasis on speed, design systems remove the space needed to question the assumptions behind a task, conceive of new possibilities, or even question if that new feature or screen is needed in the first place. </p><h2>Design Systems Don’t Work</h2><blockquote>“The challenge with any design system is they normally don’t work, don’t get adopted, don’t grow or get used if they are imposed top-down without an awful lot of consultation.”<br>~ <a href="https://markboulton.co.uk/journal/design-systems-in-difficult-places/" target="_blank">Design systems in difficult places</a></blockquote><p><a href="https://www.chromatic.com/blog/why-design-systems-are-a-single-point-of-failure/" target="_blank">Design systems are a single point of failure</a>, as they deliver the same components to multiple product and service touch points across an organisation. One bug or unintended error is now multiplied across every interface. Thanks to the nature of software development, a bug while easy to deploy is much harder to debug. The only solution for engineering is to invest even more effort in testing and maintenance.</p><p>The reality is that the only people who truly adopt design systems are the designers who create them. Design systems are the direct descendants of their equally tedious and ignored forefather, the corporate brand guidelines. In a fast-paced work environment, other team members will drop in and find just what they need in order to move on. They will assume that by any kind of lazy reference to the design system they are now good to go. That has serious consequences for communication and collaboration between teams.</p><h2>Design Systems Ignore Context</h2><blockquote>“Designers are trained and expected to make good decisions based on judgment… To bake this judgment into a system manifested through groupthink is submitting the individual designer’s expertise to an outside force.”<br>~ <a href="https://modus.medium.com/suburban-tract-housing-and-the-death-of-craftsmanship-a-critique-of-digital-design-systems-34c0fc1e106f" target="_blank">Design Systems Create Bad Designers</a></blockquote><p>A design system detracts from what should be any designer’s primary reference: context.</p><p>Now there’s a system, the pressure will be for designers to parse everything through its rules and piece together solutions from the available assets within the system. Coupled with the knowledge that the design system exists in order to sped up their work, contextual research and experimentation within those grey areas early on in the process will be squeezed under an excessively performance-focused culture.</p><p>The very objective of a system is to cover all bases. But this approach is destined to produce mediocre results within design, as any pre-defined system will always lack the critical context ingredient. Taking a component out of context, setting rules and a multitude of variables, creates the false illusion that this component can now be applied without reference to the new context. On top of this, by trying to systematically cover all eventualities the design system creates unnecessary bloat, documenting styles and components that may never even be needed.</p><p>The widely held opinion that a design system has to constantly evolve, is a recognition in itself that it will never be adequate enough to deal with the real world problems it faces. This is often presented as a caveat, but it illustrates flawed and misplaced thinking. If something is always in need of being updated whenever it is put into practice, how can it be relied upon?</p><h2>Design Systems Straitjacket Creativity and Kill Craft</h2><blockquote>“Design systems can make designers lazy, driving them to think only in terms of the components that are available in the design system.”<br>~ <a href="https://uxplanet.org/the-hidden-trap-in-design-systems-4540424f8c1" target="_blank">The Hidden Trap in Design Systems</a></blockquote><p>Design systems choose consistency and convenience over creativity and craft. When you overvalue consistency in the pursuit of uniformity, you create too many unnecessary rules that straitjackets creative thinking before it can even get going. When you overvalue convenience in the pursuit of speed, you kill the holistic working process necessary to develop a designer’s craft.</p><p>Design systems are well meaning, and no one can fault their ambition. But by dismembering the design process with prescriptive step-by-step rules, it restricts a designer’s freedom to work creatively.</p><p>One of the main reasons cited for implementing a design system is to achieve consistency. A slavish devotion to<a href="https://www.blogofpascal.com/post/consistency-the-killer" target="_blank"> consistency kills creative thinking</a>. Building a design system encourages designers to lose themselves in the details of components, while losing sight of larger product design issues.

				<p>Earlier in the year I switching from being a long time Comcast account holder to CenturyLink. They brought fiber to the home (FTTH) and offered up near-symmetrical gig internet for just $65 month including taxes and fees! Compared to the $100+ I paid Comcast for 50 Mbps it was a no brainer. The experience has been good so far but I have been held back by their included <a href="https://www.centurylink.com/home/help/internet/modems-and-routers/actiontec-c3000a.html">3000A modem</a>. There was nothing majorly wrong with it it just didn't have the best range, nor enough ethernet ports for me plus I already had a <a href="https://www.netgear.com/support/product/R8500.aspx">Nighthawk X8 R8500</a> sitting unused so I decided to figure how to remove the 3000A. It turned out to be a pain in the ass so I thought I woud share it with you so save you some pain. </p><p>Before you read further make sure you are on a CenturyLink fiber plan and your router can set the VLAN. If your router can't do this then don't even bother as this guide won't be for you.</p><p>With that out of the way. You may want to take a screenshot or download this page because you will be without internet for a few minutes.</p><h3 id="step-1">Step 1</h3><p>Call CenturyLink and get your PPP username and password. You may think its the password on your paperwork you got when you got your internet installed. This is not the case! You need to call to get it. While you are on the line make sure you confirm your VLAN. It likely will be 201, but yours may be different.</p><h3 id="step-2-this-is-where-you-lose-internet-">Step 2 (this is where you lose internet)</h3><p>Unplug your CenturyLink provided router and add your new one using the same cable/ports as the old one.

<section itemprop="text">

<p>I get confused with tensor computation libraries (or computational graph libraries, or symbolic
algebra libraries, or whatever they’re marketing themselves as these days).</p>
<p>I was first introduced to PyTorch and TensorFlow and, having no other reference, thought they were
prototypical examples of tensor computation libraries. Then I learnt about Theano - an older and
less popular project, but different from PyTorch and TensorFlow and better in some meaningful ways.
This was followed by JAX, which seemed to be basically NumPy with more bells and whistles (although
I couldn’t articulate what exactly they were). Then came <a href="https://pymc-devs.medium.com/the-future-of-pymc3-or-theano-is-dead-long-live-theano-d8005f8a0e9b">the announcement by the PyMC developers
that Theano would have a new JAX
backend</a>.</p>
<p>Anyways, this confusion prompted a lot of research and eventually, this blog post.</p>
<p>Similar to <a href="https://eigenfoo.xyz/prob-prog-frameworks/">my previous post on the anatomy of probabilistic programming
frameworks</a>, I’ll first discuss tensor computation
libraries in general - what they are and how they can differ from one another. Then I’ll discuss
some libraries in detail, and finally offer an observation on the future of Theano in the context of
contemporary tensor computation libraries.</p>
<h2 id="dissecting-tensor-computation-libraries">Dissecting Tensor Computation Libraries</h2>
<p>First, a characterization: what do tensor computation libraries even do?</p>
<ol>
<li>They provide ways of specifying and building computational graphs,</li>
<li>They run the computation itself (duh), but also run “related” computations that either (a) <em>use
the computational graph</em>, or (b) operate <em>directly on the computational graph itself</em>,
<ul>
<li>The most salient example of the former is computing gradients via
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05767">autodifferentiation</a>,</li>
<li>A good example of the latter is optimizing the computation itself: think symbolic
simplifications (e.g. <code>xy/x = y</code>) or modifications for numerical stability (e.g. <a href="https://cs.stackexchange.com/q/68411"><code>log(1 + x)</code>
for small values of <code>x</code></a>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>And they provide “best execution” for the computation: whether it’s changing the execution by JIT
(just-in-time) compiling it, by utilizing special hardware (GPUs/TPUs), by vectorizing the
computation, or in any other way.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="tensor-computation-library---maybe-not-the-best-name">“Tensor Computation Library” - Maybe Not The Best Name</h3>
<p>As an aside: I realize that the name “tensor computation library” is too broad, and that the
characterization above precludes some libraries that might also justifiably be called “tensor
computation libraries”. Better names might be “graph computation library” (although that might get
mixed up with libraries like <a href="https://networkx.org/"><code>networkx</code></a>) or “computational graph management
library” or even “symbolic tensor algebra libraries”.</p>
<p>So for the avoidance of doubt, here is a list of libraries that this blog post is <em>not</em> about:</p>
<ul>
<li>NumPy and SciPy
<ul>
<li>These libraries don’t have a concept of a computational graph - they’re more like a toolbox of
functions, called from Python and executed in C or Fortran.</li>
<li>However, this might be a controversial distinction - as we’ll see later, JAX also doesn’t build
an explicit computational graph either, and I definitely want to include JAX as a “tensor
computation library”… <code>¯\_(ツ)_/¯</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Numba and Cython
<ul>
<li>These libraries provide best execution for code (and in fact some tensor computation libraries,
such as Theano, make good use them), but like NumPy and SciPy, they do not actually manage the
computational graph itself.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Keras, Trax, Flax and PyTorch-Lightning
<ul>
<li>These libraries are high-level wrappers around tensor computation libraries - they basically
provide abstractions and a user-facing API to utilize tensor computation libraries in a
friendlier way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="some-differences-between-tensor-computation-libraries">(Some) Differences Between Tensor Computation Libraries</h3>
<p>Anyways, back to tensor computation libraries.</p>
<p>All three aforementioned goals are ambitious undertakings with sophisticated solutions, so it
shouldn’t be surprising to learn that decisions in pursuit on goal can have implications for (or
even incur a trade-off with!) other goals. Here’s a list of common differences along all three axes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Tensor computation libraries can differ in how they represent the computational graph, and how it
is built.
<ul>
<li>Static or dynamic graphs: do we first define the graph completely and then inject data to run
(a.k.a. define-and-run), or is the graph defined on-the-fly via the actual forward computation
(a.k.a. define-by-run)?
<ul>
<li>TensorFlow 1.x was (in)famous for its static graphs, which made users feel like they were
“working with their computational graph through a keyhole”, especially when <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13429355">compared to
PyTorch’s dynamic graphs</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lazy or eager execution: do we evaluate variables as soon as they are defined, or only when a
dependent variable is evaluated? Usually, tensor computation libraries either choose to support
dynamic graphs with eager execution, or static graphs with lazy execution - for example,
<a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/eager">TensorFlow 2.0 supports both modes</a>.</li>
<li>Interestingly, some tensor computation libraries (e.g. <a href="https://thinc.ai/">Thinc</a>) don’t even
construct an explicit computational graph: they represent it as <a href="https://thinc.ai/docs/concept">chained higher-order
functions</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Tensor computation libraries can also differ in what they want to use the computational graph
<em>for</em> - for example, are we aiming to do things that basically amount to running the
computational graph in a “different mode”, or are we aiming to modify the computational graph
itself?
<ul>
<li>Almost all tensor computation libraries support autodifferentiation in some capacity (either
forward-mode, backward-mode, or both).</li>
<li>Obviously, how you represent the computational graph and what you want to use it for are very
related questions! For example, if you want to be able to represent aribtrary computation as a
graph, you’ll have to handle control flow like if-else statements or for-loops - this leads to
common gotchas with <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/Common_Gotchas_in_JAX.html#%F0%9F%94%AA-Control-Flow">using Python for-loops in
JAX</a>
or needing to use <a href="https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/can-you-have-for-loops-in-the-forward-prop/68295"><code>torch.nn.ModuleList</code> in for-loops with
PyTorch</a>.</li>
<li>Some tensor computation libraries (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/Theano/Theano">Theano</a> and it’s
fork, <a href="https://theano-pymc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">Theano-PyMC</a>) aim to <a href="https://theano-pymc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extending/optimization.html">optimize
the computational graph
itself</a>, for which an
<a href="#an-observation-on-static-graphs-and-theano">explicit graph is necessary</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Finally, tensor computation libraries can also differ in how they execute code.
<ul>
<li>All tensor computation libraries run on CPU, but the strength of GPU and TPU support is a major
differentiator among tensor computation libraries.</li>
<li>Another differentiator is how tensor computation libraries compile code to be executed on
hardware. For example, do they use JIT compilation or not? Do they use “vanilla” C or CUDA
compilers, or <a href="https://tensorflow.google.cn/xla">the XLA compiler for machine-learning specific
code</a>?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="a-zoo-of-tensor-computation-libraries">A Zoo of Tensor Computation Libraries</h2>
<p>Having outlined the basic similarities and differences of tensor computation libraries, I think
it’ll be helpful to go through several of the popular libraries as examples. I’ve tried to link to
the relevant documentation where possible.<sup id="fnref:1" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:1">1</a></sup></p>
<h3 id="pytorch"><a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>How is the computational graph represented and built?
<ul>
<li>PyTorch dynamically builds (and eagerly evaluates) an explicit computational graph. For more
detail on how this is done, check out <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/autograd.html">the PyTorch docs on autograd
mechanics</a>.</li>
<li>For more on how PyTorch computational graphs, see <a href="https://jdhao.github.io/2017/11/12/pytorch-computation-graph/"><code>jdhao</code>’s introductory blog post on
computational graphs in
PyTorch</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the computational graph used for?
<ul>
<li>To quote the <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html">PyTorch docs</a>, “PyTorch is an
optimized tensor library for deep learning using GPUs and CPUs” - as such, the main focus is on
<a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/autograd.html">autodifferentiation</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does the library ensure “best execution” for computation?
<ul>
<li>PyTorch has <a href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/notes/cuda.html">native GPU support</a> via CUDA.</li>
<li>PyTorch also has support for TPU through projects like
<a href="https://github.com/pytorch/xla">PyTorch/XLA</a> and
<a href="https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/">PyTorch-Lightning</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="jax"><a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">JAX</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>How is the computational graph represented and built?
<ul>
<li>Instead of building an explicit computational graph to compute gradients, JAX simply supplies a
<code>grad()</code> that returns the gradient function of any supplied function. As such, there is
technically no concept of a computational graph - only pure (i.e. stateless and
side-effect-free) functions and their gradients.</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://sjmielke.com/jax-purify.htm">Sabrina Mielke summarizes the situation very well</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>PyTorch builds up a graph as you compute the forward pass, and one call to <code>backward()</code> on
some “result” node then augments each intermediate node in the graph with the gradient of the
result node with respect to that intermediate node. JAX on the other hand makes you express
your computation as a Python function, and by transforming it with <code>grad()</code> gives you a
gradient function that you can evaluate like your computation function — but instead of the
output it gives you the gradient of the output with respect to (by default) the first
parameter that your function took as input.</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the computational graph used for?
<ul>
<li>According to the <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html">JAX quickstart</a>,
JAX bills itself as “NumPy on the CPU, GPU, and TPU, with great automatic differentiation for
high-performance machine learning research”. Hence, its focus is heavily on
autodifferentiation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>How does the library ensure “best execution” for computation?
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is best explained by quoting the <a href="https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/quickstart.html">JAX quickstart</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>JAX uses XLA to compile and run your NumPy code on […] GPUs and TPUs. Compilation happens
under the hood by default, with library calls getting just-in-time compiled and executed. But
JAX even lets you just-in-time compile your own Python functions into XLA-optimized kernels
[…] Compilation and automatic differentiation can be composed arbitrarily […]</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>For more detail on JAX’s four-function API (<code>grad</code>, <code>jit</code>, <code>vmap</code> and <code>pmap</code>), see
<a href="http://alexminnaar.com/2020/08/15/jax-overview.html">Alex Minaar’s overview of how JAX works</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="theano"><a href="https://theano-pymc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Theano</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> the <a href="https://github.com/Theano/Theano">original Theano</a> (maintained by
<a href="https://mila.quebec/en/">MILA</a>) has been discontinued, and the PyMC developers have forked the
project: <a href="https://github.com/pymc-devs/Theano-PyMC">Theano-PyMC</a> (soon to be renamed Aesara). I’ll

<li>Theano statically builds (and lazily evaluates) an explicit computational graph.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>What is the computational graph used for?
<ul>
<li>Theano is unique among tensor computation libraries in that it places more emphasis on

<p>Fresh off <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/software-updates/tesla-hack-reveals-treasure-trove-of-fsd-beta-settings/">hacking into Tesla’s developer mode</a> for Full Self-Driving (FSD) beta, <a href="http://twitter.com/greentheonly" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" target="_blank">@greentheonly</a> has now discovered a new augmented reality view for the self-driving software.</p><p><em>Save with big discounts at your favourite Tesla accessories stores, like 10% off at Tesmanian, TesBros and Nikola Pro, plus many more. Coupon codes at <a href="http://driveteslacanada.ca/deals" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DriveTeslaCanada.ca/deals</a>.</em></p>

<p>In a series of late night tweets, green showed off the new view as well as the code behind it. There were also some interesting pieces of “dead code” included like coast2coast and map selection.</p>

<p>The hacker also shared a number of videos of the new view, showing just how much data the car is taking in and processing in real-time.</p><p><em>Get 10% off at <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/shop/tesloidcanada" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesloid.ca</a> or <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/shop/tesloidusa" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tesloid.com</a> with coupon code DTC10 at checkout.

</center>
<p>While the new views are new to us, they look exactly like what Tesla has shown in the past. A similar view was shown when highlighting development of FSD, and when recruiting for positions within the FSD software team like the video below from earlier this year.</p>

<p>The FSD beta software is still in limited release in the US. CEO Elon Musk <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-fsd-beta-wide-release-soon/">hinted at a wider release in the middle part of December</a>, so it wouldn’t be surprising to hear an update from Musk any day now.</p>
<p>The timing of a wider release would also be good news for Canadians, as Musk has said the <a href="https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/tesla-full-self-driving-beta-canada-next-month/">self-driving software would “hopefully” come to Canada in December</a>.</p>

Injury to axons often leads to neuronal impairment and cell death. </p><p>Researchers know that inhibiting an enzyme called dual leucine zipper kinase (DLK) appears to robustly protect neurons in a wide range of neurodegenerative diseases models, but DLK also inhibits axonal regeneration.

Conversely, there are ways to promote regeneration, but then the survival was rather modest. Of course, for a successful strategy of vision restoration, you need both and this is a step in that direction.” </p><p>The researchers conducted a series of screens after first creating retinal ganglion cells (RGC) from human stem cells. RGCs are a type of neuron located near the inner surface of the retina of the eye. They receive visual information from photoreceptors and collectively help transmit that information to the brain.</p><figure data-orig-width="640" data-orig-height="401"><img src="https://64.media.tumblr.com/1b67a80057dfc35191f1159cdd584dde/229a1ee8ca896ff2-d8/s640x960/e61324113ae96876b8187bc54acc3637b5571ab8.jpg" alt="image" data-orig-width="640" data-orig-height="401" width="640" height="401"></figure><p><i>Image:&nbsp;Example of retinal ganglion cells with axons and dendrites in the retina of a healthy eye.

That was definitely a surprise. It highlights one of the advantages of discovery-based science using high-throughput screening: By testing many agents at once, we can find identify overlooked genes that might not have been thought to play a role.”</p><p>Welsbie and colleagues focused their work on RGCs because they are interested in optic neuropathies, such as glaucoma. “Most people think only about glaucoma in terms of ‘eye pressure,’” Welsbie said. But eye pressure is only part of the problem. At its core, glaucoma is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of RGCs and their axons, leading to measurable structural and functional damage to the optic nerve, visual impairment and blindness. </p><p>The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate 3 million Americans have glaucoma. It is the second leading cause of blindness worldwide. </p><p>Welsbie cautioned that it’s not yet known whether these findings extend to other neuron types, but he noted that the work suggests strong therapeutic possibilities. </p><p>Co-authors include: Amit K.

<p>(Hey, if you want to come work for me at Roundforest, and try out JSDoc typing, feel free to
find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/giltayar/">LinkedIn</a> or on Twitter (@giltayar))</p>
<p>TypeScript! For me, it’s a love-hate relationship.</p>
<p>I started my developer life in statically typed languages
(well, if we ignore Basic, which is dynamically typed): C, C++, and Java.
Then somewhere around 2010, I had the good fortune to start working in Python.
And I saw the light! I was liberated! Suddenly all those Java and C++ design sessions, where
we fretted and worried and analyzed our class hierarchy to death, disappeared.
I suddenly saw them for what they were: hair splitting and yak shaving about
this design or that design, instead of just, well, working. And that yak shaving also
usually generated tons of abstractions, that half a year later, when reading the code, were
all but incomprehensible.</p>
<p>And then I started programming in Python, and all those discussions just end.
You just work. And it’s not that the design doesn’t happen, but somehow,
once you stop talking about class hierarchy, you start dealing with the <strong>data</strong> flow,
dealing with what data you have in the system, and how it changes over time,
and what the algorithms are that change it. And because
you’re dealing with <em>data</em>, and not trying to abstract it away, then the design becomes
simpler. Much easier to reason and deal with. And much less hair splitting. And when
disagreement happens, it was on a much more practical level.</p>
<p>The disappearance of types was good for my profressional career. And this goodness continued
when I started working in JavaScript. And one of the more interesting benefits I found for
dynamic typing was that I found myself writing more tests than I usually write.
This was <em>because</em> dynamic typing doesn’t give the safety net that static typing does.
So you write more tests. Which is a good thing.</p>
<p>Another good thing about dynamic typing: my code was “clean”. In many ways, type information
is noise that you usually don’t need to understand the code. And with dynamic typing,
that noise goes away, and your code is “clean”: pure intent.</p>
<p>But I have to admit: While I loved having my code clean of types, I sometimes
missed code completion, and the ability to know what a function accepts or returns. I didn’t worry
or fret about it, and not bugs were caused by this, because if I mixed my types,
my tests would tell me that, but unfortunately that happens during the running of my testis
and <em>after</em> coding, so some amount of time was wasted to deal with problems my tests found
that I would have found out during coding time if I had static typing.</p>
<p>But when I weighed the drawbacks of static typing (as I knew it), with the benefits of dynamic
typing, I knew that I wanted stick with dynamic typing. “Never go back!”, said I.
So I didn’t very much like TypeScript’s rise in popularity.
It was like finally I found a nice comfortable dynamic language, and, well,
just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in!</p>
<p><img src="https://gils-blog.tayar.org/img/they-pull-me-back-in.webp" alt="just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in"></p>
<p>TypeScript’s gaining popularity was an affront to my belief that static typing is a scourge
on the world of development and that everybody should move to dynamic typing! How
can developers choose to go back to static typing after they saw the horrors of static typing?
I really couldn’t understand it. And I fought back. In any forum I could—I warned of the dangers
of static typing, and reminded people that if we weren’t careful, Java-isms would come and
take us back to the dark ages of yak shaving and incomprehensible abstractions.</p>
<p>But after a while I calmed down, and I started thinking a bit. And I noticed two things. The first
was that the war I was fighting was a religious war. A binary war, a holy war. And I do not like
religious wars. And here I was, fighting one, feverishly, passionately, arguing <strong>against something
that I had no experience about</strong>. And that was not nice. I let my anger obscure my objectivity.</p>
<p>The second thing I noticed was that a lot of people that I admired were using TypeScript,
and liking it. So it couldn’t be <em>all</em> bad could it? Then again, a lot of those people
did not have <em>any</em> experience with static typing, so maybe they were lured by the temptation of
static typings, but once there, they would start to convert it to code that shaved yaks and
generated incomprehensible abstractions?</p>
<p>Maybe. But maybe maybe I should do what I should have done from the beginning, instead of starting
a holy war? Mayb I should just…</p>
<p>Listen.</p>
<p>So I talked to some TypeScript developers. And read blog posts.
And realized something I never realized: TypeScript’s type system is NOT Java’s.
TypeScript’s spirit is much closer to JavaScript’s than to Java’s or C#'s.
How so? TypeScript’s type system is just a formal definition of something
that was never really defined: JavaScript’s type system. It does not try to bend JavaScript to its
type system. Rather, it tries to bend <em>itself</em> to JavaScript’s. I believe it’s goal is to be able
to define a type signature for every NPM package out there, however weird that NPM package is. And
it’s succeeding marvelously!</p>
<p>And that is the main argument against my “you’re going to turn JavaScript into Java” war.
Typescript is not trying to emulate an OOP type system’s like Java. Not at all.
It’s trying to formalize JavaScript’s informal way of implementing APIs and package interfaces.
And since most JavaScript packages interface are more concerned with <em>data</em>,
and less with abstractions, then so does TypeScript’s.
Yes, you can abuse TypeScript (and JavaScript!) to create incomprehensible abstractions,
but the <em>spirit</em> of TypeScript doesn’t really want you to do that. Instead, it
encourage’s a JavaScript like simplicity, that is more around functions and data than it is
around classes and abstractions.</p>
<p>But what about my second problem with TypeScript? Transpilation. I dislike transpilation. It…
complicates everything: debugging, stack traces, tooling, comprehension, scripting. Everything.
So while I was curious TypeScript, and could see the benefits, I didn’t really want to deal
with <em>that</em> problem.</p>
<p>But, still, one <em>should</em> try, right? Right. So, because at work we work with Microservices,
I decided to write my next Microservice in TypeScript. Just to try it out. Which I did.</p>
<p>And it was wonderful and horrible at the same time. Wonderful, because types really do help the
coding phase. They don’t reduce bugs, because I have tests for that, and any typing
mistakes I made would have been caught by those tests. But they <em>do</em> reduce the coding time,
because no more typing mistakes (mostly), and they <em>do</em> increase the readability of the code.</p>
<p>Horrible? Yes. TypeScript is the only language I know that changes its behavior based on a
config file. In actuality, TypeScript is not <em>one</em> language. It’s an infinity of languages,
each one <em>slightly</em> different, and each one “generated” by a specific configuration file. And
to figure out the language variation you want, you start playing with that arcane config file.
Documentation for the configuration? It’s there, and much better than it was a year ago,
but it’s still arcane.</p>
<p>And it was horrible because of the transpilation. I had to start figuring out the tooling. And
how to work with Docker. And debugging. And stack traces. Not a nice environment. Workable,
but less than perfect.</p>
<h2 id="the-dilemma">The dilemma <a href="#the-dilemma">#</a></h2>
<p>So on the one side, JavaScript: wonderful language, no build time, really great tooling.
And dynamically typed, with all the pros and cons that come with this.
And on the other side, TypeScript: a variation on JavaScript, statically typed,
altough as dynamic as you want it to be. And transpiled, with all the cons that come with this
(no, there are no pros to transpilation).</p>
<p>So what to choose for a new project? I’ve just joined <a href="https://roundforest.com/">a new company</a>,
and I’d like to figure out what to use there! My heart went for JavaScript and it’s buildless
simplicitiy, but I could not forget how <em>nice</em> static typing works when coding, and how it helps
the readability of the code. But I couldn’t help myself: I dislike transpiling.
I didn’t want to lose the simplicity that comes with no build phase.</p>
<p>So can I get both? Can I get the buildless, no transpiling simplicity of JavaScript, along
with the ability to statically type functions and classes?</p>
<p>The answer it seems, is yes. And this blog post is all about that: how to enable this solution

<p>Note: this solution works in Node.js. I haven’t <em>yet</em> tried it with frontend code, but I’m pretty
sure the results will be similar.</p>

<h2 id="the-solution">The solution <a href="#the-solution">#</a></h2>
<p>The solution? Good ol’ JSDocs. Ironically enough, JSDocs are an evolution of <em>JavaDocs</em>, which
were invented in Java land as a way to document Java code, and to make it available as structured
documentation.</p>
<p>But this time, we’re not going to use them to document JavaScript <em>code</em>, but rather only
the <em>types</em> in our code. And to do that, we’re going to not simply write JSDoc comments, but
write them in a way that is <strong>recognized by TypeScript</strong>. Let’s start.</p>
<p>By the way, you can find all the code in this blog post at the <code>jsdode-typing</code> repo
<a href="https://github.com/giltayar/jsdoc-typing">https://github.com/giltayar/jsdoc-typing</a>, that includes the source for an NPM package
that has full typings and can be used with any TypeScript (or JSDoc typing) code.</p>
<h2 id="simple-jsdocs">Simple JSDocs <a href="#simple-jsdocs">#</a></h2>
<p>Let’s start with a simple example of JavaScript code that is typed:</p>
<pre><code><span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a<span>,</span> b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> a <span>+</span> b<br><span>}</span><p>module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span> add <span>}</span></p></code></pre>
<p>(the above code uses CommonJS, but you can also use the new native ESM supprot in Node.js)</p>
<p>The above code is simple: it defines a function, <code>add</code>, that adds two numbers. Simple JavaScript,
no types. Now let’s add some JSDocs.</p>
<pre><code><br><span>function</span> <span>add</span><span>(</span><span>a<span>,</span> b</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span><br>  <span>return</span> a <span>+</span> b<br><span>}</span><p>module<span>.</span>exports <span>=</span> <span>{</span><br>  add<span>,</span><br><span>}</span></p></code></pre>
<p>Same code, but we added a comment above the function <code>add</code> that defines the types of <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>.
Is this code regular JavaScript? Yes. We just added some comments.
Those comments are JSDocs typing comments. Let’s look at the JSDoc:</p>
<ol>
<li>It starts with <code>/**</code> to tell the world that this is a JSDoc.</li>
<li>It includes a line for each param in the format:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code></code></pre>
<ol start="3">
<li>The type MUST be inside <code>{...}</code> and anything inside it …</li></ol></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If OKRs - “Objectives and Key Results” - are completely new to you,
there are probably better introductions.
But if you’re looking for a lightweight OKR system that has worked well for me, then here goes.</p>

<p>Many of the problems I’ve seen and heard of with OKRs seem to come from well-intentioned people taking Google’s implementation of OKRs
(which includes scoring and assessment and measurement and other complexities and nuances)
and misapplying it,
copying some parts but not other essential pieces,
and just generally having a square-peg-round-hole situation.</p>

<p>I’m sure the Google system works well for Google.
Here’s what has worked well for me.</p>

<!-- more -->

<p>First up: what am I trying to achieve with OKRs?
I want a way of aligning people and communicating goals and direction.
I don’t want to necessarily specify implementation,
inadvertently micromanage,
or other problematic things.
I want to assess how well we’re doing,
but I’m not trying to build a measurement framework.</p>

<p>So, define some Objectives - high-level directional goals and intents.
Maybe they’re tangible - a revenue target or a concrete achievement.
Maybe they’re more nebulous - “make people happier” is a solid (and worthwhile!) objective.</p>

<p>For each Objective, define some Key Results - concrete tangible achievements that indicate progression towards the Objective.
They should specify a result not a task - don’t fall into the trap of specifying implementation.
A Key Result for an Objective about revenue might be the launch of a new product you expect to sell well.
A Key Result for an Objective of making people happier might be to score better on an annual mood survey.</p>

<p>Once you have these, crack on - that’s it!</p>

<p>The focus here is on Objectives - Key Results are potential but not necessary contributors.
They give you something tangible to aim for,
but they’re a milestone on a planned journey,
not the end destination.
If your Objective is to exceed last year’s profits,
and a Key Result is something resulting in a massive revenue increase,
that shouldn’t stop you from taking advantage of another opportunity for profit that might arise instead.</p>

<p>And that’s it.
No “scoring functions”,
no “difficulty calibration”.
This isn’t a framework for goal-setting and measurement across an organisation.
It’s a lightweight tool for alignment and direction.</p>

<p>Encourage people to cascade OKRs down into smaller groups.
If you have organisation-wide OKRs then it’s great if divisions can produce OKRs that align within those,
and teams producing OKRs that align within those,
and individuals producing OKRs that align within those.
But it’s not a strict subset.
The “parent” OKRs won’t capture everything and shouldn’t try.
They should be about what matters at that level.</p>

<p>OKR all the things - big to small.
Prioritisation matters,
and isn’t touched upon here,
but there’s value in explicitly encoding targets of all sizes in this form,
and later reflecting on success or where things didn’t work out.</p>

<p>Review periodically - both Objectives and Key Results.
Things change and there’s no point keeping irrelevant goals around,
and there’s no shame in changing priorities in light of new information and circumstances.</p>

<p>Reflect periodically.
How are things going?
Are you progressing as you’d like?
Can you do more?
Should you do less?</p>

<p>Lightweight OKRs - a relatively simple tool for alignment and direction-setting.</p>

  <article>
    <p>The Standard Template Library (STL) for C++ provides a set of powerful and flexible templated container classes.  Never again will you have to hand-craft a doubly-linked list (and get your pointer arithmetic mixed up) – just use <code>std::list&lt;T&gt;</code>.</p>

<p>Now most of the idiomatic C++ code I’ve read that uses STL iterators uses the prefix <code>operator++</code> to move the iterator forward.  And so I had long ago adopted this too, with a vague recollection of having read somewhere that it performed better.  But why?  Good question…</p>

<!--more-->

<p>The use of the post-increment operator is well established idiomatic code for looping (in both C and C++):</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++">  <span>for</span> <span>(</span> <span>unsigned</span> <span>i</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>array_length</span><span>;</span> <span>i</span><span>++</span> <span>)</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>// do something with array[i]
</span>    <span>// ...
</span>  <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>When the indexing variable is an ordinal type (usually an integer), the incrementing order makes no difference.  The expressions <code>++i</code> and <code>i++</code> are identical in this case.  And so many people developing in C++ simply use the same style in C++ with their iterator code.  Why would it matter?</p>

<p>Well, it turns out that it does.  If the indexing variable is a class, such as an iterator, there are some subtle differences between the pre-increment and post-increment operators that may have a big impact on performance.</p>

<p>Referring back to Scott Meyer’s wonderful <a href="http://www.amazon.com/More-Effective-C%2B%2B-Addison-Wesley-Professional/dp/020163371X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/002-4241626-5806441?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1190249817&amp;sr=8-1">More Effective C++</a> book, I tracked down the explanation (item 6, page 31), which I will attempt to reproduce here in simplified form.  The signature of the pre-increment <code>operator++</code> for a class T is:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++">  <span>T</span><span>&amp;</span> <span>operator</span><span>++</span><span>();</span> <span>//</span> <span>prefix</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>while the post-increment operator had a dummy parameter added to make the signature unique:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++">  <span>const</span> <span>T</span> <span>operator</span><span>++</span><span>(</span> <span>int</span> <span>);</span> <span>//</span> <span>postfix</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>But that isn’t the only difference - notice that the prefix operator returns a <em>reference</em> to the object itself (permitting chaining of method calls), while the postfix operator returns a <em>const object</em>, semantically defined as the previous value.  (This is for consistency with the behaviour of ordinal types.)</p>

<p>The result is that the pre-increment operator modifies the object in-place, whereas the post-increment operator will result in temporaries being created, invoking the constructor and destructor.  So something as simple as <code>++it</code> versus <code>it++</code> turns out to have some significant side-effects when applied to an object with overloaded operators.  Since this is the case with virtually all iterators in the STL, as well as many other similar objects, it is worth investigating.</p>

<p>So I decided to quantify the difference, to see how much of a difference it made.  I wrote a test program that created a very large (5 million) array of integers, and iterated over the array.  I used a high-resolution timer to time two versions of the loop, identical save for one being pre-increment and one being post-increment.  After a warmup of 3 runs, I ran the test 10 times, collected the timings and compared them.</p>

<p>The results were very interesting: on an Intel workstation, the pre-increment code took an average of 14.1ns per call, while the post-increment code took 27.6ns per call.  That’s a significant difference of 49%, or nearly twice as fast!  A plot of 10 iterations each is shown below:</p>

<p><img src="http://antonym.org/img/results_ppc_g4.png" alt=""></p>

<p>So - it really can improve the performance of your code to write:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++">  <span>mylist</span><span>::</span><span>const_iterator</span> <span>it</span><span>;</span>
  <span>for</span> <span>(</span> <span>it</span> <span>=</span> <span>numbers</span><span>.</span><span>begin</span><span>();</span> <span>it</span> <span>!=</span> <span>numbers</span><span>.</span><span>end</span><span>();</span> <span>++</span><span>it</span> <span>)</span>
  <span>{</span>
    <span>// do something with *it
</span>  <span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>For small arrays, it may not make much of a noticeable difference, but every cycle counts, and a little consistency goes a long way.  Using the prefix increment will enable your application to scale better.</p>

<p>Using the prefix form won’t make your actual loop run twice as fast, as the iterator increment is only one component contributing to the performance, and the looping overhead may indeed be swamped by the execution time of the body.  So as always, YMMV!</p>

<p>I have provided the test source in C++, along with an R script to summarise and plot the output.  You can download it via the attachment linked at the end of this article.  The code should compile on any POSIX-conforming system with a decent C++ compiler.  And if you do your own performance tests, please drop me a line and let me know what you found.</p>

<p>As one final note, the wonderful <a href="http://www.boost.org/">Boost++ library</a> provides the <code>foreach</code> module, which provides a powerful wrapper to iterate over containers with a nice clean simple syntax:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="c++"><span>int</span> <span>total</span> <span>=</span> <span>0</span><span>;</span>
<span>foreach</span><span>(</span> <span>int</span> <span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>numbers</span> <span>)</span>
<span>{</span>
    <span>total</span> <span>+=</span> <span>num</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></figure>

<p>And yes, it uses the pre-increment operator for maximum performance.</p>

<p><strong><em>In August, documents from the Google vs Arizona case were published. Many sections of these documents have been redacted but some interesting emails went though. In one of these emails a Google Software Engineer is puzzled by the way Android keeps prompting users to enable Google Location Services (a.k.a Google Location Accuracy). In this post, I detail how Google nudges Android users toward its own location service in order to collect their location data</em></strong>. <em><strong>Beyond the question of using nudges to collect more data, I discuss the compliance of these </strong></em><strong><em>with EU regulation. Finally</em></strong>, <strong><em>by this self-preferencing services through which they collect location data,  Google get an edge over competing  Android location-based services.</em></strong> </p>











<p><strong>GPS or GLS </strong></p>



<p>Android phones have more than one location settings, one of these settings is the main switch that controls if the phone can estimate its location and there are 5 other settings that control more specific options which most users don’t care about. <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/location-data?hl=en-FR&amp;fg=1">One of these neglected settings control the “source” used to estimate the device  location</a> :</p>



<ul><li>GPS works great outdoor, but not so well indoor</li><li>Google Location Services (GLS) are more sophisticated : they combine GPS with information from mobile networks and the device sensors. GLS are part of the Google Play Services, a set services and APIs that are installed on most Android smartphones and on thoses smartphones, GLS are enabled by default. </li></ul>



<p>To sum-up:  the <strong>Android Location setting </strong>controls if your phone <strong>can </strong>estimate its location and the<strong> Google Location Services</strong> setting controls <strong>how </strong>your phone determine its location : GPS or GLS .</p>



<p>The GLS provides a faster and more accurate device location (at least according to Google), but there is a price to pay for that and not surprisingly, this price is paid with data : through the Google Location Services, Google collects location data that are used to improve its location-based services<em>. </em>Also not so surprisingly, users are nudged towards the Google Location Services instead of GPS. Enabling GLS by default is one of these nudges, but it’s not the only one. <em> </em></p>



<p><strong><em>Easily opt-ing in, not so easily opting-out</em></strong></p>



<p>The Google Location Services are enabled by default on most Android phones and it is quite hard to disable them. The fastest way is to turn off the <strong>Android Location settings</strong> but that means loosing the benefit of all location based services and apps. The other solution is to switch from GLS to GPS but it’s more complicated and, to some extent, it feels like it has been harder with every new Android version.</p>







<div><div>
<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="320" height="568" src="https://unsearcher.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20201128_100659.gif" alt="Opting-out"></figure><p>On Android 10 <strong><em>from your home screen, it takes at least 5 clicks to opt-out from Google Location Services</em></strong>. </p></div>
</div></div>



<p>Here is the Android 10 walk-through to switch from GLS to GPS: open the Android Settings, then the Location Settings, and then the Advanced Settings, then click on “Google Location Accuracy” and finally disable the Google Location Services. </p>



<p>That’s at least five “clicks” with one that could clearly have been avoided: the settings hidden under “<em>Advanced Settings”</em> section are not more advanced than the <em>“Wifi and Bluetooth scanning”</em> option that is directly visible in the location section. <strong>It is not clear to me why those settings are not directly visible in the location setting.</strong></p>



<p>As a matter of fact, device manufacturers have modified the location menu and show directly all the settings, thus saving you one click. I tested devices of a few brands in a retail store: devices from Oppo, Xiaomi and Samsung directly show all the settings in the location menu. Devices from Sony, OnePlus and Nokia kept the original location settings organization thus requiring 5 clicks to opt-out.</p>







<div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="320" height="568" src="https://unsearcher.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/20201202_212939.gif" alt="GLS consent popup"></figure><p>Much simpler to opt-back in : <strong><em>just clicking OK on a popup appeared in a middle of an app </em></strong><strong><em>re-enable GLS</em></strong> <strong><em>almost permanently.</em></strong></p></div>



<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2020/08/unredacted-suit-shows-googles-own-engineers-confused-by-privacy-settings/?utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_brand=ars&amp;utm_social-type=owned">As noted by a Google engineer</a>, it is too easy to enable Google Location Services, even when you don’t want to. Even users who’ve managed to opt-out of Google Location Services are likely to opt-back in when they use apps that need access to the location. When the <strong>Android Location setting</strong> is off, enabling location within an app such as Google Maps, Waze or even Citymaper  will make a small popup appear asking you to confirm that you want to <em>“turn on device location which uses Google Location Services”</em>. Sometimes, this popup will appear if you just visit Google Search. </p>



<p>If you click “OK”, the Android Location setting AND the Google Location Services will be enabled permanently (i.e. not limited to the time you use the app). Even after you disable the Android location setting, GLS will remain the selected source to determine the device location. The first time you click OK, you may see an additional popup, explaining that Google may collected anonymous data and asking you to confirm, but this popup may appear only once on a given device.</p>



<p>The first time a user re-enabled the GLS, a popup may appear with more details about the fact that enabling GLS implies that Google may collect  data and use them in an anonymous way. It seems that this popup appears only one time on a given devices, in my experience the popup never re-appeared.</p>



<p>Once you’ve click “OK”, the location will be enabled and the GLS as well. To switch back from GLS to GPS you’ll have to go through the 5 clicks again.</p>











<p><strong><em>Minimal information</em></strong></p>



<p>Not only it is much simpler to enable GLS than to disable them, but the information users get before they re-enabling GLS is amazingly poor. Yet this consent box triggers the collection of users location data by Google. It is worth analyzing the two layers of information provided by Google.</p>



<figure><img loading="lazy" width="531" height="466" src="https://unsearcher.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CaptureGLS.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://unsearcher.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CaptureGLS.jpg 531w, https://unsearcher.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CaptureGLS-300x263.jpg 300w, https://unsearcher.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/CaptureGLS-342x300.jpg 342w" sizes="(max-width: 531px) 100vw, 531px"><figcaption>Google Location Services popup appearing within an app. The”details” (on the right screen) appear after clicking on the arrow on the left screen.</figcaption></figure>



<p>When the pop-up is displayed, the text only says <em>“To continue turn on device location, which uses Google location services”</em>. This text appears even when the devices is configured to use GPS instead of the Google Location Services, so the text should be “<em>Continuing will turn on device location and uses Google’s Location Service instead of GPS</em>“. That small imprecision is just a detail though.</p>



<p>Users have to click on the small “arrows” at the end of the sentence to learn that, if they click on OK, “<em>Google may collect location data periodically and <strong>use this data in an anonymous way to improve location accuracy and location-based services </strong></em>[emphasize mine]<em><strong>“</strong></em> . Two details are worth discussing in this sentence:</p>



<ol><li>The data are collected and processed for two different purpose : First, they are used to improve the <strong>location accuracy</strong> (i.e. the service requested by the user). Second, Google uses them to <strong>improve their location-based services.</strong> These purposes are bundled, it’s not possible to have one without the other.</li><li>The location data collected by Google <strong>are not anonymous, they are used in an anonymous way</strong>. </li></ol>







<p><strong><em>Google should obtain a valid consent </em></strong></p>



<div><p>While GDPR does not require all processing to be based on consent, in the case of location data the ePrivacy directive applies. Especially <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32002L0058&amp;from=EN">article 9.1 </a> :</p></div>



<blockquote><p><em>“Where location data other than traffic data, relating to users or subscribers of public communications networks or publicly available electronic communications services, can be processed,<strong>such data may only be processed when they are made anonymous, or with the consent of the users or subscribers to the extent and for the duration necessary for the provision of a value added service</strong> [emphasize mine].”</em></p></blockquote>



<p>Unless they are anonymizing the data (they probably don’t, see  the Privacy Nerd section bellow), Google has to obtain a valid user consent to the processing of his location data. It’s not clear to me that the popup displayed within apps is enough to obtain an informed consent.</p>







<p><strong><em>“Scale helps make [Google] product better”</em></strong></p>



<p>With GLS, Google certainly collects more data than any other Android location services and uses them to improve location-based services. Some of these services are good for everyone like the earthquake detection system released in 2020. But Google most certainly also uses these data to improve drive to store accuracy (although drive to store is only reported for users who enabled location history), to predict traffic and suggest itineraries. </p>



<p><a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/bright-side-of-sitting-in-traffic.html">As Google explained it in 2009</a> </p>



<p><em>“Ever since GPS location started coming to mainstream devices, people have been thinking of ways to use it to figure out how fast the traffic is moving. But for us to really make it work, we had to solve problems of scale <strong>(because you can’t get useful traffic results until you have a LOT of devices reporting their speeds)</strong></em><em>[emphasize mine]”</em></p>



<p>A competing location-based service running on Android is very unlikely to get access to more location  data than Google. Indeed, it is very complicated for an incumbent to obtain Android location data without Google being in the loop. Clearly, Google is leveraging its control over Android to collect location data in order to improve its services. The prevalence of the Google Location Services gives Google an edge over all other location based services ranging from traffic prediction to location based advertising.</p>



<p><em>As conceded by Google in the <a href="https://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/08/bright-side-of-sitting-in-traffic.html">2009 blogpost</a>:<strong> </strong></em></p>



<blockquote><p><em><strong>“Google is fortunate to have a lot of people using our products, and that scale helps make our products better.”</strong></em></p></blockquote>



<p>Fortune favor the brave. Back in 2009, Google may have been fortunate, but now it seems Google products are favored by the operating system.</p>







<p><em>Thanks to Franck Baudot for reviewing a draft,</em></p>



<div><div>
<p><strong><em>For privacy nerds</em></strong>: <em>hints that these data are not anonymized</em></p>



<p>Google could delete the data right after they estimated the device location, but to <strong>“improve location based services”</strong> they need to keep these data for a while. So if they want to keep them without consent, they have to anonymize them.</p>



<p>Very little documentation explains what data is processed by GLS. In a response to Senators Richard …</p></div></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We’re continuously releasing new capabilities to enable more people to be productive and compliant when working with Apache Kafka.</p><p>Our engineers have been hard at work on a great Christmas present for our amazing community of Kafka users.&nbsp;</p><p>Before unwrapping our latest and greatest release, here’s a sneak peak of what’s inside. </p><h2>Streaming SQL workloads on Kafka Connect</h2><p>In July, we revamped our <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/07/Why-new-Streaming-SQL-opens-up-data-platform/">Streaming SQL engine</a> for powerful data processing minus the typical operational and development complexities.&nbsp;</p><p>This came with a new deployment framework (“DAD” as we call it).</p><p>You’ve got enough distributed technologies to manage. So we built the framework to simplify deploying streaming SQL workloads on your existing infrastructure alongside wherever you run your other applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For our first DAD Release, we included support for Kubernetes. And now we’re extending the framework to deploy your workloads over your Kafka Connect infrastructure too!</p><p>If you want to understand how it works, checkout our recent <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYjVgyWzGVE">CNCF webinar.</a> </p><h2>Powered-up Streaming SQL for complex data structures
</h2><p>Speaking of Streaming SQL, Lenses 4.1 comes packed with new features that make life even easier when processing data with complex data structures.  We’ve introduced<a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/sql/functions/#array-functions"> 6 new functions to work with arrays</a>, better support for array literals, and lateral joins.
</p><p>All these features are available both for our Snapshot and Streaming SQL engines.
</p><p>Lateral joins for example is a new kind of join that allows you to extract and work with the single elements found inside an array, as if the array was a normal table.
</p><p>As a basic example converting the structure:
</p><p><code>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"readings":&nbsp;[100,&nbsp;101,&nbsp;102]&nbsp;},</code></p><p>To single-value structure such as:</p><p><code>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;100&nbsp;},&nbsp;</code></p><p><code>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;101&nbsp;},&nbsp;</code></p><p><code>{&nbsp;"meter_id":&nbsp;1,&nbsp;"reading":&nbsp;102&nbsp;},</code></p><p>This means you can define even more types of data processing workloads with SQL rather than on complex stream-processing frameworks.&nbsp;</p><p>Read Nicolò’s <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/12/exploding-arrays-in-kafka-with-lateral-joins">blog about Lateral Joins</a> for more detail.</p><h2>Explore Kafka Message Headers with SQL</h2><p>Apache Kafka 0.11 introduced headers to messages in Kafka. A very welcome feature.</p><p>Kafka Headers are useful for annotating, auditing, monitoring and routing of events as they flow through Kafka.&nbsp;</p><p>This opens up a number of new use cases, including for monitoring data lineage and distributed tracing, that help make Kafka more governable and allow you to offer higher service-levels to your users.</p><p>Our new release now allows you to query headers alongside Kafka message payload and key with the Lenses snapshot SQL engine. This will radically accelerate the time to investigate incidents and problems. </p><p>See our <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/12/kafka-distributed-tracing-with-message-headers">message headers blog</a> for more information.&nbsp;</p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/3DXYl9WI25AbGTgnkvvvnm/b06a02dde2ccc551a77c7e0a63a83fb9/lenses.io_kafka_headers.png" alt="Query Kafka Message Headers with Lenses.io and SQL"></p><h2>Data Policies namespaces</h2><p>Data privacy has been a first-class citizen of Lenses since the beginning.&nbsp; Policies allow you to discover and anonymize data within your streaming data. This means data can be socialized across your business whilst maintaining top notch compliance.</p><p>Data Policies were applied globally across all matching Kafka streams and Elasticsearch indexes. This wasn’t always what everyone needed. As an example, an emailAddress field should be anonymized for production topics and not across dev topics.&nbsp;</p><p>So whilst you're defining Data Policies you can now apply policies based on specific topic namespaces.&nbsp;</p><p>Read more about the latest Data Policies features and how to protect your data in our blog <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/12/life-of-pii-data-masking-and-compliance-for-apache-kafka/">life of PII for Apache Kafka</a>.</p><h2>Kafka Connect multi-tenancy
</h2><p>We see many of you are managing dozens if not hundreds of Kafka Connect clusters. Often in a multi-tenant fashion. 

Operating so many clusters puts a strain on good governance and adds risk. 
</p><p>Not only should you control what topics users and connectors can access but also potentially completely isolate tenants to your platform for compliance. Avoiding them even seeing other tenants clusters let alone having access to them. </p><p>The Lenses security model has protected which Kafka topics users can access (on top of what you may have already with ACLs). We’ve now extended this security model so users can set privileges over which Connect clusters can be accessed by whom. 
</p><p>To understand more about applying compliance and governance to Kafka Connect, <a href="https://lenses.io/blog/2020/12/kafka-connect-top-compliance-controls/">some further reading here.</a></p><h2>App Catalog Drilldown</h2><p>The Topology view is one of our most popular features. It provides a view of the lineage of real-time data flows. Very useful for impact analysis and troubleshooting for example.&nbsp;</p><p>We’re now simplifying the workflow so you can understand the relationships between data and applications with an instant drill down from a data flow to an enhanced view of an App’s metadata.&nbsp;</p><p>This shows detailed information about an application generating data including state, health and business metadata. </p><p><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/tnuaj0t7r912/27xzELE1DIze9sHpkEFW8O/7531062a27fdecbb10672f03742b1e78/app-catalog-lenses-4.1.png" alt="app-catalog-lenses-4.1"></p><h2>Take her for a spin?</h2><p>The release is packed with more features including support for recursive schemas, new Kafka Connect Alerting and improvements to how you can manage your license keys.&nbsp; Full release notes can be found here: <a href="https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/release-notes/">https://docs.lenses.io/4.1/release-notes</a></p><p>Experience the latest version in a cloud demo environment or as an <a href="https://lenses.io/start/">all-in-one Kafka &amp; Lenses docker now</a>!</p><p>Merry Christmas and a thanks to everyone in the community for their wonderful support.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]>

The most common way to authenticate users is by using the email/password combo. Unfortunately, <a href="https://blog.cotter.app/medium-and-slack-moved-away-from-passwords-and-heres-a-reason-why-you-should-too/">passwords have serious disadvantages on both security and user interface</a>. <strong>In this tutorial, we'll use a verification code sent to the user's email to authenticate the user</strong>.</p><p>Authorization is a way for your server to authorize a request. In simpler terms, this is where you pass in a token or session to your backend server when calling an API to view or update some data. The 2 common strategies are <strong>cookie-based sessions</strong> and <strong>JWT tokens</strong>. </p><p>The main advantage for JWT tokens is that it's not stored in your database so you don't need to do a DB check to validate every request. That's why <strong>we're going to use JWT Tokens in this tutorial.</strong></p><p><a href="https://blog.cotter.app/what-on-earth-is-oauth-super-simple-intro-to-oauth-20-access-tokens-and-how-to-implement-it-in-your-site/">Learn more about how OAuth 2.0 and Access Token works.</a></p><h3 id="how-would-the-overall-registration-login-look-like">How would the overall registration/login look like?</h3><p><strong>Authentication: </strong>We'll ask for the user's email and send them an email containing a code. If the user enters the code correctly, we'll get a JWT Token in the frontend and store it in <code>localStorage</code>.</p><p><strong>Authorization: </strong>Every time we want to access a private API endpoint we need to include a header <code>Authorization: Bearer ${token}</code>.</p><blockquote>Storing the token in the browser local storage is susceptible to cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. If an attacker can successfully run JavaScript code in your site, they can retrieve the tokens stored in local storage. XSS vulnerability arises when your website takes data from users without proper validation or from a third-party JavaScript code (like Google Analytics, jQuery, etc) included in the website.</blockquote><h2 id="let-s-start-building">Let's Start Building</h2><p>Create your Next.js app. We'll call the app <code>next-passwordless-login</code> and use the default starter app.</p><pre><code>yarn create next-app

<p>Today, Pornhub took down all videos from unverified accounts after a New York Times report documented instances of nonconsensual pornography and child sexual abuse material on the service.</p>
<p>But the Times editorial isn't what spurred the shutdown: rather, it was the decision by Visa and Mastercard to withdrawn Pornhub's payment processing that prompted Pornhub to take action.</p>
<p>You may count that as a win. No one with any kind of moral center endorses nonconsensual pornography, especially when it involves children, and the less there is out there, the better the world is. I agree.</p>
<p>But we should also be worried about the growing monopolization of payment processing, and the role that payment processors are coming to play as gatekeepers for all kinds of activities.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/visa-and-mastercard-are-trying-dictate-what-you-can-watch-pornhub">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/visa-and-mastercard-are-trying-dictate-what-you-can-watch-pornhub</a></p>
<p>Mastercard and Visa are not qualified to make those calls. More importantly, no one elected them to make those calls. No law requires them to make those calls, and any law that tried would likely be unconstitutional.</p>
<p>If you want a sex industry based on consent and dignity, this should doubly worry you. After all, the first group of people shut down by payment processors' arbitrary judgements about what speech should and should exist were independent sex-workers.</p>
<p><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/160488/nick-kristof-holy-war-pornhub">https://newrepublic.com/article/160488/nick-kristof-holy-war-pornhub</a></p>
<p>It took years for the payment processors to work their way up to the monopolistic, sprawling porn empire behind Pornhub – a Canadian company called Mindgeek that maintains the pretense that it is headquartered in Luxembourg,a notorious tax-evasion jurisdiction.</p>
<p>There's an old saw that the sex industry are early tech adopters. That's not quite true – rather, people with disfavored views are the first people for whom it's worth figuring out new technologies, since the old ones are unavailable to them.</p>
<p>Porn got into home films because most big cinemas wouldn't screen pornography. They got into VHS because it was easier to duplicate than film. They got into the net because it offered access without social costs of being seen in the adult section of the video rental place.</p>
<p>But while pornographers aren't early adopters, they ARE leading indicators. Pornographers' fights with novel censorship tactics are also trial-runs for using those tactics against OTHER people – and payment processors have already been pressed into service.</p>

<p>If you're charged with a crime, the prosecutor has to prove you did it beyond a reasonable doubt; when it's a civil case, it's up to YOU to prove based on "preponderance of evidence" that you are innocent. A real difference, especially when the accused is an inanimate object.</p>
<p>In civil asset forfeiture, police seize the goods of people they suspect of criminal activity – without the need for a charge or conviction – and sue that property (i.e. "State of Iowa v Six Tons of Bricks") and you pay a lawyer to prove your property's innocence.</p>
<p>If your lawyer loses (or if you can't afford a lawyer), you lose your stuff, and the cops get to keep it or sell it and keep the money as an off-the-books black budget. Cops love this money – it lets them buy military surveillance gear.</p>
<p><a href="https://revealnews.org/article/chicago-and-los-angeles-have-used-dirt-box-surveillance-for-a-decade/">https://revealnews.org/article/chicago-and-los-angeles-have-used-dirt-box-surveillance-for-a-decade/</a></p>
<p>But not just that: one sheriff stole $70k from his townspeople and used the money to buy a muscle car that he only drove to and from work.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt--politics/feds-want-reimbursement-for-gwinnett-sheriff-70k-muscle-car/zkOidGb5oRfCHGO5RlZGsL/">https://www.ajc.com/news/local-govt–politics/feds-want-reimbursement-for-gwinnett-sheriff-70k-muscle-car/zkOidGb5oRfCHGO5RlZGsL/</a></p>
<p>City attorneys have worked with cops in the past to draw up "wish lists" of stuff they'd like to steal. The cops then nose around the owners of that stuff, looking for a pretence to seize it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/us/police-use-department-wish-list-when-deciding-which-assets-to-seize.html">https://www.nytimes.com/2014/11/10/us/police-use-department-wish-list-when-deciding-which-assets-to-seize.html</a></p>
<p>Indeed, police departments future budgets projected their forfeiture revenues for years to come, effectively setting a quota for how much they had to steal from people each year:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/dc-police-plan-for-future-seizure-proceeds-years-in-advance-in-city-budget-documents/2014/11/15/7025edd2-6b76-11e4-b053-65cea7903f2e_story.html">https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/dc-police-plan-for-future-seizure-proceeds-years-in-advance-in-city-budget-documents/2014/11/15/7025edd2-6b76-11e4-b053-65cea7903f2e_story.html</a></p>
<p>By 2014, US police were stealing more from the people they were sworn to protect than all the nation's burglars combined.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/north_america/americas-current-economy/police-civil-asset-forfeitures-exceed-all-burglaries-in-2014/">https://www.armstrongeconomics.com/international-news/north_america/americas-current-economy/police-civil-asset-forfeitures-exceed-all-burglaries-in-2014/</a></p>
<p>No wonder that by 2015 Congress ended the program (don't worry, Trump reinstated and expanded it):</p>
<p><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/23/the-feds-just-shut-down-a-huge-program-that-lets-cops-take-your-stuff-and-keep-it/">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/12/23/the-feds-just-shut-down-a-huge-program-that-lets-cops-take-your-stuff-and-keep-it/</a></p>
<p>Long after the program was ended, cops insisted that without forfeiture, they lacked the "incentive" to fight crime:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/taken/2019/02/03/sc-civil-forfeiture-police-defend-practice-say-funds-essential-law-enforcement/2746412002/">https://www.greenvilleonline.com/story/news/taken/2019/02/03/sc-civil-forfeiture-police-defend-practice-say-funds-essential-law-enforcement/2746412002/</a></p>
<p>They predicted that without forfeiture, police budgets would be too strained to fight crime, while criminals' coffers would swell. That was the scare-story New Mexico's legislature heard in 2015 when the state ended civil forfeiture.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/police-say-seizing-property-without-trial-helps-keep-crime-down-a-new-study-shows-theyre-wrong">https://www.propublica.org/article/police-say-seizing-property-without-trial-helps-keep-crime-down-a-new-study-shows-theyre-wrong</a></p>
<p>Five years later, the verdict is in, and the cops' predictions were wrong. A new report from The Institute for Justice shows that NM experienced no rise in crime, no drop in arrests, and "arrest/offense rates consistent with trends in two neighboring states, CO and TX."</p>
<p><a href="https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/">https://ij.org/report/policing-for-profit-3/</a></p>
<p>The study shows that far from being an instrument to return stolen goods or make restitution to crime victims, forfeiture is a way to fatten police budgets and personally enrich police officials. The seizures are mostly small-dollar amounts (not drug dealer money).</p>
<p>The larger seizures tell an even worse story: they include numerous instances in which a family home was seized because an underage offender sold small quantities of drugs from the premises – leaving families to spend fortunes defending their homes, often unsuccessfully.</p>

<p>Back in September, we got a glimpse of upcoming EU tech competition rules, courtesy of a leak from the European Commission; they set out an ambitious set of rules on mergers, self-dealing, surveillance, and interoperability.</p>
<p><a href="https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/30/death-to-all-monopoly/#whither-structural-separation">https://pluralistic.net/2020/09/30/death-to-all-monopoly/#whither-structural-separation</a></p>
<p>The proposal wasn't perfect, but it was still exciting and encouraging, especially the interoperability proposals. Interop, after all, is the judo that every one of today's tech giants used to beat the companies that came before them.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/samba-versus-smb-adversarial-interoperability-judo-network-effects">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/07/samba-versus-smb-adversarial-interoperability-judo-network-effects</a></p>
<p>Today, the Commission published the first public draft of its rules (these need to get through the EU Parliament and the Council of national governments):</p>
<p><a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en">https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-markets-act-ensuring-fair-and-open-digital-markets_en</a></p>
<p>The Digital Markets Act and its companion, the Digital Services Act, are the first major update to EU e-commerce rules in nearly two decades. A LOT has changed since the E-Commerce Directive!</p>
<p>For a quick overview, I recommend my EFF colleagues Christoph Schmon and Karen Gullo's analysis:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/european-commissions-proposed-regulations-require-platforms-let-users-appeal">https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/12/european-commissions-proposed-regulations-require-platforms-let-users-appeal</a></p>
<p>The good news: the proposal requires due process for content removal – not a system where filters remove your content in an eyeblink and then you spend months or years in autoresponder hell trying to get it back up.</p>
<p>It doesn't require giant companies to police their users' speech, a rule that has led to mass-scale censorship, especially targeted against marginalized people who lack the platform and resources to complain when they get blocked.</p>
<p>It includes <em>very</em> steep penalties for companies that don't comply (up to 6% of annual global revenue), and a means to reach beyond EU borders to sanction companies that do business in the EU – both measures are powerful and potentially dangerous, and both need more specifics.</p>
<p>One disappointment: the interoperability measures have been weakened since September's leaks, though Article 6 of the Digital Markets Act is still a strict and far-reaching set of pro-competition rules with some look-in for interop.</p>
<p>Here's some A6 highlights, rules for the largest tech companies ("gatekeeper companies"):</p>
<ul>
<li>A ban on combining platform data with data from third parties and on automatically logging users from one service on a platform to other ones
</li>
<li>
<p>A requirement to let businesses on the platform offer services and pricing that directly competes with the platform owner</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A requirement to let businesses on the platform do subscription and payment with users on their own terms, without having to use the platform</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ban on blocking businesses on the platform from complaining about abuses to regulators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A ban on …</p></li></ul></div></article></div>

<h2 id="prelude">Prelude</h2>

<p>I grew up in a small town where compliments werenâ€™t really a thing. Back in school, the highest praise I ever received came from a classmate who wore metal-tipped boots â€œall the better to kick people withâ€�. One day, he gave me a nod of approval for something important, I canâ€™t recall. I savored that nod for months.</p>

<p>My relationship to compliments in those days was simple: I didnâ€™t give any and I didnâ€™t receive any either. Talking openly about feelings - or heaven forbid - giving praise - simply wasnâ€™t the norm. This was especially so with the older generation, people like my granddad.</p>

<p>But then I moved. Moved to the big city, a place filled with people themselves big on compliments. My upbringing had left me underprepared for these changes. Even something as simple as receiving praise was complicated. There certainly were times when my soul would be lit up with joy. But other times, my feelings were murkier. The compliment left me feeling weirdly uncomfortable.</p>

<p>The fear of inflicting this discomfort on others â€” or of being perceived as sleazy â€” meant that I had no interest in adding complimenting to my social repertoire. Instead I wanted to be more like my friend Fabio: effortlessly likable, disarming, and sincere â€” the exact opposite to the sales-y flatterer type. Fabio was above needing to deal in compliments.</p>

<p>One day I was inside Fabioâ€™s apartment and saw a note pinned to his mirror that read â€œCompliment someone every dayâ€�. I asked him if he lived by that advice. He stopped, thought for a few seconds, then told me I looked amazing.</p>

<p>That evening, I replayed all my previous interactions with Fabio and realized that heâ€™d been complimenting people â€” including me â€” <em>constantly</em>. It was just that he did it with so much grace that I hadnâ€™t noticed it. Perhaps all his complimenting was what made him so effortlessly likable in the first placeâ€¦</p>

<p>Realizing that I had been too hasty to dismiss compliments, I decided to investigate in earnest, embarking on a year-long side quest to truly understand them. The following 40 pages are what I learned by taking hundreds of my own observations in the field and reading dozens of papers on the topic.</p>



<h2 id="i-what-is-a-compliment">I What Is A Compliment?</h2>

<p>I began with the most fundamental of research tools. Not the dictionary, but my mum. She defines a compliment as an expression of praise that lifts the other person up. A sociologist will tell you that compliments fit into a catalog of behaviors know as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingratiation#Tactics_of_ingratiation">ingratiation tactics</a>. Sociologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingratiation">Edward E. Jones, dubbed the father of ingratiation</a>, found that compliments were the most prevalent of these behaviors, outpacing opinion conformity (â€œSir, your plan for a winter invasion of Russia is a masterpiece.â€�), the rendering of favors (picking ticks out of your fur â€” if you are a chimp), and self-presentation (e.g. <a href="https://www.lesspenguiny.com/articles/best-article-on-bragging">boasting</a> and name-dropping).</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/how-to-compliment/783h0qgmdyv11.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Categorizing anything correctly â€” including ingratiation tactics â€” is hard.</em></p>

<p>Most compliments are given with words, but thatâ€™s not to say a knowing grin paired with a ravenous, lusty undertone in oneâ€™s voice donâ€™t speak volumes to your date, nor that a pat on the back from a curmudgeonly sportsball coach doesnâ€™t let you know he respects you.</p>

<h2 id="ii-what-topics-are-complimented">II What Topics Are Complimented?</h2>

<p>The academic work on compliments (such as by Holmes) suggests that they center on a surprisingly narrow number of traits. The most common topic is looks, accounting for perhaps <a href="https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/paying-compliments-sexpreferential-politeness-strategy/">one of every two</a> compliments given. Itâ€™s clear weâ€™re a vain bunch.</p>

<p>Other frequently praised topics include performances/achievements (â€œgreat article on complimenting, LessPenguiny), material possessions (â€œnice padâ€�), and personality/friendship (â€œyouâ€™re so funnyâ€�).</p>

<p>Below is a table from Holmesâ€™ study that displays how sex affects the choice of compliment topic. You can see how M-M (Male to Male) compliments centered on material possessions twice as often as F-F ones, whereas F-F compliments were far likely to center on appearance than M-M ones.</p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/how-to-compliment/ScreenShot2019-06-18at212425.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>The topic of a compliment is sometimes left vague. Imagine being told: â€œYour fiancÃ© is a very lucky man.â€� How would you interpret this? Is it a compliment about your looks? Your personality? Is it even about <em>you</em> at all â€“ maybe the speaker considers your fiancÃ© lucky for unrelated reasons. Such a compliment amounts to a choose-your-own-adventure in praise, one seeped in the speakerâ€™s plausible deniability, the most powerful force in the social universe.</p>

<p>Similarly vague are activities on social media. When someone likes my photo on Facebook, itâ€™s not clear <em>what exactly</em> I should feel good about. Was it because I was looking rugged? Or was the composition of the photo praiseworthy? Or are they just acknowledging they say I uploaded? Who knows?</p>

<p>By the way, allow me to rant: Itâ€™s common for â€�complainerattiâ€œ columnists to write op-eds lamenting how social media turns us all into monsters. But doesnâ€™t every social network have a like or a heart button, basically a compliment in binary form? As such, in all of history, never have so many kind sentiments been expressed. Itâ€™s just that negativity is better at commanding our attention on these networks.</p>

<h2 id="iii-timing">III Timing</h2>

<p>When exactly do compliments occur? You might think people compliment â€œwhenever they feel like itâ€�, but thatâ€™s not the majority case. Most compliments occur at rather specific times, and while plenty of compliments appear between this invisible metronomeâ€™s beats, these stand out that bit more, their salience raising the emotional stakes. Depending on the situation, this be can be either a good or bad thing.</p>

<p><strong>Time #1: Greeting and Farewell</strong></p>

<p>The most common time for a compliment is at the beginning of an interaction, almost as an extension of â€” or a substitute for â€” a regular greeting. Why welcome your friends with a mere â€œhiâ€� when you could say â€œAhh the beautiful people have arrivedâ€� or â€œA<em>maz</em>ing jacket! Whereâ€™s the catwalk?â€� The great thing about using compliments in your greetings is that they promptly reaffirm affections that may have grown ambivalent through time apart.</p>

<blockquote lang="en" data-id="1ZUcUUK"><a href="https://imgur.com/1ZUcUUK">Fennec Fox reunited with his best friend, William the Cat</a></blockquote>


<p>Lad-ish males riff on this theme by mock insulting each other on greeting. â€œAhh the vermin have arrivedâ€� Despite being a put-down on the face of it, these are far more affectionate than vanilla greetings, the affection proportionate to the effort put into the banter.</p>

<p>No surprise, then, that compliments also fill in for farewells, closing off the interaction on a sprightly note: â€œSee youâ€¦ Oh yea and BTW, your new scooter is so futuristic-looking!â€� Parting praise like this demands no response, for the parties are already on their separate ways. This can be a boon, because many people find responding to a compliment to be trying. More on this later.</p>

<p><strong>Time #2: In Response to Change</strong></p>

<blockquote lang="en" data-id="a/lPTwJ"><a href="https://imgur.com/a/lPTwJ">Motivational Post - Before and After :)</a></blockquote>


<p>Whenever we notice somethingâ€™s changed with a friend or acquaintance, there is a powerful impulse to bring it up, to say something positive. This impulse is strong enough to even derail sentences:</p>

<p><em>Someone opens the front-door and shouts out to a flat-mate out of sight and in another room</em></p>

<p>â€œHey! I really need to tell you the news! Me and Steve got back from the doctors and the results are in. Weâ€™re â€“â€� <em>(the flat-mate emerges from their room and into sight</em>) â€œ- OH! What an elegant dress. You look fab â€“ pregnant!â€�</p>

<p>This phenomenon â€” complimenting in response to change â€” explains why we receive so much praise about our new haircuts, our new cars, or the latest decorations in our homes. Novelty gets noticed.</p>

<p><strong>Time #3: When Customary</strong></p>

<p><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/less-penguiny/how-to-compliment/dog-1272852_1280.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><em>Why hasnâ€™t my human told me Iâ€™m a good boy for sitting?</em></p>

<p>There are circumstances where the <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08351818009370503">absence of applause is taken to mean disapproval</a> â€“ as if the situation itself were fishing for a compliment. Imagine giving a talk after which no one claps. Or cooking a meal about which no-one tells you they enjoyed. Wouldnâ€™t youâ€™re confidence be undermined?</p>

<p>Now flip the roles. Instead of being the cook, you are now the dinner guest. If youâ€™re anyway wired like I am, youâ€™ll probably feel immense pressure to assure the host that the food is great, even if youâ€™ve barely tasted it yet. Etiquette tells us that itâ€™s polite to compliment in such circumstances.</p>

<p>In the business networking world, when I make an introduction on your behalf, Iâ€™m sort of expected to big you up, to explain why youâ€™re worthy of the other partyâ€™s time: â€œYou have to meet Annie. Sheâ€™s a kick-ass online marketer who knows absolutely everything about how Googleâ€™s algorithm works and is single-handedly responsible for why you canâ€™t find anything good online anymore.â€� (I presume this is the highest praise a man can give in such circles.) Incidentally this is also an <a href="https://www.lesspenguiny.com/articles/best-article-on-bragging#8-outsourced-brag">Outsourced Brag</a>, as I write about in my bragging article.</p>

<p>Because of this, I quite enjoy being in the loop for these exchanges. Sometimes they reveal what your colleagues admire about you, things they might never express in normal circumstances. In a sense, the situation forces their loving hand.</p>

<p>Lastly there are situations when the speaker is explicitly fishing for a compliment. Of course, they wonâ€™t go out and say â€œI want you to compliment my new sofaâ€�. Instead theyâ€™ll ask you want you â€�think aboutâ€� the pieceâ€” but you can tell theyâ€™re anxious for praise. This is the complimenting equivalent of a gun to the head, a hold-up, …</p></article></div>

<p><img src="https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/img/sos.png" width="200"></p>
<p>In early 2019, we started visiting campuses across India to recruit the best and brightest minds to ensure LinkedIn, and all the services that make up its complex technology stack, is always available for everyone. This critical function at Linkedin falls under the purview of the Site Engineering team and Site Reliability Engineers (SREs) who are Software Engineers specializing in reliability. SREs apply the principles of computer science and engineering to the design, development and operation of computer systems: generally, large scale, distributed ones</p>
<p>As we continued on this journey we started getting a lot of questions from these campuses on what exactly the site reliability engineering role entails? And, how could someone learn the skills and the disciplines involved to become a successful site reliability engineer? Fast forward a few months, and a few of these campus students had joined LinkedIn either as interns or as full-time engineers to become a part of the Site Engineering team; we also had a few lateral hires who joined our organization who were not from a traditional SRE background. That's when a few of us got together and started to think about how we can onboard new graduate engineers to the Site Engineering team.</p>
<p>There is a vast amount of resources scattered throughout the web on what the roles and responsibilities of SREs are, how to monitor site health, production incidents, define SLO/SLI etc. But there are very few resources out there guiding someone on the basic skill sets one has to acquire as a beginner. Because of the lack of these resources, we felt that individuals have a tough time getting into open positions in the industry. We created the School Of SRE as a starting point for anyone wanting to build their career as an SRE.</p>
<p>In this course, we are focusing on building strong foundational skills. The course is structured in a way to provide more real life examples and how learning each of these topics can play an important role in day to day SRE life. Currently we are covering the following topics under the School Of SRE:</p>
<ul>

<p>Many of Silicon Valley’s biggest companies could face blockbuster fines under <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_2347" target="_blank">new proposals</a> from the European Union announced Tuesday aimed at boosting digital competition and protecting people from online harm.</p>



<p>The announcement represents a watershed moment for Ursula von der Leyen's Commission, which has made so-called “<a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/europe-digital-technological-sovereignty-facebook-google-amazon-ursula-von-der-leyen/">technological sovereignty</a>,” or efforts to bolster the bloc’s role in digital markets, a central piece of its legislative agenda.</p>



<p>Under the proposals, known as the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act, large online platforms like Google, Amazon and Facebook will face new limits on how they can expand their online empires or face levies of up to 10 percent of their global revenue — potentially billions of euros — for unfairly hamstringing smaller rivals.</p>



<p>In the most egregious cases, EU regulators would be granted stronger powers to break up companies that flouted the bloc’s new digital rulebook.</p>



<p>Brussels also outlined separate fines of up to six percent of annual revenue for Big Tech companies — those with at least 45 million users across the 27-country bloc — that <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/tech-giants-to-face-large-fines-under-europes-new-content-rules/">fail to limit how illegal material</a>, everything from hate speech to counterfeit products, can spread across their networks.</p>



<p>“Now we have such an increase in the online traffic that we need to make rules that put order into chaos,”&nbsp;Margrethe Vestager, the European Commission’s executive vice president who oversaw the bloc’s digital reboot, told reporters&nbsp;Tuesday.&nbsp;“We should be able to navigate without being confronted with terrorist propaganda and feeling as certain that the toy we buy online is safe, just as well as the toy we buy in a brick and mortar shop.”</p>



<p>The proposals are still far from becoming law. The European Parliament and member countries will now weigh in — there is no consensus on how best to regulate tech companies — and final rules are not expected before 2023 at the earliest. Deciding which companies are deemed dominant under Europe's new regime — making them liable for tougher oversight — will also take years, and will likely involve firms challenging those decisions in EU courts.</p>



<p>Those in favor of the new rules say the current system for policing the online world is broken, with Silicon Valley holding too much sway over people’s digital lives.</p>



<p>"It is the right move to prohibit some practices up front instead of picking up the pieces afterwards,” Monique Goyens, head of BEUC, the consumer group, said in a statement, though added Brussels should have gone&nbsp;further in limiting the powers of dominant online companies.</p>



<p>Those against the reboot caution that Europe’s proposals may harm innovation, just as the bloc tries to keep pace with the United States and China.</p>



<p>“We are concerned that they appear to specifically target a handful of companies and make it harder to develop new products to support small businesses in Europe,”&nbsp;Karan Bhatia, Google’s vice president of government affairs and public policy, said in a statement.</p>



<p>Still, Brussels is eager to flex its regulatory muscles as other parts of the globe, most notably the U.S. — where local competition authorities recently filed separate antitrust lawsuits against Google and Facebook — also begin to question Silicon Valley’s role in people’s daily lives.</p>



<p>“The bigger they are, the more obligations they have to&nbsp;fulfil,” said Thierry Breton, the French commissioner who helped draft Tuesday’s proposals and is a staunch critic of Big Tech, told reporters Tuesday in reference to the largest digital players. “Our responsibility is to decide and to give direction&nbsp;and the rules to protect what is important to us."</p>



<h3>Digital Markets Act: Dos and don'ts</h3>



<p>The centerpiece of Europe’s digital plans is aimed at boosting online competition in a world dominated by Silicon Valley.</p>



<p>As part of the proposals, the Digital Markets Act will impose new obligations on so-called “gatekeepers,” or online players that determine how other companies interact with online users, to ensure these platforms do not stop others from competing for users.&nbsp;The rules will cover companies offering digital services like online search, social networking, video-sharing platforms, cloud computing, internet messaging services, online operating systems, online marketplaces and advertising products. </p>



<p>Failure to live by these rules could lead to hefty fines up to 10 percent of a company’s global revenue, or — in the worst cases — threats<strong> </strong>to break up firms that repeatedly break the new rules, a provision that is already baked into EU law.</p>



<p>On Tuesday, Brussels did not name companies that would be designated as gatekeepers. But officials said that any firm with European revenues of at least €6.5 billion or at least 45 million users in the bloc would fall into the new category, allowing for tougher regulatory oversight. Companies operating in at least three EU countries, controlling a digital ecosystem that rivals need to use to reach customers and maintaining an entrenched market position would be included. That would almost certainly include the likes of Facebook, Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft, though it will initially be up to companies to determine if they fall under the scope of the new rules.</p>



<p>There will also be a lesser defined gatekeeper provision to ensure the new rules also apply to smaller platforms that either do not have sufficient revenues to meet the EU’s first criteria or are only dominant in specific online markets.&nbsp;Several departments within the Commission are expected to work to define who should be treated as a gatekeeper — an overtly political decision that will likely lead to internal strife amid <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/margrethe-vestager-thierry-breton-europe-big-tech-regulation-digital-services-markets-act/">ongoing tensions</a> between Vestager and Breton over the bloc's approach to digital rulemaking.</p>



<p>“We have to be very careful in Europe because we’re&nbsp;focusing on the issue of Big Tech,” said Jacques Cremer, a French academic who co-wrote a Commission-sponsored report last year on how to overhaul competition rules for&nbsp;the digital age.&nbsp;“The biggest issue we are facing is innovation in Europe."</p>



<p>As part of the overhaul, the Commission outlined plans to ban certain business practices like dominant digital companies displaying or ranking their own products ahead of those of rivals, known as self-preferencing. Apple, for instance, could see restrictions on how it promotes its new suite of digital services, while Google may be limited in placing its own products at the top of people’s search results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brussels also wants to outlaw gatekeepers’ ability to ban others from accessing their online marketplaces like app stores, as long as these rivals comply with conditions that apply to all firms present on the service. That has become a significant bone of contention for the likes of Spotify and Facebook that believe Apple has slapped unfair conditions on those companies' apps on the company's App Store. The iPhone maker denies any wrongoing. </p>



<p>Big Tech firms will also have to inform, and win approval from, Brussels when they plan to buy smaller rivals — an acknowledgement, according to officials, campaigners and some smaller tech firms, that the EU’s current merger rules have often failed to stop large companies from buying startups, in what many see as tactics to stifle competition.</p>



<p>“We will regulate again for a&nbsp;level playing field,” Breton said.&nbsp;“So that all businesses will have the same opportunities, no matter their nationality."</p>



<h3>Digital Services Act: Greater responsibility</h3>



<p>Brussels also unveiled a sweeping reboot of how large platforms must police their platforms for illegal material — rules that have not been updated in two decades.</p>



<p>Under those separate proposals, known as the Digital Services Act, online platforms will have to do more to limit the spread of illegal content and goods. The United Kingdom <a href="https://www.politico.eu/?p=1551148">published similar proposals</a> earlier on Tuesday, while the United States is mulling its own changes to so-called content liability to force platforms to further police what is posted or sold online.</p>



<p>The largest platforms like Facebook, Google and Amazon will have to provide regulators and outside groups with greater access to internal data, and appoint independent auditors who will determine if these firms are compliant with the new rules.</p>



<p>That will require these companies to carry out yearly risk assessments over how they are stopping illegal content and goods from spreading on their networks. National regulators will be granted more powers, including the ability to levy fines of up to six percent of a firm’s annual revenue if companies flout the regulations.</p>



<p>The biggest tech companies will also be forced to provide greater transparency to people over who targets them with online ads and how, give them more control over the material they see online. Companies will be encouraged to sign up to a new code of practice to stop illegal content from spreading, which will be overseen by firms, regulators and parts of civil society.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A lot of pressure will be on national regulators as the first point of contact to enforce the new rules. Many of&nbsp;Silicon Valley’s biggest names are legally based in&nbsp;Ireland, mostly for tax purposes, but Vestager dismissed concerns that Dublin would not be either willing or able to hold these companies to account if they abuse the new rules.</p>



<p>For EU officials, Tuesday’s announcements mark their latest attempt to create greater competition in digital markets and protect people online from a wave of illegal material.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But many European politicians, tech executives and civil society groups still disagree over how best to promote those goals while still encouraging the bloc’s online economy to compete with those of the U.S. and China.</p>



<p>That balance — Europe pushing for greater control over the online world while also boosting its digital economy — will now take center stage.</p>



<p>“Now, the U.S., us, the Australians, the Japanese are part of a&nbsp;global conversation about how to&nbsp;balance things …</p></div></div>

              <div>
                <div>
                    <p>Since its creation COG-UK has been supporting genomic surveillance efforts to identify variants of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the genome sequencing data from the UK.</p>
                    
<p><strong>New SARS-CoV-2 variant&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>The variant described today in the House of Commons contains a novel set of mutations associated with a lineage spreading rapidly in the South East of England (and more widely) that is the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/phe-investigating-a-novel-strain-of-covid-19">subject of ongoing investigations by the UK Public Health Agencies, coordinated by Public Health England</a> and supported by COG-UK. This variant carries a set of mutations including an N501Y mutation in the receptor binding motif of the Spike protein that the virus uses to bind to the human ACE2 receptor.</p>
<p>Efforts are under way to confirm whether or not any of these mutations are contributing to increased transmission. There is currently no evidence that this variant (or any other studied to date) has any impact on disease severity, or that it will render vaccines less effective, although both questions require further studies performed at pace. &nbsp;We will provide further updates as our investigations proceed.</p>

<p><strong>How COG-UK is tracking emerging SARS-CoV-2 gene mutations</strong></p>
<p>Explanation of terms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mutation is used to describe a replacement of a base in the genome, or a deletion or insertion event.</li>
<li>Viral variant refers to a distinct virus, which may have a combination of different mutations.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Background</strong></p>
<p>Mutations arise naturally in the SARS-CoV-2 genome as the virus replicates and circulates in the human population. These accumulate at a rate of around one to two mutations per month in the global phylogeny. As a result of this on-going process, many thousands of mutations have already arisen in the SARS-CoV-2 genome since the virus emerged in 2019. As mutations continue to arise, novel combinations are increasingly observed.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the mutations observed in SARS-CoV-2 have no apparent effect on the virus and only a very small minority are likely to be important and change the virus in any appreciable way (for example, a change in the ability to infect people; cause disease of different severity; or become insensitive to the effect of the human immune response including the response generated by a vaccine).</p>
<p>It is difficult to predict whether any given mutation is important when it first emerges, against a backdrop of the continuous emergence of new mutations. Understanding their significance may be possible based on experimental work that shows a link between the mutation and a subtle change in virus biology. However, it would take considerable time and effort to test the effect of many thousands of combinations of mutations. The biggest concern is any changes that lead to an increase in reinfections or vaccine failure (signalling that the virus may be evading the immune protection elicited by previous infection or vaccination).</p>
<p>Most attention is on mutations in the gene that encodes the Spike protein, which is associated with viral entry into cells. There are around 4000 mutations in the Spike protein gene at the present time (note that a different mutation can occur at the same point in the genome, which is why the number of mutations is greater than the actual number of bases in the Spike protein gene). A small number of mutations are in a region referred to as the receptor binding motif (RBM) of the Spike protein which is responsible for viral entry via its interaction with the&nbsp; receptor (hACE2) on host cells.</p>

<p><strong>What is COG-UK doing?</strong></p>
<p>COG-UK (whose partners include the four Public Health Agencies) undertake unselected (random) sequencing of positive samples across the UK and publish a sequencing Coverage Report, which is cascaded to the Public Health Agencies each week. A short version is open access and widely available <a href="https://www.cogconsortium.uk/data/">https://www.cogconsortium.uk/data/</a>. Random sampling is important to capture regional coverage (note that outbreak sequencing is also important, but if associated with a true outbreak, this activity will generate numerous genomes of the same variant, which does not add to the effort to identify variant viruses). Total viral sequence coverage across the UK is around 10% (that is, the proportion sequenced versus the proportion of positive tests)</p>

<p><em>Automated genome analysis</em></p>
<p>COG-UK has developed software to automatically analyse genomes for the presence of mutations, for example: <a href="http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home">http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home</a>.</p>
<p><em>Tracking mutations</em></p>
<p>COG-UK tracks the emergence of virus mutations over time, and the spread of these variants. We use two approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>A data-driven approach uses automated statistical analyses, phylogenetic studies and daily working alignments to generate a report on mutations present and their frequency in the sequenced viral population.</li>
<li>A targeted approach to look for and track mutations that have already been characterised in laboratory experiments as potentially important (for example, because they could affect the interaction with the human immune response).</li>
</ul>
<p>COG-UK has developed a Summary Mutation Report, which will be released online each week as a companion to the Coverage Report. The first prototype will be released by 18th December, with improvements made over time. This will focus on mutations that are common, and/or are of existing or emerging interest. These reports will be caveated, since they represent a subset of true case numbers.</p>

<p><strong>The role of other agencies</strong></p>
<p>COG-UK is one component of a much larger end-to-end process, the component parts of which have been defined by Public Health England.</p>
<p>The genome data generated by COG-UK is open access and available to Public Health Agencies, who then merge genome data with detailed epidemiological and clinical data. It is this combination of data that allows Public Health Agencies to interpret the significance of mutations for human health. COG-UK do not have access to this detailed patient level data.</p>
<p>The genome data and Summary Mutation Report will be used by other organisations and groups to assess the possible biological significance of the mutations, and decide which to prioritise for rapid investigation in laboratory studies of virus behaviour and immunology.</p>
<p>There is a possibility that the roll-out of vaccination will lead to selection for mutations that allow the virus to escape from the effect of the vaccine. Public Health Agencies are central to the ongoing evaluation for this event and will require the effective and rapid detection of people who have had infection more than once, or else have vaccine failure, which could be explained by changes in the virus. Such cases will need to be prioritised to have their virus sequenced. This will depend on effective and rapid triage by the diagnostic testing system before their test is processed to allow for efficient and comprehensive capture of cases that require further testing by sequencing. Once a sample arrives at a sequencing site, it is possible to generate genome data within 24 hours. Given the diagnostic testing volume, pace and geographical distribution, it is not feasible to find samples from such cases only after the testing is complete.</p>

<p><strong>COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK)</strong></p>
<p>The current COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2, represents a major threat to health. The COVID-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) consortium has been created to deliver large-scale and rapid whole-genome virus sequencing to local NHS centres and the UK government.</p>
<p>Led by Professor Sharon Peacock of the University of Cambridge, COG-UK is made up of an innovative partnership of NHS organisations, the four Public Health Agencies of the UK, the Wellcome Sanger Institute and twelve academic partners providing sequencing and analysis capacity. A full list of collaborators can be found here:&nbsp;<a title="* this link opens in a new window/tab" href="https://eur01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cogconsortium.uk%2Fabout%2F&amp;data=02%7C01%7C%7Cdbf9acbe4cee47f319fc08d8690d358f%7C1faf88fea9984c5b93c9210a11d9a5c2%7C0%7C1%7C637374852754973852&amp;sdata=QYeq5wDbGNNzvo%2FT5WDo3TvOxDviH8JzD%2Fgj6t8fbOo%3D&amp;reserved=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.cogconsortium.uk/about/.&nbsp;</a>Professor Peacock is also on a part-time secondment to PHE as Director of Science, where she focuses on the development of pathogen sequencing through COG-UK.</p>
<p>COG-UK was established in March 2020 supported by £20 million funding from the UK Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) and the Wellcome Sanger Institute, administered by UK Research and Innovation.</p>

					<div><p>Our oceans will be flooded with an estimated 1.56 billion face masks in 2020 says a report released today by Hong-Kong-based marine conservation organization OceansAsia. This will result in an additional 4,680 to 6,240 metric tonnes of marine plastic pollution, says the report, entitled “Masks on the Beach: The Impact of COVID-19 on Marine Plastic Pollution.” These masks will take as long as 450 years to break down, slowly turning into&nbsp; micro plastics while negatively impacting marine wildlife and ecosystems.</p>
<p>The report used a global production estimate of 52 billion masks being manufactured in 2020, a conservative loss rate of 3%, and the average weight of 3 to 4 grams for a single-use polypropylene surgical face mask to arrive at the estimate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“The 1.56 billion face masks that will likely enter our oceans in 2020 are just the tip of the iceberg,” says Dr. Teale Phelps Bondaroff, Director of Research for OceansAsia, and lead author of the report. “The 4,680 to 6,240 metric tonnes of face masks are just a small fraction of the estimated 8 to 12 million metric tonnes of plastic that enter our oceans each year.”</p></div>

Update 2017-09-25: Simplified the table syntax even more

</p>

<p>

Update 2018-04-06: Comments on the standardization argument

</p>

<p>

Update 2019-04-12: Extended syntax examples, "Makes Sense Outside of Emacs", "Tool Support" and added more backlinks

</p>

<p>

Update 2020-05-02: Comment by Ian Zimmerman

</p>

<p>

Disclaimer: this is a very nerdy blog entry. It is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language">lightweight markup languages</a> and why I think that Org mode is the best lightweight markup language for many use-cases. And with lightweight markup language, I do mean the syntax, the way you express headings, lists, font variations such as bold face or italic, and such things.

</p>

<p>

Please do note that this is not about Emacs. This is about Org mode syntax and its advantages even when used outside of Emacs. You can type Org mode in <a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Notepad">notepad.exe</a>, <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, <a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/">Notepad++</a>, and all other text editors out there. And in my opinion it does have advantages compared to the other, common lightweight markup standards such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AsciiDoc">AsciiDoc</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki#Editing">Wikitext</a> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText">reStructuredText</a>.

</p>

<p>

Of course, Org mode is my favorite syntax. Despite my personal choice you will see that I've got some pretty convincing arguments that underline my statement as well. So this is not just a matter of personal taste.

</p>

<p>

If you already have a grin on your face because you don't have any clue what this is all about: keep on reading. It makes an excellent example for making fun of nerds at your next dinner party. ;-)

</p>

	  <header><h2>Org-Mode Is Intuitive, Easy to Learn and Remember</h2></header>

<p>

Here you are. This is almost anything you need to know about Org mode syntax:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> * This Is A Heading
 ** This Is A Sub-Heading
 *** And A Sub-Sub-Heading

 Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line.

 *bold* /italic/ _underlined_ +strikethrough+ =monospaced=
 [[http://Karl-Voit.at][Link description]]
 http://Karl-Voit.at → link without description

 - list item
 - another item
   - sub-item
     1. also enumerated
     2. if you like
 - [ ] yet to be done
 - [X] item which is done

 : Simple pre-formatted text such as for source code.
 : This also respects the line breaks. *bold* is not bold here.	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

And yes, for the people with advanced syntax in mind, this is not everything. Just the basics. A common objection is that source code needs a begin and an end marker instead of a string prefix like <code>: </code> and Org mode is providing this as well:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> #+BEGIN_SRC python
 myresult = 42 * 23
 print('Hello Europe! ' + str(myresult))
 #+END_SRC	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

I've seen many coworkers who typed Org mode markup when taking notes in their text editor. And they did not even know anything about it. So it is that intuitive I'd say.

</p>

<p>

While I was learning Org mode, I did not even use a cheat-sheet for the syntax as I normally do. It was very natural for me to type Org mode right from the start.

</p>

<p>

Tables are a bit more complicated like in all other markup languages I know of:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> | My Column 1 | My Column 2 | Last Column |
 |-------------+-------------+-------------|
 |          42 | foo         | bar         |
 |          23 | baz         | abcdefg     |
 |-------------+-------------+-------------|
 |          65 |             |             |	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

You most probably won't type a table like this outside of Emacs. The manual alignment without tool-support is very tedious. But even here you are able to deliver a perfectly fine Org mode table by simply ignoring the alignment altogether:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> | My Column 1|My Column 2 | Last Column |
 |-
 | 42 | foo | bar|
 | 23 | baz | abcdefg|
 |-
 | 65 |||	  </pre>
    </div>

	  <header><h2>Org-Mode Is Standardized</h2></header>

<p>

This is an almost ridiculous argument because in my opinion a markup is of no use when it is not the same for tool A as for tool B.

</p>

<p>

However, there are markup languages that are different. For example the very widely used markup language named <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">Markdown</a> has many flavors to choose from:

</p>
<ul>
<li>the original writeup and implementation by John Gruber</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#Markdown_Extra">Markdown Extra</a></li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MultiMarkdown">MultiMarkdown</a></li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/">GitHub</a> Flavored Markdown</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown#CommonMark">CommonMark</a> which tries to standardize the Markdown standard (again)</li>
</ul>

<p>

<a href="https://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> lists six different Markdown flavors as output formats. This is an absolutely bad situation which foils the original idea behind lightweight markup languages. When some web service tells me that I can use "Markdown" for a text field, I have to dig deeper to find out which of those many different Markdown standards the web page is talking about. After this I will have to continue and look for a cheat-sheet of this dialect because nothing is more difficult to differentiate than multiple standards that are almost the same but not really the same. A usability hell. I get furious every time I have to enter this hell.

</p>

<p>

An additional notion is the lack of standardization of file extensions using Markdown syntax. I've seen <code>.md</code>, <code>.mkdn</code>, <code>.markdown</code> and even <code>.txt</code> (in Markdown).

</p>

<p>

With Org mode, life is easy. The snippet from the previous section explains all there is. Any tool that interprets Org mode accepts this simple and easy to remember syntax. The extension is always <code>.org</code>.

</p>

	  <header><h2>Org-Mode Is Consistent</h2></header>

<p>

Many lightweight markup languages do offer multiple ways of typing headings. There are basically three ways of defining headings:

</p>
<ol>
<li>Prefix headings</li>
<li>Pre- and postfix headings</li>
<li>Underlined headings</li>
</ol>

<p>

Here are some examples for each category:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> Prefix headings:

 # Heading 1
 ## Heading 2
 ### Heading 3

 Pre- and postfix headings:

 = Heading 1 =
 == Heading 2 ==
 === Heading 3 ===

 Underlined headings:

 Heading 1
 =========

 Heading 2
 ~~~~~~~~~

 Heading 3
 *********	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

I prefer the prefix heading style. Org mode use this as well with <code>*</code> as prefix characters. The more asterisks, the deeper the level of the heading is.

</p>

<p>

<b>Pre- and postfix headings</b> do offer bad usability. The user has manually synchronize the number of prefix character with the number of postfix characters. And it is totally unclear how something like <code>=<code> heading </code>==</code> with different numbers of pre/postfix characters is going to turn out when being interpreted.

</p>

<p>

And in case the user already used a markup language with simple prefix headings, it is not logical why there is the need for the postfix characters at all.

</p>

<p>

Even worse than this is the <b>underlined heading category</b>. The user is completely irritated for multiple reasons. Besides the tedious manual work to align the stupid heading characters with the heading title, it is not clear what characters must be used for those heading lines. If you've got a bigger document with different levels of headings you get confused which heading character stands for which heading level.

</p>

<p>

Are the tilde characters level one? Or was it the equals characters? And how about asterisks? Without a cheat-sheet, the occasional markup user is completely lost.

</p>

<p>

This gets even more worse: some markup languages let you choose your "order" of heading characters. This results in weird situations. For example one author is starting to write a reStructuredText document using her favorite heading syntax. A second author is joining in and has to analyze the document in order to know what heading syntax he must use.

</p>

<p>

In the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/emacs.html">reStructuredText mode of Emacs</a> you can find following function:

</p>

<blockquote>You can visualize the hierarchy of the section adornments in the
current buffer by invoking <code>rst-display-adornments-hierarchy</code>, bound
on <code>C-c C-a C-d</code>. A temporary buffer will appear with fake section
titles rendered in the style of the current document. This can be
useful when editing other people's documents to find out which section
adornments correspond to which levels.</blockquote>

<p>

Yes, you got it right, it is true: this function's only purpose is to generate a dummy-hierarchy of headings to visualize which markup has to be used for heading 1, which one for heading 2 and so forth just for this single document. What a bad design decision of the markup when you need such hacks just to know how a heading should look like in a markup even if you are familiar with in the first place.

</p>

<p>

Here is one more: some markup languages even allow <b>mixed heading styles</b>. You can use an underlined heading style for heading level 1, a prefix style for level 2, another underlining style for level 3 and so forth. Now the chaos is a perfect one.

</p>

<p>

Let's have a look at a different markup element: <b>external links</b>. As you already remember in Org mode, a link looks like this:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> [[http://Karl-Voit.at][my home page]]	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

The only difficult thing here is to remember that the URL is at the beginning and the description follows after the URL. Many markup languages do add additional and unnecessary levels of difficulties.

</p>

<p>

Here are some <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_markup_language#Link_syntax">examples from Wikipedia</a> and comments by me where a user might be irritated.

</p>

<p>

AsciiDoc:

</p>

	  

<p>

The form is simple but for complex URLs, the <code>[Text]</code> might look like being part of the URL itself. Not beautiful but at least something I could live with.

</p>

<p>

Markdown:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> [Text](http://example.com)
 [Text](http://example.com "Title")	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

Brackets or parentheses first? Why using different kind of markup characters in the first place like only brackets? Is the <code>Title</code> part of the URL? Why not part of <code>Text</code>? Very confusing design decisions from my point of view.

</p>

<p>

reStructuredText:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> `Text &lt;http://example.com/&gt;`_	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

Holy moly. This is some weird stuff. First, you have to grave accents <code>`</code> and not apostrophes <code>'</code>. Then what about the underscore character at the end? This is as complicated as you can define a simple URL. I'd even prefer the hard to type HTML version of linking. A disaster for something which has "lightweight" in its class name.

</p>

<p>

Even with the most basic formatting syntax, Markdown (I assume in all flavors of it) shows a high level of inconsistency:

</p>

	  <div>
	  <pre> _italic_, **bold**, `monospace`, ~~strikethrough~~	  </pre>
    </div>

<p>

Why is it that italic and monospace require only one character before and after the string in-between and others require two? It's …</p></article></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><article><p>My understanding of getting into a flow state (or “being in the zone”) was completely wrong.</p><p>Authors like Steve Kotler and Csíkszentmihályi describe achieving flow as a structural problem. To achieve flow we must match our skills to the challenges in front of us, they write. If the challenges are too easy, we’ll get bored, if too difficult, we’ll quit from frustration.</p><p>Start-up founders will speak of passion as the gateway to flow. If you’re passionate, you’ll dance into the office ready to get back to it. If you’re feeling resistance … well, maybe you’re not passionate or <a href="http://paulgraham.com/earnest.html">earnest</a> enough.</p><p>My personal day-to-day experiences are a stark disconnect from the popular descriptions of flow. I reliably find it irritating to sit down and start working. My mind wanders, opening up HackerNews, Reddit, and Youtube tabs to stave off the <a href="https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1337243673944334336">negative feelings</a>.</p><p>What I learned and want to share with you, dear reader, is the wisdom that <strong>irritation is a necessary starter to getting down to work</strong>. It’s completely normal to “not be into it” regardless of how passionate you are or how well the challenges are structured. The initial resistance is part of the process, not a sign of a defected process or defected you.</p><h2 id="why-oh-why">Why oh why?</h2><blockquote><p>TL;DR Noradrenaline</p></blockquote><p>Noradrenaline is one of the major brain chemicals that builds the initial resistance to getting things done. It’s the “alertness” neurotransmitter (fancy word for “chemical messenger”) that tells different systems in the brain to be at attention when we’re ready to do focused, hard work. The problem: it’s the same messenger that yells across our system when we’re triggering our <a href="https://learn.genetics.utah.edu/content/cells/fight_flight/">fight or flight response.</a></p><p>Evolutionarily speaking, fight or flight is effective because we want to escape the feeling of irritation. Racing heart rate, shortness of breath, paranoid alertness–the state of fight or flight is painful. Us humans, as pleasure-seeking monkeys,
would like to avoid pain as often as we can.</p><p>This very blog post is a month too late. I have it dated as November 11th but it’s December 13th today. One month later and I’m still writing this damn thing. I have excuses, believe me. Job interviews, interview prep, life, etc., but that’s all they are: excuses. What was most important to me was daily writing. But writing is hard and noradrenaline-fueled resistance makes it harder.</p><p>Noradrenaline, to repeat, performs double duty for both “getting down to work” and “escaping danger.” It’s the yin-yang that gives us the predicament of resisting productive work. Work that would be good for us in the long-term but painful in the short-term.</p><h2 id="okbut-why">OK…but why!?</h2><p>Why is noradrenaline necessary before hard work?</p><p>Dr. Huberman (neuroscientist and tenured professor in the Department of Neurobiology at Stanford Medicine) describes it as the necessary ingredient to neuroplasticity. It’s the combination of noradrenaline and another neurotransmitter, acetylcholine (the “focus” neurotransmitter), that triggers the process of “change” in our brain. The change will eventually make hard work easy because we’ll turn new knowledge from foreign and awkward to domestic and routine.</p><p>It goes like this:</p><ol><li>You’re at your desk, working hard on your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Things_First_(book)">important but not urgent project</a>.</li><li><strong>Noradrenaline</strong> starts transmitting through your brain to make you alert.</li><li><strong>Acetylcholine</strong> is released at the precise neurons that represent your subject of intense focus (a new concept you’re learning, a blog post you’re writing, etc.).</li><li><strong>Noradrenaline</strong> and <strong>acetylcholine</strong> work together to <strong>mark</strong> the relevant neurons for change.</li><li>The day ends, you go to bed, and during deep sleep your brain processes those marked neurons for change.

It pushes down our noradrenaline levels to give us more runway to do hard work. Our nervous system releases dopamine when we achieve small milestones or we <em>think</em> we’re on the right path. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27439375/">This is why laughter, for example, is effective in giving you a boost of energy</a>.</p><p><strong>Therefore, the trick to getting started and staying on track is to reward yourself for trying.</strong></p><p>It’s why short, manageable milestones are crucial to achieving long-term goals. This has been written about extensively from folks like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0813X2LFZ">Scott Adams</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1847941834">James Clear</a>. The idea is to lace your sessions of hard work with hits of dopamine.</p><p>Scott Adams, for example, encourages his couch-bound readers to start small and move just their pinky. Eventually, with enough body parts moving (small achievements), they’ll get off of the couch and thwart procrastination.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> Jerry Seinfeld encourage writers to create an end time to their daily writing sessions. He <a href="https://overcast.fm/+KebudJ124/33:31">admits</a> that it’s torture to have open ended writing sessions. “If you’re going to sit-down at a desk with a problem and do nothing else, you gotta get a reward for that. The reward is, the alarm goes off and you’re done. You get up and walk away and have some cookies and milk.”</p><p>My personal trick for getting the ball rolling is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro</a>. I don’t need multiple sessions, I just need the first one to get to my first dopamine hit and then I’m off to the races.</p><h2 id="what-if-theres-no-dopamine-hit">What if there’s no dopamine hit?</h2><p>We quit.</p><p>Dr. Huberman states noradrenaline as the underlying substrate for quitting. When our brain hits its limit of noradrenaline, <a href="https://youtu.be/SwQhKFMxmDY?t=3294">he describes</a>, “it shuts down cognitive control over [our] motor circuitry and we quit.”</p><p>All this to say, encourage your creative self. This post isn’t a panacea but visibility into the early resistance of the productive process. Willingness to show up everyday and get to work is a small miracle given the complexity of our internal systems. You must nurture effort, reward it and not blame yourself for a lack of passion, grit, or discipline.</p><p>Cheers.</p><section role="doc-endnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote"><p>Adams, Scott.

December 15, 2020 | https://unpleasantfacts.com/information-hazards-in-career-and-life | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://unpleasantfacts.com/information-hazards-in-career-and-life">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="post_body_1628185">
    
      <div><p>This site was named after the idea that we need to face
unpleasant facts. In some ways, it is named after a quote from George Orwellâ€™s<a href="https://www.orwellfoundation.com/the-orwell-foundation/orwell/essays-and-other-works/why-i-write/">
Why I Write</a>.</p>

<p><i>â€œI knew that I had a facility with words and a power of
facing unpleasant facts, and I felt that this created a sort of private world
in which I could get my own back for my failure in everyday life.â€�</i></p>

<p>Now, I lack Orwellâ€™s facility with words, but I have always
thought that my ability to face and discuss unpleasant facts as an asset. After
encountering <a href="https://www.nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf">Nick
Bostromâ€™s work on information hazards</a>, I am less certain that this is the
case. According to Bostrom, an information hazard is:</p>

<p><i>A risk that arises from the dissemination or the
potential dissemination of (true) information that may cause harm or enable
some agent to cause harm</i></p>

<p>One basic example of this dynamic is that once people know
that nuclear bombs or certain bioweapons are possible, some agents who might
cause harm might figure out how to make these for themselves. For the world at
large, the advancement of science and spread of scientific knowledge is not
always good like we assume it is.</p>

<p>Bostromâ€™s paper does a good job categorizing different types
of hazards, but I want to focus on how individuals might use the concept of
information hazards. An example of a potential information hazard is if a
person would be much happier never knowing their partner cheated on them. It is
only an information hazard if they could have lived their life happily having
never known that their partner was unfaithful. If they would have found out eventually
when other people laughed at them for it, or if they got an STD, genetically
tested their children, or if their partner then leaves them for their mistress
then the revelation is just getting bad news earlier and giving the person more
time to adjust for it, which is not an information hazard.</p>

<p>On an individual level, one way to frame this is the classic
Matrix dilemma, where Morpheus asks Neo if he wants to take the red pill and
see reality for what it is or take the blue pill and go back to believing
everything is normal. Many people immediately think the red pill is the obvious
option, but after taking the red pill they can no longer relate to their
previous friends. And worse, having taken the red pill Neo made enemies of immensely
powerful people.</p>

<p>Information hazards are not necessarily about red vs blue,
as taking the red pill might give you superpowers. But sometimes it is more
like a black pill that might give you a slightly more accurate understanding of
how the world works but saps your motivation to effectively navigate it.</p>

<p>Social media is a way information hazards get spread in the
world. One example that applies to everyone who uses social media: We know
intellectually that people have horrible views. But in todayâ€™s world, more and
more people are saying offensive things in ways that can spread online. When a partisan
commentator is highlighting how some random person on the other team is
saying ridiculous thing about the world, a practice often referred to as nut-picking,
their partisan fans become less inclined to interact in good faith with anyone
on the other side. Everyone is worse off because they were exposed to true but unrepresentative information about how some people see the world.</p><p>It might be helpful to think through a few more scenarios.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge that makes you unpopular</i></p>

<p>One type of knowledge that is often more than useless is
knowledge that makes you unpopular. It might be fun to be the one to tell your
classmates that Santa Claus is not real, but they will not like you for it.
Similarly, knowing something is false when your colleagues ardently believe in
it can be dangerous for anyone with a predisposition for correcting others.</p>

<p><i>An accurate vision of a future point in time without
considering the paths that will lead there</i>.</p>

<p>There have been many economic bubbles, and not participating
early on has always been the wrong choice from a financial perspective.</p>

<p>Imagine a situation where people are getting excited about a
technology, but the pessimist who is interested in the area knows that it will
not be viable for another decade while others in the field insist that success
is a couple years around the corner. If they decide not to join or invest in a
group of otherwise very smart people working on this problem, they will miss
out on working with people at the cutting edge of what they are doing. And
their business venture might still be a success if they can convince someone
else to buy their company, whether it is public market investors or a CEO who wants
their company to have exposure to the cool new technology. They could buy it
early on even if numbers do not add up. And the pessimist could have been right
about the timeline and the fundamental economics but still miss out massively
by not joining that initial team. </p>

<p><i>Knowing that a problem is really hard</i></p>

<p>Similarly, industry insiders often miss out on new ideas
that remake their industry because they are too aware of the little details
that new solutions do not address. Knowing other details, they fail to appreciate
what can be built on top of new technologies.</p>

<p><i>Understanding that what they are doing is not helping the
world (or their customers).</i></p>

<p>It is debatable as to whether this is a true information
hazard for the world at large. But from an organizationâ€™s or individualâ€™s
perspective, if they or their employees switch from believing they are helping the world towards
believing they are a negative force then morale will take a hit and there will
be less productivity. Like bad news about infidelity, this is not an
information hazard if there are effective paths that resolve the issues. But if an
employee is naÃ¯ve enough to put information about the problems into an email,
it could later be used as evidence against the company.</p>

<p>Googleâ€™s quest to keep all mention of antitrust related
phrases out of any written communications is an example where explicit knowledge
of market dominance is effectively an information hazard.</p>

<p><i>When team members understand that they are not aligned
with the firm.</i></p>

<p>Many organizations have incentives set up that allow for abuse by clever employees.
When people understand these mismatching incentives, the organization can suffer. If one of
the employees notices a misalignment and does
not think before they point it out publicly, they might not be helping the company or themselves. Now other
employees might be tempted to take advantage of the loophole and some people in management might resent them for bringing up the issue in the first place when things weren't broken before they mentioned the problem.</p>

<p><i>Complete knowledge of costs, incomplete knowledge of
communication norms</i></p>

<p>Letâ€™s say that a project manager knows certain types of
projects run into cost overruns, and they incorporate those projections into their
presentation. First, the project will look expensive compared others. Second,
the observers might not give them credit for incorporating the overruns ahead
of time and might add an additional premium on top of their estimates, making the
project look even worse in comparison. The project manager suffers if they acknowledge the true costs ahead of time. From a societal perspective, it might be beneficial if a few less boondoggle high speed rail type projects get started under extremely rosy projections, but the people working on the project will hurt their careers if accurate information about the project's actual costs become widely known ahead of time.</p>

<p><i>Knowledge that a person acted badly towards someone else</i></p>

<p>Knowing that another person treated someone badly is another
type of information that is sometimes protective but can also backfire. People
are already subject to fundamental attribution error where they ignore the
situational factors when judging otherâ€™s behavior. And if the person who did
something questionable is in their life regardless as part of their social
circle or exists in their business world, then it would be better not to hear
about a one-off instance of bad behavior unless it is likely that the bad
behavior is persistent or extreme enough to be worth noting.</p>

<p><i>Information about who is to blame during a crisis</i></p>

<p>Figuring out who to blame can backfire if everyone is going
to remain on the team and will be working to fix things together for the time
being. If there is a big leak in the boat, finding clues about who caused the
leak is a distraction to the main goal of bailing out the water and plugging
the hole. If two parents leave their child at the mall, understanding who was
supposed to bring them home does not help. Only after the crisis is solved is
information about who is at fault not likely to do more harm than good. Like
other types of potential information hazards, this only holds true to the
extent that the person at fault is not an active saboteur. (Or in the parent
analogy, itâ€™s possible that proof that one parent was at fault allows them to
stop fighting and focus on solving the problem)</p>

<p><i>General Solutions for personal information hazards:
Optimism, Social Grace and Esotericism</i></p>

<p>One confusing fact that the existence of personal information hazards help solve is how pessimists are generally more accurate than optimists, but
optimists succeed more often. About the only career in which pessimists do
better is law, where understanding downside scenarios is particularly valued. Developing
a bias towards optimism helps avoid focusing on information hazards that are more
likely to bring you or other people down.</p>

<p>One aspect of social grace is developing a habit of not
spewing out low-grade information hazards to people. If that is too difficult
for some people, and I can relate, then being a little bit more esoteric in
your speech and writings might be an alternative solution.</p>

<p>Knowledge in any amount can sometimes be a dangerous thing.
But thinking through some of these dynamics can …</p></div></div></div>

These are the first services available from Expo Application Services (EAS), our new cloud services.</p><h2 id="233e">Feature Preview</h2><p id="1abe">EAS Build is a new service that takes everything good about the Expo build service (<code>expo build:[ios|android]</code>) and makes it available to all React Native apps. You can set your app up to build for distribution in minutes or even less, thanks to <a href="https://docs.expo.io/app-signing/managed-credentials/" rel="noopener">automatically managed app signing credentials</a> and defaults that <em>just work</em> for most Expo and React Native apps.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Terminal window running EAS Build in order to configure a new project, generate a keystore, and start a build." src="https://miro.medium.com/max/2304/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png" width="1152" height="684" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*Yfou6wa_fi05Ps8anXeJBA.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>In this screenshot, we go from a brand new project to release build running on EAS Build in 30 seconds.</figcaption></figure><p id="83b0">We’ve also added support for “<a href="https://docs.expo.io/build/internal-distribution/" rel="noopener">internal distribution</a>” — a feature that makes it easy for you to share test builds with colleagues and friends without going through an app store, by using <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/iosbuild-with-adhoc-provision-profile" rel="noopener">ad hoc provisioning</a> on iOS and standard APK side-loading on Android. Generating and updating the ad hoc provisioning profile can be handled entirely for you by EAS Build.</p><figure><div role="button" tabindex="0"><div><div><p><img alt="Image for post" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/7148/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png" width="3574" height="1018" srcset="https://miro.medium.com/max/552/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png 276w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1104/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png 552w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1280/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png 640w, https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png 700w" sizes="700px" data-old-src="https://miro.medium.com/max/60/1*9sydz-IelPB7FDMBSgRpwg.png?q=20"></p></div></div></div><figcaption>Easily share builds with your team using “<a href="https://docs.expo.io/build/internal-distribution/" rel="noopener">internal distribution”</a>.</figcaption></figure><p id="2d9a">EAS Build <em>currently</em> works best with bare React Native apps. If you use the Expo managed workflow and end up needing to move to the bare workflow, you can transition seamlessly to EAS Build — just run <code>eas build</code> instead of <code>expo build</code> after ejecting.</p><h2 id="7c43">Coming later in 2021: full support for Expo managed workflow</h2><p id="608d">With EAS Build, you can include libraries with native code that aren’t part of the Expo standard library. For many of you, the Expo managed workflow is nearly a perfect fit — except for that one piece of functionality you absolutely have to have in your app, but that isn’t part of the Expo standard library (whether that’s <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/in-app-purchases" rel="noopener">IAP</a> support, <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/webrtc" rel="noopener">WebRTC</a>, <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/bluetooth-api" rel="noopener">Bluetooth</a>, or something more <a href="https://expo.canny.io/feature-requests/p/data-over-sound" rel="noopener">esoteric</a>).</p><p id="9e41">EAS Build will let you use any compatible library from GitHub or npm or that you write yourself, even if it has native code in it.</p><p id="c8c2">EAS Build also lets you build smaller, stripped-down binaries that include only the code your application needs, which means <a href="https://github.com/expo/fyi/blob/master/managed-app-size.md" rel="noopener">a smaller install size for your users</a>.</p><p id="339b">There’s already early support for Expo managed apps in EAS Build in the preview, but it’s not quite ready for production yet. There’s also a big missing piece: how do you get a new version of your Expo development client app that includes your bespoke native runtime? We’re working on this, and we’ll have answers for you in the coming months.</p><p id="a288">These are some of the most common requests we hear from Expo developers today, so we’re extremely excited to be close to getting a solution into your hands.</p><h2 id="8c79">Feature Preview</h2><p id="40a1">When you want to put your app into the App Store and Play Store, you can use a single command from your terminal or from CI to submit it.</p><p id="c0ac">When you run <code>eas submit</code>, your app binary will be uploaded to EAS and then submitted to the respective app store from there. This means fewer dependencies to install on your machine, and that you can submit your apps from your Windows, Linux, or macOS computer to any app store.</p><p id="1d7c">We guide you through your first submission and try to make your <em>n</em>th submission as easy as possible by catching common mistakes and giving you guidance on how to resolve them. For example, if you’re missing a privacy policy, <a href="https://expo.fyi/missing-privacy-policy" rel="noopener">we have an FYI for that</a>.</p><p id="4905"><strong><em>Expo</em></strong> is the open source project, and <strong><em>Expo Application Services</em></strong> offers hosted cloud services built for both Expo and React Native.</p><p id="6d1f"><strong>You won’t need EAS to use Expo, </strong>which will always be open source and free. You can choose a different CI/CD service or use your own hardware.</p><p id="0569">Likewise, <strong>you’ll be able to take advantage of EAS with any React Native project, whether or not it uses Expo’s open source tools</strong>. EAS is designed for developers who specifically want their builds, updates and/or other parts of their app operations, development and collaboration workflows streamlined by a cloud service designed purposefully for and deeply integrated with React Native and Expo.</p><p id="ea39">We don’t want to disrupt anyone who is counting on Expo services to make software, and so we’ll continue to operate the existing build, update, and notification services indefinitely. So, if you’re happy with the way you’re using those services now, you don’t need to do anything differently and you can continue using them.</p><p id="84cc">To reduce confusion with EAS versions of the services, we’re going to start calling the existing free services the “Classic” Expo services. So, “Classic” Build, Updates, and Notifications.</p><p id="a6f7">That said, EAS is where most of our investment and effort on the services side will go in the future, so you should expect to see each EAS service keep getting better, more powerful, and easier to use as time goes on. Keep an eye out for the EAS Update preview, launching in early 2021.</p><p id="c6cd">We’ll always maintain a free tier that can meet the needs of individual and hobbyist developers building small apps. We’ll announce further pricing details closer to the date when EAS services graduate from preview in 2021.</p><p id="be36">If you’re currently paying for Expo Developer Services, we’ve automatically updated your plan to EAS Priority Plan. EAS Priority will have the same price point and feature set as your old Developer Services plan, plus preview access to EAS Build and Submit. You don’t need to do anything: you’ll be moved over automatically.</p><p id="7bc9">The previews of EAS Build and Submit are available to developers subscribed to the <a href="https://expo.io/pricing" rel="noopener">EAS Priority Plan</a>. If you’re not yet a subscriber, <a href="https://expo.io/pricing" rel="noopener">you can try it out for free for a month</a>. If you want to try the preview services out but don’t have access to a credit card, please reach out to us <a href="https://www.twitter.com/expo" rel="noopener">on Twitter</a> and we can help you out.</p><p id="9298">Once you’re signed up, you can find everything that you need to know in the <a href="https://docs.expo.io/eas" rel="noopener">Feature Preview documentation</a>.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When I first started to learn to code, I didn't struggle much trying to figure out what programming language to learn. This was mainly because I knew exactly what I needed to learn at that time. I knew for sure that I love websites, and I would like one day to be able to make a beautiful website or web app by myself. The next step was for me was to google <a href="https://monalidor.com/design-and-build-your-first-website-from-scratch-for-complete-beginners/">how to make a website</a> or which languages and tools will allow me to do that?</p><p>Luckily I didn't jump much from one programming language to another. After a simple research, I knew for sure I needed to know HTML (A markup language), CSS (A stylesheet language), and JavaScript (A programming language). Now HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are not your typical programming languages though they are both used to create websites.</p><p>So I would say my first programming language was JavaScript, that was apart from Java which I learned at school in my <a href="https://monalidor.com/computer-science-degree-is-it-worthy-it/">Computer Science degree</a>. I obviously hated Java because it didn't have much to offer me as far as creating websites was concerned. When I continued learning how to design and develop websites I found out that even JavaScript is not needed that much and that only HTML and CSS were enough if you know what you're doing. So my focus was heavily on HTML and CSS in the early beginnings.</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---HTML-and-CSS-logo.png" alt="HTML and CSS logo" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Monalidor---HTML-and-CSS-logo.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Monalidor---HTML-and-CSS-logo.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Monalidor---HTML-and-CSS-logo.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---HTML-and-CSS-logo.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>HTML and CSS logo</figcaption></figure><p>Now, <em>you </em>might be in a different situation, maybe you're a high school student or a college student or just someone who is curious about programming and you're wondering what programming language should you pick. You might have heard already about these programming languages like Java, JavaScript, Ruby, C# (Pronounced as C-Sharp), C++ (C plus plus), PHP, C (Plain C), Python, Objective C, etc. And now you're wondering, <em>God! I wanna know how to program which language should I pick?</em> </p><p>I hope by the end of this blog post you will know which programming language to pick.</p><p>First things first, people normally don't just say they wanna know how to program, oh! maybe they do. But what is actually in the back of their minds when they say "I wanna know how to code" is something like this – (Or and by the way, coding and programming is pretty much the same thing) :</p><ul><li>I wanna know how to make websites</li><li>I wanna know how to make iOS (iPhone) apps</li><li>I wanna know how to make Android apps</li><li>I wanna get a job at Google or Apple as a Software Engineer</li><li>I wanna get a good-paying job — &nbsp;and most good-paying jobs require that I know how to code</li><li>I wanna be able to make a program or software that will do so and so</li><li>I wanna make a computer game</li><li>etc. etc.</li></ul><p>Maybe some of those might be an exaggeration, but a majority of people who are first-time learners will fall under one of those groups. So which group are you? </p><p>What is your WHY to learn how to code?</p><p>That should be the first question you ask yourself. And once you know the answer what follows is easy. And that will exactly be the focus of my blog post. What is your why? What do you want to become? What's your end goal after learning to code? So here it goes:</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---JavaScript-Logo.png" alt="JavaScript Logo" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Monalidor---JavaScript-Logo.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Monalidor---JavaScript-Logo.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Monalidor---JavaScript-Logo.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---JavaScript-Logo.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>JavaScript Logo</figcaption></figure><h2 id="1-i-want-to-be-a-web-designer-or-a-web-developer-i-wanna-know-how-to-make-websites-">1. I want to be a web designer or a web developer (I wanna know how to make websites)</h2><p>If the statement above is true, look no further. This is exactly what you need to learn. First and for most you need to learn HTML and CSS. Once you're confident on those then you can move to JavaScript, which is a programming language. Depending on your speed and pace, that might take maybe a few months or even a year or so...and that's okay. You should take learning to code at your own pace. I would actually advise not to touch JavaScript at all until you have built at least two or three websites by yourself with just HTML and CSS - those two tools can be super powerful!</p><p><strong>JavaScript </strong>is one of the easiest programming languages to learn, at least most people would say so. This language is so popular and it was made for the web. Remember when I said about using the right tool for the job? Maybe I didn't. Anyway, this is exactly what I mean...Use or Learn a specific language for what it was intended for.</p><p>A bit of history...</p><p> JavaScript was created by <em>Brendan Eich</em> in 1995. And please don't let the name confuse you, JavaScript has nothing to do with Java, another programming language you will learn about. If you're wondering why was it was named JavaScript, it was mainly because Java was already big name at the time, so they named it JavaScript so that people could acknowledge it and start talking about it. Here is what Mr. Brandan Eich has to say <em>"<a href="https://twitter.com/BrendanEich/status/1325903379982217216">Yes, it was a marketing ploy</a>. Bad one too, but not my call. ...Not unrelated, marketing has consequences..."</em> </p><p>Eich then goes on explaining that as a result JavaScript had to be made to have similar things like Java...but I won't go deep on that. As of right now just know that JavaScript and Java are different programming languages.</p><p>Continue reading if you love websites because JavaScript as you gonna find out is not the only language used on the web. And if you wanna be able to make both websites and web application then languages like Ruby, C#, PHP, Python and their frameworks might be something of interest to you. I have explained about those languages down below.</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Swift-Logo.png" alt="Swift Logo" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Monalidor---Swift-Logo.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Monalidor---Swift-Logo.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Monalidor---Swift-Logo.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Swift-Logo.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Swift Logo</figcaption></figure><h2 id="2-i-wanna-know-how-to-make-ios-iphone-apps-be-an-ios-developer-">2. I wanna know how to make iOS (iPhone) apps (be an iOS developer)</h2><p>Good! If that's what you want to be able to do as the result of you knowing how to code. I would say with 100% confidence that you should learn <strong>Swift</strong>! Yes! Swift is a programming language that was designed and developed by Apple. Swift was first announced in 2014, so in this list, Swift is probably the youngest language. And in case you're wondering, before Swift Apple was building their apps using a language called Objective-C. So they kinda abandoned (maybe not completely) Objective-C and start developing their apps with Swift.</p><p>That was easy, right? You wanna be an Apple developer, Swift is your guy!</p><h2 id="3-i-wanna-know-how-to-make-android-apps-android-developer-">3. I wanna know how to make Android apps (Android Developer)</h2><p>Great! If you wanna be able to develop applications on the popular Android platform then you should learn JAVA. Java is a very popular and powerful programming language, actually, it's uses go way over just developing Android applications. Java can be used in software development, video game development and even to create desktop apps for your computer. </p><p>The language was created in 1995 by James Gosling. Gosling first named the language Oak because of an oak tree that was outside his office. Later on, they found out that there was a company called Oak Technologies and they had to forgo the name. </p><p>In the search for new names, so many names were suggested that could not work out...and as a joke one of the members of the team mentioned Java as one of those names that wouldn't work. As it turns out they used to drink Peet's Java and it was right in front of them during the brainstorming process. Then they sent about 10 names or so to their lawyers, and <a href="https://www.infoworld.com/article/2077265/so-why-did-they-decide-to-call-it-java-.html">Java was mysteriously chosen</a>.</p><p>Not much to say about Java honestly, the language really kicked my ass when I started learning how to program...so it's definitely not the easiest language to learn but also not necessarily the hardest. Good luck!</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Java-Logo.png" alt="Java Logo" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Monalidor---Java-Logo.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Monalidor---Java-Logo.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Monalidor---Java-Logo.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Java-Logo.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Java Logo</figcaption></figure><h2 id="4-i-wanna-get-a-job-at-google-or-apple-as-a-software-engineer">4. I wanna get a job at Google or Apple as a Software Engineer</h2><p>Awesome! If your goal is to get a job in any of the big tech companies...then you can easily pick a language to learn. You won't be confined by anything really other than that company's choice of programming language and also what you will be doing day to day in your position. </p><p>If you fall under this category it might be beneficial to look at the tech stack (a collection of technologies, tools, programming languages, etc.) used by that specific company. Also, a big tech company normally has a lot of products, and their different lines of products might use different tools and languages. Here I advise you, to pick any of the major programming languages used by the company.</p><p>The good thing is that some big-tech companies have got their own programming languages. For example, if you wanna work for <em>Microsoft </em>then <strong>C#</strong> will be a good choice for you to learn. If you wanna work for <em>Apple</em>, pick <strong>Swift</strong>. And if you wanna work for <em>Google</em>, maybe pick <strong>Go</strong> programming language, which is sometimes called <strong>Golang</strong>.</p><p>If the company you wanna work for don't have their own programming language. I would urge you to do a quick Google search and you will find out right away what programming language they use. Something like <em>"Which programming language is used at [put your company here]"</em> …And don't be surprised when more than one programming language appears because most companies use all these programming languages for different purposes.</p><figure><img src="https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Python.png" alt="Python Logo" srcset="https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Monalidor---Python.png 600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Monalidor---Python.png 1000w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Monalidor---Python.png 1600w, https://monalidor.com/content/images/2020/12/Monalidor---Python.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Python Logo</figcaption></figure><h2 id="5-i-wanna-get-a-good-paying-job-and-most-good-paying-jobs-require-that-i-know-how-to-code">5. I wanna get a good-paying job — &nbsp;and most good-paying jobs require that I know how to code</h2><p>Beautiful! A career in programming can be so lucrative especially if you get a job in a big tech company.</p><p>If you fall under this group, your choices are also kinda unlimited. I would say pick any of the top three languages and you should be fine. Being in this group means you really don't care much about the tool itself for the job (a programming language), you're just interested in what it will allow you to do...get a good job.</p><p>The following programming languages are both popular and said to pay a lot: <strong>Java</strong>, <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>C#</strong>, <strong>C++ </strong>and maybe a few others. It's important to know also here that the highest-paying programming languages might not necessarily be the most popular. And also it depends on the specific company, location and how strong your skillset is.</p><p>Sometimes it's all about supply and demand, there are some niche programming languages...and because of how scarce the talent pool is...the companies may be willing to pay a lot of money. However, that might also mean that there are not enough jobs for that specific language. </p><p>So I would think twice before picking COBOL as a programming language just because I saw some government agency is paying a lot of money for COBOL developers. You might easily find yourself out of the job market …</p></div></div>

<p>
	It’s so funny when I hear people being so protective of ideas.
	People who want me to sign an NDA to tell me the simplest idea.
</p><p>
	To me, ideas are worth nothing unless executed.
	They are just a multiplier.
	Execution is worth millions.
</p><p>
	Explanation:
</p>
<table>
<tbody><tr><td>
	AWFUL IDEA
</td><td>= -1</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	WEAK IDEA
</td><td>= 1</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	SO-SO IDEA
</td><td>= 5</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	GOOD IDEA
</td><td>= 10</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	GREAT IDEA
</td><td>= 15</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	BRILLIANT IDEA
</td><td>= 20</td></tr>
<tr><td>--------</td><td>---------</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	NO EXECUTION
</td><td>= $1</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	WEAK EXECUTION
</td><td>= $1000</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	SO-SO EXECUTION
</td><td>= $10,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	GOOD EXECUTION
</td><td>= $100,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	GREAT EXECUTION
</td><td>= $1,000,000</td></tr>
<tr><td>
	BRILLIANT EXECUTION
</td><td>= $10,000,000</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>
<strong>
	To make a business, you need to multiply the two.
</strong>
</p><p>
	The most brilliant idea, with no execution, is worth $20.
</p><p>
	The most brilliant idea takes great execution to be worth $20,000,000.
</p><p>
	That’s why I don’t want to hear people’s ideas.
</p><p>
	I’m not interested until I see their execution.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><img src="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/building-and-testing-50-ui-states-with-decision-tables/images/featured.png"><figcaption><p>Illustration: Hachibu</p></figcaption></figure><h4 id="introduction">Introduction</h4><p>Decision tables are a useful tool for modeling complex logic. And when you’re
building user interfaces, things can get very complicated – e.g., show a pop-up
every other Monday between Midnight UTC+5:30 and Noon UTC+12:45 to trial
customers born on a Leap Year.</p><p>In this post, I’m going tell you a story about how I lost my cool trying to
build and test 50 different UI states and how decision tables saved my project.
By the end of this post, you’ll have a problem solving tool that is
generalizable across other programming domains besides UI programming.</p><h4 id="what-are-decision-tables">What Are Decision Tables?</h4><p>Decision tables are a visual way to map conditions to outcomes in a tabular
format. Organizing information in a tabular format is nothing new. For example,
Boolean Algebra uses truth tables to map inputs to outputs for logical
operations such as AND and OR.</p><table><thead><tr><th><code>AND (&amp;&amp;)</code></th><th>False</th><th>True</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>False</strong></td><td>False</td><td>False</td></tr><tr><td><strong>True</strong></td><td>False</td><td>True</td></tr></tbody></table><table><thead><tr><th><code>OR (||)</code></th><th>False</th><th>True</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>False</strong></td><td>False</td><td>True</td></tr><tr><td><strong>True</strong></td><td>True</td><td>True</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Since it’s just a table, you get all of the benefits associated with organizing
your information in a tabular format.</p><ul><li>Missing outcomes are visibly obvious so you’re forced to immediately address
any gaps in your logic and ensure that you’ve considered every case.</li><li>They can be used as a design document when communicating with your peers; a
reference when you’re writing code; and a complete specification when you’re
testing code.</li></ul><h4 id="the-setup">The Setup</h4><p>This story took place at a SaaS startup that helped its customers collect and
manage product feedback. They also had a Machine Learning algorithm that could
automatically categorize feedback by topic and sentiment. For example, the
feedback “Constant rendering issues” would be tagged with “BUGS” and given a
negative sentiment by the ML algorithm. Customers could also create their own
tags to match specific words and phrases. These were called text match tags.</p><p>I was teamed up with a designer and a backend engineer to add 2 checkboxes to
the UI which would allow customers to add tighter constraints to their text
match tags. The goal of this feature was to improve the results of text match
tags by letting customers define rules around how their tags would be applied to
feedback. These 2 checkboxes would allow text match tags to be aware of more
information like feedback metadata such as filters and the tags that were
applied by the ML algorithm.</p><p><a href="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/building-and-testing-50-ui-states-with-decision-tables/images/ui-screenshot.png"><img src="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/building-and-testing-50-ui-states-with-decision-tables/images/ui-screenshot.png"></a></p><h4 id="the-confrontation">The Confrontation</h4><p>This project appeared to be straight-forward. I just had to build and connect 2
checkboxes. What could be easier? So, I just started coding, and I opened a pull
request for code review shortly thereafter. It wasn’t until I entered QA testing
in our staging environment that my troubles began.</p><p>Every time my code got reviewed, my teammates would keep finding new bugs and
regressions. This went on for days as I attempted to brute-force my way through
the project. I knew that I didn’t have a complete understanding of what I was
supposed to be building, but I soldiered on out of desperation.</p><p>My frustration was growing, and I could sense that I was approaching my limit.
So, I put the project on pause so I could sleep on it. After sleeping on it, I
came to the realization that there were too many states for me to keep track of.
I would need to write down and enumerate every single state so that I could
confidently implement and test this feature.</p><p>Each hide or show decision relied on the value of 2 variables: the parent tag
mode and the child tag mode. This reminded me of something I had studied years
ago while implementing logic gate functions: Boolean Algebra Truth Tables. With
truth tables in mind, I eventually stumbled upon decision tables. Working
together with the backend engineer for this project, we created the following
decision tables.</p><p><a href="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/building-and-testing-50-ui-states-with-decision-tables/images/spreadsheet-1.png"><img src="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/building-and-testing-50-ui-states-with-decision-tables/images/spreadsheet-1.png"></a>
<a href="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/building-and-testing-50-ui-states-with-decision-tables/images/spreadsheet-2.png"><img src="https://hachibu.net/posts/2020/building-and-testing-50-ui-states-with-decision-tables/images/spreadsheet-2.png"></a></p><p>Once we finished the decision tables, I breathed a sigh of relief because all of
the logic was now crystal clear. But I was also shocked to discover that this
seemingly simple feature had 50 different UI states. A parent tag has 5 options,
and a child tag has 5 options. So each checkbox has 5 * 5 combinations: 25
states. And with 2 checkboxes, that’s 25 + 25 combinations: 50 total states.</p><h4 id="the-resolution">The Resolution</h4><p>I was finally ready to start programming but first I would need to decide how to
translate a decision table into a data structure. Building your programs around
well designed data structures is very important, which reminds me of a quote by
Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux and Git).</p><blockquote><p>git actually has a simple design, with stable and reasonably well-documented
data structures. In fact, I'm a huge proponent of designing your code around
the data, rather than the other way around, and I think it's one of the
reasons git has been fairly successful […] I will, in fact, claim that the
difference between a bad programmer and a good one is whether he considers his
code or his data structures more important.</p></blockquote><p>What kind of data structure could represent a table? Given that a table is
comprised of rows and columns, it seemed obvious to use a 2-dimensional data
structure like an array of arrays or a map of maps.</p><p>I chose a map of maps, because it would allow me to get my answer quickly by
2-dimensionally indexing on parent tag mode and child tag mode. The outer map
would represent the rows which are the parent tag modes; the inner map would
represent the columns which are the child tag modes; and the cells would
represent the hide or show decision as a boolean.</p><p>The following code is written in TypeScript which should seem familiar to you
if you’ve written JavaScript before. That’s because the syntax of TypeScript and
JavaScript are closely related. The biggest difference between TypeScript and
JavaScript is that the former layers additional syntax for types on top of the
latter.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>type</span> <span>TagMode</span> <span>=</span> <span>'none'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'manual'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'text_match'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'smart'</span> <span>|</span> <span>'managed'</span>

</code></pre></div><p>After adding those functions to the AngularJS controller for that page, all I
had to do was bind those functions to the HTML view. For that, AngularJS has a
built-in directive called <code>ng-show</code> which shows or hides an HTML element based
on an expression.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="html"><span>&lt;</span><span>div</span> <span>ng-show</span><span>=</span><span>"showFeedbackFilters(parentTag, childTag)"</span><span>&gt;</span>

testing. This time would be different. Decision tables in hand, the QA testers
were able to systematically reproduce each case and verify that the code was
behaving correctly. The code moved through QA testing quickly, and it was
deployed to production later that day.</p><p>Lastly, I think it’s worth mentioning that while finalizing this post months
after writing the original code, I realized that I could have written these two
functions as fairly simple one-liners. Even with the benefit of hindsight, I
don’t know which solution I prefer; I could make arguments for and against each
one, but that’s beyond the scope of this post.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="typescript"><span>function</span> <span>showUseFeedbackFilters</span><span>(</span><span>parent</span>: <span>Tag</span><span>,</span> <span>child</span>: <span>Tag</span><span>)</span><span>:</span> <span>boolean</span> <span>{</span>

</code></pre></div><h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>I wish I had known about decision tables earlier in my career. I’m a visual
learner and thinker and being able to visually map out states into a table would
have helped me out so much in the past. When you enumerate the states of your
program into a table, the logic becomes obvious and it can also be validated by
anyone on your team because tables are everywhere in daily life.</p></div></div>]]>

<p>The most productive and jelled teams I’ve seen tend to be the noisiest. The Slack channels for those teams are chaos.</p>



<p>The teams I’ve seen with the worst morale tend to be quiet. People on those teams don’t talk to each other often. They <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/17/zombie-standups-try-walking-the-board/">rattle off a standup update</a>, and they ask for help when they get blocked on something, and that’s it.</p>



<p>The book <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33517721-the-culture-code">The Culture Code</a> talks about a team’s “notification rate” in the context of airline pilots:</p>



<blockquote><p>The term pilots use to describe this type of short-burst communication is notifications. A notification is not an order or a command. It provides context, telling of something noticed, placing a spotlight on one discrete element of the world. </p><p>Notifications are the humblest and most primitive form of communication, the equivalent of a child’s finger-point: I see this. </p><p>Unlike commands, they carry unspoken questions: Do you agree? What else do you see? In a typical landing or takeoff, a proficient crew averages twenty notifications per minute.</p><cite>Daniel Coyle, The Culture Code</cite></blockquote>



<p>I love the simplicity: <em>you just say stuff</em>. Throw your random thoughts and observations in the chat room. You don’t have to filter out the stuff that isn’t useful to anyone else. Who are you to decide that anyway? You’re increasing the notification rate of the team, and that’s all the reason you need.</p>



<p>This is powerful in 2 ways:</p>



<p><strong>#1: It increases the possibility of <em>serendipitous moments</em>.</strong> Your coworker sees you’re working on X and says “Oh I looked into X last week and I noticed Y!” Or the reverse: you start working on X and you think “wait a second, didn’t someone say something about X in the chat last week?” </p>



<p>Standup is meant to do that kind of thing, but summarizing 8 hours of work into a 15 second update doesn’t provide enough granularity.</p>



<p><strong>#2: It makes a team feel more like a <em>team</em>.</strong> A team that doesn’t talk to each other <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/12/14/are-we-actually-a-team/">isn’t a team</a>. Constant communication helps teams become <em>teams</em> instead of some people who happen to be working from the same kanban board. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/11/10/death-to-just-add-water-team-jelling/">Trust is built slowly and steadily</a> and increasing notification rates help a lot.</p>



<p>I can hear you now: “<em>But that will be <a href="https://critter.blog/2019/09/05/the-chatodoro-breaking-the-group-chat-addiction/">so distracting</a>! People won’t get any work done! Important messages will be lost!</em>” </p>



<p>Instead of thinking of all the reasons why it will fail, <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/10/26/you-cant-fail-at-experiments/">try it out</a>. Take a team that doesn’t feel much like a team, and encourage everyone to start saying more. <a href="https://critter.blog/2020/08/12/stop-changing-start-experimenting/">Make it an experiment</a>, and lead by example. Keep it up for a couple months and see if people feel more comfortable and honest and vulnerable. See if the team feels more like a <em>team</em>.</p>

<p>Postgres allows you to define custom data types when the default types provided don't fit your needs. There are many situations where these custom data types come in handy.</p>
<p>For example, if you have multiple columns in several tables that should be an <code>int</code> between 0 and 255, you could use a custom data type so that you only have to define the constraints once. Or, if you have complex data - like metadata about a file - and you want to save it to a single column instead of spreading it across several, custom data types can help.</p>

<p>No matter how you decide to define your datatype, Django has the functionality to allow you to map custom column data to model attributes. You can achieve this by extending the Django <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/#django.db.models.Field">field class</a>. In this walkthrough, we'll see <strong>how to create custom types in Postgres</strong> and then use them in Django to <strong>ensure consistent data types across your application</strong>. We will do this by walking you through an <a href="https://github.com/pganalyze-resources/django-custom-data-types-example">example project</a>.</p>
<h2 id="custom-domains-in-postgres"><a href="#custom-domains-in-postgres" aria-label="custom domains in postgres permalink"></a>Custom Domains in Postgres</h2>
<p>There are several different kinds of custom data types in Postgres, including <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/datatype-enum.html">enums</a> and <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/rangetypes.html">range types</a>. The two we’ll use in our project today are called domain types and composite types. </p>
<p><strong>First</strong>, let’s take a look at <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createdomain.html">domain types</a>. Domains are a way of adding restrictions to an existing type so that it can be reused in columns across tables. They are particularly useful for columns like email addresses, phone numbers, or <a href="https://postgis.net/docs/stdaddr.html">street addresses</a>, where you might find yourself repeating the same checks over and over. A custom domain allows you to define those checks once and then reuse them making them easier to manage and maintain.</p>
<p>For our example project, we'll start by creating a custom data type that performs a check to ensure a string doesn't contain any spaces:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> DOMAIN string_no_spaces <span>as</span> <span>VARCHAR</span> <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>CHECK</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span> <span>!</span><span>~</span> <span>'\s'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can use this type on as many tables or in as many columns as we like. For example say we don’t want to allow spaces in user_names for a chat app:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> users <span>(</span>
  id <span>serial</span> <span>primary</span> <span>key</span><span>,</span> 
 user_name string_no_spaces
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now if you try to add a value with a space, Postgres will throw an error:</p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>INSERT INTO users(user_name) VALUES ('I am a      bad user name');
-- ERROR:  value for domain string_no_spaces violates check constraint "string_no_spaces_check"</code></pre></div>
<p>We can also reuse this domain in the definition of another domain. For example: </p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> DOMAIN email_with_check <span>AS</span> string_no_spaces <span>NOT</span> <span>NULL</span> <span>CHECK</span> <span>(</span><span>value</span> <span>~</span> <span>'@'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> email_addresses <span>(</span>
  user_id <span>integer</span><span>,</span>
  email email_with_check
<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> email_addresses<span>(</span>email<span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'josh @gmail.com'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>


<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> email_addresses<span>(</span>email<span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span> <span>(</span><span>'joshgmail.com'</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Here, we've created a new check to ensure an email contains <code>@</code> and we've used <code>string_no_spaces</code> as our base type. This allows us to inherit the no spaces check. Now data of datatype <code>email_with_check</code> must contain <code>@</code> and cannot contain spaces.</p>
<h2 id="composite-types-in-postgres"><a href="#composite-types-in-postgres" aria-label="composite types in postgres permalink"></a>Composite Types in Postgres</h2>
<p>The <strong>second</strong> kind of custom data type we’ll look at today is called a <a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtype.html">composite type</a>. A composite type is essentially a group of data that can be held in a single column. Composite types can be helpful if you have lists of data that you don't want to be spread over multiple columns. Perhaps this data only makes sense when grouped together like the <a href="https://til.hashrocket.com/posts/3693c7fc13-creating-custom-types-in-postgresql">dimensions of a package</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB_color_model">RGB color data</a> is another good example because it doesn't make much sense on its own - 255 is just an <code>int</code> - but coupled with some labels and two other numbers (<code>red: 255, green: 0, blue: 0</code>), it becomes the color red. Every time we access a color, we'll want to have all three of these values returned, so it saves us from having to query multiple columns for a group of data that is only meaningful when combined.</p>
<p>Let's start by creating a new RGB color value type:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TYPE</span> rgb_color_value <span>as</span> <span>(</span>
  red <span>integer</span><span>,</span>
  green <span>integer</span><span>,</span>
  blue <span>integer</span>
<span>)</span><span>;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we can create a new table and use both our domain and custom data type for the columns:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> colors <span>(</span>
  name string_no_spaces<span>,</span>
  rgb rgb_color_value
<span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>INSERT</span> <span>INTO</span> colors<span>(</span>name<span>,</span> rgb<span>)</span> <span>VALUES</span><span>(</span><span>'pink'</span><span>,</span> <span>(</span><span>252</span><span>,</span><span>15</span><span>,</span><span>192</span><span>)</span><span>)</span><span>;</span>

<span>SELECT</span> <span>*</span> <span>FROM</span> colors<span>;</span>

 name <span>|</span> rgb   

 pink <span>|</span> <span>(</span><span>252</span><span>,</span><span>15</span><span>,</span><span>192</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We can even access the individual values. For example, if all we want is the green value:</p>
<div data-language="sql"><pre><code><span>SELECT</span> <span>(</span>rgb<span>)</span><span>.</span>green <span>FROM</span> colors<span>;</span>

  green 
 
   <span>15</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="custom-types-in-django"><a href="#custom-types-in-django" aria-label="custom types in django permalink"></a>Custom Types in Django</h2>
<p>Let's use our <code>string_no_spaces</code> domain and our <code>rgb_color_value</code> composite type to create a Django model to define a color. <code>rgb_color_value</code> is going to take the most work, so we'll start there and then come back to <code>string_no_spaces</code>.</p>
<h3 id="registering-a-type-with-psycopg2"><a href="#registering-a-type-with-psycopg2" aria-label="registering a type with psycopg2 permalink"></a>Registering a type with psycopg2</h3>
<p>We'll use the <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/">pyscopg2</a> database adapter in this example. I won't go into how to set it up here, but I recommend <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-postgresql-with-your-django-application-on-ubuntu-14-04">this tutorial</a>. It does a good job covering the setup if you aren't familiar with it yet.</p>
<p>We'll need to start by <a href="https://www.psycopg.org/docs/extensions.html#psycopg2.extensions.register_adapter">registering and creating an adapter</a> for our new type so that psycopg2 knows how to handle it. After we register it, psycopg will return values from the database as a named tuple.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> connection
<span>from</span> psycopg2<span>.</span>extras <span>import</span> register_composite

Rgb <span>=</span> register_composite<span>(</span>
  <span>'rgb_color_value'</span><span>,</span>
  connection<span>.</span>cursor<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>cursor<span>,</span>
  globally<span>=</span><span>True</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>type</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The above code will handle data coming to our app from the database, but <strong>we'll also need to tell psycopg what to do with data sent to the database</strong>. That's where the adapter comes in:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> connection
<span>from</span> psycopg2<span>.</span>extras <span>import</span> register_composite
<span>from</span> psycopg2<span>.</span>extensions <span>import</span> register_adapter<span>,</span> adapt<span>,</span> AsIs

Rgb <span>=</span> register_composite<span>(</span>
  <span>'rgb_color_value'</span><span>,</span>
  connection<span>.</span>cursor<span>(</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>cursor<span>,</span>
  globally<span>=</span><span>True</span>
<span>)</span><span>.</span><span>type</span>

<span>def</span> <span>rgb_adapter</span><span>(</span>value<span>)</span><span>:</span>
  <span>return</span> AsIs<span>(</span><span>"(%s, %s, %s)::rgb_color_value"</span> <span>%</span> <span>(</span>

<p>Now that psycopg knows about our new data type and how to handle it, we can create the same functionality for Django. </p>
<h3 id="representing-composite-types-as-a-python-class"><a href="#representing-composite-types-as-a-python-class" aria-label="representing composite types as a python class permalink"></a>Representing composite types as a Python class</h3>
<p>We want to be able to do things with our objects like this: </p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code>rgb <span>=</span> Rgb<span>(</span><span>255</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>)</span>

my_color_object<span>.</span>rgb <span>=</span> rgb 

my_color_object<span>.</span>save<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>To do that, we'll need to start with a Python class that represents an RGB value.</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Rgb</span><span>:</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> red<span>,</span> green<span>,</span> blue<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        self<span>.</span>red <span>=</span> red
        self<span>.</span>green <span>=</span> green
        self<span>.</span>blue <span>=</span> blue</code></pre></div>
<p>We'll come back to this class in a bit, but first, we need to talk about fields.</p>
<h3 id="using-django-fields"><a href="#using-django-fields" aria-label="using django fields permalink"></a>Using Django fields</h3>
<p>You are probably familiar with many of <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/ref/models/fields/">Django's built-in model fields</a> like <code>models.CharField</code> or <code>models.IntegerField</code>. You've also probably noticed that many of these fields correspond to data types we often use in Postgres (<code>varchar</code>, <code>int</code> etc.). </p>
<p>For custom data types, Django allows us to create our fields and then use them in our models:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>from</span> django<span>.</span>db <span>import</span> models

<span>class</span> <span>RgbField</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Field<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    
    <span>def</span> <span>db_type</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> connection<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'rgb_color_value'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>All custom fields inherit from <code>models.Field</code>. You can also inherit from existing fields like <code>models.CharField</code> (which itself inherits from <code>models.Field</code>) This is helpful if your custom type behaves similarly to an existing type. Since ours doesn't, we'll inherit directly from <code>models.Field</code>. </p>
<p>Next, we need to override <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/custom-model-fields/#converting-values-to-python-objects">three methods</a> so that they will return instances of our <code>Rgb</code> class. The first, <code>from_db_value()</code> is called when data is loaded from the database. This is the method that will receive our named tuple we set up with Psycopg earlier. The second, <code>to_python()</code> gets called during deserialization. These two need to return an instance of the <code>Rgb</code> class. </p>
<p>The last method we need to override is <code>get_prep_value</code>, where we'll convert our <code>Rgb</code> object back into a tuple before handing it off to Psycopg to save to the database. When we're done, our field class should look like this:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>RgbField</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Field<span>)</span><span>:</span>
  
  <span>def</span> <span>from_db_value</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> value<span>,</span> expression<span>,</span> connection<span>)</span><span>:</span>
      <span>if</span> value <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
          <span>return</span> value
      <span>return</span> Rgb<span>(</span>value<span>.</span>red<span>,</span> value<span>.</span>green<span>,</span> value<span>.</span>blue<span>)</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>to_python</span><span>(</span><span>)</span><span>:</span>
      <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span>value<span>,</span> Rgb<span>)</span><span>:</span>
          <span>return</span> value

      <span>if</span> value <span>is</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
          <span>return</span> value

      <span>return</span> Rgb<span>(</span>value<span>.</span>red<span>,</span> value<span>.</span>green<span>,</span> value<span>.</span>blue<span>)</span>

  <span>def</span> <span>get_prep_value</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> value<span>)</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>(</span>value<span>.</span>red<span>,</span> value<span>.</span>green<span>,</span> value<span>.</span>blue<span>)</span>
  
  <span>def</span> <span>db_type</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> connection<span>)</span><span>:</span>
      <span>return</span> <span>'rgb_color_value'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The checks I put in place above are suggestions from the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/custom-model-fields/#converting-values-to-python-objects">Django docs</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, we can create our model using our brand new Rgb field:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Color</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Model<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    rgb <span>=</span> RgbField<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    name <span>=</span> models<span>.</span>CharField<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But wait! Didn't we create a special <code>string_no_spaces</code> domain that we want to use for the <code>name</code> attribute?</p>
<p>Since this type is just a string with checks at the database level, all we need to do is create the field with the appropriate <code>db_type</code> method:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>StringNoSpacesField</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Field<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    
    <span>def</span> <span>db_type</span><span>(</span>self<span>,</span> connection<span>)</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'string_no_spaces'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Now we can update our model and run our migrations:</p>
<div data-language="python"><pre><code><span>class</span> <span>Color</span><span>(</span>models<span>.</span>Model<span>)</span><span>:</span>
    rgb <span>=</span> RgbField<span>(</span><span>)</span>
    name <span>=</span> StringNoSpacesField<span>(</span><span>)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Let's confirm that everything is working as expected. In the python shell (I'm using <a href="https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/shell_plus.html">shell plus</a>), we'll create a new color:</p>
<div data-language="bash"><pre><code><span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> from colors.models <span>import</span> Rgb
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> rgb <span>=</span> Rgb<span>(</span><span>255</span>, <span>0</span>, <span>0</span><span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> c <span>=</span> Color.objects.create<span>(</span>name<span>=</span><span>'red'</span>, <span>rgb</span><span>=</span>rgb<span>)</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> c.rgb
<span>&lt;</span>colors.models.Rgb object at 0x104e3d6d<span><span>8</span>&gt;</span>
<span>&gt;&gt;</span><span>&gt;</span> c.rgb.red
<span>255</span></code></pre></div>
<p>If you try to create a color with a name that has a space in it, you will get an error like this: </p>
<div data-language="text"><pre><code>django.db.utils.IntegrityError: value for domain string_no_spaces violates check constraint "string_no_spaces_check"</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, let's check the database and make sure everything got saved as the correct type:</p>
<div data-language="psql"><pre><code>customdt=# SELECT pg_typeof(rgb), pg_typeof(name) FROM colors_color;
    pg_typeof | pg_typeof     
-----------------+------------------
 rgb_color_value | string_no_spaces
(1 row)</code></pre></div>
<p>From here, we could ensure that only numbers from 0 - 255 are entered by <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/howto/custom-model-fields/#writing-a-field-subclass">overriding the __ init __ </a> method and adding checks at the Postgres level. We could also create a new type for storing the hex code for …</p></div></div></div>

    </span></p><p>I did something different in 2020, and it's had a profound effect on my programming progress. Instead of detailed <em>quarterly</em> plans, I’ve been creating detailed <em>monthly</em> plans for my programming goals.</p><p>This one change has had such a positive outcome that I’ll do it again in 2021—and I encourage you to do the same.</p><p>I’ve set quarterly plans for my personal work for as long as I can remember. But in 2019, my plans were consistently foiled. I kept missing the quarterly goals that I set for myself.</p><p>In retrospect, that’s not too surprising because a quarter is actually a long time. So much can change. It’s really hard to anticipate what’s going to happen in three months. </p><p>That’s precisely what got me into trouble in 2019: I consistently overplanned and underestimated how long it would take to nail new concepts or complete practice projects.</p><p>Practice projects took longer to complete than expected. Technologies took longer to learn and get comfortable with than I’d planned for at the start of the quarter. I was putting a lot of time and effort into my personal programming work, but I wasn’t seeing the desired results. </p><p>So I turned to monthly plans for my longer-term goal planning. At the end of the month, I plan what I want to do, learn, or build for the month ahead. </p><p>This helps me to focus my time and attention on realistic, manageable goals. It also helps me to see progress: a month is plenty of time to make significant headway on something.</p><p>Now that I’ve done this type of planning for an entire year, I can tell you this one change has had an incredible impact on my programming progress. Here’s how you can implement a monthly plan, too.</p><p>The monthly plan forces you to be selective and prioritize precisely what you want to get done. There’s not enough time to do everything. Instead of saying you’ll learn Node and React and build “x” number of applications this <em>quarter</em>, you commit to learning Node this <em>month</em>.</p><p>As a result, you’ll find yourself doing better work. Rather than spreading yourself too thin trying to get it all in, you’re laser focused on one thing—and doing that one thing exceedingly well. </p><p>The workload becomes much more manageable, and therefore realistic. This fuels motivation because you can see the progress happening right before your eyes.</p><p>And you know that you’re making progress because at the end of the month, you’ll create a new plan for the month ahead. This means setting aside some time to reflect on what you did during the month of November so you can effectively plan for December. </p><h2>Get Better Faster with Feedback</h2><p>This rapid monthly <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/why-you-will-get-better-faster-with-feedback">feedback loop</a> is critical, and is a key reason why monthly planning is incredibly effective. </p><p>The last Sunday of the month I make my plan for the following month, which means I’m constantly evaluating and reflecting on my programming progress to see what’s going well and what needs some work. </p><p>There have been several occasions when at the end of the month when I’ve said to myself: “I could use more practice with this” or “I need to take a deeper dive into that.” </p><p>So I make time for this extra practice or learning in the following month. My personal programming work is about learning and getting better. If it takes me an extra month to really solidify a concept or complete more practice projects in order to feel more comfortable with a technology, I’m fine with that. I’d rather spot a weakness and do something about it, than let a lot of time go by and have the problem get worse.</p><p>I want to <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/what-is-the-fastest-way-to-learn-to-program-is-the-wrong-question">build a solid foundation</a> of programming knowledge. The monthly plan is helping me do that.</p><h2>The Details Matter</h2><p>Admittedly, I haven’t thrown the quarterly plan completely out the window. Instead of a plan, however, I make a quarterly sketch. It contains broad ideas of what I’d like to accomplish. But the details really take shape at the monthly level.</p><p>My monthly planning process is twofold: reflection and action. First, reflection because it’s important to look back in order to move forward. </p><p>I pull up my past month’s plan on my computer and assess how I did:</p><ul><li>What went well.</li><li>What could have gone better.</li><li>What I’ll do differently in the month head.</li><li>Any noticeable trouble spots or knowledge gaps.</li></ul><p>This is an informal process. The point is simply to take an honest look at what happened during the past month. </p><p>However, I do type out my responses. It helps me solidify my thoughts. It also underscores the seriousness of the process. Instead of casually thinking about the past month, I’m taking the time and putting in the effort to write out coherent answers.</p><p>Then, I make my plan for the month ahead. There are many ways you can go about making a monthly plan. I’ve used different approaches, depending on what I’m trying to achieve.  </p><p>One way is to have one main objective. For example, say you want to build out the backend of a project with Node. </p><p>Then, create a handful of sub-goals that’ll help you reach it. Think backwards, and ask yourself this question: "what are three or four things that'll help me reach this main objective?" </p><p>Keeping with the same example, your sub-goals may be specific projects you want to complete and the concepts you need to learn.</p><p>These sub-goals are specific, and they’re incredibly important to have. They’ll help you reach your main objective. They’ll also be a means of measuring your progress at the end of the month.</p><p>Monthly planning is fantastic for longer term goals. Yet it’s equally important to create weekly and daily plans: they’re essential to help you chip away at your larger goals and to ensure that you’re on track. </p><h2>Make It a Reality</h2><p>My weekly planning takes place on Sundays. I head to my standing desk, open Evernote, and evaluate my programming progress at the weekly level. First, I reflect on what went well during the past week and areas of improvement. </p><p>Then, I identify my goals for the week ahead. I ask myself: “what do I want to get done by the end of the week?” I pull up my monthly plan as I think through the answer.</p><p>This weekly assessment brings awareness of <em>what</em> I did during the past week and <em>what</em> I want to do in the week that follows. The <em>when</em> and <em>how</em> I'm going to do it comes to light when I create a daily plan.</p><p>I end my day the same way: by creating a plan for the day ahead. So on Thursday evening I create a plan for Friday. I allocate a <a href="https://amymhaddad.com/working-in-blocks-of-time">block of time</a> for each task I need to complete. For example, from 6:30-8 - solve ‘x’ problem. </p><p>Monthly planning gets the main goal into place. The weekly and daily planning help to make it a reality.</p><p>The older I get, the more I realize how important it is to have specific, concrete plans. Otherwise, goals fall through the cracks. Specific plans help to enable the outcomes we want.</p><p>At the same time, a specific, concrete plan keeps your programming journey focused on yourself. A monthly plan is a constant reminder of what <em>you're</em> doing, the progress <em>you're</em> making, and how <em>you're</em> getting better. The focus is on <em>your</em> outcomes, which helps evade the “comparison game” that’s so common in life and in programming. </p><p>So, as we round out 2020, I can assure you of one thing: on Sunday, December 27, I’ll be creating my monthly plan for January 2021. I hope you’ll do the same.</p><p><a href="https://amymhaddad.com/"><br>← back to all posts</a></p></div></div></div>]]>

</p>

<p>I’ve been thinking a lot about task management lately. I’ve actually been
thinking about it for years. I’ve always been searching for the optimal way to
sort through the bajillion things I have to do and remain productive.</p>

<p>This all started when, as a programmer, I realized that I had the power to
automate the tasks that I found repetitive in my digital life. I would write
scripts, for example, to do things like organize my photos, clean up my music
library, and back up my data. Over the years, I’ve developed my own homegrown
approach to task management, which has included a couple of attempts at writing
a command-line tool to manage my tasks in a way that’s in line with my approach.
Then, recently, I discovered that there is already a robust command-line tool
that does exactly what I need.</p>

<p>That tool is <a href="https://taskwarrior.org/">Taskwarrior</a>. But before I get into it, here’s a
brief dive into the journey that led me to using it.</p>



<p>Around the same time that I was starting to write scripts to automate the
monotonous parts of my day-to-day life, I was also discovering the joy of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=inbox+zero">Inbox
Zero</a>. If you’re unfamiliar with Inbox Zero, the basic idea is that
you endeavor to keep your email inbox empty as much as possible, instead of
letting emails pile up that you’ll get to “later” (which could be days, months,
or even years from now, or perhaps never). You can achieve Inbox Zero by being
disciplined about reviewing your inbox regularly (at least once a day) and
taking action on every email. Taking action on an email can mean deleting or
archiving it, replying (even if a quick reply is all you have time for), or
perhaps making a note for yourself on your calendar to do something later.</p>

<p>(You might be wondering what Inbox Zero has to do with task management. That
will become clear very shortly. Read on!)</p>



<p>Sometime around 2013, I discovered an excellent, free service called
<a href="https://followupthen.com/">FollowUpThen</a>. The elevator pitch for FollowUpThen is that you can send or
forward an email to an address like <code>tomorrow@followupthen.com</code> (or
<code>tomorrow@fut.io</code>, for short) and tomorrow at 6 AM, the email that you sent or
forwarded will arrive in your inbox, like clockwork. FollowUpThen supports a
<a href="https://www.followupthen.com/how#timeformats">wide variety</a> of time and date formats, many of which are highly
useful. I often found myself forwarding an email to <code>2weeks@fut.io</code> or sending
an email to <code>september@fut.io</code>, for example.</p>

<p>FollowUpThen quickly became the primary tool in my Inbox Zero toolbox. If I had
a lot of work to do and a handful of emails that I just didn’t have time for at
the moment, I could use FollowUpThen to “snooze” the emails until a particular
time later in the day when I knew I would be more available.</p>

<p>I also started to use FollowUpThen as a task manager. For example, if I was
planning to mow the lawn on Saturday, I would send an email with the subject
<code>mow the lawn</code> to <code>saturday@fut.io</code>. Then when Saturday rolled around, I would
get an email with the subject <code>mow the lawn</code>, and I would have to mow the lawn
in order to reach Inbox Zero, which motivated me to mow the lawn.</p>

<p>After a while, I started wishing that I could see my upcoming tasks ahead of
time. I wanted to see into the future just slightly, so that I could mentally
prepare myself to work on a task that wasn’t due yet. This would be better than
forgetting that I had a task scheduled, and then <em>BAM</em> – I get an email,
signaling that I needed to do it right now!</p>

<p>Now, to be fair, you <em>can</em> see all of your scheduled follow-ups by logging in at
followupthen.com – and I did that from time to time – but that’s a little
cumbersome for something that I’d ideally like to do on a regular basis. Over
time, I’ve become more and more accustomed to doing things at the command line.
I’m already in a terminal most of the time, so it is typically a lot faster for
me to do something at the command-line as opposed to, say, logging into a
website, navigating to the right page, and clicking a button. I started pining
for a way to manage all of my projects and tasks at the command-line.</p>



<p>As I imagined an ideal command-line task management workflow, I found myself
thinking about the ancient AS400 system that I used in my previous life as a
claims adjudicator.</p>

<p>I was managing a caseload of anywhere from 50 to 200 claims, each of which had a
log of past actions (called <em>log items</em>) and a schedule of upcoming actions
needed (called <em>action items</em>). Some of the action items were designated <code>IA</code>,
which meant that Immediate Action was needed. This was really just a way of
designating some action items as being higher priority than others.</p>

<p>The best part of the system was the case summary screen. This was a top-level
summary of all of my cases, with statistics about how many cases fell into
certain categories.  For example, there was a “Cases needing immediate action”
category, which displayed the number of cases with Immediate Action follow-up
actions either due or overdue. There were also useful categories like “Cases
without action in 30 days.” When I was working at that job, I developed a highly
productive workflow in which I was able to effectively manage large caseloads
and ensure that the most urgent tasks were done first. My daily process was to
go through the categories on the case summary screen in priority order, and
endeavor to get the number to the right of each category down to zero, over
time. I was following the Inbox Zero philosophy with my workload, and it worked
very well for me.</p>

<p>I wanted to replicate this sort of workflow for day-to-day task management in my
personal life. So, I started writing a program that I called <a href="https://github.com/daveyarwood/ews"><code>ews</code></a> (named
after the Electronic Worksheet System that I had used in my past job). I was
envisioning <code>ews</code> as essentially a port of the AS400 system I had used, where
“cases” (i.e. projects, groups of related tasks) could be managed and summarized
in priority order.</p>

<p>I started writing this tool in <a href="https://clojurescript.org/">ClojureScript</a> targeting
<a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>, but I got frustrated with the need to use callbacks when
interfacing with the node.js ecosystem, which was a show-stopper for me. I was
playing with <a href="https://rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> at the time, so I did a basic rewrite in Rust, which I
was fairly happy with, although I realized that the strictness of the Rust
compiler caused me to work more slowly than I do in less strict languages.</p>

<p>I was on the verge of yet another rewrite in <a href="https://crystal-lang.org/">Crystal</a> when I finally
took a step back and thought about what I really wanted to create. This led me
to my next iteration, which was different enough that I decided to give it a
different name.</p>



<p>I had a shower-thought that Google Calendar provides a database for events and
an API for interacting with them, so I could leverage this platform to build my
tool. So, I started writing <a href="https://github.com/daveyarwood/tdz">tdz</a> as an experiment in that direction. (NB:
I didn’t get very far, so don’t expect to find much in that repo!)</p>

<p>While I was thinking about how my mental model of projects and tasks could map
onto the Google Calendar API, I also realized that the model could be
simplified. I didn’t really need to manage projects; I only needed to manage
individual tasks that have scheduled dates and due dates. (If I could organize
them into projects, that would be icing on the cake, but it wasn’t a
requirement.)</p>

<p>With the conceptual model simplified to just tasks, I (finally) started to
wonder if maybe somebody else had already created something like this. After
some googling, I stumbled upon <a href="https://stackify.com/top-command-line-tools/">this list of useful command-line
tools</a>, which included Taskwarrior, a feature-rich task
management application. So, I decided to give it a try.</p>



<p>I’d briefly encountered Taskwarrior before in the past and thought, “This is
cool, but how is it different from the other command-line TODO apps I’ve seen?”
I’d dismissed it as “just another TODO list app.”</p>

<p>At that point, I’d already come across a number of command-line TODO list
managers in the open source space; it’s a fun, easy project that any beginning
programmer can build and get working in a short amount of time. So, by
association, I had come to expect any command-line TODO manager to be simplistic
and fall short of my task management needs.</p>

<p>I didn’t want a tool that would simply keep track of a list of tasks and let me
check them off when I did them.  This is akin to a traditional pen-and-paper
TODO list; I’ve always hated those because there’s no way to assign dates to
things and filter out the noise of backlog tasks that aren’t yet ready for
action.  It didn’t occur to me that there might be a more sophisticated task
management CLI tool that had all of the features I needed in order to follow an
“Inbox Zero” style of task management. Taskwarrior turned out to be exactly what
I needed and more!</p>

<h2 id="tasks-projects-and-urgency">Tasks, Projects, and Urgency</h2>

<p>Adding and listing tasks is, of course, a breeze:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ task add mow the lawn
Created task 1.

$ task
[task next]

ID Age Description  Urg
 1 5s  mow the lawn    0

1 task</code></pre></figure>

<p>The default behavior when you run <code>task</code> is to run the command <code>task next</code>,
which lists your most urgent tasks, sorted by urgency.</p>

<p>Tasks can be modified in a number of ways, including, but not limited to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Adding tags.</li>
  <li>Categorizing the task as being part of a project.</li>
  <li>Setting the dates/times when the task will be visible, scheduled, and due.</li>
  <li>Assigning a priority (the default priorities are L, M, and H, and you can
customize or replace them or add more priorities).</li>
  <li>Marking the task as “active” (i.e. you’ve started working on it).</li>
</ul>

<p>Watch what happens to my task when I designate it as part of the “home” project:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ task 1 modify project:home
Modifying task 1 'mow the lawn'.
Modified 1 task.
The project 'home' has changed.  Project 'home' is 0% complete (1 task remaining).

$ task
[task next]

ID Age  Project Description  Urg
 1 2min home    mow the lawn    1

1 task</code></pre></figure>

<p>Notice that the urgency level changed from 0 to 1! We can see why if we view
information about the task:</p>

<figure><pre><code data-lang="text">$ task 1
No command specified - assuming 'information'.

Name          Value
ID            1
Description   mow the lawn
Status        Pending

<a href="https://aakinshin.net/tags/performance-analysis/">Performance analysis</a></span></p><p>Software performance is a complex discipline that requires knowledge in different areas
from benchmarking to the internals of modern runtimes, operating systems, and hardware.
Surprisingly, the most difficult challenges in performance analysis are not about programming,
they are about mathematical statistics!</p><p>Many software developers can drill into performance problems and implement excellent optimizations,
but they are not always know how to correctly verify these optimizations.
This may not look like a problem in the case of a single performance investigation.
However, the situation became worse when developers try to set up an infrastructure that
should automatically find performance problems or prevent degradations from merging.
In order to make such an infrastructure reliable and useful,
it’s crucial to achieve an extremely low false-positive rate (otherwise, it’s not trustable)
and be able to detect most of the degradations (otherwise, it’s not so useful).
It’s not easy if you don’t know which statistical approaches should be used.
If you try to google it, you may find dozens of thousands of papers about statistics,
but only a small portion of them really works in practice.</p><p>In this post, I want to share some approaches that I use for performance analysis in everyday life.
I have been analyzing performance distributions for the last seven years,
and I have found a lot of approaches, metrics, and tricks which nice to have
in your statistical toolbox.
I would not say that all of them are must have to know,
but they can definitely help you to improve the reliability of your statistical checks
in different problems of performance analysis.
Consider the below list as a letter to a younger version of myself with a brief list of topics that are good to learn.</p><h3 id="bad-approaches">Bad approaches</h3><p>The classic statistics aggressively promotes a lot of approaches that don’t work well on performance distributions.
I’m not sure that I know the best tools for performance analysis,
but I’m sure that I know dozens of approaches that shouldn’t be used.
Let me briefly highlight the most popular sources of trouble.</p><h4 id="dont-assume-normal-distributions">Don’t assume normal distributions</h4><p>The first thing you should remember about performance distributions: they are not <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution">normal</a>.
Of course, some of them could remind the normal distribution, but you can’t assume normality in advance.
Performance distributions can be asymmetric and heavy-tailed,
can contain extremely high outliers,
can be multimodal,
can have a strange distribution shape.</p><p>Thus, it’s not a good idea to use any approaches that require normality.
Instead, you should look for <em>distribution-free</em> methods that support <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonparametric_statistics"><em>non-parametric distributions</em></a>.</p><p>References:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aakinshin.net/posts/normality">Normality is a myth</a></li><li><a href="https://doi.org/10.1093/biomet/34.3-4.209">Testing for normality</a> (1947) by R.C.

Wilcox</li></ul><h4 id="dont-use-null-hypothesis-significance-testing-with-p-values">Don’t use null hypothesis significance testing with p-values</h4><p>The null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) is an awful technique that typically creates more problems than solves.
I had been using it for many years, I had been trying a lot of different tests,
and now I am completely disappointed in this.</p><p>To be honest, if you aware of all the possible pitfalls,
it’s possible to conduct a good performance analysis with NHST.
Note that most of the significance tests assume normality,
so if you decide to use NHST, make sure that you use non-parametric tests
(e.g., the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test">Mann–Whitney U test</a> or
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kolmogorov%E2%80%93Smirnov_test">Kolmogorov–Smirnov test</a>).</p><p>However, there are other approaches that are much more reliable than NHST.
For example, you can look at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_statistics">Bayesian statistics</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimation_statistics">Estimation statistics</a> (also known as the <em>new statistics</em>).</p><p>If you use NHST, I highly recommend to read the following books and papers:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2023435.What_If_There_Were_No_Significance_Tests_">What If There Were No Significance Tests?</a>

      <p>Serverless technology is getting more popular by the day. More and more people are starting to experiment with it and learn for which use cases it can add value. In this blog post I share an example of what a fully Serverless workflow can achieve.</p>
<p>For a while now I've been curious how one would implement a payment workflow on a website. I was aware that platforms like <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a>, <a href="https://www.adyen.com/">Adyen</a> and <a href="https://www.mollie.com/">Mollie</a> exist, but I never knew how much work would be required to set up a fully functioning workflow. I therefore decided to give it a try using nothing but Serverless technology.</p>
<p>There is no specific reason I built the workflow using Mollie - any other provider would have worked as well. From a quick glance at their documentation, the workflow would be pretty similar.</p>
<p>In this blog post I'll go through the exact workflow that I built in AWS using S3, API Gateway, Lambda and DynamoDB. To see the full source code and get the application running yourself, I recommend checking out my <a href="https://github.com/SanderKnape/serverless-payment-workflow">GitHub Repository</a> with the fully functioning code. The following image depicts the full architecture and workflow steps.</p>
<p><img src="https://sanderknape.com/images/serverless-payment-workflow-architecture.png" alt="Serverless Payment Workflow Architecture"></p>
<h2 id="the-workflow">The workflow</h2>
<p>If you ever bought something on the internet, you're probably familiar with the typical payment flow. After you click the “Pay” button in the webshop, your browser redirects to another website where you can input your information to make a payment. After you entered your information, you are redirected back to the webshop greeted by some “Payment received!” message.</p>
<p>The image above shows more in-depth which steps are part of this flow. Let's go through these steps one-by-one.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The first step is to open up the webshop page that is about to redirect you to the payment provider. In our case this website is hosted in an S3 bucket. The page displayed shows a list of articles and a “Buy” button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After clicking this button the browser executes a POST request to our payments API. This endpoint first registers the payment at Mollie after which it stores the started payment session in the DynamoDB table. The API response then tells the browser to redirect to the checkout URL which we received from Mollie.</p>
<ul>
<li>We use the Mollie API to register the payment. As part of creating the payment we also provide the webhook URL where Mollie can send updates regarding the payment, and the URL where to redirect to after the payment was finalized (the “thank you” page). The Mollie documentation includes the full <a href="https://docs.mollie.com/reference/v2/payments-api/create-payment">Create Payment API reference</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the user entered their payment details, Mollie calls our API to send us the latest information. We update the current payment information in DynamoDB to reflect the correct status (paid, cancelled, etc.).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After the user finalized the payment, Mollie redirects the user back to the “thank you” page on our webshop. The redirect URL contains the payment's ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Finally, on the “thank you” page the browser executes an XHR request to fetch the latest payment information from our API based on the ID in the redirect URL. This is how we tell the user whether the payment was successful or not.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can find more information about the Mollie Payment flow in <a href="https://docs.mollie.com/payments/overview">their documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="things-to-keep-in-mind">Things to keep in mind</h2>
<p>I took many, many shortcuts when building this workflow. The application only contains the minimal steps required to get a fully functioning workflow up and running. The application is far from production-ready. Here are some things to keep in mind when you want to take this application to the next level:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Important: I'm storing the Mollie API credentials as plaintext</strong>. The API key is therefore visible to anyone with access to your code or your AWS environment. Use a solution such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-securely-provide-database-credentials-to-lambda-functions-by-using-aws-secrets-manager/">AWS Secrets Manager</a> to store and retrieve the API key securely.</li>
<li>The workflow assumes the latest payment information is available when the browser opens the “thank you” page. In reality, this is an asynchronous process - Mollie sends an update to our Payments API when an update is available and when their systems can forward this information. Updates will be delayed when a credit card verification takes more time. Mollie may also give delayed responses if their queues are filling up. Our API may also have an issue and not properly process the payment update - luckily, Mollie retries until our API returns a 200 status code. Keep this all in mind when designing your thank you page: the database's payment status may still be “pending”.</li>
<li>For simplicity, the only entity I work with in this workflow is a “payment”. In reality you'll want to separate the lifecycle of your payment from the lifecycle of the actual order.</li>
<li>The code assumes everything works as expected; only the happy path is implemented. You'll want to add additional checks to account for unexpected API responses and build in retry mechanisms.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="give-it-a-try">Give it a try</h2>
<p>There is no such thing as too many Serverless example workflows. You learn the most by doing, so I would recommend giving this a try for yourself. To deploy this workflow, check out my <a href="https://github.com/SanderKnape/serverless-payment-workflow">GitHub Repository</a> with instructions on how to get started.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The subject of Artificial Intelligence piques my interest and I’m constantly studying and trying new things in this field.</p><p>It is notorious how the technologies related to Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision and such have emerged and evolved into solutions used by millions of users every day.</p><p>Even though people use the term "Artificial Intelligence", we are still far away from something as advanced as a Skynet from the Terminator movies.</p><p>The most common subfield of AI used today is the one called Machine Learning, which, in its turn, has Deep Learning as subfield steeply growing every day for quite some time now.</p><p>In this guide, I aim to describe a path to follow for software engineers to begin understanding how Machine Learning works and how to apply it to your projects.</p><p>Yeah, you can just go to Google API’s or Amazon and pick some magical API to do Speech Recognition for you, but the value of knowing how it works, why it works and even more, how to make your own API as a Service and tune it to your specific needs is incredible.</p><p>Remember, as a developer, every tool is a new power.</p><p>I’ve read, watched and gone through all these resources until the end, even got a paid certification for some, even though it is not necessary to learn, I find myself more engaged to finish when I have some deadline and assessment to prove I actually learned the material.</p><p>Let’s dive into the topics.</p><p>Python is the main language these days when working with Data Science, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning.</p><p>If you need a crash course on Python, here is your guide: <a href="https://renanmf.com/the-python-guide-for-beginners/">The Python Guide for Beginners</a>.</p><h2>The Basics: Math!</h2><p>Maybe you never had the chance to study some college-level math, or you did study it but you can’t remember most of the stuff because JavaScript and CSS took all the memory of those topics away.</p><p>There are 3 topics you must know beforehand, or at least have a decent grasp of to follow any good material on ML and DL: Linear Algebra, Calculus and Statistics.</p><p>If you’d like to go deep in learning the math needed to ML and DL, you can look for MIT OpenCourseWare classes like Professor Strang’s renowned <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/">Linear Algebra</a> class.</p><p>I’ve watched it in college in parallel with my regular class and it is very good.</p><p>But, let’s face it, most people have no time for that or the patience.</p><p>So I will give you the crash course for the 3 topics mentioned above.</p><h3>Linear Algebra</h3><p>Just watch the whole series <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Essence of Linear Algebra</a> from the Youtube channel 3Blue1Brown.</p><p>The guy makes visual explanations of once hard concepts incredibly easy!</p><p>It is very far in terms of content compared to Professor Strang’s, but it’s enough, to begin with, and you can go after other topics as you advance in ML and DL.</p><h3>Calculus</h3><p>Guess what?</p><p>3Blue1Brown also has a whole series on Calculus on Youtube for you to watch for free: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr">Essence of Calculus</a>.</p><p>Again, he is very good at giving you the intuition of why and how rather than just throw some random equations on your face.</p><h3>Statistics</h3><p>This is a whole field that, in my opinion, you can learn as needed, a good reference is <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Statistics-Data-Scientists-Essential/dp/1491952962">Practical Statistics for Data Scientists: 50 Essential Concepts</a>.</p><p>An objective book with some good examples for every concept.</p><p>Fast to read too.</p><p>As the title implies, it is more suitable for Data Scientists, but understanding some basics of statistics is always good and this is what this is book is for.</p><p>You won’t become a statistician after reading it, but you will learn some good stuff.</p><h2>The Bypassed: Machine Learning</h2><p>Everybody wants to jump straight into Deep Learning and be the cool guy training a single model for a week on a 12GB GPU.</p><p>But to get Deep Learning right, you need to go through Machine Learning first!</p><h3>Start from the beginning</h3><p>The concepts, the train of thought, the "feeling" of how things work start here and there is no one else more capable of teaching those concepts than Professor Andrew Ng in his course <a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a>.</p><p>You may think this course is old and outdated, well, technology-wise, maybe, but conceptually-wise, it is better than anything else out there.</p><p>Professor Ng makes it easy to understand the math applied in every technique he teaches and gives you a solid understanding of what happens underneath in a very short and concise course.</p><p>All the exercises are made in Octave, a free version of Matlab of sorts, and you finish the course implementing your own Neural Network!</p><p>The syntax in Octave is easy to grasp for any programmer, so don’t let that be a barrier for you.</p><p>Once you finish the course, you will have implemented all the major algorithms and will be able to solve several prediction problems.</p><h3>Random Forests</h3><p>I said all the major algorithms, right?</p><p>Actually, there is but one flaw in Andrew Ng’s course, he doesn’t cover Random Forests.</p><p>An awesome complement to his course is fast.ai’s <a href="http://course18.fast.ai/ml">Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders</a>.</p><p>Jeremy Howard goes super practical on the missing piece in Ng’s course covering a topic that is, for many classical problems, the best solution out there.</p><p>Fast.ai’s approach is what is called Top-Down, meaning they show you how to solve the problem and then explain why it worked, which is the total opposite of what we are used to in school.</p><p>Jeremy also uses real-world tools and libraries, so you learn by coding in industry-tested solutions.</p><h2>Deep Learning</h2><p>Finally!</p><p>The reason why we are all here, Deep Learning!</p><p>Again, the best resource for it is Professor Ng’s course, actually, a series of courses.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/">Deep Learning Specialization</a> is composed of 5 courses total going from the basics and evolving on specific topics such as language, images, and time-series data.</p><p>One nice thing is that he continues from the very end of his classical Machine Learning course, so it just feels like an extension of the first course.</p><p>The math, the concepts, the notion of how and why it works, he delivers it all very concisely like few I’ve seen.</p><p>The only drawback is that he uses <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">Tensorflow</a> 1.x (Google’s DL Framework) in this course, but that’s minimal detail in my opinion since the explanations and exercises are so well delivered.</p><p>You can pick up the most recent version of the framework relatively easy and to do so there is the final piece of this guide, a book.</p><h3>Too much stuff, give me something faster</h3><p>This book might be the only thing you need to start, it is Aurélien Géron’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B07XGF2G87">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems</a>.</p><p>It covers a lot, from classical Machine Learning to the most recent Deep Learning topics. Good examples and exercises using industry-grade frameworks and libraries.</p><p>I dare say that, if you are really in a rush, you can skip everything I said before and just go for the book.</p><p>You will miss a good amount of information contained on the other resources mentioned, but the practical and actionable knowledge from Géron’s book is enough to work on many ideas for your next project.</p><p>If you feel limited after only reading the book, go back and study the rest of the material, it will fill in the gaps you might have and give you a more solid understanding.</p><h2>What about Framework X or Y?</h2><p>"Hey, I’ve heard about PyTorch and that other framework or library X everybody talks about".</p><p>As a Software Engineer, you know better than anyone how fast technology evolves.</p><p>Don’t go crazy for that, after you learn the basics in this guide, you can easily go, for instance, on <a href="https://pytorch.org/">PyTorch</a> documentation or any other library or framework of sorts and learn how to use it in a week or two.</p><p>The techniques, the concepts, are all the same, it is only a matter of syntax and application or even tastes that you might have for any given tool.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To wrap it up, I want to say that, even though it might seem a lot, I tried to remove all the noise and at the end of the process, you will feel confident that you understand what is happening behind the curtains, the jargons and even be able to read some papers published in the field to keep up with the latest advances.</p><p>TL;DR Here is the list of resources mentioned in sequence:</p><ul><li><a href="https://renanmf.com/the-python-guide-for-beginners/">The Python Guide for Beginners</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab">Essence of Linear Algebra</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUvTyaaNkzM&amp;list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr">Essence of Calculus</a></li><li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning">Machine Learning</a></li><li><a href="http://course18.fast.ai/ml">Introduction to Machine Learning for Coders</a></li><li><a href="https://www.deeplearning.ai/deep-learning-specialization/">Deep Learning Specialization</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com.br/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow-ebook/dp/B07XGF2G87">Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems</a></li></ul></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article id="post-5697" role="main"><div><div><div><p>A <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20039-w" target="_blank">new study of almost 40,000 adults</a> has found that the brains of lonely people differ from those of people who are not lonely, in significant and detectable ways. <span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p>This loneliness “signature” consists of variations in the volume of different brain regions, and the way those brain regions communicate. And these variations may be related to the typical thinking patterns of lonely people, which include for example higher than average amounts of reminiscence and imaginary conversations.</p><p>The study compared the MRI scans of people who said they “often” feel lonely with the scans of people do not report feeling that way. The data comes from the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/" target="_blank">UK Biobank</a>, which is an open-source database containing genetic and health information from about half a million people in the UK.</p><p>The 38,701 participants consisted of 47.5% men and 52.5% women. Their ages ranged from 40 – 69, with an average age of 55. About 13% of them answered “yes” to the question “Do you often feel lonely?” Of those who answered yes, about 39% were men, and 61% women.</p><p>The new paper appeared today (December 15) in <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms" target="_blank">Nature Communications</a></em>.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-medrectangle-4"></span></p><h2>Lonely people and the default network</h2><p>The researchers behind the study, from McGill University in Montreal, found that the key differences involved the brain’s “<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_mode_network" target="_blank">default network</a>.” This network is responsible for a wide range of mental processes that take place when the brain is at rest. These processes are often referred to as the “inner voice”, or the “self.”</p><p>The default network plays a crucial role in memory, social cognition (i.e. thinking about other people), and mental time travel (“What will I do tomorrow?”). It involves the medial prefrontal cortex, and the posterior cingulate cortex, along with a number of other structures. It is also responsible for hallucinations and internal imagery.</p><p>The researchers discovered, unexpectedly, that volumes in several of these default network regions were larger in lonely people. They also found equally unexpected patterns of positive associations between some of these regions.</p><h2>Feeling lonely: the typical thought patterns of lonely people</h2><p>The association between the default network and loneliness may be because of the way lonely people think. Lonely people have been found, for example, to focus more on internal thoughts, perhaps to compensate for their lack of actual social experiences. Their thought patterns tend to include above-average levels of reminiscing and imagined social exchanges. And this increase in thoughts about the self might well influence the relationship between the regions of the default network.<span data-ez-name="psychnewsdaily_com-box-4"></span></p><p>“In the absence of desired social experiences,” the authors write, “lonely individuals may be biased towards internally directed cognitions,” as if “to fill the social void.”</p><p>In that sense, then, the physical effects of loneliness on the brain are not surprising. Paying “greater attention to one’s inner milieu, and a heightened focus on the self and self-reflective thoughts,” the authors write, “would naturally engage memory-based functions of the default network.”</p><p>Indeed, <a href="https://amzn.to/3nnJzNk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">past research on loneliness</a> has found that lonely people are more likely to engage in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037%2F0022-3514.85.3.409" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imaginary social interactions</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1467-9280.2008.02194.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nostalgic reminiscences</a>, and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1037%2F0033-295X.114.4.864" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hypothetical conversations</a>, and are also more likely to <a href="https://doi.org/10.1111%2Fj.1467-9280.2008.02056.x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treat pets like people</a>.</p><h2>So lonely: why studying loneliness matters</h2><p>Researchers are increasingly recognizing loneliness as a major health problem. A recent study, for example, found that <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/loneliness-among-older-americans-doubled-during-pandemic-poll-shows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loneliness has more than doubled among older people</a> since the Covid-19 pandemic began.</p><p>Past research has also shown that older people who experience loneliness have a higher risk of cognitive decline and dementia. Lonely people get sick more often, and take longer to get over infections. Loneliness also increases blood pressure and levels of stress hormones. Socially isolated people are more likely to be depressed, suffer from memory loss, and use alcohol and drugs. Likewise, evidence suggests that loneliness contributes to ageing in a number of ways, and leads to reduced longevity. In fact, the health risks of loneliness are <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691614568352" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">equivalent to those related to obesity or smoking 15 cigarettes a day</a>.</p><p>Understanding how loneliness works in the brain could one day help prevent neurological disease, and lead to better treatments.</p><p>“We speculate that the associations between the default network and loneliness revealed here,” the researcher write, “reflect increased demands on episodic mental simulation of inner social events in the absence of desired social experience in the external world.”</p><hr><p><strong>Study:</strong> “<a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-20039-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The default network of the human brain is associated with perceived social isolation</a>“<br><strong>Authors:</strong> Nathan Spreng et al.<br><strong>Published in:</strong> <em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.nature.com/ncomms" target="_blank">Nature Communications</a></em><br><strong>Publication date: </strong>December 15, 2020<br><strong>DOI:</strong> http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-20039-w<br><strong>Photo:</strong> by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@anthonytran?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Anthony Tran</a>&nbsp;via&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></p><p>For a weekly summary of the latest psychology news, subscribe to our <a href="https://www.psychnewsdaily.com/the-psych-news-weekly-newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Psych News Weekly newsletter</a>.</p></div></div></div></article></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="what-is-retentioneering">

<p>Retentioneering is a Python framework and library
(<a href="https://github.com/retentioneering/retentioneering-tools">github link</a>)
to assist product
analysts and marketing analysts as it makes it easier to process and
analyze clickstreams, event streams, trajectories, and event logs.
You can segment users, clients (agents), build ML pipelines to predict
agent category or probability of target event based on historical data.</p>
<p>In a common scenario you can use raw data from Google Analytics BigQuery
stream or any other silimal streams in form of events and their timestamps
for users, and Retentioneering is all you need to explore the user behavior
from that data, it can reveal much more insights than funnel analytics, as
it will automatically build the behavioral segments and their patterns,
highlighting what events and pattern impact your conversion rates, retention
and revenue.</p>
<p>Retentioneering extends Pandas, NetworkX, Scikit-learn for in-depth
processing of event sequences data, specifically Retentioneering provides
a powerful environment to perform an in-depth analysis of customer
journey maps, bringing behavior-driven segmentation of users and machine
learning pipelines to product analytics.</p>
<p><img alt="_images/intro_0.png" src="https://retentioneering.github.io/retentioneering-tools/_build/html/_images/intro_0.png"></p><p>You don’t need to be a Pandas expert, all the functions are specifically
designed for analytics tasks, reduce data wrangling and simplify data
cleaning and visualization.</p>
<p>Product analysts can apply Retentioneering Tools as a Python framework
to explore, grow, and optimize the product based on deep analysis of user
trajectories. Using Retentioneering you can vectorize clickstream logs
and cluster user trajectories to automatically identify common successful
or churn patterns. You can explore those patterns using our tools such
as graph visualizer, step matrix, multiple clustering, and segmentation
engines, and many others.</p>
<p>If you have csv datasets you can start with user behaviour data and try
Retentioneering with “pip install retentioneering” and a few lines of
code. Sample datasets are included in package for quick start.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section id="main">

<p>My first computer (Apple IIe) used 5-inch floppy disks. If a program didn’t fit on a single floppy, you might need to spread it across multiples, but otherwise this solution was fine. Floppy disks could hold the application AND the user data, be easily backed up or shared, and storing them was easy enough. The computer was old when I got it, and the former owner included something like 500 programs on floppy disk, an endlessly discoverable mountain of software.</p>
<p>My next computer (90s era IBM clone) had multiple media drives, a 3.5-inch floppy drive and a CD drive. The floppies held more data than the old 5-inchers, and had all the same upsides. I could work on something at home, bring it to a computer at school and just keep going. The CD drive was a big game changer though. A CD can hold 700mb of data, and my hard drive at the time was 600mb. A really common pattern was to run software off a CD, but save your user data on floppies or hard drive. There was internet, initially in the AOL and later dial-up, but bandwidth was expensive and transfer speeds were slow. So slow.</p>
<p>My next computer, a G3 Graphite iMac, had an optical drive that could read and write CDs and read DVDs. I used to rent movies from the Blockbuster where I worked and watch them on the tiny CRT screen. This was in the Napster days, and burning CDs was a boon. I could make mixes for friends or girlfriends, or even share my own music. I burned a lot of CDs in those days. The 100gb hard drive was enough that I didn’t miss my floppy drive, plus we had the internet everywhere by then.</p>
<p>Then came the MacBook Pro, a beast of a machine with a SuperDrive (burns CDs and DVDs), USBs galore and even an SD card reader. I owned two incarnations of this machine, one of which is still in service to this day. Around this time, my college started using Iomega Zip Disks, although I never bought a drive for myself, I did own several of the disks.</p>
<p>Now I have two computers I switch between, but neither accepts any form of physical media beyond a USB stick without the inclusion of an external drive. The Mac (my reluctant work machine), can’t even use these without a dongle. These computers are designed to rely on the internet as a means of installing programs and sharing data, which obviously works fine since everybody in the world is doing it that way.</p>
<h3 id="so-what">So what?</h3>
<p>I miss removeable physical media. I miss having a drawer of disks or CDs. Yes, I can still burn CDs, and do, but the subtle advantages of physical media are hard to fully grasp without an ecosystem.</p>
<p>In high school, every kid had a CD book in their backpack. We would ride the bus on field trips and look through each other’s collections to listen to them on the way. I discovered a lot of great music this way. I guess you could look through someone’s iTunes library or Spotify history, but it wouldn’t be the same.</p>
<p>On the same note, a lot of my early musical tastes were formed by listening to my parents old records. I can play songs I like for my children, but without a physical media library they are unlikely to discover my music on their own, especially without album art. I remember seeing the cover of <code>Eat A Peach</code> and thinking that I really wanted to listen to it.</p>
<p>As a parent I have a lot of pictures of my kids, many of which are precious to me. We’ve printed some out, stored others on a SSD, and the rest are in the cloud. Yes, we could print more/all of them, but we all know this is no longer the norm, and I’m probably never going to meander through the folders on our storage drive the way I used to through old family albums.</p>
<p>I think there was a lot of value in being able to run software directly off a CD instead of kludging up your internal storage with installed apps or relying on the cloud. Most software today is designed with the assumption that you have lots of memory, lots of storage and lots of cloud access. Can I even run a MacOS app directly off a CD? Maybe I should try. Look at your own Applications folder and tell me you really need all that installed on your machine. How easy is all that to uninstall if you want to? How big of a SSD would you actually need if you only stored your user data on your machine? How much less worried would you be about security if your computer didn’t require internet access to function? If, in 10 years I want to fire up an old computer or phone, could I even get software onto it?</p>

<h2>In Bowes Park a pair of underpants are gently decaying in public.</h2>
<p><strong>They have a fascinating and genuinely moving story to tell; now how many pairs of old pants can you say that about?</strong></p>
<p><strong><img src="https://www.smarterwebcompany.co.uk/peterberthoud-co-uk/_img/George-Moore-The-Underpants-1024x768.jpg" alt="The Most Interesting Underpants in London" width="1024" height="768"></strong></p>
<p>The pants occupy pride of place in the window display of George Moore Menswear at 99, Myddleton Road, in Bowes Park. The shop is no longer open for business but the owner still lives above it.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.smarterwebcompany.co.uk/peterberthoud-co-uk/_img/George-Moore-Shopfront-1024x940.jpg" alt="George Moore Menswear Myddleton Road" width="1024" height="940"></p>
<p>The owner is Brian Moore, son of the founder George. George Moore established the firm in 1942 and despite the problems associated with starting a business during a war he made a great success of it. When Mr Moore senior died in 1969 his widow and son, Brian, continued to run the shop. When Mr Moore junior decided to retire, around 13 years ago, he simply stopped trading, he didn't clear the window display but left it just as it was on the last day of business.</p>
<p>And so today we can enjoy this "museum piece" and all of its wonderful little exhibits.</p>
<p>A smart new shirt and tie, perfectly co-ordinated.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.smarterwebcompany.co.uk/peterberthoud-co-uk/_img/George-Moore-Youve-got-the-look-768x1024.jpg" alt="George Moore shirt and tie" width="768" height="1024"></p>
<p>A handy multi-purpose wallet featuring an under-arm security strap.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.smarterwebcompany.co.uk/peterberthoud-co-uk/_img/George-Moore-Multi-purpose-wallet-1024x768.jpg" alt="George Moore wallet" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>There is plenty for the ladies too.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.smarterwebcompany.co.uk/peterberthoud-co-uk/_img/George-Moore-Last-One-Other-Colours-768x1024.jpg" alt="George Moore ladies jumper" width="768" height="1024"></p>
<p>The hand-written tags warn that the item on the left is the "LAST ONE" but reassure us that the item on the right is available "IN OTHER COLOURS".</p>
<p>This was one of those rare places where it was once possible to stock up on bowties and Max Bygraves cassette tapes all at the same time. I can't think of any other current example in London.</p>

<p>So is this the work of an eccentric? Are there echoes of Dirty Dick, the 18th Century pub owner who famously stopped washing, or otherwise looking after himself, from the moment his fiancée died on their wedding day? Has wrack and ruin come to this shop in an unplanned, yet picturesque, fashion; like a retail version of Highgate Cemetery?</p>
<p>The answer is none of the above. Mr Moore simply stopped trading and left time to run its course. You can hear Mr Moore speak about his life and work in a recent short interview on the excellent <a href="http://www.bowesandbounds.org/xn/detail/6278630:Note:9422" target="_blank">Bowes &amp; Bounds Connected website</a> (it's the very model and epitome of a genuine community website). Mr Moore is articulate, clearly fully compos mentis, engaging and fascinating. He is a man who has lived in the same road since he was three, an engaged resident, a force for good, a real local hero.</p>
<p>His retirement has created a really beautiful piece of genuine community art. His "exhibition" is free and acessible to all, open 365 days a year, and although it is tiny, it has more than enough interest to merit multiple visits. At each glance one's eyes are drawn to some fresh detail.</p>
<p>It serves as a memorial to the family firm but also encourages us all to pause and reflect on all the previous lives that have been lived in this street. With none of the technological gadgetry, so beloved by modern museums and galleries, Mr Moore has produced an exhibit that is far more engaging than many of the big budget ones to be found in the great national collections.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.smarterwebcompany.co.uk/peterberthoud-co-uk/_img/George-Moore-Shirts-Ties-1024x768.jpg" alt="George Moore Menswear window" width="1024" height="768"></p>
<p>Sunlight is bleaching the display, mildew is taking hold. The contents are slowly disintegrating. So there is movement here, albeit imperceptibly slow movement; this is a delicate ballet of decay. Dust is being allowed to return to dust in its own good time.<br>The first time I saw Mr Moore's shop I was delighted, surprised and amazed. An instinct for preservation immediately kicked in. Is this display under any kind of threat? Are there plans for redevelopment? Has a bloody coffee chain already started eyeing up the property? Has Mr Moore spoken to anyone at the National Trust about any long-term wishes he may have? How best can this gem be preserved and enjoyed?</p>
<p>Then, as I thought about it more, I realised that any potential preservation and conservation of the display would run absolutely counter to the reason why it is so engaging.</p>
<p>How could one begin to conserve such a variety of objects that are all softly decomposing? Well I think even the most able conservator would have their work cut out here&nbsp; but even if every object was made stable, all the moulds neutralised, all bugs banished and the effects of temperature, humidity and sunlight controlled and mitigated against, that would miss the point entirely.<br>One can conserve an object or objects but one cannot "preserve" a process without ending it.</p>
<p>The thought-provoking charm of this unique window display is that it is a living process. It lives, as we all do, by taking small incremental steps towards our own inevitable departures.</p>
<p>But there is no sadness for me in the display, quite the opposite I find in it a celebration of life and a call to enjoy all that we can in the here and now. Fashion is transitory, businesses are transitory, we are all individually transitory - so let's make the most of the moment whilst we can.</p>
<p>And thanks to Mr Moore we can imagine ourselves doing so in some very reasonably priced short socks!</p>

<p>I would encourage anyone to go and go and enjoy these "must-see" underpants and the rest of Mr Moore's wonderful window display as they gently dissolve before your eyes. If you can't make it then I have put some more pictures of the shop's display on my <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64929148@N05/sets/72157629100378436/" target="_blank">Flickr Photostream</a> and I'll add to these over time.</p>

Recently someone opened up an <a href="https://github.com/elixir-gettext">issue on Gettext</a> saying compilation of Gettext modules got slower in Erlang/OTP 23. In this article, we are going to explore how I have debugged this problem and the three separate pull requests sent to the Erlang/OTP repository to improve compiler performance.</p>
<p>
For those not familar, the Gettext project converts <code>.po</code> files like this:</p>
<pre><code># pt
msgid "Hello world"
msgstr "Olá mundo"

# pl
msgid "Hello world"
msgstr "Witaj świecie"</code></pre>
<p>
Into a module with functions:</p>
<pre><code><span>def</span><span> </span><span>translate</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-1">(</span><span>"pt"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"Hello world"</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-1">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Olá mundo"</span><span>
</span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>translate</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-2">(</span><span>"pl"</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>"Hello world"</span><span data-group-id="9576884584-2">)</span><span>,</span><span> </span><span>do</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"Witaj świecie"</span></code></pre>
<p>
While we start with an Elixir application, we end-up doing most of the work with the Erlang compiler and tools, so most of the lessons here are applicable to the wider ecosystem. Be sure to read until the end for a welcome surprise.</p>
<h2>
Isolating the slow file</h2>
<p>
When project compilation is slow, the first step is to identify which files are slow. In Elixir v1.11, this can be done like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix compile --force --profile time</code></pre>
<p>
The command above will print:</p>
<pre><code>...
[profile] lib/ecto/query/planner.ex compiled in 1376ms (plus 596ms waiting)
[profile] lib/ecto/association.ex compiled in 904ms (plus 1168ms waiting)
[profile] lib/ecto/changeset.ex compiled in 869ms (plus 1301ms waiting)
[profile] Finished compilation cycle of 95 modules in 2579ms
[profile] Finished group pass check of 95 modules in 104ms</code></pre>
<p>
Compilation of each file in your project is done in parallel. The overall message is:</p>
<pre><code>[profile] FILE compiled in COMPILE_TIME (plus WAITING_TIME waiting)</code></pre>
<p>
<code>COMPILE_TIME</code> is the time we were effectively compiling code. However, since a file may depend on a module defined in another file, <code>WAITING_TIME</code> is the time we wait until the file we depend on becomes available. High waiting times are not usually a concern, so we focus on the files with high compilation times.</p>
<p>
At the end, we print two summaries:</p>
<pre><code>[profile] Finished compilation cycle of 95 modules in 2579ms
[profile] Finished group pass check of 95 modules in 104ms</code></pre>
<p>
The first includes the time to compile all files in parallel and includes how many modules have been defined. The second is the time to execute a group pass which looks at all modules at once, in order to find undefined functions, emit deprecations, etc.</p>
<p>
Unless the “group pass check” is the slow one - which would be a bug in the Elixir compiler - we are often looking at a single file being the root cause of slow compilation. With this file in hand, it is time to dig deeper.</p>
<h2>
Timing the slow file</h2>
<p>
Once we have identified the slow file, we need to understand why it is slow. When Elixir compiles a file, it executes code at three distinct stages. For example, let’s assume the slow down was in <code>lib/problematic_file.ex</code> that looks like this:</p>
<pre><code><span># FILE LEVEL</span><span>
</span><span>defmodule</span><span> </span><span>ProblematicModule</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0623758596-1">do</span><span>
  </span><span># MODULE LEVEL</span><span>
  </span><span>def</span><span> </span><span>function</span><span> </span><span data-group-id="0623758596-2">do</span><span>
    </span><span># FUNCTION LEVEL</span><span>
  </span><span data-group-id="0623758596-2">end</span><span>
</span><span data-group-id="0623758596-1">end</span></code></pre>
<p>
When compiling the file above, Elixir will execute each level in order. If that file has multiple modules, then compilation will happen for each module in the file, first at MODULE LEVEL and then FUNCTION LEVEL.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
TIP: If a file with multiple modules is slow, I suggest breaking those modules into separate files and repeating the steps in the previous section.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
With this knowledge in hand, we want to compile the file once again, but now passing the <code>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time</code> flag to the underlying Erlang compiler, which will print time reports. One option is to do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix compile
$ touch lib/problematic_file.ex
$ ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time mix compile</code></pre>
<p>
Then, for each module being compiled (which includes the one in your <code>mix.exs</code>), you will see a report like this:</p>
<pre><code>core             :  0.653 s   72136.4 kB
sys_core_fold    :  0.482 s   69055.3 kB
sys_core_alias   :  0.146 s   69055.3 kB
core_transforms  :  0.000 s   69055.3 kB
sys_core_bsm     :  0.098 s   69055.3 kB
v3_kernel        :  2.250 s  169439.0 kB</code></pre>
<p>
Most compilers work by doing multiple passes on your code. Above we can see how much time was spent on each pass and how much memory the code representation, also known as Abstract Syntax Tree (AST), takes after each pass.</p>
<p>
The <code>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time mix compile</code> command above has one issue though. If other files depend on the problematic file, they may be recompiled too, and that will add noise to your output. If that’s the case, you can also do this:</p>
<pre><code>$ ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time mix run lib/problematic_file.ex</code></pre>
<p>
This is a rather neat trick: we are re-running a file that we have just compiled. You will get warnings about modules being redefined but they are safe to ignore.</p>
<p>
With the time reports in hand, there are two possible scenarios here:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
One (or several) of the passes in the report are slow. This means the slow down happens when compiling at the FUNCTION LEVEL and it will be associated with the generation of the <code>.beam</code> file for <code>ProblematicModule</code>    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
All passes are fast and the slow down happens before the reports emitted by <code>ERL_COMPILER_OPTIONS=time</code> are printed. If this is the case, the slowdown is actually happening at the MODULE LEVEL, before the generation of the <code>.beam</code> file    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
Most times, the slowdown is actually at the FUNCTION LEVEL, including the one reported as a Gettext issue, so that’s the one we will explore. Performance issues at the MODULE LEVEL may still happen though, especially in large module bodies as seen in Phoenix’s Router - but don’t worry, those have often already been optimized throughout the years!</p>
<h2>
Moving to Erlang</h2>
<p>
At this point, we have found a module that is slow to compile. Given the original Gettext issue pointed to a difference of performance between Erlang versions, my next step is to remove Elixir from the equation.</p>
<p>
Luckily, this is very easy to do with the <a href="https://github.com/michalmuskala/decompile">decompile</a> project:</p>
<pre><code>$ mix archive.install github michalmuskala/decompile
$ mix decompile ProblematicModule --to erl</code></pre>
<p>
This command will emit a <code>Elixir.ProblematicModule.erl</code> file, which is literally the compiled Elixir code, represented in Erlang. Now, let’s compile it again, but without involving Elixir at all:</p>
<pre><code>$ erlc +time Elixir.ProblematicModule.erl</code></pre>
<blockquote>
  <p>
TIP: the command above may not work out of the box. That’s because the <code>.erl</code> file generated by <code>decompile</code> may have invalid syntax. In those cases, you can manually fix those errors. They are often small nits.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you want to try it yourself, you can <a href="https://gist.github.com/josevalim/694c1799143fcf25e43aa27e3e11e4c1">find the <code>.erl</code> file for the Gettext report here</a>:</p>
<pre><code>$ erlc +time Elixir.GettextCompile.Gettext.erl</code></pre>
<p>
Here are the relevant snippets of the report I got on my machine:</p>
<pre><code>...
expand_records         :      0.065 s   19988.0 kB
core                   :      3.295 s  373293.3 kB
...
beam_ssa_bool          :      1.125 s   39252.7 kB
...
beam_ssa_bsm           :      2.432 s   39263.1 kB
   ...
beam_ssa_funs          :      0.119 s   39263.1 kB
beam_ssa_opt           :      6.242 s   39298.0 kB
   ...
...
beam_ssa_pre_codegen   :      3.426 s   48897.5 kB
   ...
...</code></pre>
<p>
Looking at the report you can start building an intuition about which passes are slow. Given we were also told the code compiled fast on Erlang/OTP 22.3, I compiled the same file with that Erlang version and compared the reports side by side. Here are my notes:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p>
The <code>core</code> pass got considerably slower between Erlang/OTP versions (from 1.8s to 3.2s)    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
Going from the <code>expand_records</code> pass to <code>core</code> increases the memory usage by almost 20 times (although this behaviour was also there on Erlang/OTP 22)    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
The <code>beam_ssa_bool</code> did not exist on Erlang/OTP 22    </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>
In Erlang/OTP 22.3, the module takes 22 seconds to compile. On version 23.1, it takes 32 seconds. We have some notes and a reasonable target of 22 seconds to optimize towards. Let’s get to work.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>
Note: it is worth saying that it is very natural for new passes to be added and others to be removed between Erlang/OTP versions, precisely because the compiler is getting smarter all the time! As part of this process, some passes get faster and others get slower. Such is life. :)  </p>
</blockquote>
<h2>
Pull request #1: the profiler option</h2>
<p>
The Erlang compiler also has a neat feature that alows us to profile any compiler pass. Since we have detected the slow down in the <code>core</code> file, let’s profile it:</p>
<pre><code>$ erlc +'{eprof, core}' Elixir.ProblematicModule.erl</code></pre>
<p>
It will print a report like this:</p>
<pre><code>core: Running eprof

****** Process &lt;0.111.0&gt;    -- 100.00 % of profiled time ***
FUNCTION                   CALLS        %      TIME  [uS / CALLS]
--------                   -----  -------      ----  [----------]
gen:do_for_proc/2              1     0.00         0  [      0.00]
gen:'-call/4-fun-0-'/4         1     0.00         0  [      0.00]
v3_core:unforce/2              2     0.00         0  [      0.00]
v3_core:make_bool_switch/5     2     0.00         0  [      0.00]
v3_core:expr_map/4             1     0.00         0  [      0.00]
v3_core:safe_map/2             1     0.00         0  [      0.00]</code></pre>
<p>
With the slowest entries coming at the bottom. In this Gettext module, the slowest entry was:</p>
<pre><code>cerl_trees:mapfold/4     3220377    19.14   2447684  [      0.76]</code></pre>
<p>
Jackpot! 20% of the compilation time was spent on a single function. This is a great opportunity for optimization.</p>
<p>
I usually like to say there are two types of performance improvements. You have semantic improvements, which you can only pull off by having a grasp of the domain. The more you understand, the more likely you are to be able to come up with an improved algorithm (or the more you will be certain you are already implementing the state of the art). There are also mechanical improvements, which are more about how the runtime and the data structures in the language work. Often you work with a mixture of both.</p>
<p>
In this case, the function <code>cerl_trees:mapfold/4</code> is a function that traverses all AST nodes recursively. You can also see it was called more than 3 million times. The <a href="https://github.com/erlang/otp/blob/db13f8883721c7a217a80cb2c73a1e419f462d83/lib/compiler/src/v3_core.erl#L3040">caller of this function in the <code>core</code> pass has the following goal</a>:</p>

<p>Bad air is bad for you. The air purifier market, though, is a mess. Every purifier uses incompatible proprietary filters, presumably to lock you into buying replacements. How do we know these actually work? Few seem to publish lab tests. And why does it cost $100-$300 for a big plastic box with a fan and a filter inside?</p>

<p>It’s common to build DIY air purifiers by basically strapping a filter to a fan. I like the idea of these, but again, it’s hard to be confident they really work. There’s a few experiments out there, but not enough to make me comfortable. So I decided to do some experimenting of my own. I made a purifier, generated smoke, and measured how well it removes tiny particles.</p>



<p>If you’re in a hurry, this post says that if you strap two HEPA filters to a box fan, it will clear the air of basically all the particles we can measure, and it will do it faster than a commercial filter that costs twice as much.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_log.jpg" alt="in a large room the DIY filter does slightly better than the commercial filter"></p>



<h3 id="diy-purifier">DIY purifier</h3>

<p>My DIY purifier was <em>very</em> simple. (I don’t want to promote any particular brands here. Contact me if you want the exact products.)</p>

<ul>
  <li>A standard box fan. (Cost: $19)</li>
  <li>Two HEPA air filters, each approximately 32 cm x 22 cm and 5cm thick. (Cost: $35 for both)</li>
  <li>A bungie cord. (Cost: Free)</li>
</ul>

<p>Assembly takes about 30s. You put the filters on the intake side of the fan and strap them on with the bungie cord. Here’s a picture:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/filter_notape.jpg" alt="DIY purifier" max-width="60%" min-width="35%"></p>

<p>Timeless elegance and grace, it is not. I get the shakes just looking at that bit of crinkled filter.</p>

<h3 id="commercial-purifier">Commercial purifier</h3>

<p>As a comparison, I got a $100 air purifier from a well-known brand that’s intended for small rooms. It uses uses a single HEPA filter that’s about 25cm x 12cm and 4cm thick. Replacement filters currently cost around $25.</p>

<h3 id="smoke">Smoke</h3>

<p>It’s surprisingly hard to repeatedly generate a consistent amount of smoke. I tried burning various things (paper, cardboard) and found that the number of particles generated can vary by an order of magnitude, depending on the burn pattern. This is difficult to control and effectively random.</p>

<p>Ideally, I’d have liked to burn some food product like oil, since the kitchen is usually the biggest source of indoor air pollution. I couldn’t figure out a good way of doing this, either: You’d need to have the same amount of oil distributed in the same way and heated to the same temperature.</p>

<p>I finally settled on using incense. I cut sticks to the length of a standard credit card and then attached the ends horizontal to the ground. This seemed to be pretty consistent. In retrospect, I bet that burning toast in a toaster would work well. (I didn’t have one on hand.)</p>

<h3 id="measurements">Measurements</h3>

<p>I borrowed a cheap-ish ($100) air quality monitor from a friend. I think it’s made by some company in China and then re-sold by various white-label brands. I can’t figure out who the original manufacturer is. Based on data I’ve seen for the reliability of other air quality monitors, I wouldn’t trust the absolute numbers, but the I think the <em>relative</em> measurements should still be OK.</p>

<p>The typical measurement for particulate pollution is “PM 2.5” which is in units of μg/m³. This is intended to measure what you’d get if you did the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Take a cubic meter of air.</li>
  <li>Filter all the solid particles out of the air.</li>
  <li>Keep only the solid particles that are are 2.5 micrometers (μm) or smaller.</li>
  <li>Weigh all the particles you kept in micrograms (μg).</li>
</ul>

<p>Here are some ways to interpret these numbers:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The EPA says yearly averages should be below 12 and daily averages below 35.</li>
  <li>The average outdoor level ranges from 6 in Finland to almost 100 in Nepal. Rich countries are typically under 15. The highest levels are typically found in Asia and Africa.</li>
  <li>Cooking can easily cause PM 2.5 measurements to spike into the hundreds. I’ve observed myself that this can happen with only a small amount of visible smoke.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="logging">Logging</h3>

<p>Since the air quality monitor doesn’t log data, I used an ultra-hacky alternative: I set the monitor next to a laptop running a stopwatch. I then aimed a tabet at both of those screens and took a timelapse video. Finally, I manually transcribed the data by going to each minute marker in the data. (This was even more tedious than it sounds.)</p>



<p>I ran a first experiment in a tiny room of around 8 ㎥. Due to worries that wind from the purifiers might change the speed the incense burned, I placed it on the opposite side of a wall, with a gap of around 20 cm near the ceiling.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/setup_tinyroom.jpg" alt="tiny room setup"></p>

<p>I repeated the experiment once with no filter, once with a commercial filter, and once with the DIY filter. Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_linear.jpg" alt="smallroom measurements in linear space"></p>

<p>Things are a bit random around the beginning, probably due to the drifting of the smoke before it’s equalized in the room. With no filter at all, this spikes all the way to 1000 μg/m³, the maximum the instrument can show.</p>

<p>If we make the y-axis logarithmic, it becomes quite clear that the DIY filter is cleaning the air at a better rate. (This is the picture from the top of this page.)</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/smallroom_log.jpg" alt="smallroom measurements in log space"></p>

<p>If we take the EPA’s threshold of 12 μg/m³, the DIY filter gets there in around 15 minutes, while the commercial filter take around 25 minutes.</p>



<p>Thankfully, I don’t spend most of my time in an 8 ㎥ room. Thus, I repeated the experiment in a large room of around 100 ㎥. Here there was no wall between incense and purifier. Instead I left around a meter of distance between the incense and purifier and the purifier and the monitor.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/setup_largeroom.jpg" alt="large room setup"></p>

<p>Here are the results:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/largeroom_linear.jpg" alt="large room measurements in linear space"></p>

<p>There’s even more randomness around the beginning, probably just due to how the smoke drifts around. Based on the room volume we’d expect a peak concentration with no filter of around 80 μg/m³ = 1000 μg/m³ * (8/100). Reassuringly, this is pretty close to what we see.</p>

<p>The DIY purifier looks a bit better. If we plot in log space, it’s more clear that it is indeed filtering at a better rate:</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/largeroom_log.jpg" alt="large room measurements in log space"></p>



<p>It’s common advice for DIY purifiers like this to seal around the edges of the filter so that all air must pass through it.  I share the intuition that this would help, but it’s hard to be sure: If you block airflow, you slow down the fan. This could be counterproductive.</p>

<p>In this case at least, experiment is easier than theory. I took packing tape and carefully sealed around the intake side.</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/filter_tape.jpg" alt="DIY purifier with tape" max-width="60%" min-width="35%"></p>

<p>And the results are…</p>

<p><img src="https://dyno-might.github.io/img/purifier/taping.jpg" alt="taping around the filter has no effect"></p>

<p>…nothing!?</p>

<p>This was unexpected. I thought the tape would help, but I wouldn’t have been surprised if it hurt instead. Instead, there’s basically no difference at all. I don’t know enough about fluid dynamics to even speculate about what’s happening here, so I won’t try.</p>

<p>There could be some weird quirk in how I ran this experiment. This doesn’t necessarily mean that all the advice to tape around the filter is <em>wrong</em>. However, I’ve never seen any experriments that show taping helps either.</p>



<p><strong>Cost.</strong> The DIY purifier isn’t dramatically cheaper than the commercial one, but I expect the filters would need to be replaced much less often. The commercial purifier uses a single filter with an area of 300 cm², whereas the DIY purifier uses two filters with a total area of around 1400 cm², and also slightly thicker. It’s reasonable to assume the DIY filters could remove ~4 times as many particles before replacement.</p>

<p><strong>Durability.</strong> One concern is that box fans aren’t meant to be used with filters attached and could wear out. This is reasonable. However, box fans are much cheaper than commercial purifiers, and I’ve been using this particular fan with various filters attached for several years now without issue.</p>

<p><strong>Electricity.</strong> The cost of electricity is another factor. Typical box fans seem to use around 55W, whereas commercial purifiers typically use 30-45W. If electricity costs $0.13 / kWh, the box fan would cost around $62 to operate 24 hours a day for a year, while a 30-watt purifier would cost around $34. Obviously, these numbers decrease if you run the purifier less. Some (more expensive) commercial purifiers have air quality sensors built in and automatically turn on only when needed.</p>

<p><strong>MERV or HEPA?</strong> Most people who build box-fan purifiers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_efficiency_reporting_value">MERV</a>-rated filters intended for furnaces. Commercial air purifiers use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HEPA">HEPA</a>-rated filters. Roughly speaking, HEPA filters are “better” in that they are rated to remove a higher percentage of particles in one pass. It’s not clear that HEPA filter will actual perform better when attached to a fan, though: A filter that catches fewer particles in one pass might still be better if it allows for faster airflow.</p>

<p><strong>That one video.</strong> If you’re reading this article after it was linked from some forum, I’d bet you that someone in the comments links to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kH5APw_SLUU">this video</a> from the Michigan Sinus Center. I found this inspirational, but note a couple of things: First, while the description says they use HEPA filter, the video clearly indicates a MERV filter. Again, that’s not necessarily bad! They claim that around 90% of particles sized 0.3 microns are larger are eliminated in a single pass. That’s good, but not totally reassuring. The question is, does it remove 99% in two passes? If 90% of the particles in the ambient air were large and the filter only catches large particles, then additional passes would never get rid of the most dangerous small particles. This is why I trust HEPA filters a bit more: since they remove almost all particles in one pass, I’m confident they should remove almost all particles eventually. This is also why I strongly prefer experiments that actually measure particles removed from the air in a room, rather than just the air coming out of the purifier.</p>

<p><strong>Further questions.</strong> There’s a lot of things that further experiments could look at:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Does the fan speed make a huge difference?</li>
  <li>How does the purifier compare to larger commercial purifiers?</li>
  <li>How do MERV-rated furnace-type filters compare under the same conditions?</li>
  <li>How can it not matter if there’s tape around the filters!?</li>
  <li>Does fan speed matter? (I always ran the box fan at maximum speed.)</li>
  <li>Is it better to put the filters on the intake or outtake side of the …</li></ol></div></div></div></div>

      <div>
        <div id="markdown" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Hello everybody! I am going to write a tutorial on how to work with CSVs using TerminusDB. That’s right, TerminusDB 4.0 now has the feature in which you can import and export CSVs, Let’s dive into this.</p>

<h3 id="how-to-create-a-database-with-csvs">How to create a database with CSVs</h3>

<ol>
  <li>Open up the TerminusDB console and create a database</li>
  <li>Fill in the Id, Name and description of your database</li>
  <li>You will find a button Create Database from CSVs <img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/1-createdb.png" alt="create database with csvs" title="create database with csvs"></li>
  <li>Click on this button to load which ever CSVs you wish to import to your database, In this blog I am going to use <a href="https://terminusdb.com/blog/2020/09/01/my-first-terminusdb-3-0-graph-bike-share-data/">The Bike Share Data</a></li>
  <li>I have added 2 CSVs into my database as shown below <img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/2-createdbwithcsvpreview.png" alt="different csvs loaded into db" title="different csvs loaded into db"></li>
  <li>And that’s it, go ahead and click on Create New database, which includes the 2 CSVs in it 😊😊😊😊😊</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="what-happens-when-you-import-csvs-into-your-database"><strong>What happens when you import CSVs into your Database?</strong></h3>

<p>On creating our database, Go to the Documents Page</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/2-dbdocumentpage.png" alt="document page view" title="document page view"></p>

<p>Each of our CSV files that were loaded on create becomes a separate Document Type. All the columns in the CSV file have been converted into properties and a schema is auto-generated.</p>

<p>Each CSV is of doctype CSV and has rows hanging off them, we can use these auto generated column properties to query the database.</p>

<p>You can also add more CSVs once you have created your database by clicking the Add CSVs</p>

<p>Go to the Schema Page to view the property types which have been generated off the columns</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/3-trasnformcsvtoproperties.png" alt="comaprison between excel and loaded csv" title="comaprison between excel and loaded csv"></p>

<h3 id="lets-query-the-database">Let’s Query the Database</h3>

<p>Get CSV Id’s, Query for type scm:CSV</p>

<div><div><pre><code>and (
    triple('v:CSV ID', 'type','scm:CSV'),
    triple('v:CSV ID', 'label', 'v:CSV Name')
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/4-querycsvid.png" alt="query database to get csv Id" title="query database to get csv Id"></p>

<p>This query simply gives you the ID and name of available CSVs in the Database. Take a note of the CSV Id you’re interested in, also visit the Schema page to get the Property Id’s your interested in as well.</p>

<p>Open a new Query Pane and try the below query</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const id="doc:CSV_bike_tutorial-1.csv"

WOQL.and (
  .limit(1).triple('v:CSV ID', 'type', 'scm:CSV')
    .eq('v:CSV ID', id)
    .triple('v:CSV ID', 'scm:csv_row', 'v:CSV Row')
    .triple('v:CSV Row', 'type', 'v:Row Type'),
  .quad('v:Property', 'domain', 'v:Row Type', 'schema/main')
    .quad('v:Property', 'label', 'v:Property Name' ,'schema/main')
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This query gets all the property Id and name from the schema graph.</p>

<p>Next, let’s query to display a few columns of our CSV, I plan to display Start Station Number, Start Station, End Station Number, End Station and Duration</p>

<div><div><pre><code>const id="doc:CSV_bike_tutorial-1.csv"

const startStationNumber = "scm:column_Start%20station%20number"
const StartStation = "scm:column_Start%20station"
const endStationNumber = "scm:column_End%20station%20number"
const endStation = "scm:column_End%20station"
const duration = "scm:column_Duration"

and (
	triple('v:CSV ID', 'type','scm:CSV').eq('v:CSV ID', id)
      .triple('v:CSV ID', 'scm:csv_row', 'v:CSV Row')
      .triple('v:CSV Row', startStationNumber, 'v:Start Station Number')
      .triple('v:CSV Row', StartStation, 'v:Start Station')
      .triple('v:CSV Row', endStationNumber, 'v:End Station Number')
      .triple('v:CSV Row', endStation, 'v:End Station')
      .triple('v:CSV Row', duration, 'v:Duration')
)
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>All the rows of CSV matching the column names will be displayed on running this query</p>

<p>So yeah that’s it, you can do all sorts of queries on your CSV</p>

<h3 id="how-to-update-csv">How to update CSV</h3>

<p>I am going to show an example in which I change the duration of Bike number W22558 to 500 in my CSV file and I am going to update this change. So we go to Document Page and click on Add CSVs and add the CSV of interest</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/6-updatcsv.png" alt="update csv" title="update csv"></p>

<p>Since bike_tutorial-1.csv already exists, console will automatically prompt you to update the CSV. Input a commit message of what we have changed and hit on Upload CSV.</p>

<p>The brilliant part about the update is that only diffs are considered and updated which makes update of big sized files more efficient. To understand this, Go to DB Home Page -&gt; Latest Updates</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/7-latestudates.png" alt="DB Home latest updates " title="DB Home latest updates "></p>

<p>Click on your recent update, The only change on update was the row for bike W22558 of duration 417 was removed and a new row for bike W22558 with duration 500 was added instead. This makes updates of CSVs much more quick 😊😊😊😊😊</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/8-updatechange.png" alt="comparison between commits" title="comparison between commits"></p>

<p>You can also time travel on the database to see the diffs on CSV files over time.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/9-commitime.png" alt="time travel on data" title="time travel on data"></p>

<h3 id="export-your-csv">Export your CSV</h3>

<p>Now that we have imported our CSVs into our database we can do whatever we like or modify it however we want and Export this CSV back.</p>

<p>Go to Documents, and filter for all CSV types to get a download option as shown and download the CSV.</p>

<p><img src="https://terminusdb.com/blog/assets/uploads/5-export.png" alt="export csv from document page " title="export csv from document page "></p>

<p>So here we go, this tutorial shows a very simple way to import  CSVs into TerminusDB and play with them and do all sorts of useful cool queries, whatever you like.</p>

<p>Earlier we had to do all the steps mentioned in <a href="https://terminusdb.com/blog/2020/07/13/terminusdb-importing-reordering-exporting-a-csv/">TerminusDB: Importing, Reordering &amp; Exporting a CSV</a> not anymore!</p>

<p>Now it’s just a few button clicks and voilà!</p>

<blockquote><p>“The only thing that matters is getting to product-market fit… Product-market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.”</p><cite> MARC ANDREESSEN</cite></blockquote>
</div></div>



<p>Marc Andreessen wrote these words back in 2007, coining the term product-market fit. While the concept has gained widespread adoption there remains a lack of consensus on what it means at a more precise level. For an early stage company, it is still really hard to both recognize the signs of product-market fit, as well as to optimally execute towards amplifying these early signals.</p>



<p>At Tribe Capital we recognize the importance of objectively measuring product-market fit and have developed frameworks to do so using company data. It has not been easy: we have exercised and refined these frameworks hundreds of times across companies in a wide variety of industries across our collective operating and investing history spanning companies such as Facebook, Slack, Front, Carta, and countless other early stage companies. But the payoff has been worth it. These analytical tools are not only useful to inform and improve our investment decisions, but also provide invaluable perspective for founders and operators looking to achieve or amplify existing product-market fit.</p>



<p>This article will first go into greater detail of why we believe a quantitative approach to product-market fit is important. Then it will outline in detail three types of analyses we employ at Tribe Capital to understand product-market fit in a given company. Finally, there are some closing thoughts regarding opportunities for further analysis as well as an appendix that addresses some frequently asked questions.</p>



<h3>Accounting for Product-Market Fit</h3>



<p>A quantitative approach to product-market fit for startups is akin to the discipline of financial accounting. The income statement and balance sheet are the <em>lingua franca</em> for an established company to communicate the financial health of its business. These accounting concepts are often unhelpful when inspecting an unprofitable early-stage company. For a startup, what’s needed is a common quantitative language for what matters, namely, a quantitative framework for assessing product-market fit.</p>



<p>Just as larger companies employ accountants to monitor financial health (cash flows, profitability, etc), so to do product-oriented startups employ people to monitor the health of its product-market fit. They just go by a different name: data scientists. The term “data science” as currently used in the industry is quite broad and covers a wide spectrum of activities spanning what would be better thought of as ML engineering all the way to activities that are typically focused on decision-making and often referred to as “analytics”. For our purposes, we tend to use the latter end of the spectrum as there are numerically more data scientists in analytics style roles than in ML engineering style roles and because the analytics use case is more broadly applicable in early stage companies. In any case, from our point of view, accountants were the first data scientists.</p>



<p>The functional roles of accountants and data scientists are similar: take a big pile of raw data and use it to dig into important aspects of the business. Accountants work with a ledger of every financial transaction to answer whether the business is cash-flow positive, how costs are broken down between fixed and variable, what are the assets and liabilities, etc. Data scientists work with large datasets of customer activity to determine how the product is growing, how retention/churn is playing out, etc. This is why we have chosen to make data science a central component to what we are building at Tribe Capital.</p>



<p><strong>Accounting: Financial Health ↔ “Data Science” : Product-Market Fit</strong></p>



<p>In our development of frameworks for product-market fit, we have taken cues from the principles of accounting and tried to adhere to the following tenets:</p>



<ul><li><strong>Simple</strong>: Definitions should be easy to understand.</li><li><strong>Detailed</strong>: Yet well-defined enough to be useful.</li><li><strong>Universal</strong>: Applicable to a broad range of products and businesses.</li></ul>



<p>In accounting, the three most important frameworks for understanding a business are the balance sheet, income statement, and cash flow statement. These three statements do not provide a complete picture of a company’s health, but they provide a useful snapshot that can be used to benchmark it against other businesses across sectors.</p>



<p>Along those lines, we view product-market fit through three standardized analyses:</p>



<ul><li>Growth Accounting</li><li>Customer Cohorts</li><li>Distribution of Product-Market Fit</li></ul>



<p>As with financial statements, we do not claim these analyses to be an exhaustive definition of product-market fit. Rather, they provide a consistent and extensible method for breaking down customer behavior while being detailed enough to be useful. Also note that most people think of product-market fit in binary terms – either you have it or you don’t. In contrast, we tend to think of it as a spectrum similar to the concept of “financially healthy” for a more mature business.</p>



<p>As investors, we use these analytical techniques to understand whether a company has achieved product-market fit. While these analyses are a critical component of our investment process, they are not the sole deciding factor but are rather a starting point for discussion. We use them the same way Warren Buffet uses financial statements to guide his investments. Does he look at them? Absolutely. Would he ever pass based on financial statements? Absolutely. Would he ever invest based only on financial statements? Hopefully not.</p>



<p>For founders and operators, these frameworks are useful to understand and amplify a company’s growth. We have found that nearly every successful technology company founded in the last two decades has employed them in one form or another. The frameworks provide precise concepts and quantitative relationships that are useful for understanding how customers engage with the company’s product while being universal enough to be applicable in almost any context in which the concept of product-market fit is useful.</p>



<h3>Growth Accounting</h3>



<p>The first technique we use at Tribe Capital when looking at a company is “growth accounting,” which breaks down overall growth in some activity across specific customer segments. The activity can be anything, though revenue and product engagement are the most common examples of growth accounting. To begin, we will focus on revenue and then abstract into engagement later on.</p>



<p>There are six categories that revenue can be bucketed into:</p>



<ul><li><strong>New</strong>: Gained from customers were first active in the present time period.</li><li><strong>Churned</strong>: Lost when a customer who was active in the previous time period has no revenue in the present one.</li><li><strong>Resurrected</strong>: Gained from customers who had churned at some point in the past (and thus generated no revenue in the previous time period) but resumed in the present.</li><li><strong>Expansion</strong>: Gained from customers increasing revenue relative to the previous time period.</li><li><strong>Contraction</strong>: Lost from customers decreasing (but not to zero, otherwise they would be churned) revenue relative to the previous time period.</li><li><strong>Retained: </strong>Carried over by customers from the previous time period to the present one.</li></ul>



<p>For example, a customer who spent $10 last month and $12 this month would have $2 in expansion revenue and $10 in retained revenue. However, if this customer instead spent $8 this month (while still spending $10 last month), then $8 would be counted as retained and $2 as contracted.</p>



<p>There are three important identities that express the definitions above:</p>



<ol start="1"><li>All revenue in the present time period is equal to the sum of the gains in revenue (new, resurrected, and expansion) and retained revenue.</li></ol>



<p>Revenue(t) = retained(t) + new(t) + resurrected(t) + expansion(t)</p>



<ol start="2"><li>All revenue from the previous time period must either churn, contract, or be retained in the present time period.</li></ol>



<p>Revenue(t-1) = retained(t) + churned(t) + contraction(t)</p>



<ol start="3"><li>All <em>change</em> in revenue across a time period is equal to the sum of the gains (new, expansion, and resurrected) minus the sum of the losses (churned and contraction). </li></ol>



<p>Revenue(t) – Revenue(t-1) = new(t) + expansion(t) + resurrected (t) – churned(t) – contraction(t)</p>



<p>For the last identity, we can convert the terms into percentages (e.g. “% New” is new revenue divided by total revenue from the previous time period) to frame everything in terms of the overall growth rate.</p>



<p>Growth_rate ~ New_rate + Resurrected_rate + Expansion_rate – Contraction_rate – Churn_rate</p>



<p>There are three useful statistics that come out of growth accounting:</p>



<p><strong>1. Gross retention</strong> is equal to retained revenue divided by total revenue from the previous time period.</p>



<p>Gross retention = retained(t) / revenue(t-1)</p>



<p><strong>2. Quick ratio</strong> is the sum of gains in revenue (new, resurrected, and expansion) divided by the losses in revenue (churned and contraction).</p>



<p>Quick ratio = [new(t) + resurrected(t) + expansion(t)] / [churned(t) + contraction(t)]</p>



<p>Quick ratio measures how efficiently a company is growing in terms of revenue gained per every unit of revenue lost. (By its definition, a quick ratio below 1.0x means that total revenue must be shrinking.)</p>



<p><strong>3. Net churn </strong>is the sum of losses minus gains in revenue from existing customers only (i.e. excluding new customers) divided by total revenue from the previous time period.</p>



<p>Net_Churn = [churned(t) + contraction(t) – resurrected(t) – expansion(t)] / revenue(t-1)</p>



<p>Note that, by definition…</p>



<p>Growth_rate ~ New_rate – Net_churn</p>



<p>For example, a company with 2% net churn loses 2% of its revenue assuming that it generates no new customers. Note that net churn can be negative, which means that the company will grow revenue even <em>without </em>gaining new customers. Usually, negative net churn is achieved by the company getting significant expansion revenue from its customer base and is a positive signal in any business.</p>

        <p><span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p>Believe it or not, popups don’t exist just to be annoying.&nbsp;</p>
<!--more-->
<p>They are actually a very powerful way to encourage users to perform a certain action or pay attention to something that will lead to conversion. But before we dive into that, let’s get the basics down.</p>
<h2><strong>What are Popups?&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>Popups are the boxes that pop up on your screen when you enter a page on an app or website. They temporarily block the content you intend to access and are paired with a call-to-action to get you to do or pay attention to something.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This CTA can range from inviting you to subscribe to their newsletters, sign up for membership, or check out an event that’s currently taking place. In other words, they intend to direct your focus towards something and trigger a certain action or behavior.</p>
<h2><strong>Popup Triggers</strong></h2>
<p>A popup trigger basically controls when a popup opens on a page. Here’s a simple breakdown of some of the most common triggers available by off-the-shelf popup makers and the uses they’re most well suited for.</p>
<h2><span>1. Time-based</span></h2>
<p>This trigger opens a popup after a set amount of time has passed. For example, a popup that appears 3 seconds after a user enters a website’s home page.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is the most popular out of all triggers. Popups that use this trigger are commonly seen on e-commerce websites and apps during flash sales or seasonal offers, as well as most websites that push for newsletter subscriptions.</p>
<h2>2. Behavior-based</h2>
<p>Behavior simply refers to any action a user performs on a platform. For example, popups with behavior-based triggers can be conditioned to open when a user:</p>
<p><span>•&nbsp;</span>Clicks on certain elements on a page (buttons, links, images, text, etc)<br><span>•&nbsp;</span>Scrolls a certain distance down a page<br><span>•&nbsp;</span>Visits a specific number of pages</p>
<p>These types of triggers are great for a big variety of uses, the most common being to let users view details of an item or play media on a popup without needing them to leave a page.</p>
<h2>3. Exit-intent</h2>
<p>Popups with these triggers open when a visitor attempts to leave a page, prompting them with a customizable message.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On desktop browsers, these triggers can operate with soft exit detection technology to trigger a popup when the user’s cursor leaves a page. Hard exit prevention can also be used to trigger a popup when the user refreshes the page, closes the tab, or hits the back button.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These triggers are effective for prompting users to think again before they abandon a site. For example, showing users a popup that says “Are you sure you want to abandon your shopping cart?” before they leave a checkout page can quickly get them to reconsider.</p>
<h2><strong>How to Make Your Popups Effective</strong></h2>
<p>While it’s true that 80% of the time website visitors would immediately look for the tiny ‘X’ to get rid of a popup, when done in a way that hits all the right spots, popups can do wonders for conversion.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Think of them as a quick sales pitch — Since the content on the page is blocked by the popup, you’ve got a few seconds of your visitor’s undivided attention. Can you get them to do what you want them to do in those few seconds?</p>
<h2><span><strong>Get to the Point</strong></span></h2>
<p>Popups aren’t the time and place for long eloquent copy. Remember, you’ve only got a few seconds to get your point across.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you’re trying to get visitors to checkout with a discount code, you might want to only highlight the discount percentage, discount code, a simple CTA, and important details like the validity period to spark a sense of urgency.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/daugdkLGx6AAfwc0M5B2YGCyLHXr0630IWBEo8rWM7LMKmHj5ybE-qLUcHjBb4EVFYMU4kx4EEYlTxvD-px5Zs31ReFWH-TQFJ0SBn11912KzZfHJcSAIpwxbFGLBc170tJ1mZvo" width="624" height="345" alt="Shopback popup google chrome button extension cta"></span></p>
<p>Upon entry, visitors who access ShopBack on Google Chrome will get a popup that encourages them to add the ShopBack button extension to their browser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This popup gets to the point by telling users what the extension can do — automatically find and apply cashbacks and coupons. They also make it clear that getting this button only takes 2 clicks, and pair the message with simple graphics that are easy to understand.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Within 3 sentences and an image, the idea is sold. That’s how you get to the point.</p>
<h2><strong>Cohesive Design</strong></h2>
<p>Prevent your popups from looking like spam. Make sure they look like they’re part of your brand by using colors, fonts, and graphics that are cohesive with the rest of your platform.</p>
<p><span><img src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/DmXhU3W0n2xQeze1vVE4TRWUhlCR7RJaV7JliyQajeQ75YezUUdgT1vje7gwXqqK1-aj-OjHKDd8nLs5Nb9lVM1vbnZ52nkI66Pvd7B_WiGJn43WPRLU6tML64FFq2aysAd3OALU" width="624" height="345" alt="shopee popup 1212 sale free delivery no minimum spend new uses only cta"></span></p>
<p>Shopee’s 12.12 sale popup is a great example of cohesive design that helps accentuate and draw attention to the main message.</p>
<p>Getting straight to the point, the popup highlights “No Min. Spend” followed by “Free Delivery” with the same clear and bold typefaces used throughout their website, against their signature orange and blue accents.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The simplicity of the popup layout also prevents information overload. By keeping the design clean and simple, there’s less room for confusion and more room for the main message to stand out.</p>
<h2><strong>Let Users Decide</strong></h2>
<p>Lastly, make sure the exit door is easy to find. Don’t try to hide the ‘X’ button to “trap” your visitors. That won’t make them want to click on your CTA more. In fact, they might even get frustrated with your platform.</p>
<p>Respecting their choice to say No will leave a better impression on them than if you force them to say Yes, and that’s what you should aim for — users who voluntarily choose you.</p>
<p>This also means you shouldn’t suffocate returning users with the same popup every time they enter your app or platform. Give them space to breathe and chances are they’ll have a better experience on your platform.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Get Help from an Agency</strong></h2>

                    <p><em>Written by Jonah Kanner and Jameson Rollins of LIGO Laboratory, California Institute of Technology and Leo Singer of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center.</em></p><p>Gravitational-wave detectors - like <a href="https://ligo.org/">LIGO</a> and <a href="https://www.virgo-gw.eu/">Virgo</a> - are some of the newest tools being used to explore objects in distant galaxies. The current generation of detectors began observing in 2015, and since then, have published observations of 50 collisions of black holes and neutron stars. These exciting discoveries are changing the way astrophysicists are learning about a broad range of topics - including how stars evolve, the expansion rate of the universe, and the deep laws that describe gravity and other fundamental forces.</p><p>LIGO and Virgo data are freely available through the <a href="https://www.gw-openscience.org/about/">Gravitational Wave Open Science Center (GWOSC)</a>. These public data sets are being used all over the world, by scientists, teachers, students, and artists, and have contributed to the publication of over 100 scientific articles over the past year.</p><h2 id="barriers-to-learning">Barriers to learning</h2><p>There’s one challenge encountered by everyone getting started with gravitational-wave data for the first time: &nbsp;most options for working with these data sets demand installing specialized software libraries and writing computer code to process and display the results. For professional scientists, this is often OK - a full-time researcher can afford to spend a few hours installing and learning new software, and likely has already had some experience programming. But for a much broader audience - including high school students, teachers, and artists - writing code in Python to just get started with gravitational-wave data is a significant barrier.</p><p>We’d experimented with a few different options to make this transition easier. In fact, cloud hosted <a href="https://www.gw-openscience.org/tutorials/">Jupyter notebooks</a> provided a big step forward, and we were able to show students how to write code to work with our data, without asking them to install any libraries on their own machines. But when we shared these notebooks with teachers and artists, they were not interested: <strong>they wanted some way to work with gravitational-wave data without using any code at all!</strong></p><p>Moreover, it's not just new students who can benefit from an easier method to access LIGO/Virgo data. Even though professional scientists often <em>could </em>write specialized code to make the plot they want, it’s not efficient to have lots of scientists re-writing code to make the most popular plots.</p><h2 id="enter-streamlit">Enter Streamlit</h2><p>Knowing that we had a need for a web app for the most common plots - both to broaden access and to improve research efficiency - we were excited to discover <a href="https://www.streamlit.io/">Streamlit</a>. Python is very popular in our research community, so Streamlit apps can easily make use of some of the most cutting-edge modules used for gravitational-wave research. For example, <a href="https://pycbc.org/">pycbc</a> and <a href="https://gwpy.github.io/">gwpy</a> are packages used by many gravitational-wave researchers to process and display LIGO/Virgo data. With Streamlit, we can easily write apps that let students and scientists use these packages, without writing any code themselves. Because GWOSC provides data access through a simple API, we found that Streamlit apps can access data on demand, and so process and display any segment of public data.</p><figure><iframe width="612" height="344" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ytV1KhjEQbs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe><figcaption><a href="https://www.gw-openscience.org/path/">Getting started video from GWOSC Learning Paths - video created by Cardiff University Physics &amp; Astronomy</a></figcaption></figure><p>Today, we’re using two Streamlit apps to introduce students to LIGO/Virgo data as part of the <a href="https://www.gw-openscience.org/path/">GWOSC Learning Paths</a>, and a third app, the <a href="https://range.ligo.org/">Gravitational Wave Inspiral Range Calculator</a>, allows scientists and astronomers to easily calculate how far into the universe current and future detectors can see.</p><h2 id="working-with-data">Working with data</h2><p>To help students and scientists get started working with gravitational-wave data, we wrote the <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/jkanner/streamlit-dataview/master/app.py/+/">GW Quickview App</a> to make some common plots with any stretch of data. Users can instantly make plots by selecting a published gravitational-wave event from a list, or by entering any time LIGO and Virgo were running. The Quickview App has access to the full public archive of LIGO/Virgo data - around 30 TB and growing! Sliders allow the user to set filter and plotting options, and even to directly download the filtered data. In most cases, you can see the signal from a black hole merger or neutron star collision with just a few clicks. This app is a great way to take a first peak at a segment of data and explore the archive.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.23-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.23-PM.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.23-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.23-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.23-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://share.streamlit.io/jkanner/streamlit-dataview/master/app.py/+/">GW Quickview App</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="how-far-can-ligo-see">How far can LIGO see?</h2><p>One of the most important things to know about a gravitational-wave detector is how sensitive it is to the kinds of signals it’s capable of detecting. Ground-based gravitational-wave detectors primarily target the mergers of black holes or neutron stars, also known as compact binary coalescences (CBCs). Since the amplitude of a CBC signal is inversely proportional to how far away it is, the question is usually asked in terms of how far away can we detect the signal from a given type of CBC. In LIGO’s first observing run (O1) the LIGO detectors could detect binary neutron star (BNS) mergers out to a distance of roughly 70 megaparcecs (Mpc), or 230 million light-years. As the detectors have improved, the so-called “inspiral range” has increased as well; during the O3 run the LIGO BNS inspiral range was nearly 120 Mpc. Every time the range doubles the volume of space searched goes up by a factor of 8, and the event rate is proportional to volume. That’s a lot more events!</p><p>While plenty of tools exist to calculate the range for a given detector, all of them required special access and knowledge to run. With Streamlit, we were able to create a simple web app tool for anyone to <a href="https://range.ligo.org/">calculate the inspiral range for any type of CBC</a> they wish, for any point of the past observing runs, or even for hypothetical detectors that are yet to be built. This app should be useful for LIGO scientists, for the general astronomy community, and for the public at large.<br></p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.00-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.00-PM.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.00-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.00-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.10.00-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://range.ligo.org/">Gravitational Wave Inspiral Range Calculator</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="finding-signals-in-the-noise">Finding signals in the noise</h2><p>Gravitational wave signals are typically buried in noise; finding them requires a few signal processing tricks. These signal processing concepts are new to many students, and can be a barrier to understanding data from LIGO and Virgo. Working with Professor Amber Stuver at Villanova, we created an app to let students try out some signal processing in an easy to use, interactive environment. The <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/jkanner/streamlit-audio/main/app.py">Signal Processing Tutorial</a> asks visitors to apply high-pass filtering and whitening to noisy data, to find a secret sound hidden in the noise. Then, they can try their new skills on some real data, and try to recreate a well known plot showing the first gravitational-wave observation of a binary black hole merger. Following hints from a <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/uc-davis-tool-tracks-californias-covid-19-cases-by-region/">post by Pranav Pandit</a>, we found we were able to speed up the app by porting plots from <code>matplotlib</code> to <code>altair</code>, so that students can adjust plot parameters and see updates almost instantly.</p><figure><img src="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.12.26-PM.png" alt="" srcset="https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.12.26-PM.png 600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.12.26-PM.png 1000w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.12.26-PM.png 1600w, https://blog.streamlit.io/content/images/size/w2400/2020/12/Screen-Shot-2020-12-07-at-11.12.26-PM.png 2400w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption><a href="https://share.streamlit.io/jkanner/streamlit-audio/main/app.py">Signal Processing Tutorial</a></figcaption></figure><h2 id="building-the-app">Building the app</h2><p>We built the GW Quickview App partly as an experiment, to see how easy it would be to run some of our favorite python modules in Streamlit. In this case, we tried using gwpy, which has a number of handy methods for finding, processing, and plotting LIGO and Virgo data.</p><h3 id="data-discovery-and-download">Data discovery and download</h3><p>The <a href="https://github.com/jkanner/streamlit-dataview">app code</a> uses the gwosc client for data discovery, to get a list of all published gravitational-wave events, and find their GPS times:</p><pre><code>
from gwosc import datasets
eventlist = datasets.find_datasets(type='events')
chosen_event = st.sidebar.selectbox('Select Event', eventlist)
t0 = datasets.event_gps(chosen_event)

</code></pre><p>Then, it uses gwpy to download the data file with the corresponding time:</p><pre><code>
from gwpy.timeseries import TimeSeries
strain = TimeSeries.fetch_open_data(detector, t0-14, t0+14, cache=False)


</code></pre><p>The strain data are stored in some pretty big files (up to 500 MB), so we used the cache feature of <code>streamlit</code> to allow users to change plot parameters without needing to repeat the data download.</p><h3 id="data-processing">Data processing</h3><p>To make plots where you can see a signal in GW data, some signal processing steps are needed to reduce the impact of noise. The app uses the <a href="https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/api/gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.html"><code>bandpass()</code> and <code>whiten()</code></a> <a href="https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/api/gwpy.timeseries.TimeSeries.html">methods</a> of gwpy to do this. Sliders allow the user to set the limits on the band-pass filter, and to toggle whitening on or off. The app also uses the gwpy <a href="https://gwpy.github.io/docs/stable/examples/timeseries/qscan.html"><code>q_transform</code></a> method to make a beautiful time-frequency plot, which allows most detectable events to be clearly seen in the figure. Additional sliders allow setting plot parameters, so the user can fine-tune the time-frequency plot to look just right. We even used the new <code>streamlit beta_expander<strong>()</strong></code><strong> </strong>to allow the user to display hints about how to understand the plots and set the parameters.</p><h3 id="display-the-plots">Display the plots</h3><p>Finally, the app displays several plots to visualize the data. We opted to use convenient methods in gwpy to make plots with <code>matplotlib</code>, which saved us from writing code to style and label the plots. That fact that Streamlit can easily display these plots with <code>streamlit.pyplot()</code> was a big plus for us, and the Streamlit team helped us fix some <a href="https://blog.streamlit.io/uc-davis-tool-tracks-californias-covid-19-cases-by-region/">issues related to thread-safety</a> when using this feature.</p><p>Though we know that Streamlit apps run faster when plotting with <code>altair</code> (we used this trick in another app!), for the GW Quickview App, we chose to keep the <code>matplotlib</code> plots, mainly to demonstrate the handy plotting features built into gwpy.</p><h2 id="the-big-picture">The big picture </h2><p>A number of break-throughs in the past few years have proved that gravitational-wave detectors represent a new and exciting way to learn about our universe. To make use of this new technology, we’ll need to train the next generation of scientists who will build the instruments of the future and study their observations. After getting started with Streamlit apps and <a href="https://www.gw-openscience.org/path/">GWOSC Learning Paths</a>, we hope some students will move on to use …</p></div></section></article></div></div></div>

<p>I heard a lot about impostor syndrome. But there’s something bigger than that. The size of the developers ego. It’s unbelievable. Let’s talk about it.</p>



<h3>Sunday Rockstar</h3>



<p>By the end of summer 2013, my head was so big I couldn’t get through doors. At that point, I only have two years of experience behind me. So I’m just coming out of the “junior period”. <strong>And above all, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.24joursdeweb.fr/2019/reconnaitre-et-mettre-fin-a-ton-burnout/" target="_blank">in the previous episode of this story</a>(french version), I was doing a complete burn-out because of a project that came straight from hell.</strong> It was basically a trap. Not enough time and a monstrous scope.</p>



<p>After almost two months of work, like a maniac, I shipped a huge app for a big client. I’ve done it ! I did this alone. I did this on time. And i really felt that I had gained expertise.</p>



<p>After a period of post-burnout depression, I came back angry. So angry. <strong>This prowess</strong> <strong>made my head swell up like crazy.</strong> I really thought I was an important person. I would arrive in the morning and walk across the open space without saying hello to anyone.</p>



<div><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://media.giphy.com/media/NThhQp6mHoFkVuRw9y/giphy.gif" alt="ego"></figure></div>



<p>I would sit at my desk and start my day by complaining about totally stupid customer requests. Then, I would go into meetings and make monologues about how stuff should be made. <strong>I didn’t give a fuck what anybody else was saying.</strong> I was in a special situation. One of the most experienced dev in this little organization. And, in my head, everything I touched turned to gold.</p>



<p>I used to do the same thing all the time. Same technology, same projects, same issues, same context, same load, again and again. In a situation like that, without any challenge, it’s easy to produce fast and well. <strong>It galvanized me in my feeling of being the best. </strong>I told myself that everything was so simple. And if anyone wasn’t keeping pace, I would immediately point the finger at them in the most toxic way possible.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/k7SWxdv.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/k7SWxdv.jpg" alt="finger"></figure>



<p>This situation lasted for months. It was bad. And since I was relying only on my past exploits, it was impossible for me to evolve. <strong>And then one day, a major event suddenly changed my approach to everything.</strong></p>



<h3>Why so arrogant?</h3>



<p>Before that, I would like to discuss why this ego overflow is relatively common in tech.</p>



<p>First of all, because companies are at the mercy of technology. In this context, you are the one who gives answers and really knows how the product works. Worse than that, they see what you do like black magic. Like an illusionist, most people don’t understand what you’re doing. But everybody thinks it’s extraordinary. <strong>When people tell you that you’re a magician all the time, you end up believing it.</strong> And each time you do, a dose of ego is injected into your skull.</p>



<p>Juniors are more affected by the phenomenon than seniors. Many companies do the same thing, the same way, all the time. And when it’s so easy, you don’t realize it anymore. <strong>When you don’t know what you don’t know, you think you know everything.</strong> And when a junior is not tutored and/or accompanied by more senior developers, it’s dangerous. You end up with an arrogant kid who thinks he’s a killer.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/i1DfNLW.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/i1DfNLW.jpg" alt="ego"></figure>



<p>Also, our field is extremely competitive. Voluntarily or not, companies put developers in competition with each other. Who will be the first to solve the bug? Who has the best architecture? Who knows the most? And I’m not even talking about the competitions that are legion. <strong>And you, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.topcoder.com/tc?module=AlgoRank" target="_blank">how high are you ranked</a> ?</strong> In such an extreme competitive environment, egos can be spectacular.</p>



<p>It’s not reserved to juniors. A lot of developers with more experience are affected, too. What you do is super complicated. <strong>Solving complex problems, faster and faster, of course it flatters ego.</strong> And if you’re not careful, you can quickly fall into disdain for others who don’t keep up. Especially with the juniors. Most developers take a pedagogical and tutoring approach. Others become jerks.</p>



<p>What makes the two profiles quite different is the acceptance of a simple fact. <strong>You don’t know everything, anyone can teach you something, and that’s very positive.</strong> And sometimes it only takes one event to realize that.</p>



<h3>Back to reality</h3>



<p>After several months of nonsense, I was at the top of my bullshit.<strong> King of idiots in a world without any challenges.</strong> And since there was no one to calm me down, it could have gone on for a long time.</p>



<p>And one Friday night, I joined my entire company for drinks at a nearby bar. This company was working in a big co-working space with a lot of other companies. And all these companies were smaller, but their projects were technically very challenging.</p>



<p>I show up and yell at anyone that I’m an expert in just about everything. Oh, yeah, I do architecture and everything else. It was fucking ridiculous. Anyway, at that moment a senior developer from another company hears me talking shit in the distance and comes up to me. He needs to talk to an expert for one of his issues. And in my great kindness, I agree to give him some time.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/c8Toum8.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/c8Toum8.jpg" alt="meet"></figure>



<p>And I’m not lying to you, <strong>I didn’t understand all the words in his problem statement</strong>. I was shocked, but I tried to follow what he was telling me as best I could. He exposed to me his problem and asked me what type of data structure, and therefore what algorithm, would be the most optimized for his problem in his existing architecture. </p>



<p>It was an extremely advanced problem. <strong>It dealt with concepts that I had vaguely discussed in school, but never practiced.</strong> He felt that i was confused, so he took it down a notch and asked me what I thought about this or that language for his problem. I had no idea because I was working with only one language and was not interested in anything else. And that’s when he started teaching me about life on my own language that he knocked me out.</p>



<div><figure><img src="data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E" data-src="https://qph.fs.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-073103809f1b257a483269bc99d48db5" alt="ego"></figure></div>



<p>The worst part of this story is that in reality, this dude was very nice with me. <strong>I’m the one who mistook this for violence.</strong> It was violence for my ego. I wasn’t ready, but it was exactly what I needed at the time. Pain is a great teacher. And it hurted like hell.</p>



<h3>It’s all relative</h3>



<p>Being efficient and productive for your team is your main goal. Once you get there, there’s something you need to keep in mind. <strong>You are efficient and productive in this context.</strong> Once you’re out of that context, you’re going to have to rethink and question yourself.</p>



<p><strong>The myth of the developer who knows absolutely everything is totally false.</strong> There will always be someone to teach you something, because there’s too much to learn. The problem is that if you convince yourself you’re a god, you’ll end up believing it. The higher your ego will take you, the harder the fall.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/I2RIDze.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/I2RIDze.jpg" alt="fall"></figure>



<p>And there are other hellish effects of having so many high ego profiles in our field. First of all, <strong>it’s intimidating for a lot of people</strong>, but more importantly, <strong>it can very quickly jeopardize entire projects</strong>.</p>



<h3>Ego programming</h3>



<p>A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away, I saw with my own eyes computer projects blown up in mid-air because of overflowing egos.</p>



<p>I saw a team of big senior developers get together for an ambitious project. The idea was to go fast. When the time came to make technical decisions, no one agreed. <strong>Nobody wanted to be wrong and sit on their ego.</strong> And when the first insults appear in pull requests, the project got reboot.</p>



<p>I saw a lead tech forcing his homemade framework. Every developer without exception politely asked for a free and more maintainable solution. <strong>This lead tech decreed that the only choice was his homemade framework.</strong> This dude ego cost the company several developers in a matter of weeks.</p>



<p>I’ve seen so many times entire days of work wasted because a developer was too proud to ask for help. I’ve seen so many times developers redo code they thought was bad without asking the author why. I could go on like that for a long time. </p>



<h3>Egoless programming</h3>



<p>The weekend after this big discussion with this developer, I felt bad. I finally got my head out of my ass and realized I had so much to learn that it was scary. </p>



<p>The more I evolve and learn in this job, the more I realize how much I don’t know. Since that day, I have approached this job with humility. <strong>This trigger tremendously helped me in my career.</strong> And I strongly advise you to do the same. Stay proud of what you’ve accomplished and what you know, but be aware of what you don’t know.</p>



<figure><img src="https://i.imgur.com/NvadHD5.jpg" data-src="https://i.imgur.com/NvadHD5.jpg" alt="rise"></figure>



<p>It’s the same pattern all over the place. <strong>Huge egos, immaturity and a lack of perspective in a highly competitive environment.</strong> When I see initiatives like <a href="https://compassionatecoding.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compassionate coding</a> or the well known <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/the-ten-commandments-of-egoless-programming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 commandments of egoless programming</a>, I tell myself that I’m not the only one to have noticed all this.</p>



<h3>Ego is important</h3>



<p>Now, be careful, ego is still important. <strong>You need confidence in yourself and your abilities.</strong> Approaching this job with humility doesn’t mean letting yourself be stepped on. It means taking the time to listen to everyone before giving your point of view. It means taking everyone’s ideas into account in an unbiased way. <strong>It means making your solution heard when you’re right.</strong> It means accepting when you’re wrong.</p>



<p>Understanding that no one is irreplaceable. <strong>Not you, not me, not your boss, not your CTO</strong>. Understand that calling your colleagues bad is not going to help the project go forward. Understand that just because you consider yourself a god doesn’t mean it’s true. Understand that if you make a mistake it’s not the end of the world. Besides, it’s okay if someone points it out to you. Understanding that it’s your mistakes that will make you grow faster.</p>



<h3>Epilogue</h3>



<p>If this article can even trigger a single click in someone, I would be very happy. There’s still a lot to be said on the subject, but I prefer to stick to the essentials. Your huge misplaced ego won’t get you anywhere. It’s time to keep it out of your career.</p>

</ul>

<p>I’m pleased to finally have some results to show for a project I’ve been working on in my spare time for the last year or so.</p>

<p>The idea originated when I was trying to think of an interesting idea for a project to help me learn Verilog and FPGA design, and the notion of building a simple raytracer came to mind (partly inspired by a scarily smart friend of mine who is building his own GPU). A bit later - because sometimes my brain hates me and delights in coming up with silly things to do - this turned into “wouldn’t it be interesting to try making a SNES do raytracing?”, and thus the SuperRT chip idea was born.</p>

<p>What I wanted to try and do was something akin to the Super FX chip used in titles such as Star Fox, where the SNES runs the game logic and hands off a scene description to a chip in the cartridge to generate the visuals. To that end I’ve deliberately tried to restrict myself to just using a single custom chip for the design, not making use of the ARM core available on the DE10 board or any other external processing resources.</p>

<p>The end results look something like this:</p>

<p>Apologies for the poor screenshot quality, incidentally - for some reason my capture card produces terrible results when capturing from my SNES, so I had to resort to the good old “photograph the screen in a darkened room” approach.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Hardware.jpg" alt="SuperRT development hardware"></p>

<p>The Super Nintendo (technically a Super Famicom) seen here has had the case removed to make room for the cabling, but other than that is totally unmodified. Attached to it is the PCB from a copy of an <em>awful</em> Pachinko game I picked up for 100 yen at a local second-hand store, with the game ROM removed and replaced with a cable breakout. This then passes through a set of level shifters to convert the SNES’s 5v down to 3.3v and then into a DE10-Nano FPGA development board with a Cyclone V FPGA. The level shifter boards are anything but pretty - and assembling them was a nightmare thanks to the necessary ICs only being available in surface-mount packages - but they do the job.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide3.jpg" alt="Hardware layout diagram"></p>

<p>The SuperRT chip constructs the scene using a specialised command language which is executed by one of three parallel execution units on the chip - essentially specialised CISC processors - to perform ray intersection tests. The scene description allows objects to be constructed using a subset of CSG operations, using spheres and planes as the basic building blocks and then performing OR, AND and subtraction operations using them to build up the desired geometry. AABBs are also supported, although primarily for use in culling tests (they can be rendered if desired, but they have a lower positional accuracy than other primitives and thus this is not generally very useful except for debugging purposes).</p>

<p>
 <video width="320" height="240" autoplay="" loop="">
  <source src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Artefact.mp4" type="video/mp4">

 </video> 
</p>

<p>The renderer casts up to four rays per screen pixel, calculating direct shadows from a directional light source and a single reflection bounce. Surfaces each have a diffuse colour and reflectivity property, and it’s possible to apply modifiers to these based on CSG results or specialised functions - this is used to generate the checkerboard pattern on the floor.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide2.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>The ray colour for each pixel is calculated by a “ray engine”, which handles the overall ray lifecycle and uses an “execution engine” module to run the command program describing the scene as many times as is required to resolve the ray. The command program itself is uploaded from the SNES and stored in a local 4K RAM buffer - animation is performed by writing modified commands into this buffer as required. A disassembled command buffer looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>0000 Start
0001 Plane 0, -1, 0, Dist=-2
0002 SphereSub OH 2, 1, 5, Rad=5
0003 SphereSub OH 4, 1, 4, Rad=4
0004 SphereSub OH 5, 1, 9, Rad=9
0005 SphereSub OH 2, 1, 2, Rad=2
0006 SphereSub OH -0.5, 1, 2, Rad=2
0007 RegisterHitNoReset 0, 248, 0, Reflectiveness=0
0008 Checkerboard ORH 48, 152, 48, Reflectiveness=0
0009 ResetHitState
0010 Plane 0, -1, 0, Dist=-2.150146
0011 RegisterHit 0, 0, 248, Reflectiveness=153
0012 AABB 4, -2.5, 11,    8, 3.5, 13
0013 ResetHitStateAndJump NH 44
0014 Origin 6, 2, 12
0015 Plane -0.2929688, 0, -0.9570313, Dist=0.2497559
0016 PlaneAnd OH 0.2919922, 0, 0.9560547, Dist=0.25
0017 PlaneAnd OH 0, 1, 0, Dist=1
0018 PlaneAnd OH 0, -1, 0, Dist=4
0019 PlaneAnd OH -0.9570313, 0, 0.2919922, Dist=-1
0020 PlaneAnd OH 0.9560547, 0, -0.2929688, Dist=1.499756
0021 RegisterHit 248, 0, 0, Reflectiveness=0
</code></pre>

<p>Each execution engine is a processor module with a 14 cycle pipeline, and in general one instruction is retired per cycle, so each execution unit can calculate about 50 million sphere, plane or AABB intersections per second. The exception to this is that branch operations have to flush the entire pipeline and thus have a  16 cycle overhead (14 cycles to flush the pipeline + 2 cycles instruction fetch delay). To try and avoid this as much as possible a branch prediction system is used - fortunately a lot of the time the spatial coherency of nearby rays means that a high prediction hit rate is achievable.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide5.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>Intersections in the execution engine are carried out by two pipelines, one handling AABBs and the other spheres and planes. The system as a whole works exclusively using 32-bit integer maths in 18.14 fixed point format, with 16-bit (2.14) format used where values are known to be in the +-1 range, and the sphere/plane intersection pipeline has two dedicated additional maths units that calculate reciprocal and square root operations.</p>

</p>

<p>Once a frame is rendered, the PPU converter module turns the framebuffer into a format that can be DMAed directly to the SNES VRAM for display, reducing it to 256 colours and swizzling it into character tile bitplanes. The screen resolution is 200x160 - this results in exactly 32000 bytes of image data for a full frame, which is transferred to VRAM in two 16000 bytes chunks over successive frames due to bandwidth constraints. Thus the full image can only be refreshed once every two frames, effectively limiting the maximum framerate to 30FPS - although the test scene runs at closer to 20FPS (primarily due to some bottlenecks with the logic on the SNES side at present).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Many thanks to the participants in <a href="https://forums.nesdev.com/viewtopic.php?f=12&amp;t=20068">this thread</a> over at SNESdev for a lot of useful ideas on fullscreen expansion chip DMA that inspired the solution used here.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Slide4.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>The chip also implements a number of other basic functions - there is an interface to the SNES cartridge bus, along with a small program ROM holding 32K of code for the SNES (this is constrained by the fact that the interface board currently only connects up the SNES Address Bus A lines, and thus the effective usable address space is a mere 64K, of which 32K is used for memory-mapped IO registers to communicate with the SuperRT chip). There is also a multiplication accelerator unit that lets the SNES perform 16x16bit multiply operations rapidly.</p>

<p><img src="https://www.shironekolabs.com/posts/superrt/Shot13.jpg" alt="SuperRT screenshot"></p>

<p>For debugging, I used the HDMI interface on the DE10 board to output data to a second monitor, along with a Megadrive joypad connected to the GPIO pins to manipulate the debug system. Resource constraints mean that this has to be disabled if all three ray engine cores are enabled, however.</p>

<p>So that’s a broad overview of the system - I intend to post some articles giving more details of how individual components work in the near future. In the meantime, though, if you have any questions or thoughts then please get in touch and I’ll do my best to answer!</p>

<p>Many thanks to Matt, Jaymin, Rick and everyone else who has helped with advice, inspiration and support!</p>

			<p> Web development has become a very complex field with many branches and tools to master. In this article, I suggest doing the inverse and use just a simple `index.html` file to manage all of the web app development scripts and assets. This might seem radical but does it make life more complex than using all those front-end tools we have become accustomed to? </p>

		<p>Using an <code>index.html</code> as the single management file for the app.</p>
<p><img src="https://hugodaniel.com/images/html5-hammer.png" alt="HTML5 badge with a hammer, ready to do some damage" title="That is one big hammer!"></p>
<p><em>"It might work for small things, but I wouldn't use it for something big."</em>
Said someone about something.</p>
<p>These are some of the things that an <code>index.html</code> typically does:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sets the title for the current page</li>
<li>Defines the content and assets</li>
<li>Defines content to be used as a template</li>
<li>Loads styles</li>
<li>Runs scripts and resolves modules dependencies</li>
</ul>
<p>Which are already quite good, but there are many more goodies to be found among the things that a simple <code>index.html</code> allows to do such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest">manifest file</a> for offline usage of the page items</li>
<li>Using the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API">Web API</a>'s on the scripts (navigation, web components, 3d, audio, network access, etc...)</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Preloading_content">Preload</a> content and assets</li>
<li>Content <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_syndication">syndication</a></li>
<li>Social networks <a href="https://ogp.me/">meta information</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, everything that any modern complex Web App does can be fit into a single <code>index.html</code> file.</p>
<p>It is mostly a matter of managing the complexity and growth of files, assets, components, etc...</p>
<p>We have developed a wide range of very complex tools to help us with that. Front-end development has become so complex that it is hard for any single person to master it.</p>
<p>How much harder would life be if a single <code>index.html</code> was used to drive all of the development instead of all those Create-React-App/Babel/WebPack/npm/yarn/d/sass/styled-components/optimizers? </p>
<p>I don't know how to answer this but will try to shed some light on a simpler, more "naked" approach for web app development.</p>
<p>To start <strong>there are at least two problems</strong> with using a single <code>index.html</code> as the only management file for the app:</p>
<ul>
<li>No TypeScript support (or any other transpiler language, only JS, GLSL, and WebASM supported)</li>
<li>No way to easily manage 3rd party dependencies dependencies (dependencies)</li>
</ul>
<p>These two will be the subject of my next post. For now, I am going to lay the ground for a simple <code>index.html</code>-only approach.</p>
<h2 id="a-common-structure-for-most-apps">A common structure for most apps</h2>
<p>The common structure I plan to follow is something like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Page meta --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;link&gt;'s go here after the meta stuff --&gt;
&lt;!-- &lt;script type="module"&gt;'s go here --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>head</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt; </span><span>&lt;!-- Feature flags as class strings in body --&gt;
  &lt;!-- Modals go here --&gt;
  </span><span>&lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
    </span><span>&lt;!-- The content being shown goes here --&gt;
  </span><span>&lt;/</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  </span><span>&lt;!-- &lt;template&gt;'s go here --&gt;
  &lt;!-- &lt;script&gt;'s go here at the end --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre>
<p>This structure makes some compromises but overall is enough for most complex apps. It is not that different from a normal HTML page 🧐.</p>
<p>JavaScript modules are being loaded at the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>, which is ok because module scripts are deferred by default and do not block the parsing of the rest of the document. They could go anywhere, I prefer to keep the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> for the main logic and more immediate scripts.</p>
<p>With this in mind, here are 3 common things to a web app that can be done in such a simple structure without much effort:</p>
<ol>
<li>Global loading state (full-screen loading)</li>
<li>Routing (what to show according to the URL being rendered)</li>
<li>Place common HTML parts/assets without repeating them (templating/components)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="global-loading-page">Global Loading page</h2>
<p>A loading page that fills the whole screen is something that most web apps have, some even distract us with cool animations while loading.</p>
<p>In the above structure, the loading page goes into the modal area. Right before the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> content. This allows heavy content like <code>&lt;canvas&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> to be placed as <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> children and fully load (shaders, image data, etc) behind it, before clearing the loading state and showing them to our friends.</p>
<pre><code><span>...
&lt;</span><span>body</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>div </span><span>id</span><span>="</span><span>loading</span><span>"&gt;Loading&lt;/</span><span>div</span><span>&gt;
  &lt;</span><span>main</span><span>&gt;
  ...
</span></code></pre>
<p>The whole visible space gets covered with that loading <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> which is then removed when all the things that the app needs for a good first run are ready.</p>
<p>Having the loading upfront on the <code>index.html</code> without needing any JS to first show it also helps our karma score in the bots&amp;spiders purgatory that purge the web we all love into useful cinder blocks.</p>
<h2 id="routing">Routing</h2>
<p>No lib is going to be used for routing. Routing is going to consist of simple manipulations of the browser history with <code>popstate</code> and <code>pushstate</code>. The basic approach is:</p>
<ol>
<li>Read the current route from the window location</li>
<li>Clone its corresponding <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> into the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag</li>
<li>Inside it adjust the relevant <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>'s and other link navigation tags to perform a <code>pushState</code> instead of their default behavior
<ul>
<li>Filters can be applied to only consider <code>&lt;a&gt;</code>'s that have relative paths, or that do not have the <code>rel=nofollow</code> attribute</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>onpopstate</code> clone the correspnoding <code>&lt;template&gt;</code> into the <code>&lt;main&gt;</code> tag</li>
</ol>
<p>This is intended only for web apps as an effort to reduce the amount of JS and leverage the features already at hand. For anything similar to regular pages the browser behavior is more than good enough, no need for JS there.</p>
<p>This approach should work well if the web app uses less than 20 or 15 possible routing patterns. Most web apps likely average at some number under 10. This simple approach should be more than enough. There is no need in my foreseeable use cases to use anything more complex like the DOM or any big library to manage routes.</p>
<p>I will evolve this into a very simple routing/templating library to be announced soon(ish). For reference, here is some code that I did for a template engine in one of the many Grid iterations: <a href="https://hugodaniel.com/scripts/meander.js">old routing code</a>.</p>
<p>I appreciate the browser's approach of associating page state with history, however, for a web app I find it simpler and more manageable to keep these two things separate:</p>
<ul>
<li>Routing seen as pure functions of navigation only transformations</li>
<li>App state in its own separate tarpit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="html-templating">HTML Templating</h2>
<p>Stamping and repeating a common HTML structure in a couple of places is a frequent routine that most web apps do. Be it for menu entries, list items, or even whole parts like sidebars or modal and toast elements. Finding a common HTML structure and repeat it when needed with small adjustments is a stapled practice.</p>
<p>HTML templating has many technicalities and possibilities. Most JS frameworks commonly solve it in their own way with different degrees of justifiable complexity.</p>
<p>Web browsers already provide a very flexible and complex way to do templating through the Web Components suite of technologies. For most of my cases plain HTML will be prefered and written directly at that <code>index.html</code>. For the other cases where DRY speaks louder a simple static "copy/paste" tag will suffice, a small prototype of this could be something like:</p>
<pre><code><span>customElements</span><span>.</span><span>define</span><span>("</span><span>template-content</span><span>", </span><span>class extends </span><span>HTMLElement </span><span>{
  </span><span>constructor</span><span>() {
    </span><span>super</span><span>();
    </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>attachShadow</span><span>({ mode: </span><span>"</span><span>open</span><span>" </span><span>})
        .</span><span>appendChild</span><span>(
          document.</span><span>getElementById</span><span>(
            </span><span>this</span><span>.</span><span>getAttribute</span><span>(</span><span>'</span><span>from-id</span><span>'</span><span>)
          ).content.</span><span>cloneNode</span><span>(</span><span>true</span><span>))
  }
}</span><span>);
</span></code></pre>
<p>This small code defines a new WebComponent tag <code>&lt;template-content&gt;</code>, this tag reads an element id from its <code>from-id</code> attribute, then gets the corresponding element on the DOM for that id, clones it, and replaces itself with it.</p>
<p>This is useful because it provides a quick way to stamp HTML/SVG content on the document. Helpful to replicate SVG elements, lists, and node sub-trees on the client-side.</p>
<pre><code><span>&lt;</span><span>nav</span><span>&gt;
	&lt;</span><span>button </span><span>onclick</span><span>="</span><span>tool</span><span>('</span><span>undo</span><span>')"&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>template-content </span><span>from-id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-button-content</span><span>" /&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>template-content </span><span>from-id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-undo</span><span>" /&gt;
	&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;
	&lt;</span><span>button </span><span>onclick</span><span>="</span><span>tool</span><span>('</span><span>draw</span><span>')"&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>template-content </span><span>from-id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-button-content</span><span>" /&gt;
		&lt;</span><span>template-content </span><span>from-id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-draw</span><span>" /&gt;
	&lt;/</span><span>button</span><span>&gt;
&lt;/</span><span>nav</span><span>&gt;

&lt;</span><span>template </span><span>id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-button-content</span><span>"&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Some complex content here --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;
&lt;</span><span>template </span><span>id</span><span>="</span><span>tools-draw</span><span>"&gt;
</span><span>&lt;!-- Some other complex content here --&gt;
</span><span>&lt;/</span><span>template</span><span>&gt;
</span></code></pre><h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Keeping a single <code>index.html</code> might be just enough for a simpler naked approach to app development. If there is no need for big dependencies, versioning tracking files, transpilers, and all that, this could very well be good enough. It works directly on top of what browsers already provide and hints at a simpler, leaner, style of development.</p>
<p>It does not have TypeScript support and it also does not automatically resolve dependencies and bundles them.</p>
<p>These are two open problems with this approach that I plan to show a possible solution that is on par in simplicity with this one. That will be the subject of my next technical post (likely to come out next week). Stay tuned.</p>

  <p>
    <a href="" title="My Engineering Values">
      15 December 2020
    </a>
  </p>
  <p>I’ve been encouraged by <a href="https://nathanherald.com/">a mentor</a> to think about what my core (engineering) values are (in the context of being recently promoted to be a “staff engineer” and having my eyes on being a “principal engineer” one day). This felt like something that could be of wider interest so here we go:</p>

<h3 id="dont-fix-bugs-speculatively">Don’t fix bugs speculatively</h3>

<p>One I picked up from <a href="https://mxcl.dev/">Max Howell</a>, the creator of Homebrew.</p>

<p>When you’ve got a non-empty issue backlog on your open source or commercial project: don’t waste your time “fixing” things that aren’t problems affecting users. Yes, refactoring that method so it returns an empty string instead of <code>nil</code> feels useful but if there’s no way that bubbles up to a user issue: you have better things you could be doing with your time.</p>

<h3 id="perfect-is-the-enemy-of-good">Perfect is the enemy of good</h3>

<p>A solution that’s “good enough” (or even “better than the status quo”) and can be shipped this week is always superior to one that can ship next week. Iterative improvement allows you to learn more every time you ship and encourages you to keep shipping.</p>

<p>Additionally, in both commercial and open source environments I’ve seen motivation to fix a problem today destroyed by promises of some big solution that will fix this problem (and many more!) in six months time. Relatedly: these big “fix everything” projects almost never end up shipping and then the “quick win” fix has been long abandoned.</p>

<h3 id="apologies-are-easy-and-free">Apologies are easy and free</h3>

<p>One from my Dad: it costs nothing to say sorry and it’s worth saying even when you aren’t convinced you’re in the wrong. It’s an easy way to demonstrate humility, make other people feel better and have <em>someone</em> take accountability for mistakes rather than no-one.</p>

<h3 id="dont-make-changes-you-dont-understand">Don’t make changes you don’t understand</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia_talk:Chesterton%27s_fence">Chesterton’s fence</a>, basically. Try to make your changes to methods/files/systems as small as possible in order to accomplish what you want to.</p>

<p>Refactoring for refactoring’s sake (“I’m refactoring because the code is hard to read” often is “I’m refactoring because I didn’t write this code”) is an example of this in action; it often introduces new bugs and provides no direct benefit to the end-user.</p>

<p>Of course, if the code is unspeakably messy/buggy so that it takes forever to do any new development: refactoring may be in order. Just don’t do it because “this looks messy”.</p>

<h3 id="dont-repeat-yourself">Don’t repeat yourself</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself">DRY</a> is a pretty obvious and basic engineering principle at this point but I like to take it to new extremes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>don’t repeat yourself between the code and the documentation if you can avoid it</li>
  <li>don’t repeat yourself answering the same questions again and again without documenting them</li>
  <li>don’t repeat yourself making the same mistakes repeatedly</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="motivation-is-the-fuel-of-open-source">Motivation is the fuel of open source</h3>

<p>I’ve written previously about how <a href="https://mikemcquaid.com/2018/03/19/open-source-maintainers-owe-you-nothing/">open source maintainers owe you nothing</a> and this is essentially the same thing.</p>

<p>Motivation isn’t the same for everyone. For some, it’s financial (hence my work on <a href="https://github.com/sponsors">GitHub Sponsors</a>). For others, it’s about having fun (so blocking unfun, rude people makes sense).</p>

<p>When maintaining or developing open source: don’t be drawn into doing things you don’t want to do.</p>

<p>When using/contributing to/submitting issues for open source: don’t try to make others do things that they (or, as a shortcut, you) don’t want to do.</p>

<h3 id="every-time-you-agree-to-do-something-write-it-down">Every time you agree to do something: write it down</h3>

<p>I’ve written previously about <a href="https://mikemcquaid.com/2015/05/24/how-i-get-things-done/">how I get things done</a> but this is the cornerstone.</p>

<p>Anyone I know who does this is generally fairly organised. Everyone I know who doesn’t is not. The worst are those who have “a system” which doesn’t involve writing anything down and they feel like they are organised and aren’t. Don’t be that person.</p>

<h3 id="say-no-more-often">Say no more often</h3>

<p>Related to multiple of the above. Doing the most important/useful thing right now means fighting off the other 100 things that 10 people want you to do instead that are less impactful.</p>

<p>This is even more applicable when designing product and soliciting feedback from users/customers. Some of them will have universal ideas and some will have ideas that just a hack around their particular problem today.</p>

<p>If you say no to everything the first time you hear it then you’ll be able to more easily prioritise the things that keep coming up again and again.</p>

<h3 id="automate-everything">Automate everything</h3>

<p>People respond way better to <a href="https://mikemcquaid.com/2018/06/05/robot-pedantry-human-empathy/">pedantry from robots and empathy from humans</a>. As a result, prioritise your time as an engineer on turning your desire for cleanliness and pedantry into automated checks.</p>

<p>Don’t check that list once a month, get a bot to do it for you. Don’t remember to follow a deployment process, turn it into a script/application.</p>

<h3 id="build-things-that-are-useful">Build things that are useful</h3>

<p>Another one from <a href="https://mxcl.dev/">Max Howell</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re building software that is a tool for people (particularly a developer tool) and asking yourself how some feature should work: ask yourself how it can be most useful. This is often in tension with “be consistent” but often a better experience arises from being less consistent on the occasions where it makes a tool more useful (particularly if inconsistent with rules you’ve created).</p>

<h3 id="negativity-is-better-ignored-than-reciprocated">Negativity is better ignored than reciprocated</h3>

<p>This has been a real big change for me in the last 5-10 years and one I’m not consistently good at (and props to <a href="https://nadiaeghbal.com/">Nadia Eghbal</a> for nudging me initially).</p>

<p>You can get a lot of drive-by negativity through open-source (and sometimes even just working in a big company). If you’re someone (like me) who prioritises being responsive then it can feel like you should respond to this negativity with disagreement or criticism. Usually (particularly if you feel angry/sad) the best thing to do is just to ignore it and move on.</p>

December 15, 2020 | https://dubeyaayush07.github.io/deliberate-mistakes/rethinking-social-media/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://dubeyaayush07.github.io/deliberate-mistakes/rethinking-social-media/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article itemscope="" itemtype="http://schema.org/Article"><header><p>December 05, 2020</p></header><section itemprop="articleBody"><h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The harmful effects of the algorithms employed by social networking platforms like Twitter and Facebook has been well documented: polarisation, privacy issues, you name it. Even though I share a lot of these concerns between all the petty tribalism there is potential for having deep and meaningful conversations too. But I do not think it is possible to improve existing social networks, as even though these networks are not inherently evil they are a result of a bad business model. Their main objective is maximising user engagement the more time you spend glued to your screen the better. With this model at the core it is hard for these companies to implement change. In certain cases taking initiatives for improving the mental well being of users or for promoting productive discourse might be impractical too. The quality of the experience is secondary to the screen time.</p>
<p>The solution in my opinion is to build networks with strong core values that promote productive conversations. Start with a small community with a solid foundation then gradually expand keeping the values intact. What would such a network look like? Well like anything great it will have to take what is good about its predecessors and improve on their shortcomings. The improvements should be significant so as to provide a reason for people to actually switch. But improvements is a vague term to see how social networks can be improved I think it is better to analyse and think about the components that make up these networks from first principles.</p>
<h2>Moderation</h2>
<p>If we have learned anything from <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/right-wing-users-flock-to-parler-as-social-media-giants-rein-in-misinformation">Parler</a> it is that sometimes it becomes necessary to infringe upon people’s free speech rights especially when these privileges come at the cost of civilised discourse. Still banning people is a slippery slope for example if you ban a terrorist account then what do you do when China asks you to ban accounts of Hong Kong protesters? You have given them the precedent. I think the solution is to have strict moderation but with strong foundational principles and make them clear early on. A good strategy is to only censor people if they are disrespecting other people not when they are expressing their opinions or ideas. Even if you think that the earth is not flat you should let other people talk it out if they are being civil about it.</p>
<p>If you look at communities like <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>, <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, or the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/">Ask Historians subreddit</a> where the moderators rule with an iron hand you can notice that the posts and comments in these forums are of much higher quality. But still it is anecdotal evidence and these communities are small when you compare them to giants like Facebook and Twitter. Also how would you moderate millions of post? Even if it was possible for human to do it can you rely on them to look at these posts objectively and report them only if they violate the guidelines? I believe if you start a community with strong core values it is possible to motivate people with a little bit of algorithm ingenuity to act in good faith.</p>
<h2>Feed</h2>
<p>Feeds and Algorithms are inextricably linked, feeds serve content curated by algorithms. Feeds can be finite or infinite providing an endless stream of posts and the algorithms used by these can range from simple algorithms that serve posts in chronological order to relatively complex machine learning based recommender systems. Most of the big platforms nowadays use recommender systems coupled with infinite feeds. It can get really messy if a single feed is used to serve both recommended content and the content that the user is subscribed to. YouTube is a good example of this even though they have great recommendations the content that the user has actually subscribed to gets lost in the feed of recommended videos. You might argue that they have a different feed for subscriptions but its not the one they show first when the user enters their app/website and that is the one that actually counts.</p>
<p>For our ideal social network I think it will be better to use two different feed one main finite feed solely for the subscribed/followed content and one infinite feed that recommends content based on the the interests of the user. For the subscription feed I do not think a purely chronological algorithm will work as a post about an important event like a friend’s birthday might get trapped between relatively trivial posts but between the posts of similar importance chronological information can be taken into account. A more complex algorithm will be required for the recommendation feed I will talk about it more in the monetisation section. The goal of the feeds should be to maximise signal from noise and not waste the time of its users.</p>
<h2>Monetisation</h2>
<p>Advertising is a bad and unsustainable business model for social networks, if your main source of revenue are advertisements you will be incentivised to increase user engagement and sometimes even at the cost of the actual experience. The best business model for social networks I think is the Wikipedia model. Ask people who can afford to to pay a nominal subscription to keep the servers running. The success of the company will actually depend how happy its users are with the platform.</p>
<p>You might have noticed that I have used vague terms like ‘algorithmic ingenuity’ and statements like ‘build a system that recommends people posts based on their interests’ without mentioning the specifics of the algorithm that is because I do not know and when it comes to moderation algorithms neither does Twitter. Learning based algorithms are not completely transparent and it is difficult to predict what they are going to do and it becomes even more difficult to come up with good algorithms when the goals of the networks are misaligned with the public good. What my argument is that in social networks that do not depend on advertising money engineers will be actually motivated to come up with better algorithms for moderation and recommendation.</p>
<h2>Interface and Posts</h2>
<p>The whole social network revolves around posts these are the primary content that people use to interact with their subscribers/followers. For Twitter these are limited length messages, for Quora these are questions, for Instagram images, for YouTube videos, etc. The format of these posts is important. They can be designed such that people come up with clever ways to use them (example tweets) and they can also be designed in a more restrictive way such that people struggle to get across what they mean (example tweets).</p>
<p>The ideal post in my opinion is a mixture of these two we could allow people to post both a restricted length post and a full fledged article but nothing in between this leaves space for creativity and does not hamper conversation. An option could be given to the users to sort their feed by articles, shorter posts or both. And instead of like and dislike buttons we can use recommend and not recommend buttons the functions might be same but change in name might help people make conscious decision about whether they want similar content recommended to them or not.</p>
<p>Another way we can improve conversations I think is by giving people a small break between writing a post and actually posting it. This might seem counter-intuitive but I think if given a chance to reflect on things people generally take right decisions and it can also give them time to calm down so that they do not engage in pointless name calling. We can implement it by an optional 15 seconds timer which is enabled by default.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The goal of the post is to start a conversation about what an ideal social network might look like. But these are just abstract ideas and musings there is no evidence a social networks like this will be successful but instead of conjecturing about whether things will work or not it is better to try to implement it and see for yourself. In that spirit I am going to try to implement a social network based on these principles. But I am a lone programmer and I need help if some part of my post resonated with you and you think that implementing such a network is worth a try contact me at <a href="mailto:dubeyaayush08@gmail.com">dubeyaayush08@gmail.com</a> and maybe we could team up.</p></section><hr></article></div>]]>

<p><em>The lack of focus is becoming a global epidemic. And productivity sounds suspiciously dishonest on the internet. Online, hundreds of apps and experts exist that promise monumental results but only if you buy their course or subscribe to their never-ending stream of products. All these tools oath to upgrade your body and mind so you can magically stop watching YouTube videos and become a newer, somehow improved version of yourself. But we all know that these are just marketing gimmicks. Becoming more effective requires nothing else but attuning your mind to the flow state.</em></p>



<p>In the 1970s, after conducting a series of interviews with various artists, Mihaly Csikszentmihályi, the person who coined the term <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/flow/" target="_blank" aria-label="flow (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">flow</a>, concluded that these creators, when they work, enter a magical state of deep concentration that was later called the flow state.</p>



<p>These artists got so lost in what they did that they forgot to eat food, drink water, and even rest. And in no way this meant that these people were forced to execute the task they were doing. Тhey, themselves, sought to enter this deep focused condition. For them, it was the best part of their lives.</p>



<p>Nowadays, we’re witnessing a shift of focus. Instead of concentrating on projects that are important for us, such that require full commitment, we prefer to let others entertain us. When something is not stimulating enough, we simply hop to the next channel. And since everyone is trying to hook us to their story, new sources of entertainment are not hard to find. Shows and “important” news stories all around us. Trying to hold our attention for as long as they can so they can make a profit from it. And we’re not even resisting. We’re looking forward to these distractions and we welcome them in our lives.</p>



<p>As time progresses, life takes us in one of these two ways: We either realize that the constant alerts that are demanding our attention are wasteful and not contributing to our end goal. Or, we choose to live in oblivion and follow the norms set by our society – always trying to be entertained.</p>



<p>If you’ve reached the point of a mental breakdown caused by the never-ending updates and sound bites, here you’ll find ways to shift your mind from overly distracted to inner focused.</p>



<p>In this post, I’ll explain how you can enter the famous flow state, also known as being in the zone, that will help you create more, not consume more. And also, illustrate how you can stay in this hyper-focused state for an extended period of time.</p>







<h2>What is The Flow State?</h2>



<p>On the surface, the flow state seems like this ultimate productivity hack that will help you do mind-bending work that will lead to unbelievable profits.</p>



<p>And while the state of flow does increase efficiency, it’s more about being in love with doing something. Immersing yourself in a particular task that eventually leads to a sense of ecstasy.</p>



<p>In an interview, Mihály Csíkszentmihályi describes flow as follows: “Being completely involved in an activity for its own sake. The ego falls away. Time flies. Every action, movement, and thought follows inevitably from the previous one, like playing jazz. Your whole being is involved, and you’re using your skills to the utmost.”<span id="easy-footnote-1-12465"></span><span><a href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-12465" title="<a aria-label=&quot;Go With The Flow (opens in a new tab)&quot; href=&quot;https://www.wired.com/1996/09/czik/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noreferrer noopener nofollow&quot; class=&quot;ek-link&quot;>Go With The Flow</a>, Wired Magazine."><sup>1</sup></a></span></p>



<p>You get in the zone not because you’re able to focus thanks to the life hacks and productivity tools that were recommended by some internet gurus. You’re able to focus because what you’re doing, the actual activity you’re participating in, is something that brings you joy and awe.</p>



<p>This is something I believe a lot of people are confused about.</p>



<p>You don’t focus on the tools and you are careless about all the tactics. You are able to concentrate because you love what you’re doing. And, eventually, you’re happy to devote large parts of your day to this particular activity. The task itself brings you joy, <a href="https://durmonski.com/self-improvement/lack-of-feedback/" target="_blank" aria-label="positive feedback (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive feedback</a>, and satisfaction as you make progress. You don’t force yourself to do the work and you don’t need someone else to remind you about this. You’re looking forward to the moment where you’ll have the time to work – for example, write, exercise, play music. And when the working session begins, the actual activity is satisfying enough for you to stay immersed in what you do.</p>



<p>For you particularly, dear reader, this means that if you want to enter the so desirable flow state, you first must find an activity that feels so interesting to your persona, that for a short period of time, nothing else will matter.</p>







<h2>Why Entering Flow State is Important?</h2>



<p>Apart from making monumental progress towards a particular project, probably quitting your <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/bullshit-jobs/" target="_blank" aria-label="boring job (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">boring job</a> and living a nomadic life, you also get to experience daily doses of true joy because of the work you do.</p>



<p>In an information-rich world, learning to properly manage your attention is the best thing you can do to preserve your sanity. And, even at times, feel good about your life.</p>



<p>After all, if you positively respond to all the requests that come your way, you click on all the ads, and you follow all recommended people and products by the algorithm, you’ll never have time for yourself. You will never have time for anything other than making others happy. The things you want to do will be left for another day. A day that will never come. Your attention will always be focused outwards – satisfaction based on what everyone else requires of you – instead of inwards – satisfaction based on what you <em>really </em>want to do.</p>

You can reach lasting results only when you focus on doing one thing.</figcaption></figure>







<p>This outer focus directly contradicts with what your body wants for itself – to survive, thrive, and express its true <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/toward-a-psychology-of-being/" target="_blank" aria-label="best self (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">best self</a>.</p>







<h2>How to Enter the State of Flow?</h2>



<p>To get in the zone, the state of deep focused concentration you first need to find a task that interests you a lot. But more importantly, is meaningful to you. As you can imagine, here we are not talking about playing video games or binge-watching shows, it’s about work that is cognitively demanding and at the same time intriguing.</p>



<p>In the seminal work, <a href="https://durmonski.com/book-summaries/flow/" target="_blank" aria-label="Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience (opens in a new tab)" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience</a>, Csíkszentmihályi describes the state of ultimate happiness as pursuing an activity where you constantly increase the difficulty.</p>



<p>The following graph explains how this can be achieved:</p>

A2 is when the task becomes too easy. A3 is if you increase the difficulty with too much. A4 is what you should strive for – slightly increasing the difficulty.</figcaption></figure>







<p>When you first start doing something, say you want to become a musician and you decide to learn to play the guitar, you have no skills whatsoever. Even holding the instrument is something that interests you. Your eagerness to learn more makes the whole experience joyful. This is stage A1.</p>



<p>Over time, when you get better, you either get bored if you continue to play the same tunes (A2). Or, you start to feel lost, anxious, because you realize how little you know and how vast the guitar knowledge-base is (A3).</p>



<p>The best course of action is to increase the difficulty by just a bit. Refrain from trying complex songs and techniques. Or in other words, you should try songs that are a little above your comfort zone. This the stage you want to be in all the time – A4 presented on the graph.</p>



<p>Because what happens if you try something complicated?</p>



<p>Your brain realizes that the gap between what you know now and what you need to know is too big. This makes you feel anxious. Lost. Underqualified. You don’t want to wait years to learn something, after all, your body and mind both require constant doses of good feedback to keep functioning. That’s why it’s important to gradually increase the complexity if you want to continue doing what you’re doing. Otherwise, you will completely disappear from the graph and go do something else that feels rewarding (but a lot of times not productive).</p>



<p>On the other hand, if what you’re doing becomes boring at some point, you’ll stop getting positive stimuli. If this happens, you’re more likely to let your <a aria-label="mind wander (opens in a new tab)" href="https://durmonski.com/productivity/what-is-mind-wandering/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mind wander</a> and also find other ways to get positive stimulators (social media, games, etc.).</p>



<p>The best strategy is to slowly push past your comfort zone. Face an opponent who is just a little more advanced than you. Try stuff that are somehow related to what you know yet offer new insights.</p>



<p>But that’s just part of the process to stay in the flow state.</p>



<p>Sadly, simply finding a slightly harder activity is not enough to keep you involved for prolonged periods. You also need to learn how to protect yourself from all the things that are fighting for your attention.</p>







<h2>How to Remain In Flow State?</h2>



<p>Here’s is how I define the state of flow: To pursue a single line of thought for an extended period of time. And to connect it to what I mentioned above, the thought itself should be, of course, related to an activity that you’re deeply in love with.</p>



<p>It might sound simple to keep your focus on a single line, but it’s not an easy feat.</p>



<p>There are two things you need to consider to properly manage your concentration: block internal and external distractions.</p>







<h3>Block Internal Distractions</h3>



<p>If we imagine that flow is indeed your ability to pursue one task without doing anything else, we can visualize it as follows:</p>

<p>However, at some point during your work, probably something you saw near you or when one conclusion leads to the next, a new thought will eventually morph in your brain that is a lot of times unrelated to what you’re doing right now:</p>

<p><span>There is a war going on for your mind</span></p>

<p>Doesn’t it feel like it?</p>

<p>Each time you step onto the Internet you enter into a battlefield where all the opposing forces are fighting for that most valuable prize: your attention.</p>

<p>There are bullets shot in this war, but they are of a different sort.</p>

<p>The artillery barrages of old have been replaced by the incessant bombardment of messages and notifications. Instead of subterfuge and espionage, you have to defend yourself against a myriad of dark user experience patterns designed to get you to do things that are not in your interest - but are very much in the interest of the companies that employ them.</p>

<p><span>It is you against them, and it’s not a fair fight.</span></p>

<p>Just as your attention is important to those companies, it is even more so to you. In fact, I would go so far as saying your attention is your most valuable asset.</p>

<p>Think of it this way.</p>

<p>If you’re not able to direct your attention to get things done, you could be the smartest person in the world and it wouldn’t matter one bit. You’d just waste all your raw intellect capacity by spending your days playing videogames and refreshing Twitter.</p>

<p>However, if you were able to focus your mind and do what needs to be done, you’d be able to wring every drop of value from the intellectual firepower you do have and run circles around the genius whose mind is always chasing butterflies.</p>

<p><span>Attention is multiplicative with productivity.</span> Without the first, you can’t have the latter.</p>

<p>Now, I’m under no impression that this idea that your ability to focus your attention is the most valuable asset you can develop is new, or innovative or anything of that sort.</p>

<p>Deep down, we all know this. We have all felt in our bones what it’s like when we’re not in control of our minds, when our attention, our focus, is repeatedly being yanked away from us by the constant stream of messages and notifications, alongside the tantalizing allure of the many websites and apps whose primary goal is for us to ignore the world outside so we can keep in using them.</p>

<p>What’s more, <span>we also know how to fight back against it.</span></p>

<p>We know we check our phones too much and should leave them in another room when we want to be productive. We know we should sign off all our social media accounts, perhaps even install one of those programs that block distracting websites.</p>

<p>I’m not here to tell you what you already know and have read elsewhere, but I do want to share with you instead a little tool that has helped me, and might help you, regain your focus.</p>

<p>That tool?</p>

<p><span>The adblocker.</span></p>

<p>That’s right. The regular old trustworthy adblocker.</p>

<p>Now, most people who use an adblocker only use it to block, well, ads. But this helpful tool has a feature that I haven’t seen many people talk about.</p>

<p>And that feature is that not only can your adblocker block ads, but it can also block whichever part of a website you tell it to block.</p>

<p>Don’t want to see that pesky <em>“who to follow”</em> sidebar on Twitter?</p>

<p><span>Block it.</span></p>

<p>Don’t want to see all those videos Youtube says you should watch?</p>

<p><span>Block them.</span></p>

<p>Because it can be used to block anything and everything on a website, the adblocker is one of the best tools you can have in the war against distraction, and chances are, you already have it installed in your browser, ready to go. You just didn’t know you could use it this way.</p>

<p>It’s quite simple actually.</p>

<p>First off, if you don’t have uBlock installed on your browser, do so. You can find it for <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en">Chrome here</a>, and for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublock-origin/">Firefox here</a>.</p>

<p>Now go to a website where you want to block something that’s constantly snatching your attention away from you.</p>

<p>For me this is Youtube. I love Youtube, but its algorithms are too good. I can spend hours going through video after video non-stop like a zombie searching for brains, and it’s time I stop doing that. I could try to exercise self-control, but that’s leaving it to chance. Instead, I’ll just use the adblocker uBlock to… hmm, block it.</p>

<p>Because I don’t want to run the risk of getting distracted each time I open Youtube, a logical place to start is to make that list of videos that Youtube greets us with not appear. There are multiple supercomputers behind Youtube built solely with the purpose of showing me videos that they think will get me to continue using it, so if I don’t see any of them I will be protected against it.</p>

<p>Let’s say you think that’s a good idea and want to do it for yourself as well, how would you go about it?</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/9c421ab7328f4a77bd844db4d81a0ad5134022f6/5ddc1/assets/images/usinganadblocker/adblocker.gif" alt=""></p>

<p>First, right-click the part of the page you want to block. In this case that is the main page, where all the videos show up. Then select “Block Element”. When you do so, a small window will appear in the bottom-left corner of your screen, and uBlock will color the section you’ve told it to block in red.</p>

<p>If when you do this uBlock selects the wrong part of the page, you can adjust it by moving the cursor and clicking once elsewhere. This will allow you to choose what you want to block once more.</p>

<p>Now that you’ve selected the part of the website you want to block with uBlock, all you have to do now is click where it says “Create” on the small window at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<p>And voila, you’ve now added some shielding between your mind and an Internet that’s out to get it.</p>

<p>Easy as that.</p>

<p>You can use this process to block parts of other websites that continuously tantalize your attention, and as you accumulate these you’ll create an Internet that works for you rather than against you. Instead of jumping straight into a minefield each time you open your browser, you can be safe in knowing that you’ve diffused the mines and they won’t blow up in your face.</p>

<p>It’s an unorthodox use of an adblocker, I’ll give you that, but this process has been key in my own attempts at maintaining control of my focus and attention as I navigate across the web, and I now hope you can use this to help in your as well.</p>

<h2 id="postscript">Postscript</h2>

<p><span>I messed up! How do I reverse this?</span></p>

<p>It may sometimes happen that you block something you didn’t mean to. You can, by accident, make it so that you can’t use Youtube at all because you’ve blocked the entire website from showing. Ups.</p>

<p>If you blocked something you didn’t mean to, click on the uBlock icon in your browser and select the rightmost icon at the bottom where it says “Open the dashboard.”</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/dfc70657b6aa37c10c12b77c500e26b16e8cc84f/3fb4f/assets/images/usinganadblocker/adblock_opendashboard.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>There, look for the “My filters” tab. This will open what amounts to a text file with all the filters you created. Each line includes the URL of the websites they apply to, so to reverse a mistake you need only delete the appropriate line.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/8630172decd0c80ba9f479c90987b596caa90acc/90fb5/assets/images/usinganadblocker/adblock_dashboard.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p>If you have multiple lines related to a single website, it might just be easier to delete all of them, which will bring that website to its original state, without anything being blocked, and start from scratch.</p>

<p><img src="https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/75319425235fb2f5a6e9b5da343a1be8e03d66cc/3f424/assets/images/usinganadblocker/adblock_rules.jpg" alt=""></p>

<p><a href="https://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jupyter notebooks are cool</a>. They’re language-independent, great for collaboration, easy to customize, you can add extensions—the list goes on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Issues begin when you need to track training hyperparameters, metrics, test results, or graphs. That’s when the chaos starts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then there are spreadsheets, which can quickly become unmanageable, especially in a team environment where you have multiple people who need to edit them at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Managing spreadsheets is painful, and not great for productivity. Once you finish tracking and recording your experiments, you then need to:</p>



<ul><li>Search through and visualize those experiments,</li><li>Organize the experiments / spreadsheet into something all team members can understand,</li><li>Make data sharable and accessible.</li></ul>



<p>It’s not a new issue, ML practitioners have long needed tools to track and manage experiments in one place. There are multiple products that solve this issue in unique ways:</p>

<h2>Deep Learning experiments tracking with Neptune</h2>



<p>Neptune’s Jupyter notebook tracking and collaboration features make it easy to use, and to scale your projects. In fact, the best thing about Neptune is how easy it is to cooperate with your team.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It happens seamlessly, whereas other platforms I used often have lag time when multiple teams or developers work on the same project at once.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another great thing is that Neptune gives you a single place to organize your machine learning experiments. Your team can keep Jupyter notebooks, runs, and more in one convenient space. Few other platforms give you that. Something else unique Neptune provides are auto snapshots. Whenever you run an experiment in a notebook of your choice, such as Jupyter, the current state of the notebook is sent to Neptune automatically.</p>



<p>All of this means that you can focus on developing, rather than having to swift through several apps to find different parts of your experiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neptune’s recording features allow your team to see statistics and run data right from the platform. You don’t have to run Matplotlib operations manually, you can automatically view project statistics relevant to your project.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Neptune combines all essential functionalities of competing products, and they offer a generous free tier.&nbsp;</p>






<h2>Pros and cons of Jupyter Notebooks</h2>



<p>Jupyter notebooks are awesome tools, but there are some issues which make them a bit annoying to work with. Neptune solves these issues, making Jupyter notebooks a stress-free tool.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Developers like to run experiments in Jupyter notebooks because they’re a proven method of showcasing work, and they make it easy to host server sides. This makes them great for security and communication within the developer community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>So what are the issues? For one thing, you can’t collaborate with multiple people when working on a Jupyter notebook. Real-time collaboration doesn’t come with Jupyter notebooks, which can be a big problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Luckily, Neptune allows multiple developers to collaborate on Jupyter notebooks in an interactive way. Link sharing lets you see and download notebooks that your teammates create. Neptune lets you share views of experiments, notebooks, and projects by sharing the URL to a specific view.</p>



<p>The other issue with Jupyter notebooks is inefficient plotting. In theory, you can copy-paste plots from Jupyter directly into external editors like Powerpoint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But having to copy-paste plots every time your data changes is inefficient because data changes all the time. Neptune’s built-in plotting features resolve this problem completely.&nbsp;</p>






<h2>Parts of a Machine Learning experiment&nbsp;</h2>



<p>There are many entities within machine learning experiments. Parameters, artifacts, jobs and relationships, and so on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The dictionary says machine learning experiments are procedures to test a hypothesis. For example, is model 1 better than model 2? Do hyperparameters XYZ have a negative effect on response ABC?&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>In your experiments, you’re dealing with variables, trials, and trial components.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Variables are controllable factors that can vary and record responses (for example model architectures, or hyperparameters).&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trials are simply training iterations on a specific variable set.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Trial components include various parameters, jobs, datasets, models, metadata, and other artifacts. These can be associated with trials, or they can be independent.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, ML flow tracking is an essential part of the experiments we conduct. It is recommended we understand how to use ML flow tracking before continuing on to the tutorial.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are <strong>two components of ML flow tracking: experiments and runs.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>An experiment is the primary unit of organization and access control for ML flow runs. All ML flow runs belong to an experiment. Experiments let you visualize, search for, and compare runs, as well as download run artifacts and metadata for analysis in other tools.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Runs, on the other hand, correspond to a single execution of model code. Each run records the source, version, start and end time, parameters, metrics, tags, and artifacts. The source is the name of the notebook that launched the run, or the project name and entry point for the run.</p>



<p>That’s not all. Other important terms include:</p>



<ul><li>Version: Notebook revision if run from a notebook or Git commit hash if run from an ML Project.&nbsp;</li><li>Start &amp; end time: Start and end time of a run.</li><li>Parameters: Model parameters saved as key-value pairs. Both keys and values are strings.</li><li>Metrics: Model evaluation metrics saved as key-value pairs. The value is numeric. Each metric can be updated throughout the course of the run (for example, to track how your model’s loss function is converging), and ML flow records and lets you visualize the metric’s history.</li><li>Tags: Run metadata saved as key-value pairs. You can update tags during and after a run completes. Both keys and values are strings.</li><li>Artifacts: Output files in any format. For example, you can record images, models (like a pickled scikit-learn model), and data files (like a Parquet file) as an artifact.</li></ul>






<h2>Tutorial: tracking Deep Learning experiments in Jupyter Notebooks with Neptune</h2>



<p>First, let’s create an experiment in Neptune. Neptune helps you with experiment management, or basically tracking experiment metadata (such as code versions, data versions, hyperparameters, environments, and metrics).</p>



<pre>neptune.create_experiment(
    name = <span>'experiment-example'</span>,
    params={<span>'learning_rate'</span>:<span>0.1</span>}
)
</pre>



<p>Logging as many metrics as you can will save your future self a lot of trouble when metrics change with new discoveries or specifications.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Different evaluation metrics include classification accuracy, logarithmic loss, confusion matrix, area under curve, F1 Score, mean absolute error, mean squared error. Tracking these can help you evaluate the performance of your machine learning algorithm and model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For example, your DL model may give you an appropriate <em>accuracy score, </em>but a poor <em>logarithmic loss</em>. Neptune keeps all these metrics nicely organized for each experiment.&nbsp;</p>



<p>You can log a simple metric such as accuracy with Neptune:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<pre>neptune.log_metric(<span>'classification_accuracy'</span>, <span>0.99</span>)</pre>



<p>You can also log more complex metrics such as a confusion matrix:&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Now, let’s go through a deep learning example where we log metrics after each batch and epoch.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>More advanced DL models will go through hundreds of epochs. Manually tracking accuracy, batch loss, and other metrics after each epoch is impossible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If your model performance is not great, you must figure out if you need more data, reduce the model complexity, or find another solution.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To determine the next step, you must know if your model has a bias or variance problem. If it does, we can use data preprocessing techniques to troubleshoot it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Learning curves show the relationship between training set size and a chosen evaluation metric, and can be useful for diagnosing model performance. Neptune automatically generates learning curves as the model trains, and logs metrics after each epoch or batch.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>But first, you must create a NeptuneLogger callback:</strong></p>



<pre><span>from</span> tensorflow.keras.callbacks <span>import</span> Callback
<span><span>class</span> <span>NeptuneLogger</span><span>(Callback)</span>:</span>
   <span><span>def</span> <span>on_batch_end</span><span>(self, batch, logs={})</span>:</span>
       <span>for</span> log_name, log_value <span>in</span> logs.items():
           neptune.log_metric(f<span>'batch_{log_name}'</span>, log_value)
   <span><span>def</span> <span>on_epoch_end</span><span>(self, epoch, logs={})</span>:</span>
       <span>for</span> log_name, log_value <span>in</span> logs.items():
           neptune.log_metric(f<span>'epoch_{log_name}'</span>, log_value)
</pre>



<p>Next, create an experiment, give it a name, and log some hyperparameters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here, we made the epoch size 7, and the batch size 40.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<pre>EPOCH_NR = <span>7</span>
BATCH_SIZE = <span>40</span>
</pre>



<pre>neptune.create_experiment(name=<span>'keras-metrics'</span>,
                         params={<span>'epoch_nr'</span>: EPOCH_NR,
                                 <span>'batch_size'</span>: BATCH_SIZE},
                         tags=[<span>'advanced'</span>],
                         )
</pre>



<p><strong>Finally, pass the Neptune logger as Keras callback:&nbsp;</strong></p>



<pre>history = model.fit(x=x_train,
                   y=y_train,
                   epochs=EPOCH_NR,
                   batch_size=BATCH_SIZE,
                 …</pre></article></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article role="main">
        <p>Last month, <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/a-byzantine-failure-in-the-real-world/">Cloudflare published a postmortem</a> of a recent 6-hour outage caused by a partial switch failure which left <a href="https://etcd.io/">etcd</a> unavailable as it was unable to establish a stable leader. This outage has understandably led to <a href="https://twitter.com/heidiann360/status/1332711011451867139">discussion online</a> about exactly what liveness guarantees are provided by the <a href="https://raft.github.io/">Raft</a> consensus algorithm in the face of network failures.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">original Raft paper</a> makes the following claim:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[Consensus algorithms] are fully functional (available) as long as any majority of the servers are operational and can communicate with each other and with clients.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This statement implies that consensus algorithms such as Raft should tolerate network failures (also known as <a href="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/2019-06-07-modeling-the-adversary/">omission faults</a>) as long as they do not impact communication between the majority of servers.
In this post, we will consider whether Raft can guarantee liveness, and specifically whether it can establish a stable leader, if a network fault means that some servers are no longer connected to each other.</p>

<h2 id="does-raft-guarantee-liveness-in-the-presence-of-network-failures">Does Raft guarantee liveness in the presence of network failures?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, Raft, as described in the original paper, does not guarantee liveness in all such cases. Consider the following example.</p>

<p>We have 5 servers and servers 1, 2, and 3 are connected to each other. Server 4 is only connected to server 2 and server 5 is only connected to server 3. Initially, server 3 is the leader. Server 4 is not connected to the leader so it will timeout, increment its term and send a RequestVote RPC to server 2. Server 2 will update its term and then force server 3 to do the same and thus step down. Eventually, a new leader will be elected (either server 1, 2, or 3) but either server 4 or server 5 (or both) will not be connected to the leader and thus will timeout, updating its term and forcing the leader to step down. This system will not be able to establish a stable leader.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/uploads/RAFT%201.jpg" width="80%">
  <figcaption><center>Partially connected servers 4 and 5 constantly interrupt the elected leader.</center></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In order to guarantee liveness, Raft must ensure that if a leader is up and connected to a majority of responding servers then it will not be forced to step down. Fortunately, section 9.6 of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/OngaroPhD.pdf">Diego Ongaro’s thesis</a> suggests how this can be achieved using <strong>PreVote</strong>. PreVote requires potential candidates to run a trial election to test if they can win an election before incrementing their term and running a normal election using RequestVote. A server only pre-votes for a potential candidate during the PreVote phase if it would vote for it during a normal election, and importantly, if it has not received an AppendEntries RPC from the leader with in the election timeout. PreVote fixes the problem have we described as servers 4 and 5 will not update their terms as they will not receive pre-votes from the majority of servers.</p>

<p>An alternative fix is to require servers to ignore RequestVote RPCs if they have received an AppendEntries RPC from the leader within the election timeout. This was suggested in section 6 in the <a href="https://raft.github.io/raft.pdf">Raft paper</a> as mitigation for liveness issues during reconfiguration. However, we will focus on PreVote instead.</p>

<h2 id="so-does-raft-with-prevote-guarantee-liveness-then">So, does Raft with PreVote guarantee liveness then?</h2>

<p>Unfortunately not. In fact, PreVote introduces new liveness issues to Raft. Consider the following example. We have 5 servers and servers 1, 2, and 3 are connected to each other. Server 4 is connected only to server 2 and server 5 has failed.</p>

<p>Initially, server 4 is the leader. It was elected before its links to the other servers (except server 2) failed. Server 4 is now unable to make progress as it is not connected to a majority of servers. Servers 1 and 3 will not hear from the leader so they will timeout and begin the PreVote phase. Neither server will complete its PreVote phase as server 2 will not pre-vote for either server as it still receives regular AppendEntries from the leader (server 4). This system will not able to elect a new leader and the old leader will not be able to make progress.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="https://decentralizedthoughts.github.io/uploads/RAFT%202.jpg" width="80%">
  <figcaption><center>The leader, Server 4, suffers partial network faults but does not step down. Server 2 does not timeout, severs 1 and 3 will fail PreVote because of server 2.</center></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>This can be addressed by requiring leaders to actively step down if they do not receive AppendEntries responses from a majority of servers. This optimisation is sometimes referred to as CheckQuourm and related matters are mentioned in section 6.2 of <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/papers/OngaroPhD.pdf">Ongaro’s thesis</a> and in <a href="https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/issues/3866">raft discussions</a>.</p>

<h2 id="does-raft-with-prevote-and-checkquorum-guarantee-liveness">Does Raft with PreVote and CheckQuorum guarantee liveness?</h2>

<p>Yes. If there is no leader, then an election (or series of elections) will occur and eventually, a server will be elected leader. To be elected leader, the server must be connected to a majority of servers as it received votes from a majority of servers in the PreVote and RequestVote phases.</p>

<p>CheckQuorum ensures that if the elected leader is no longer connected to a majority of responding servers, it will step down and allow a new leader to be elected.</p>

<p>There will always be at least one server that can win an election. This is the server (or servers) with the most up-to-date log (logs) within the subset of servers which are all online and connected to a majority of responding servers. PreVote ensures that once a leader from this set has been elected, the system will be stable as it will not be forced to step down.</p>

<p>Web crawling is a powerful technique to collect data from the web by finding all the URLs for one or multiple domains. Python has several popular web crawling libraries and frameworks.</p>
<p>In this article, we will first introduce different crawling strategies and use cases. Then we will build a simple web crawler from scratch in Python using two libraries: requests and Beautiful Soup. Next, we will see why it’s better to use a web crawling framework like Scrapy. Finally, we will build an example crawler with Scrapy to collect film metadata from IMDb and see how Scrapy scales to websites with several million pages.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-web-crawler">What is a web crawler?</h2>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_crawler">Web crawling</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping">web scraping</a> are two different but related concepts. Web crawling is a component of web scraping, the crawler logic finds URLs to be processed by the scraper code.</p>
<p>A web crawler starts with a list of URLs to visit, called the seed. For each URL, the crawler finds links in the HTML, filters those links based on some criteria and adds the new links to a queue. All the HTML or some specific information is extracted to be processed by a different pipeline.</p>

<h2 id="web-crawling-strategies">Web crawling strategies</h2>
<p>In practice, web crawlers only visit a subset of pages depending on the crawler budget, which can be a maximum number of pages per domain, depth or execution time.</p>
<p>Most popular websites provide a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robots_exclusion_standard">robots.txt</a> file to indicate which areas of the website are disallowed to crawl by each user agent. The opposite of the robots file is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sitemaps">sitemap.xml</a> file, that lists the pages that can be crawled.</p>
<p>Popular web crawler use cases include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search engines (Googlebot, Bingbot, Yandex Bot…) collect all the HTML for a significant part of the Web. This data is indexed to make it searchable.</li>
<li>SEO analytics tools on top of collecting the HTML also collect metadata like the response time, response status to detect broken pages and the links between different domains to collect backlinks.</li>
<li>Price monitoring tools crawl e-commerce websites to find product pages and extract metadata, notably the price. Product pages are then periodically revisited.</li>
<li>Common Crawl maintains an <a href="https://commoncrawl.org/the-data/get-started/">open repository of web crawl data</a>. For example, the archive from October 2020 contains 2.71 billion web pages.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we will compare three different strategies for building a web crawler in Python. First, using only standard libraries, then third party libraries for making HTTP requests and parsing HTML and finally, a web crawling framework.</p>
<h2 id="building-a-simple-web-crawler-in-python-from-scratch">Building a simple web crawler in Python from scratch</h2>
<p>To build a simple web crawler in Python we need at least one library to download the HTML from a URL and an HTML parsing library to extract links. Python provides standard libraries <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.9/library/urllib.html">urllib</a> for making HTTP requests and <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/html.parser.html">html.parser</a> for parsing HTML. An example Python crawler built only with standard libraries can be found on <a href="https://github.com/xukai92/crawlerfromscratch/blob/master/spider.py">Github</a>.</p>
<p>The standard Python libraries for requests and HTML parsing are not very developer-friendly. Other popular libraries like <a href="https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/">requests</a>, branded as HTTP for humans, and <a href="https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/">Beautiful Soup</a> provide a better developer experience. You can install the two libraries locally.</p>
<p>A basic crawler can be built following the previous architecture diagram.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>The code is very simple but there are many performance and usability issues to solve before successfully crawling a complete website.</p>
<ul>
<li>The crawler is slow and supports no parallelism. As can be seen from the timestamps, it takes about one second to crawl each URL. Each time the crawler makes a request it waits for the request to be resolved and no work is done in between.</li>
<li>The download URL logic has no retry mechanism, the URL queue is not a real queue and not very efficient with a high number of URLs.</li>
<li>The link extraction logic doesn’t support standardizing URLs by removing URL query string parameters, doesn’t handle URLs starting with #, doesn’t support filtering URLs by domain or filtering out requests to static files.</li>
<li>The crawler doesn’t identify itself and ignores the robots.txt file.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, we will see how Scrapy provides all these functionalities and makes it easy to extend for your custom crawls.</p>
<h2 id="web-crawling-with-scrapy">Web crawling with Scrapy</h2>
<p>Scrapy is the most popular web scraping and crawling Python framework with 40k stars on <a href="https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy">Github</a>. One of the advantages of Scrapy is that requests are scheduled and handled asynchronously. This means that Scrapy can send another request before the previous one is completed or do some other work in between. Scrapy can handle many concurrent requests but can also be configured to respect the websites with custom <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html">settings</a>, as we’ll see later.</p>
<p>Scrapy has a multi-component architecture. Normally, you will implement at least two different classes: <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html">Spider</a> and <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/item-pipeline.html">Pipeline</a>. Web scraping can be thought of as an ETL where you extract data from the web and load it to your own storage. Spiders extract the data and pipelines load it into the storage. Transformation can happen both in spiders and pipelines, but I recommend that you set a custom Scrapy pipeline to transform each item independently of each other. This way, failing to process an item has no effect on other items.</p>
<p>On top of all that, you can add spider and downloader middlewares in between components as it can be seen in the diagram below.</p>

<p>Scrapy Architecture Overview [<a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/architecture.html#data-flow">source</a>]</p>
<p>If you have used Scrapy before, you know that a web scraper is defined as a class that inherits from the base Spider class and implements a parse method to handle each response. If you are new to Scrapy, you can read this article for <a href="https://www.scrapingbee.com/blog/web-scraping-with-scrapy/">easy scraping with Scrapy</a>.</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Scrapy also provides several <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#generic-spiders">generic spider classes</a>: CrawlSpider, XMLFeedSpider, CSVFeedSpider and SitemapSpider. The <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/spiders.html#crawlspider">CrawlSpider</a> class inherits from the base Spider class and provides an extra rules attribute to define how to crawl a website. Each rule uses a <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/link-extractors.html#topics-link-extractors">LinkExtractor</a> to specify which links are extracted from each page. Next, we will see how to use each one of them by building a crawler for IMDb, the Internet Movie Database.</p>
<h2 id="building-an-example-scrapy-crawler-for-imdb">Building an example Scrapy crawler for IMDb</h2>
<p>Before trying to crawl IMDb, I checked <a href="https://www.imdb.com/robots.txt">IMDb robots.txt</a> file to see which URL paths are allowed. The robots file only disallows 26 paths for all user-agents. Scrapy reads the robots.txt file beforehand and respects it when the <a href="https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/topics/settings.html#robotstxt-obey">ROBOTSTXT_OBEY</a> setting is set to true. This is the case for all projects generated with the Scrapy command startproject.</p>

            <h2>Enumerating Trees</h2>

            <p>
    Posted on December 14, 2020
</p>



<p>Consider the following puzzle:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a list of <math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mi>n</mi><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math> labels, list all the trees with those labels in order.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For instance, given the labels [1,2,3,4], the answer (for binary trees) is the following:</p>
<pre><code>┌1     ┌1      ┌1     ┌1     ┌1
┤      ┤      ┌┤     ┌┤     ┌┤
│┌2    │ ┌2   ││┌2   │└2    │└2
└┤     │┌┤    │└┤    ┤     ┌┤
 │┌3   ││└3   │ └3   │┌3   │└3
 └┤    └┤     ┤      └┤    ┤
  └4    └4    └4      └4   └4</code></pre>
<p>This problem (the “enumeration” problem) turns out to be quite fascinating and deep, with connections to parsing and monoids. It’s also just a classic algorithmic problem which is fun to try and solve.</p>
<p>The most general version of the algorithm is on forests of rose trees:</p>
<div id="cb2"><pre><code><span id="cb2-1"><span>data</span> <span>Rose</span> a <span>=</span> a <span>:&amp;</span> <span>Forest</span> a</span>
<span id="cb2-2"><span>type</span> <span>Forest</span> a <span>=</span> [<span>Rose</span> a]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It’s worth having a go at attempting it yourself, but if you’d just like to see the slick solutions the following is one I’m especially proud of:</p>
<details>
<summary>Solution to the Enumeration Problem on Forests of Rose Trees</summary>
<div id="cb3"><pre><code><span id="cb3-1"><span>enumForests ::</span> [a] <span>-&gt;</span> [<span>Forest</span> a]</span>
<span id="cb3-2">enumForests <span>=</span> foldrM f []</span>
<span id="cb3-3">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb3-4">    f x xs <span>=</span> <span>zipWith</span> ((<span>:</span>) <span>.</span> (<span>:&amp;</span>) x) (inits xs) (tails xs)</span></code></pre></div>
</details>
<p>In the rest of this post I’ll go through the intuition behind solutions like the one above and I’ll try to elucidate some of the connections to other areas of computer science.</p>

<p>I first came across the enumeration problem when I was writing my master’s thesis: I needed to prove (in Agda) that there were finitely many binary trees of a given size, and that I could list them (this proof was part of a larger verified solver for the countdown problem). My first few attempts were unsuccessful: the algorithm presented in the countdown paper <span data-cites="hutton_countdown_2002">(Hutton <a href="#ref-hutton_countdown_2002" role="doc-biblioref">2002</a>)</span> was not structurally recursive, and did not seem amenable to Agda-style proofs.</p>
<p>Instead, I looked for a type which was isomorphic to binary trees, and which might be easier to reason about. One such type is Dyck words.</p>

<p>A “Dyck word” is a string of balanced parentheses.</p>
<pre><code>()()
(()())()
(())()</code></pre>
<p>It’s (apparently) well-known that these strings are isomorphic to binary trees (although the imperative descriptions of algorithms which actually computed this isomorphism addled my brain), but what made them interesting for me was that they are a <em>flat</em> type, structured like a linked list, and as such should be reasonably straightforward to prove to be finite.</p>
<p>Our first task, then, is to write down a type for Dyck words. Te following is a first possibility:</p>
<div id="cb5"><pre><code><span id="cb5-1"><span>data</span> <span>Paren</span> <span>=</span> <span>LParen</span> <span>|</span> <span>RParen</span></span>
<span id="cb5-2"><span>type</span> <span>Dyck</span> <span>=</span> [<span>Paren</span>]</span></code></pre></div>
<p>But this type isn’t correct. It includes many values which <em>don’t</em> represent balanced parentheses, i.e.&nbsp;the expressions <code>[LParen,RParen] :: Dyck</code> are well-typed. To describe dyck words properly we’ll need to reach for the GADTs:</p>
<div id="cb6"><pre><code><span id="cb6-1"><span>data</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> (<span>n ::</span> <span>Nat</span>)<span> ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb6-2">  <span>Done</span><span> ::</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> <span>Z</span></span>
<span id="cb6-3">  <span>Open</span><span> ::</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> (<span>S</span> n) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> n</span>
<span id="cb6-4">  <span>Clos</span><span> ::</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> n     <span>-&gt;</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> (<span>S</span> n)</span>
<span id="cb6-5"></span>
<span id="cb6-6"><span>type</span> <span>Dyck</span> <span>=</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> <span>Z</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>The first type here represents suffixes of Dyck words; a value of type <code>DyckSuff n</code> represents a string of parentheses which is balanced except for <code>n</code> extraneous closing parentheses. <code>DyckSuff Z</code>, then, has no extraneous closing parens, and as such is a proper Dyck word.</p>
<div id="cb7"><pre><code><span id="cb7-1"><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>Open</span> <span>$</span> <span>Clos</span> <span>$</span> <span>Open</span> <span>$</span> <span>Clos</span> <span>$</span> <span>Done</span><span> ::</span> <span>Dyck</span></span>

<span id="cb8-21"><span>"(()())"</span></span>
<span id="cb8-22"><span>"((()))"</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>A variant of this function was what I needed in my thesis: I also needed to prove that it produced every possible value of the type <code>Dyck</code>, which was not too difficult.</p>
<p>The difficult part is still ahead, though: now we need to convert between this type and a binary tree.</p>

<p>First, for the conversion algorithms we’ll actually need another GADT:</p>
<div id="cb9"><pre><code><span id="cb9-1"><span>infixr</span> <span>5</span> <span>:-</span></span>
<span id="cb9-2"><span>data</span> <span>Stack</span> (<span>a ::</span> <span>Type</span>) (<span>n ::</span> <span>Nat</span>)<span> ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb9-3">  <span>Nil</span><span>  ::</span> <span>Stack</span> a <span>Z</span></span>
<span id="cb9-4"><span>  (:-) ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> a n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> a (<span>S</span> n)</span></code></pre></div>
<p>The familiar length-indexed vector will be extremely useful for the next few bits of code: it will act as a stack in our stack-based algorithms. Here’s one of those algorithms now:</p>
<div id="cb10"><pre><code><span id="cb10-1"><span>dyckToTree ::</span> <span>Dyck</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tree</span></span>
<span id="cb10-2">dyckToTree dy <span>=</span> go dy (<span>Leaf</span> <span>:-</span> <span>Nil</span>)</span>
<span id="cb10-3">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb10-4"><span>    go ::</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> <span>Tree</span> (<span>S</span> n) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Tree</span></span>
<span id="cb10-5">    go (<span>Open</span> d) ts               <span>=</span> go d (<span>Leaf</span> <span>:-</span> ts)</span>
<span id="cb10-6">    go (<span>Clos</span> d) (t1 <span>:-</span> t2 <span>:-</span> ts) <span>=</span> go d (t2 <span>:*:</span> t1 <span>:-</span> ts)</span>
<span id="cb10-7">    go <span>Done</span>     (t  <span>:-</span> <span>Nil</span>)      <span>=</span> t</span></code></pre></div>
<p>This might be familiar: it’s actually shift-reduce parsing dressed up with some types. The nice thing about it is that it’s completely total: all pattern-matches are accounted for here, and when written in Agda it’s clearly structurally terminating.</p>
<p>The function in the other direction is similarly simple:</p>
<div id="cb11"><pre><code><span id="cb11-1"><span>treeToDyck ::</span> <span>Tree</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Dyck</span></span>
<span id="cb11-2">treeToDyck t <span>=</span> go t <span>Done</span></span>
<span id="cb11-3">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb11-4"><span>    go ::</span> <span>Tree</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> n <span>-&gt;</span> <span>DyckSuff</span> n</span>
<span id="cb11-5">    go <span>Leaf</span>        <span>=</span> <span>id</span></span>
<span id="cb11-6">    go (xs <span>:*:</span> ys) <span>=</span> go xs <span>.</span> <span>Open</span> <span>.</span> go ys <span>.</span> <span>Clos</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>Much of this stuff has been on my mind recently because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_IINWzQhow">this</a> <span data-cites="riley_program_2020">(<a href="#ref-riley_program_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span> video on the computerphile channel, in which Graham Hutton goes through using QuickCheck to test an interesting compiler. The compiler itself is explored more in depth in <span data-cites="bahr_calculating_2015">Bahr and Hutton (<a href="#ref-bahr_calculating_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>, where the algorithms developed are really quite similar to those that we have here.</p>
<p>The advantage of the code above is that it’s all <em>total</em>: we will never pop items off the stack that aren’t there. This is a nice addition, and it’s surprisingly simple to add: let’s see if we can add it to the compiler presented in the paper.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to change is we need to add a payload to our tree type: the one above is just the <em>shape</em> of a binary tree, but the language presented in the paper contains values.</p>
<div id="cb12"><pre><code><span id="cb12-1"><span>data</span> <span>Expr</span> (<span>a ::</span> <span>Type</span>) <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb12-2">  <span>Val</span><span>   ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expr</span> a</span>
<span id="cb12-3"><span>  (:+:) ::</span> <span>Expr</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expr</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Expr</span> a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We’ll need to change the definition of <code>Dyck</code> similarly:</p>
<div id="cb13"><pre><code><span id="cb13-1"><span>data</span> <span>Code</span> (<span>n ::</span> <span>Nat</span>) (<span>a ::</span> <span>Type</span>)<span> ::</span> <span>Type</span> <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb13-2">  <span>HALT</span><span> ::</span> <span>Code</span> (<span>S</span> <span>Z</span>) a</span>
<span id="cb13-3">  <span>PUSH</span><span> ::</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Code</span> (<span>S</span> n) a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Code</span> n a</span>
<span id="cb13-4">  <span>ADD</span><span>  ::</span> <span>Code</span> (<span>S</span> n) a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Code</span> (<span>S</span> (<span>S</span> n)) a</span></code></pre></div>
<p>After making it so that these data structures can now store contents, there are two other changes worth pointing out:</p>
<ul>
<li>The names have been changed, to match those in the paper. It’s a little clearer now that the Dyck word is a bit like code for a simple stack machine.</li>
<li>The numbering on <code>Code</code> has changed. Now, the <code>HALT</code> constructor has a parameter of <code>1</code> (well, <code>S Z</code>), where its corresponding constructor in <code>Dyck</code> (<code>Done</code>) had <code>0</code>. Why is this? I am not entirely sure! To get this stuff to all work out nicely took a huge amount of trial and error, I would love to see a more principled reason why the numbering changed here.</li>
</ul>
<p>With these definitions we can actually transcribe the <code>exec</code> and <code>comp</code> functions almost verbatim <span data-cites="bahr_calculating_2015">(from page 11 and 12 of <a href="#ref-bahr_calculating_2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="cb14"><pre><code><span id="cb14-1"><span>exec ::</span> <span>Code</span> n <span>Int</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> <span>Int</span> (n <span>+</span> m) <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Stack</span> <span>Int</span> (<span>S</span> m)</span>
<span id="cb14-2">exec <span>HALT</span>         st              <span>=</span> st</span>
<span id="cb14-3">exec (<span>PUSH</span> v is)  st              <span>=</span> exec is (v <span>:-</span> st)</span>
<span id="cb14-4">exec (<span>ADD</span>    is) (t1 <span>:-</span> t2 <span>:-</span> st) <span>=</span> exec is (t2 <span>+</span> t1 <span>:-</span> st)</span>
<span id="cb14-5"></span>
<span id="cb14-6"><span>comp ::</span> <span>Expr</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Code</span> <span>Z</span> a</span>
<span id="cb14-7">comp e <span>=</span> comp' e <span>HALT</span></span>
<span id="cb14-8">  <span>where</span></span>
<span id="cb14-9"><span>    comp' ::</span> <span>Expr</span> a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Code</span> (<span>S</span> n) a <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Code</span> n a</span>
<span id="cb14-10">    comp' (<span>Val</span>     x) <span>=</span> <span>PUSH</span> x</span>
<span id="cb14-11">    comp' (xs <span>:+:</span> ys) <span>=</span> comp' xs <span>.</span> comp' ys <span>.</span> <span>ADD</span></span></code></pre></div>

<p>As I have mentioned, a big benefit of all of this stuff is that it can be translated into Agda readily. The real benefit of <em>that</em> is that we can show the two representations of programs are fully isomorphic. I have proven this <a href="https://github.com/oisdk/agda-playground/blob/d7234c276f063dbb4a2d2cbcedb86dd48501a908/Data/Dyck/Payload.agda">here</a>: the proof is surprisingly short (about 20 lines), and the rest of the code follows the Haskell stuff quite closely. I got the idea for much of the proof from <a href="https://gist.github.com/Boarders/9d83f9cbcfaffb04cf2464588fc46df9">this</a> bit of code by <a href="https://boarders.github.io/">Callan McGill</a> <span data-cites="mcgill_compiler_2020">(<a href="#ref-mcgill_compiler_2020" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>I’ll include it here as a reference.</p>

Of course, when that vital piece of automation is over-engineered or&nbsp;clunky</p><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/22g1lenhck4z/5ILHZ4nEFO4zJ1TSyNNWba/a55ce2d82136b4c1955ba25499e3a31c/1__4lfHhlpTpkP__NLtnVb0b3Q.png" loading="lazy"></figure><p>At YLD we are confronted daily with daunting questions about what should be automated, how much of it should be automated, and how much time should be spent on automating it. When we make the right decisions, we can have a huge impact on a company and the world; when we don’t, we can spend days, weeks or months slaving over tooling that no one will&nbsp;use.</p><p>Enter METAFONT, the original font creation automation tool. If you have ever worked with the typesetting software LaTeX, you may have heard of Metafont. If you have heard of Metafont, odds are you have become obsessed with it. If you have become obsessed with Metafont, drop me an email and let’s drown our sorrows together.</p><p>On the other hand, if you’re just curious, read on. Metafont is a beautiful example of <a href="https://www.yld.io/engineering/">software engineering</a> at its most ambitious, but also its most fragile. Everyone should know about&nbsp;it!</p><h2>What is Metafont?</h2><p>Metafont is a language for creating parametric fonts written by the Stanford computer scientist Donald Knuth. It is the first and by far the most powerful format for specifying parametric fonts. It is also, by the by, an engine for solving simultaneous equations. But more on that later.&nbsp;First…</p><h2>What is a parametric font?</h2><p>If you have been following recent developments in CSS, you may be aware that parametric fonts are coming to a stylesheet near you. The CSS Fonts Module Level 4 specification defines several properties designed to work with the parametric font format OpenType&nbsp;1.8:</p><ul><li>font-weight</li><li>font-stretch</li><li>font-style</li><li>font-optical-sizing</li></ul><p>The current way of the web is to ship several font files explicitly containing all of the font variations that are required: bold, italics, small capitals etc. These variations are then scattered like marbles across the page. By contrast the new specification will allow us to treat fonts more like plasticine: we can ship a single font file and simply mutate the appearance of it through CSS. Why is that&nbsp;better?</p><ul><li>We we have only one file so reduce page loading&nbsp;time.</li><li>We can animate&nbsp;fonts.</li><li>We can adjust the look of fonts to take account of ambient lighting.</li><li>We can adjust text to its container.</li><li>We can scale fonts nonlinearly to take account of different design requirements at different scales.</li><li>We can adjust fonts to improve accessibility.</li></ul><p>With just the few parameters offered by OpenType 1.8, we can have a huge impact on the appearance of a font. Now consider: fonts designed with Metafont support an infinite number of parameters!</p><h2>Metafont is&nbsp;unusual</h2><p>In OpenType 1.8 and the variable font formats that preceded it (e.g. Adobe’s Multiple Masters), glyphs are defined as outline shapes that are filled. A parameter is implemented by defining two glyphs at the opposite end of an axis of variability: the computer then uses linear interpolation to determine the intermediate forms. Metafont is different. In Metafont the glyphs are defined as the strokes of a pen, where both the shape of the strokes and the shape of the pen can be described abstractly by a set of simultaneous equations. Here is an example of a simplified Metafont&nbsp;program:</p><p>The advantage of this form of description is that we do not need to know the absolute coordinates of the points of the letter. As long as we can identify the relationships between some anchor points (z1 to z7) and set them down mathematically, Metafont can work out where exactly those points fall and join them with a suitable curve. In this case, the strokes we are constructing are all linear and the only parameters are the dimensions of the letter. But it would be possible to write down mathematical constructions of arbitrary complexity, parametrised in any way you like. The language has been designed to make this task as easy as possible. It allows, for example, equations to be written with a syntax this is closer to ordinary mathematical notation than most languages.</p><p>Let us run Metafont in proof mode to check what letter we have&nbsp;drawn:</p><pre><code>$ mf my-letter; gftodvi my-letter; open my-letter.dvi

All Knuth’s work on typesetting and font creation software is, on the face of it, nothing more than an effort to get his book printed to a reasonable standard.</p><p>The first edition of Knuth’s books appeared in 1969, printed using metal type in a fashion not fundamentally dissimilar from the techniques developed by Gutenberg. Hundreds of years of refinement of the use of metal type had produced excellent standards in fonts and typesetting. By the time of the second edition In 1976, however, the technology had changed. A new technique called phototypesetting eliminated the need for tonnes of metal by allowing fonts to be inscribed onto a small glass disc and typeset by projection. Unfortunately, the speed with which this technology was brought to market meant the quality was relatively poor. Seeing that digital printing was on the horizon, Knuth seized the opportunity to use computers to create a system that could match the quality of the old metal&nbsp;type.</p><p>Knuth laboured on the first version of Metafont, and a font written in the language (‘Computer Modern’), for 5 years. In 1982 he received the proofs of the first books printed with his system. He was, reportedly, “devastated”. The quality was higher than any book produced by phototypesetting, but still not up to the standards of the old metal type. Over the following three years Knuth rewrote Metafont from the ground up and collaborated with the famous type designer Hermann Zapf to produce MetaFont84 and the final version of Computer Modern. All told it was at least 8 years of hard&nbsp;work.</p><p>So why did he do it? Thankfully Knuth reflected a lot on his motivations, so much so that his reflections provide useful fodder for thinking about automation in general. We can identify five distinct motivations:</p><p><strong>1<!-- -->.<!-- --> Convenience</strong></p><p>A font comprises far more than the 26 letters of the alphabet and a few mathematical symbols and punctuation marks. A typical font will exist in anywhere from 10 to 300 versions: bold, italics, small capitals, etc. When the switch was made to phototypesetting, the need to create all these versions individually had massively multiplied the labour involved in transferring the old designs to the new medium. Knuth speculated that if he could capture all of the information required in a single design and produce the variations automatically, then he would be able to create fonts to a high standard without sacrificing economy and speed. A familiar story when it comes to automation.</p><p><strong>2<!-- -->.<!-- --> Analysis</strong></p><p>What specific proportions make a font appear harmonious are not always obvious, but writing a metafont obliges us to specify them exactly. As Knuth put&nbsp;it:</p><blockquote><p>“The ability to explain a design in precise terms is highly instructive”</p></blockquote><p>More than that, however, Metafont forces us to come up with a generalisation about those proportions and allows us to change the parameters to see if the generalisation holds. By observing the limits of any given generalisation, we can come up with a better one. Knuth even went so far as to&nbsp;claim:</p><blockquote><p>“The art of letter design will not be fully understood until it can be explained to a computer”</p></blockquote><p><strong>3<!-- -->.<!-- --> Experimentation</strong></p><p>Once we have a parameterised system, we can use it to discover new and unexpected results. With Metafont, we do not need to know in advance what our font should look like. We can come up with a rough estimate, vary the parameters, and pick the outcome that we prefer.&nbsp;Indeed:</p><blockquote><p>“An almost endless series of interesting experiments can be performed, now that Metafont is available”</p></blockquote><p><strong>4<!-- -->.<!-- --> Fun</strong></p><p>Knuth often raises variants of the following question:</p><blockquote><p>“The ability to manipulate lots of parameters may be interesting and fun, but does anybody really need a 6.5-point font that is one fourth of the way between Baskerville and Helvetica”</p></blockquote><p>In most cases he attempts to play down simple fun in favour of the other more politically correct motivations, but it is obvious that no one would work on a project for 8 years if they did not find it interesting and fun. Indeed, Knuth plays with Metafont throughout his papers, making, as he put it, “a travesty of mathematics”:</p><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/22g1lenhck4z/6U1TUPU9KbO69VlbHLdmlT/97296c029be31ada827a5136dc528221/1__3J__5YadRtdPP2DvudDXeKg.png" loading="lazy"><figcaption><p>Image source: <a href="https://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.bams/1183544082"><em>Mathematical Typography</em></a></p></figcaption></figure><p>At the end of his paper on <em>The Concept of a Meta-Font,</em> Knuth comes back this question and reclaims fun as a legitimate reason for introducing parametric variation, because variety is a basic human&nbsp;need:</p><blockquote><p>“The utility of parametric variations comes from mankind’s need for&nbsp;variety”</p></blockquote><p>Fun is in the end one of the most important motivations for creating ever more powerful automation.</p><p><strong>5<!-- -->.<!-- --> Idealism</strong></p><p>Knuth was very idealistic about what the aims of automation should be. He comes back again and again to the idea that automation should capture the “substance”, the “intelligence” or the “spirit” of its object, recognising both Aristotle’s <em>Metaphysics</em> and Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em> as inspiration for the name “Metafont”:</p><blockquote><p>“We should copy the substance rather than the&nbsp;form”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The intelligence of that letter can be captured in a way that permits us to obtain an infinite&nbsp;variety”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“…Capture the&nbsp;spirit”</p></blockquote><p>Knuth is not content to have the computer be a slave; he wants to teach it to be an artist. It is surely this desire that underlies the unusual decision to have the computer construct letters by pen strokes rather than outlines. If that is right then Knuth’s choice of model has been influenced more by “spiritual” considerations than practical ones. The term “spiritual” is not used lightly. Here is how Knuth demonstrates the continuous variation of parameters:</p><figure><img src="https://images.ctfassets.net/22g1lenhck4z/72pjx4xEIZwk2JrpixRFYv/052bb08dd53c16732af048c919072cac/1__WLuqMZhp9S4TI__btT5TSoA.png" loading="lazy"><figcaption><p>Image source: <a href="http://visiblelanguagejournal.com/issue/61/article/748">The Concept of a Meta-Font</a></p></figcaption></figure><p>Knuth characterises the beginning of this variable font as “old-fashioned” and the end as “hyper-modern”, writing …</p></div></div>

  <div>
  
  <p>Few non-native English speakers seem to become bestselling authors.
<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1319.The_War_of_Art">Writing is tough</a>.
Writing in a foreign language is even tougher.
Professional writers spend years perfecting their art.
But most of us can’t put in the effort required to become one.</p>
<p>When I first started writing I was unsatisfied.
My sentences felt clunky and didn’t flow very well.
Luckily, I noticed that by sticking to a few patterns my style improved significantly.</p>
<p>The book that helped me the most was <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well">On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction</a>.
It’s mandatory reading for all journalists and book writers.
I’m neither, but the perspective it gave me was invaluable.
You should still read the book, but here are a few rules that will help you boost the quality of your writing immediately.</p>
<h2 id="pick-a-good-topic">Pick a Good Topic</h2>
<p>I found these to be the best sources of high quality, information dense articles:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://syften.com/blog/post/content-creation/">A question on social media</a></strong>. Write a response in the form of a blog post. Now you have well thought out content to reply with.</li>
<li><strong>A lengthy email reply</strong>. If one person needed that long reply, chances are others will want to read it too.</li>
</ul>
<p>My friend asked me to review his article.
I sent him my review, copied the email to a text editor, replaced advice specific to his article with general thoughts and got the first draft of this post.
Next I slept on it, rewrote portions of it in the morning and published it.</p>
<h2 id="stick-to-your-topic">Stick To Your Topic</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Determine what you want to say</strong>, then say it. Each paragraph must have a purpose.</li>
<li><strong>Write a rough draft, then rewrite it</strong> removing and simplifying everything you can.</li>
<li><strong>Leave your reader with just one new thought</strong>. If there are multiple topics you wish to discuss, write multiple articles.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://syften.com/blog/post/writing-style/The-Essence-of-Writing-is-Rewriting.jpg" alt=""></p>
<h2 id="style">Style</h2>
<p>Make your blog stand out, but not your writing style.
Otherwise you’ll appear barbaric and foreign.
Here are some rules of thumb worth sticking to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Capitalize your titles correctly</strong>, use <a href="https://capitalizemytitle.com/">Capitalize My Title</a>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.roanestate.edu/owl/Commas.html">Avoid abusing commas</a></strong>. If you can remove it then you probably should.
This one is the most difficult for me and I’m still struggling with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma_splice">comma splices</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Make sure your content is actionable</strong>.
If it’s not then it’s just your diary, or worse, a lame attempt at SEO.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t answer your own rhetorical questions</strong>. It’s like laughing at your own jokes.</li>
<li><strong>Use an automatic editor</strong>.
Book writers have editors and they do a great job.
I’m reminded of that every time I read a self-published book.
Luckily for us the job is getting automated. Many people recommend Grammarly. A popular number two choice is <a href="https://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway Editor</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Add examples and anecdotes</strong> and back up your claims - otherwise they’re just opinions.</li>
<li><strong>Treat your audience as you would like to be treated yourself</strong>.
Be humble.
Your readers are just as intelligent as you are, just slightly less knowledgable in that one particular field.</li>
<li><strong>Use a thesaurus to avoid repeating words</strong>.
I like <a href="https://thefreedictionary.com/">The Free Dictionary</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Use a thesaurus to find more accurate words</strong>.
Those reading your content are “individuals”, but it’s better to refer to them as “your audience” or “readers”.</li>
<li><strong>Remove clutter words</strong>.
It’s cleaner than “At all times make sure to remember to try and look for words that might be considered as clutter that you may wish to remove”.</li>
<li><strong>Express your personality</strong>, like you would when talking with a friend.
This one comes from my girlfriend.
After reading one of my articles she said it’s rather dry and I should just write the way I speak when I’m telling her a story.
There is no “audience” reading your text, it’s always one person.</li>
<li><strong>Share your strong opinions</strong>.
Let your readers disagree if they wish, trying to please everyone with vague advice will neuter your article.</li>
<li><strong>Be consistent</strong>.
Are you sharing your personal experiences or are you writing a textbook?
Are you writing in the past tense or the future?</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Ryan-Holiday">Learn by imitation</a></strong>.
Copy what successful authors are doing, because they’re doing it deliberately.
They’ve worked on their style for years.
They write and rewrite each sentence leaving nothing to chance.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="resources">Resources</h2>

<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53343.On_Writing_Well">On Writing Well</a>, the book.</li>

      <p>As your blog grows and you <a href="https://draft.dev/learn/posts/finding-motivating-writers">get more writers to contribute</a>, you need to build documents and processes to help you maintain high quality and consistent style. To serve this goal, you should create a style guide to help writers and editors stay on the same page.</p>

<p>Generally, <strong>a style guide includes expectations for your contributors</strong>. Depending on your priorities, you may include more or less information than we do at <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft.dev</a>, but our style guide should give you an excellent place to start. We send this style guide to all new contributors to ensure they are familiar with our expectations, and we refer to this guide throughout the editing process.</p>

<p>Of course, ours is not the only example of a technical writing style guide. If you’re looking to compare your options, check out <a href="https://developers.google.com/style">Google’s developer documentation style guide</a>, <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/digitalocean-s-technical-writing-guidelines">DigitalOcean’s technical writing guidelines</a>, and some of the <a href="https://medium.com/technical-writing-is-easy/style-guides-for-technical-writers-72b011f84c4b">other guides here</a>. If you’re creating a style guide, I’d recommend reading over several and deciding what you want to include in yours.</p>

<h2 id="the-draftdev-technical-blogging-style-guide">The Draft.dev Technical Blogging Style Guide</h2>

<p>At <a href="https://draft.dev/">Draft.dev</a>, we specialize in creating technical blog content for companies that want to reach software engineers. While most of our writers are software engineers first and authors second, we still expect them to follow consistent standards for each of our clients.</p>

<p>Below is our style guide, which is broken up into four sections:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="#voice">Voice</a></li>
  <li><a href="#content">Content</a></li>
  <li><a href="#conventions">Conventions</a></li>
  <li><a href="#communication">Communication</a></li>
</ol>

<h3 id="voice">Voice</h3>

<h4 id="write-in-second-person">Write in Second Person</h4>
<p>Speak to your readers directly using “you” and “your.” Avoid “we” and “our.”</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You can use a web browser (like Chrome, Safari, or Edge) to access web sites on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We can use our web browsers (like Chrome, Safari, or Edge) to access web sites on the internet.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="use-conversational-business-appropriate-language">Use Conversational, Business-Appropriate Language</h4>
<p>Read your article out loud and ask yourself, “Would I talk like this at work?” Use your real-world experience, but avoid jargon when possible.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Experts agree that the internet was not the product of any individual mind, but a series of advances in networking and computer science.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many scholars would agree that, had it not been for active networks, the simulation of Lamport clocks might never have occurred. The notion that end-users synchronize with the investigation of Markov models is rarely outdated. A theoretical grand challenge in theory is the important unification of virtual machines and real-time theory. To what extent can web browsers be constructed to achieve this purpose?</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="dont-repeat-yourself">Don’t Repeat Yourself</h4>
<p>Eliminate wordiness. You shouldn’t repeat yourself when programming, and you shouldn’t repeat yourself when writing.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lively debate rages among software developers. The contentious issue is: tabs or spaces?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is currently a lively, ongoing controversy among many computer scientists and other professional in the field of software development: theories are being spun and arguments are being conducted among them about whether the use of tabs to designate indentation in a document is superior to the use of spaces for the same purpose.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="content">Content</h3>

<h4 id="the-introduction">The Introduction</h4>
<p>Every article should have a 1-3 paragraph introduction. This introduction should accomplish two things:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Briefly tell readers what the article is about.</li>
  <li>Hook your readers. Give them a reason to continue reading.</li>
</ol>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I remember the first time I built user preferences into an app. At first, users just needed to be able to opt in or out of our weekly emails. “No big deal,” I thought, “I’ll just add a new field on the Users table.” For a while, that was fine. A few weeks later, my boss asked me if we could let users opt into push notifications. Fine, that’s just one more column on the database. Can’t hurt, right?</p>

  <p>You probably see where this is going.</p>

  <p>Within months, my user table had 40 columns, and while Postgres can handle it, it gets pretty tricky for new devs to keep up with all of them.</p>

  <p>Fortunately, Postgres provides rich support for JSON fields, which can be very handy in situations like mine. Both JSON data types (<code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code>) allow you to store entire objects or lists directly in your database. This means that you can store any number of user preferences in one column.</p>

  <p>In this post, I’ll show you how to use Postgres’ JSON fields in a Django web application. You’ll learn about the differences between <code>json</code> and <code>jsonb</code>, how to query JSON data and some of the drawbacks of storing your data in JSON.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad (no “hook”):</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<h4 id="support-claims-with-evidence">Support Claims With Evidence</h4>
<p>For every claim you make, ask yourself, “How can I prove this?” You can do this by:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Including a link to a reputable article</li>
  <li>Including a quote from another source</li>
  <li>Citing an academic study</li>
  <li>Linking to the official documentation</li>
  <li>Interviewing knowledgeable professionals</li>
</ul>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While [Postgres can handle hundreds of columns](https://nerderati.com/2017/01/03/postgresql-tables-can-have-at-most-1600-columns/), it might not be a good idea to take advantage of this feature.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While I’m guessing Postgres can handle a lot of columns, it might not be a good idea to use more than a hundred if you can help it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="the-conclusion">The Conclusion</h4>
<p>Every article should include a 1-2 paragraph conclusion. This should restate the thesis of the article and remind readers what they learned. It may also include other resources readers can reference to learn more.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While JSON data types come with some drawbacks, they are useful when you need more flexibility in your data structure. Thanks to Django’s native support for `jsonb`, you can get started using JSON data in your web applications without [learning all the native Postgres query operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html).</p>

  <p>Next time you need more flexibility in your data model and want to benefit from the strengths of Postgres give `jsonb` fields a try.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="conventions">Conventions</h3>

<h4 id="write-in-markdown">Write in Markdown</h4>
<p>All articles should be written in <a href="https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/">Markdown</a> and submitted in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Doc</a> sent to you when you accept the assignment.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Markdown is a formatting language often *used by static site generators* and *blogs*. If you aren’t familiar with its syntax, you can [click here to learn more](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="upload-images-to-imgur">Upload Images to <a href="https://imgur.com/">Imgur</a></h4>
<p>If you have screenshots or diagrams in your article, upload them to <a href="https://imgur.com/">Imgur’s free image hosting service</a> and embed them using Markdown. Include descriptive text inside the brackets (<code>[...]</code>) so that screen readers can describe the image.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>![A diagram showing different computer hardware](https://i.imgur.com/hBE7ZF8.jpg)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>![](https://www.my-private-image-server.net/image-1.png)</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Headers make your content more scannable. Use <code>##</code>, <code>###</code>, and <code>####</code> header tags to denote different sections. Headings should be written in <a href="https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/title-case">title case</a>.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>## How to Use JSON Fields in Your Python Application</p>

  <p>…</p>

  <p>### The Two JSON Formats Supported by Postgres</p>

  <p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad (not title case):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>## How to use JSON fields in your Python application</p>

  <p>…
### The two JSON formats supported by Postgres</p>

  <p>…</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="denote-code-with-backticks">Denote Code with Backticks</h4>
<p>Use code blocks when the code is one or more lines long or deserves special emphasis.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>```</p>

  <p>function snafu() {</p>

  <p>return null;</p>

  <p>}</p>

  <p>```</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>`function snafu() {</p>

  <p>return null;</p>

  <p>}`</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use inline code when referring to a variable name or short command in context.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Call the `snafu()` method to exit and return to your command line.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Call the “snafu()” method to exit and return to your command line.</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="use-double-quotes-for-quotations">Use Double Quotes for Quotations</h4>
<p>Use blockquotes when the quote is two or more lines long.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some text leading up to the quote.</p>

  <p>&gt; “The field/element/path extraction operators return NULL, rather than failing, if the JSON input does not have the right structure to match the request; for example if no such key or array element exists.”</p>

  <p>Some text after the quote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some text leading up to the quote. “The field/element/path extraction operators return NULL, rather than failing, if the JSON input does not have the right structure to match the request; for example if no such key or array element exists.” Some text after the quote.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Use inline quotes when the quote is relatively short or when you’re referencing a single word or phrase.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“There’s nothing to see here,” said Davies.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&gt; “There’s nothing to see here.” - Davies</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 id="use-emphasis-sparingly">Use Emphasis Sparingly</h4>
<p>Use <em>italics</em> to emphasize text or use <strong>bold</strong> to suggest strong emphasis.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is *nothing* as important as using **spaces** to indent your code.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="communication">Communication</h3>

<h4 id="communicate-delays-and-roadblocks-to-your-editor-proactively">Communicate Delays and Roadblocks to Your Editor Proactively</h4>
<p>You will not be penalized for late work if you’ve been in communication with us about the assignment. We can offer technical help and extensions, but you must ask two or more days before the due date.</p>

<p>Good:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey Karl,</p>

  <p>I know the Postgres article is due next week, but I’m running into trouble. Would you be willing to hop on a quick call and explain the JSON fields in Postgres? Or do you have any resources that might help me out?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Bad:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hey Karl,</p>

  <p>I know my Postgres article was due today, but I’m not able to figure out the JSON fields in Postgres. Could I have an extension until next week to struggle with it more?</p>

																										<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In an exclusive feature for&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, U.S. military and intelligence officials, as well as Pentagon emails, offer an unprecedented glimpse behind the scenes of what’s currently going on with The Pentagon’s investigation into UFOs, or as they term them, “Unidentified Aerial Phenomena” (UAP).&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">For the last two years, the Department of Defense’s newly revamped “Unidentified Aerial Phenomena Task Force” (or UAPTF) has been busy briefing lawmakers, Intelligence Community stakeholders, and the highest levels of the U.S. military on encounters with what they say are mysterious airborne objects that defy conventional explanations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Along with classified briefings, multiple senior U.S. officials with direct knowledge of the matter say two classified intelligence reports on UAP have been widely distributed to the U.S. Intelligence Community. Numerous sources from various government agencies told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> that these reports include clear photographic evidence of UAP. The reports also explicitly state that the Task Force is considering the possibility that these unidentified objects could, as stated by one source from the U.S. Intelligence Community said, be operated by “intelligences of unknown origin.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Significantly, a retired U.S. Air Force brigadier general and head of RAND corporation’s Space Enterprise Initiative has—for the first time—gone on record to discuss some of the most likely explanations for UAP. His responses were surprising.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Briefings At The Highest Levels&nbsp;</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In June, the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence’s </span><a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CRPT-116srpt233/pdf/CRPT-116srpt233.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">FY2021 Intelligence Authorization Act</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> contained an intriguing section titled report on “Advanced Aerial Threats.” In the inclusion, the committee gave an eye-opening official hint (in recent history) the government takes UFOs seriously by offering its support for the “efforts of the Unidentified Aerial Phenomenon Task Force at the Office of Naval Intelligence.” The Intelligence Committee additionally requested an unclassified report detailing the analysis of “UAP” or “Anomalous Aerial Vehicles.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Though already acknowledged by the Intelligence Committee, in mid-August, the Pentagon&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.thedebrief.org/the-dod-has-officially-announced-it-has-a-uap-task-force-heres-what-that-means/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">formally acknowledged</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;they had established a task force looking into UAP. In a press announcement, the Secretary of Defense’s Office&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.defense.gov/Newsroom/Releases/Release/Article/2314065/establishment-of-unidentified-aerial-phenomena-task-force/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">stated</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, “the UAPTF’s mission will be to detect, analyze and catalog UAPs that could potentially pose a threat to U.S. national security.” According to the release, authority for the Task Force was approved by the DoD’s chief operating officer, Deputy Secretary of Defense David L. Norquist.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The summer news of the establishment of the UAPTF seemingly suggests—for the first time since the shuttering of Project Blue Book (the Air Force’s official investigations into UFOs) in 1969—that the Pentagon is now taking the subject of UFOs seriously.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">However, an internal email obtained by&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">shows that almost one year before the DoD’s announcement, the highest levels of the U.S. military were already being briefed on UAP.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The email, obtained via Freedom of Information Act request, shows an October 16th, 2019 exchange between then Vice Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Robert Burke, and current Vice Chief of Staff for the Air Force General Stephen “Steve” Wilson.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">In the email, Adm. Burke tells Gen. Wilson, “Recommend you take the brief I just received from our Director of Naval Intelligence VADM Matt Kohler, on Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP).” Adm. Burke concludes the email, “SECNAV [Secretary of the Navy] will get the same brief tomorrow at 1000.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The “SECNAV” referenced in Adm. Burke’s email was then-Secretary of the Navy, Richard V. Spencer. A little over a month after this UAP briefing, Spencer was fired by then-Secretary of Defense Mark Esper over public disagreements stemming from a&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/nov/28/navy-secretary-richard-spencer-donald-trump-navy-seal" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">series of controversies&nbsp;</span></a><span data-preserver-spaces="true">involving the court-martial of Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher.</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Speaking on background, one U.S. Defense official lamented that a lack of continuity with DoD leadership might have hindered some of the UAPTF’s work. Within the past 24 months, there have been four different Secretaries of the Navy and five additional Secretaries of Defense. Vice Admiral Matt Kohler, noted for having provided the briefings, retired after 36 years with the Navy in June of this year.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Attendees at the meeting told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that they were provided information on two previous DoD-backed UFO programs: The Advanced Aerial Weapons Systems Applications Program (AAWSAP) and the Advanced Aerospace Threat Identification Program (AATIP). They were also briefed on “highly sensitive categories of UFO investigations.” Only two days later on October 23rd, staffers with the Senate Select Intelligence Committee were provided the same information in a meeting on Capitol Hill.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">A former private contractor for AAWSAP and AATIP, Dr. Hal Puthoff, confirmed for&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">he was one of a handful of persons who conducted the October briefings. “I have been invited to brief congressional staffers on the Senate Armed Services Committee on UAP matters in the last couple of years,” Puthoff said in an email, “and have done so on more than one occasion.” Dr. Puthoff described the staffers during these meetings as being “engaged,” and provided “positive responses, [and] more details always being requested.”&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">reached out to the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs Office and DoD Executive Services Office and formally requested an interview with someone authorized to speak on the UAP briefings with the Joint Chiefs of Staff. In an email, Senior Strategist and Pentagon spokesperson Susan Gough responded, “To maintain operations security, which includes not disseminating information publicly that may be useful to our adversaries, DOD does not discuss publicly the details of either the observations or the examination of reported incursions into our training ranges or designated airspace, including those incursions initially designated as UAP – and that includes not discussing the UAPTF publicly, also.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Official public affairs channels indicate the Pentagon is not interested in sharing any more information on the UAP topic. However, several current and former officials with the DoD and individuals working for multiple U.S. intelligence agencies told&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">that there was much more going on behind closed doors.</span></p>

<h2><strong><span data-preserver-spaces="true">UAP Intelligence Position Reports</span></strong></h2>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Multiple sources confirmed for&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">&nbsp;that the UAPTF had issued two classified intelligence position reports, which one individual described as “shocking.” Details provided on these reports suggest both a greater degree of Pentagon involvement, and that the UAPTF’s&nbsp;hunt for unidentified objects isn’t confined only to aerial phenomena.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Two officials with the DoD and one from the U.S. Intelligence community were willing to provide details on the contents of the classified report. An additional three other U.S. Intelligence Officials and a federal law enforcement officer confirmed the report’s existence but were only willing to provide comments on their distribution. Given the report’s classification and their discussion of a “sensitive intelligence matter,” the officials we spoke with did so only under strict conditions of anonymity. While&nbsp;</span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">has agreed not to provide information on sources, identities, and employers, though everyone we spoke with works within the U.S. Intelligence Community and under the authority of the U.S. Director of National Intelligence.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One of the intelligence reports, released in 2018, is said to have provided a general overview of the UAP topic and included details of previous military encounters. According to sources who had read it, the report also contained an unreleased photograph of an “aerial phenomena” categorized as “unidentified.”&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The Debrief&nbsp;</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">was told the accompanying photo was captured from within the cockpit of an F/A-18 fighter jet with a pilot’s personal cell phone. According to three U.S. officials who had seen it, the photo showed an unidentified silver “cube-shaped” object. The report is said to have indicated the object was “hovering” or completely motionless when military pilots encountered it. All three officials agreed that based on the photo, the object appeared to be at an altitude of roughly 30,000 to 35,000 feet and approximately 1,000 feet from the fighter jet.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Defense and intelligence officials willing to discuss the report and those who only wished to confirm its dissemination all expressed shock that it had been so widely distributed amongst the Intelligence community.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">“In decades with the [Intelligence Community] I’ve never seen anything like this,” said one intelligence official.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><span data-preserver-spaces="true">One defense official described the report’s distribution as having gone through “normal, non-public, information sharing channels.” Other officials who’d seen and read the report either declined to elaborate or indicated the report was distributed on various secure systems. One defense official indicated it was distributed on the DoD’s Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNet). Two other intelligence officials said they received the information via “NSANet” (the NSA’s official intranet). An additional source said …</span></p></div></div></div>

To date, there exist multiple service mesh implementations with different architectural approaches ranging from smaller open-source projects to major endeavours being backed by big companies such as Google. This introduces questions about how mature the current service mesh projects are and what performance impact they have.&nbsp;<br></p></div></div><div data-id="caba7b6" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>The goals of this thesis have been to analyze services meshes based on the following criteria:</p><ul><li><b>Features</b>: a<span>nalyze feature sets</span></li><li><span><b>Maturity</b>: a</span><span>nalyze the overall project maturity</span></li><li><span><b>Ease of use</b>: d</span><span>escribe the process and ease of deploying the service mesh into already existing microservice application</span></li><li><span><b>Performance</b>: e</span><span>valuate the overhead introduced by integrating a service mesh into a microservice application</span></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="91b6ebd" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="471ff03" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="a977e8f" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Background: what is a service mesh?</h2></p></div><div data-id="08b931c" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p><span>Trying to describe service mesh in one sentence – “A service mesh is a mesh of useful/necessary features bundled together in a way so they can be applied to your application without the need of doing any code modification (features that you probably needed anyway)”. One example of this is resilience features, “probably” needed for every service you are to create. Instead of rewriting resilience libraries for every service in your application, yes services (they can be in different languages). You instead throw a service mesh in the mix and it’s done without modifying your service. So now you probably asking yourself, what is this magic? It’s actually a pretty easy solution.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A services mesh works by intercepting all communication to and from a service. Traffic interception is usually done by deploying proxy instances beside each service, so called sidecar injection, referring the proxy as the sidecar. This allows the service mesh to intercept and manage traffic without application modification. This enables key features such as metric gathering (e.g. latency, error rate), traffic management (e.g. splitting traffic between services, replicating traffic for testing), security (applying authentication and encrypted communication between services with mTLS) and resilience (e.g. retries, timeouts and circuit braking). The behavior of the proxy instances are steered by a set of management components referred to as the control plane. All proxies running alongside the services in the mesh are usually referred to as the data plane.</span></p></div></div></div><div data-id="9a7f5c7" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="532" height="310" src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-pod-injection.png?x58962" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-pod-injection.png 532w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-pod-injection-300x175.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 532px) 100vw, 532px"></p></div></div><div data-id="3272f66" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>A good article describing why service mesh are useful that also talks about how they work is, “The Service Mesh: What Every Software Engineer Needs to Know about the World’s Most Over-Hyped Technology” by William Morgan.

This site is a resource map to help enterprises and developers to find cloud-native technologies. The service meshes presented by the Cloud Native Landscape can be seen below. Istio was selected due to its popularity (most GitHub stars). Linkerd due to its architectural design being similar to Istio and for being hosted by CNCF.</p></div></div><div data-id="dbec31b" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="616" height="235" src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-cncf-service-meshes.png?x58962" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-cncf-service-meshes.png 616w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-cncf-service-meshes-300x114.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 616px) 100vw, 616px"></p></div></div><div data-id="c87ccc9" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><p>Istio is an open-source project publicly released for the first time in May 2017 by Google, IBM and Lyft. Its architecture follows the common approach of using sidecars to integrate into a microservice application. The architecture is divided into two main parts, a data plane and a control plane. The data plane represents the sidecars, intercepting and managing all network communication between services. The control plane manages and configures the behavior of data plane and the service mesh.</p></div></div><div data-id="db897be" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>Linkerd was for the first time released in 2016 by Buoyant. It was later to be redesigned and rewritten in Rust and Go for Kubernetes to lower the resource footprint and create a simpler solution. This newer version was introduced in December, 2017 as a separate service mesh project called Conduit. Conduit was later on July 6, 2018 merged into the Linkerd as a separate Linkerd project creating Linkerd 2.0. This thesis henceforth studies Linkerd 2.x and refers to it as Linkerd.</p><p>To date, Linkerd only supports Kubernetes and actually requires it to run compared to Linkerd 1.x that supports multiple environments. The Linkerd architecture is based on the sidecars principle mentioned earlier. The architecture is divided into two parts: the control plane and date plane, the date plane represents the proxy servers running alongside each application and intercept all communication. The control plane is split up into several services control the behavior of the data plane and collect telemetry about the network and service mesh.</p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="bf8b410" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="8a7bf68" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="50e1811" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Feature comparison: Istio vs. Linkerd</h2></p></div><div data-id="1decf38" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>Linkerd is explicitly written for Kubernetes, to date only supporting Kubernetes. Istio is designed to run in any environment claiming to be platform-independent. To date, Istio runs on Kubernetes, Consul (alpha phase) and individual virtual machines (they can be connected into an existing Istio mesh deployed on Kubernetes).&nbsp;</p><p>Both meshes provide observability by using web-interfaces (dashboard) and preinstalled Grafana dashboards. Grafana is used to display information stored in the Prometheus datebase (e.g. CPU/memory of each pod and container). The web-interface is used to display and interact with the mesh, showing inject/uninjected pods and communication between services. Displaying golden metrics such as success rate, traffic (requests per second), latencies and saturation (system utilization). Both meshes provide distributed tracing but application modification is needed to propagate headers.&nbsp;</p><p>Resiliency features are also supported such as retries and timeouts, allowing the sidecar to retry failed requests and timeouts, if replies are too slow. Fault injection for introducing errors to services. Traffic shifting for dynamically shifting traffic between services. Istio also provides circuit breaking, that breaks all connection to a service after a fixed amount of concurrent connections of failed calls.&nbsp;</p><p>Security with authentication and encryption with mTLS are supported by both meshes. Linkerd automatically enables mTLS for most HTTP traffic, some gaps (e.g. Host header in HTTP request is an IP address). Istio has a strict mode that can be toggled to allow only traffic with mTLS or both mTLS and plain-text.</p><p>A shorter list of some of the features provided by both meshes:</p></div></div></div><div data-id="36c2aea" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="image.default"><div><p><img width="612" height="499" src="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-service-meshes.png?x58962" alt="" loading="lazy" srcset="https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-service-meshes.png 612w, https://elastisys.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dahlberg-service-meshes-300x245.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px"></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div></section><section data-id="c10a6d6" data-element_type="section"><div><div><div data-id="752d98a" data-element_type="column"><div><div><div data-id="2db9a53" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="heading.default"><p><h2>Project maturity: Istio vs. Linkerd</h2></p></div><div data-id="1f53388" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="text-editor.default"><div><div><p>Both projects give a mature feeling by both having an increasing community growth with an established community governance.&nbsp;</p><p><span>Istio has, to date, 22.8 thousand stars and is steered by their Steering Committee formed to oversee the administrative aspects of the project, including governance, branding, and marketing. The committee has 10 seats held by companies currently from IBM (3 seats), Google (6 seats) and Red Hat (1 seat). They also determine the members of the Technical Oversight Committee (TOC), responsible for project oversight, direction and delivery. The community is organized into working groups focusing on a specific area (e.g. documentation and security).</span><br></p><p><span>Linkerd has, to date, 5.5 thousand stars and is hosted by the CNCF project. The governance is split up into two roles, maintainer (8 people) and super-maintainer (2 people). Maintainer oversees one or more components, handling pull requests, sorting issues, etc. Super-maintainers oversee the project, guiding the general project direction. Project decisions are resolved by consensus otherwise the majority vote by the super-maintainer and maintainer. Maintainers are voted in by a 2/3 majority organization vote.&nbsp;</span><br></p><p><span>The trajectory of GitHub stars and forks from Istio and Linkerd can be seen in the figure below.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-block-type="2" id="block-c80b9d9df420fdc8d4e0"><div><p>Most of what we call product management is really just Dutch School Marketing (essay forthcoming). It’s behavior change for business purposes. In this case, with a special focus on product. But as every incredible marketer will tell you, “ offer matters most.”</p><blockquote><p>You can destroy a brilliant sales letter with a lame and weak offer.</p><p>Conversely, you can save shit copy with a strong offer.</p></blockquote><p><em>From, </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/salesletter3?rq=offer%20crystallizatio" target="_blank"><em>Alchemy: Turning Words Into Money Part — 3</em></a></p><p>A great offer (or in this case product) with a mediocre marketing effort will do better than the inverse. That is why startups (and companies that are further along) should always spend the overwhelming majority of their resources on making a product that’s hard to live without and fight hard against the many forces that try to pull them away from doing that. Spreadsheets, meetings, shareholders, etc.&nbsp;</p><p><em>See, </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/livewithout" target="_blank"><em>Create A Product That’s Hard To Live Without</em></a></p><p>But what most people don’t realize is that the way you do that is NOT just technological.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1608015568047_21873"><div><p>You pretty quickly run into technological limitations. The difference between good enough and extraordinary is only detectable by machines. Wine experts are BS artists. (Goldstein &amp; Emerson, 2008).</p><p>But another way to look at it, is not through the lens of logic but rather the lens of psycho-logic. Which was defined by Jan Smedslund (1988) as “an attempt to formulate explicitly the implicit common-sense psychology embedded in everyday language and taken for granted by its users,” and more recently popularized by my friend Rory Sutherland (Vice-Chairman, Ogilvy UK) as the more pithy phrase “Benign bullshit.”</p><p>The heavy bottle, the ambiance, the candle lights, the uniform the waiter wears, the aroma of the restaurant, the smooth jazz softly playing, the warm welcome by the host as she goes out of her way to make you feel special, and so on and so forth.&nbsp;</p><p><em>See, </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/heavy-bottles?rq=heavy%20bottle" target="_blank"><em>Heavy Bottles</em></a></p><p>All part of the ritual. The ritual of producing a beautiful product, woven from a fabric with a label that reads “X% technological economic value creation and Y% psychological economic value creation.”</p><p>In <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5156669_Ludwig_von_Mises%27s_Monetary_Theory_in_Light_of_Modern_Monetary_Thought" target="_blank">Ludwig von Mises’s Monetary Theory in Light of Modern Monetary Thought</a>, Salerno (1994) noted:</p><blockquote><p>…consider that alcoholic beverages consumed in a restaurant situated atop one of the towers of the World Trade Center, which offers a breathtaking view of Manhattan and its surroundings, command much higher prices than drinks mixed with the same ingredients and imbibed in a street-level pub located a few blocks away. Surely, we do not expect would-be bar patrons at the World Trade Center to react to knowledge of such price discrepancies by a mad scramble to the elevators in order to take advantage of the higher purchasing power of money at ground level. (p. 96)</p></blockquote><p>What makes startups so tricky though is the dichotomy. The dance, the tension, between technology and psychology. Between the offer and the context. And product, as a subset, must abide by the same rules.&nbsp;</p><p>So without further ado, let’s get off the theoretical and into pragmatism. Here are the principles of great product management.</p><p>I’ve written about this before.</p><p><em>See, </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/horse?rq=ford" target="_blank"><em>Why Do You Want A Faster Horse?</em></a></p><p><em>See also, </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/2019/3/24/dont-listen-to-your-users-dance-with-them-instead?rq=mark%20cuban" target="_blank"><em>Don’t Listen To Your Users, Dance With Them Instead</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>You have to listen to your users. Imagine a doctor who didn’t listen to his patients. How could you possibly diagnose them? Hover your hands over them and intuit their symptoms through clairsentience?</p><p>Or… and hear me out here… just ask them!</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1608015568047_31703"><div><p>After a good 10 maybe 20 years of startup knowledge, I know I’m not saying anything paradigm-shifting here. Or at least, I shouldn’t be. But we still haven’t internalized this sufficiently. I’m looking at myself too. It’s easy to get seduced by the media and our egos that we should somehow “know” what users want.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonsense. There’s no such constraint and you should get nice and comfortable with cheating. (More on that in a second.)</p><p><em>See, </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/cheating?rq=cheat" target="_blank"><em>What Are You #1 In The World At?</em></a></p><p>Go talk to your users face to face (wear a mask), if at all possible, and develop a deep understanding of their problems.</p><p>Study my best friend <a href="http://momtestbook.com/" target="_blank">Rob Fitzpatrick’s book</a> (or arguably bible) on customer development so you can cut your learning curve down by 90% and learn how to ask questions the right way. [1]</p><p>The single most important thing to avoid is to build a product that no one wants to buy.&nbsp;</p></div></div><div data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_1_1608015568047_43551"><div><p>This is an example of what happens when you throw a bunch of features together and then try to find a user for it.</p><ul data-rte-list="default"><li><p>A proprietary press with enough force to lift two Teslas. (Why?)</p></li><li><p>Connected to the internet. (Why?)</p></li><li><p>QR code scanner so you can’t juice expired packages. (Why?)</p></li></ul><p>These features are solving Juiceroo’s problem, not mine. [2]</p><blockquote><p>The job of the business model is to serve the needs of the users. The job of the users is <strong>not</strong> to serve the business model.</p></blockquote><p>95% of the companies that pay Y&amp;F to consult, pay us to remind them of those two sentences.</p><p>A typical reply is “Yeah, no, we know, we know. But… how can we increase our revenue and hit our targets?”</p><p>I believe powerful advice that’s correct in most situations is vastly superior to weak advice that’s correct in all situations. In entrepreneurial science, being perfect is just a convenient and cowardly way of hiding behind unobtainable preciseness. The first priority should be to help the company succeed, not to say things that are 100% airtight.</p><p><em>See, </em><a href="https://www.younglingfeynman.com/essays/physicsenvy?rq=envy" target="_blank"><em>How Our Physics Envy Results In False Confidence In Our Organizations</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>Since 90% of founders don’t listen to their users, that advice should take precedence.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there’s also a smaller set of founders that have embodied point number 1 so well, that they now go too far in the opposite direction.</p><p>Yes, a large part of the role of product manager is to be a doctor. You ask the patient about the symptoms, you try to get a good idea of where the aches and pains are, but ultimately it’s up to you to make a diagnosis.</p><p>The patient has leg pain and tells you to give him pain killers and to use kinesiology taping, but maybe the problem is in the SI-joint (connection between hip and spine) and the pain radiates down to the leg.</p><p>Your job isn’t to blindly listen to the user. You are not an order taker. Why? Because they have a busy life. They’re not experts in solving their issues, you are. They’re merely experts in noticing the problem/symptoms.</p><p>You’ll mostly hear two philosophies in the startup scene about competitors. You got the investors stressing out founders about the competition. “Have you seen what X is doing? Have you read that TechCrunch piece? Have you seen how much they’ve raised?” And you have the other camp that says “Just focus on your product and your users and forget about the competition.”</p><p>If you can only pick one, pick the latter.</p><p>But just as good marketing has <a href="https://www.marketingweek.com/ritson-bothism-cure-marketers-fascination-conflict/" target="_blank">bothism</a> (performance marketing and brand marketing), product does too.</p><p>One way to look at your competition is as evil people trying to steal a bigger slice of the pie. Another way to look at it is that it’s a non-zero-sum game and you can learn from the experiments they’ve done.

<p>If you never heard of <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf">fzf</a>, it is a very
handy general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder. Besides command-line, it is
also a popular Vim plugin. If you’re wondering, a fuzzy finder is a tool that
helps you find what you’re looking for without needing to write the full name.</p>
<p>As a Vim user, I am always obsessed with doing a thing in the fewer keystrokes
as possible. Having the ability to open a file in Vim quickly is super useful to
me, and you will see why soon.</p>
<p>But, did you know that this fuzzy finder - fzf, can do a lot more than you
thought? Oh yeah, the fuzzy search is just the tip of the iceberg here.
It is like wine; the more you leave it on your computer, the more flavor and
sweetness it accumulates from that command-line. Let’s dive in and find out how
you can increase your productivity with fzf inside Vim.</p>
<h2 id="starting-off"><a href="#starting-off" aria-label="starting off permalink"></a>Starting off</h2>
<p>To be able to do the things I am doing in this blog post, you will need a couple of
plugins. If you’re not using <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a>
for installing other Vim plugins, then you are missing out. Go ahead and set
that up, and you can add the following:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>Plug <span>'junegunn/fzf'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span> <span>'do'</span><span>:</span> <span>{</span> <span>-</span><span>&gt;</span> fzf#<span>install</span><span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>}</span> <span>}</span>
Plug <span>'junegunn/fzf.vim'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>Then, install these plugins with <code>:PlugInstall</code> or use this shortcut I use:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>
nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span><span>1</span> <span>:</span><span>source</span> ~<span>/</span><span>.</span>vimrc \| <span>:</span>PlugInstall<span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You can then press your leader key and number 1 to install and apply all the
changes in your <code>.vimrc</code>.</p>
<p>Now, to the coolest part!</p>
<h2 id="the-magic-finder"><a href="#the-magic-finder" aria-label="the magic finder permalink"></a>The magic finder</h2>
<p>Everything we need is installed, and we can get to the practical part. As we
said before, fzf is a fuzzy finder, a file selector if you want. Let’s try
out that feature right off. To get the file picker opened, type <code>:Files</code> in
a Vim session. You should get something like this:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Open :Files" title="Open :Files" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/47be299b0a37790ebdd8396d20b872fa/fcda8/open-files.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/47be299b0a37790ebdd8396d20b872fa/12f09/open-files.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>What happened is fzf opened a small window at the bottom showing files in our
directory. If you look at the newly opened window, you will see the list of
files, and the <strong>preview</strong> of the currently selected file on the right
of the window. So you got your files on the left and their preview on the
right. Are you already impressed as I was? Cool, let’s move on.</p>
<p>If you don’t like the window, you can fine-tune easily with fzf customization
options. But if you want any fzf command in fullscreen, you can append <code>!</code> at
the end of the command. For example, let’s do <code>:Files!</code> and you should see the
following:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Open :Files! in fullscreen" title="Open :Files! in fullscreen" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/71e5fe325ab9a32de02f08763196d067/fcda8/open-files-fullscreen.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/71e5fe325ab9a32de02f08763196d067/12f09/open-files-fullscreen.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>But, I don’t use <code>:Files</code> that often. As a matter of fact, I only use
<code>:GFiles</code> command by fzf. <code>:GFiles</code> will open a file picker for your Git files,
ignoring ones in the <code>.gitignore</code>. Using it is pretty neat in JavaScript
projects where <code>node_modules</code> files tend to kill the mood when running
<code>:Files</code>. Let us compare the same project with <code>:Files</code> and <code>:GFiles</code> commands:</p>
<p><span>

<p>
  Yuck! `node_modules` everywhere.
</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt=":GFiles in a JavaScript project" title=":GFiles in a JavaScript project" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/6cd545cf7ed03bb38decb5c1ae2d9949/fcda8/git-files-js-project.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/6cd545cf7ed03bb38decb5c1ae2d9949/12f09/git-files-js-project.png 148w,

<p>
  Ah, that's better.
</p>
<p>Notice the difference? It feels like I just dropped a heavy backpack off my
back by not having those <code>node_modules/**</code> files popping up. Anyway, let’s see
this bad boy in action when searching for files to edit.</p>
<p><img src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/5a84a887e91f3aea28f8692bcc518fc0/gfiles-in-action.gif" alt=":GFiles in action GIF"></p>
<p>That’s it, and it is looking pretty good. Only thing I dislike about using <code>:GFiles</code> is
that it won’t include your new files unless you add them to the Git index with
<code>git add</code>. Also, I’d like some syntax highlighting to be there out of the box
when previewing files, but we will cover that in another blog post. In the
meantime, consider subscribing to the <a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/improving-vim-workflow-with-fzf/newsletter">newsletter</a> to get similar
posts like this.</p>
<p>To sum up, fzf is useful and quick as a flash when searching for files. And, as
Drake below says, resort to using <code>:GFiles</code> or try to configure <code>:Files</code> to
ignore certain files and paths.</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Drake fzf choices - go with :GFiles instead of :Files" title="Drake fzf choices - go with :GFiles instead of :Files" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/643d1c18c9fd8e42484fcaffaa4d99eb/41099/drake-no-files-yes-gfiles.jpg" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/643d1c18c9fd8e42484fcaffaa4d99eb/a80bd/drake-no-files-yes-gfiles.jpg 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>To make this super fast for you, you can create a shortcut. I open <code>:GFiles</code>
with CTRL + p. I got left with this in my muscle memory from the legendary
<a href="https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim">ctrlp</a> plugin. To have <code>:GFiles</code> wired
up, so it opens with CTRL + p, you can add the following to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>nnoremap <span>&lt;</span>C<span>-</span><span>p</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>:</span>GFiles<span>&lt;</span>Cr<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<h2 id="speed-search-your-project"><a href="#speed-search-your-project" aria-label="speed search your project permalink"></a>Speed search your project</h2>
<p>What blows my mind from time to time is other things you can do with fzf in
Vim. For example, you can use
<a href="https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher">The Silver Searcher</a>
or
<a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">ripgrep</a> with fzf.
To search with The Silver Searcher, type <code>:Ag</code> and a term you want to
search. And, to search with ripgrep, type <code>:Rg</code> and the term. Of course, to
have these commands work, you need the respective libraries installed in your
environment.</p>
<p>I use <code>:Ag</code>, and it performs wonderfully. It is wired to CTRL + g for me,
so I access it quickly. To have this or a similar setup, add the following
to your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>

<p>The shortcut above will open up the <code>:Ag</code> search windows at the bottom with the
preview of the file. I find it super helpful and quick when I need to search
for a word in a project. Let’s see <code>:Ag</code> in action.</p>
<p><img src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/0c1dc6a8efd411223955dd76a20783a6/ag-in-action.gif" alt=":Ag in action"></p>
<h2 id="buffed-up"><a href="#buffed-up" aria-label="buffed up permalink"></a>Buffed up</h2>
<p>You can search all your open buffers with fzf by typing <code>:Buffers</code>. I keep a
shortcut at my leader key (the Space key, BTW) + b. Like so:</p>
<div data-language="vim"><pre><code>nnoremap <span>&lt;</span><span>silent</span><span>&gt;</span><span>&lt;</span>leader<span>&gt;</span><span>l</span> <span>:</span>Buffers<span>&lt;</span>CR<span>&gt;</span></code></pre></div>
<p>With that command, you will get a buffers explorer where you can quickly switch
between open files. I hope that helps. Let’s see how it looks:</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt=":Buffers in action" title=":Buffers in action" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/cb72ecbb277eb7bb278051d84c0b5f96/fcda8/buffers.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/cb72ecbb277eb7bb278051d84c0b5f96/12f09/buffers.png 148w,

<p>If you are a fan of drawing inside the terminal, then you are going to love this one.
Try typing <code>:Commits</code> if you are using the <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive">vim-fugitive</a> plugin.
The plugin by itself is a pretty awesome wrapper around Git, just if you
never want to leave the warmth of your Vim session. Anyways, if you type
<code>:Commits</code> you should get a tree of your project commits like so:</p>

<p>Pretty cool, huh? You can scroll up and down and checkout changes at each
commit. You can even enter the commit you are interested in and check out
changes made there. All of this is possible thanks to the <code>vim-fugitive</code>, so check
it out. A blog post about using Git inside Vim is coming, so be sure to
subscribe to the <a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/newsletter">newsletter</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-quick-summary"><a href="#a-quick-summary" aria-label="a quick summary permalink"></a>A quick summary</h2>
<p>Vim ecosystem has a lot of plugins, and fzf is one great plugin. You can search
for files with <code>:GFiles</code> and <code>:Files</code>. If you want to do a text search, try using
<code>:Ag</code> or <code>:Rg</code>, which use The Silver Searcher and ripgrep, respectively. Tired of
slow switching between open buffers - try out <code>:Buffers</code>. Or, if you want some
nice commit information, do <code>:Commits</code>.</p>
<p>These are just a couple of commands and tricks fzf has, be sure to check out
their README for more information. Also, stay tuned for more posts like these
from me and consider subscribing to the <a href="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/newsletter">newsletter</a>. If you found

    <p>Recently the team I work with completed a project to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UyDK2bDjc4">allow Shopify to run in
multiple datacenters</a>. This project
was a refactoring project in disguise. When you undertake large refactoring of a
code-base with 100s of developers and 100,000s of lines of code, you can’t align
by sending an email. The merge-conflicts a single pull request would entail
makes me shiver. When deprecating in a large code-base the only way to reliably
avoid new deprecated behaviour is a failing test that tells you what to do.
Otherwise the pace that new deprecated code is introduced can easily outpace the
speed at which you can remove them, or be a massive source of frustration.</p>
<p>Typically deprecations come in the form of soft warnings: Logging to <code>stderr</code>,
capital letters and exclamation marks in the documentation, or a legacy prefix
to the method or class name. At the end of the day, everyone needs to get work
done, and if they see a code-path already being used from 10 places in the
code-base despite these soft warnings–it doesn’t seem crazy to introduce
another. However, if another project is blocked on these deprecated code-paths,
piling on may have a large cost.</p>
<p>To solve this problem <a href="https://twitter.com/fw1729">Florian Weingarten</a> on our
team introduced what he calls “shitlists”: a whitelist of deprecated behaviour.
Existing deprecated behaviour is OK and whitelisted. New usage of the deprecated
API is banned and fails a test with a well-defined error.</p>
<p>They come in many forms, but could look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>Shitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>ClassA</span>,
  <span>ClassB</span>,
  <span>ClassC</span>
<span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>push_job_that_does_crazy_things</span>(klass)
  <span>if</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>.</span>include?(klass)
    <span># Existing deprecated behaviour is called.</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span>, <span>&lt;&lt;-EOS
</span><span></span><span>You</span><span>'</span>re pushing a job that does crazy things<span>.</span> <span>This</span> <span>API</span> has been 
deprecated <span>in</span> this code<span>-</span>base<span>.</span> <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;</span> is actively trying to get
rid of this code<span>-</span>path, because
<span>&lt;</span>reason<span>&gt;.</span> <span>We</span> suggest you instead <span>do</span> <span>&lt;</span>alternative<span>&gt;.</span> <span>If</span> you have questions, please
ping <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;.</span>
  <span>EOS</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>A shitlist could be something as simple as a <code>git grep</code> for a certain code-path:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>test</span> <span>"no new introductions of legacy code path"</span> <span>do</span>
  actual <span>=</span> <span>`git grep some_legacy_method_with_a_unique_name`</span>
  assert_equal <span>321</span>, actual
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other times you can reach into another API and get a count or shitlist:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RedisShitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>Session</span>,
  <span>FragmentCache</span>,
  <span>AuthenticationTokens</span>,
<span>]</span>

<span>test</span> <span>"no new redis models introduced"</span> <span>do</span>
  assert_equal <span>RedisShitlist</span>, <span>RedisModel</span><span>.</span>descendants
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other ways we’ve used shitlists in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that a certain datastore is only read from in a certain context (or
not used at all). This would allow for using a read-only slave, or improving
resiliency in a certain area.</li>
<li>Ensure fallbacks for all uses of a secondary data-store. E.g. if you access
sessions in Redis and Redis is down, you should be able to still render the
page (i.e. have an empty session fallback).</li>
<li>Shitlisting joins between tables that have no business being joined. This is
helpful to keep data-models and scope clean, or separating a part of an
application.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a linter for a project, you may be able to encode rules. For example
you might use <a href="http://www.foodcritic.io/">Foodcritic</a> for Chef, or
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">Rubocop</a> for Ruby.</p>
<p>Sometimes the shitlist is quite complicated, and much more domain-specific.</p>
<p>Building the shitlist gives the team responsible for it a number of advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strong feedback loop.</strong> The goal is to reduce the <code>Shitlist</code> to an empty
Array and always raise or remove the code entirely. Remove a class from the
list, fix the code and the tests, celebrate and move on.</li>
<li><strong>Stopped the bleeding.</strong> New deprecated behaviour is not introduced unless
the team is contacted or some other action defined in the error is taken.</li>
<li><strong>Success metric</strong>. If you have shitlists for everything that needs to be
done for your project, you have metrics that you can track. Every week you
can look at how these lists are shrinking. Refactoring for months at a time
can be exhausting, but if you see that you’re making progress with metrics
moving, it’s much more rewarding.</li>
<li><strong>Enforces a guarantee</strong>. For example, you can have a shitlist that all jobs
have a retry mechanism. In that case, you know that you can kill any worker
gracefully at any time since the job will retry. Because of 1-3 you know how
much work it will take to have this guarantee.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important that the shitlist errors are actionable. If you hit the shitlist
of another team, you need to know what to do next. Ideally the error explains
exactly what you need to do, and no humans need to talk, but reaching out to the
owner of the shitlist should always be part of the shitlist.</p>
<p>If you own a shitlist, you must empathize with the problems of everyone who’s
running into problems. If you simply deprecate new behaviour and don’t offer an
alternative, you will be the source of frustration. If the value of emptying the
shitlist far outweighs the value of adding to the shitlist, it may be OK to not
offer a direct other solution but ask the person who ran into the error to
revise their solution.</p>
<p>It is important that people run into shitlists as early in development as
possible. If you run into a shitlist after spending hours implementing your
solution, you will be less than popular. Some shitlists may require an entire
re-architecting of some teams’ solutions.</p>
<p>Months, in our case more than a year, of refactoring can be overwhelming and
unrewarding work. With the strong feedback loop that shitlists introduce you can
see the light at the end of the tunnel. You know that nothing is added to the
shitlist without you knowing about it.</p>
<p>Creating shitlists in some cases can be extremely difficult. Some take hours to
create, others weeks, and in our case one took months to come up with. You’ll
have to place the cost of developing the shitlist against the cost of not having
it. In some cases logging when you hit a bad code-path may be enough (simple
soft warning deprecation) if you assert the risk of new behaviour small and the
complexity of introducing the shitlist big.</p>
<p>Delegating with shitlists is great. Due to the tight feedback loop, asking other
teams or onboarding new team members becomes much easier. Remove something on
the shitlist, fix the code and the tests, then move on. Sometimes during large
refactorings you may need other teams with more domain expertise of a certain
area of the code-base to help. The shitlist becomes a great rock to point people
at.</p>
<p>If you are about to embark on a large refactor, I highly recommend adding
shitlists to your toolbox. Your project will look much less daunting when it
goes from an opaque objective to a list of shitlists.</p>

            <h3>Feliĉan Zamenhofan Tagon</h3>

            <p>
                Zamenhof Day (also known as Esperanto Book Day) is the birthday of the creator of the constructed
                language Esperanto, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._L._Zamenhof">Ludwik Łazarz Zamenhof</a>.
                It’s widely celebrated as the Day of Esperanto by many Esperantists across the world.
            </p>

            <p>
                I even have a t-shirt for the occasion, and you know I’m serious when I have a t-shirt.
            </p>

            <p>
                <img src="https://martinrue.com/assets/by-post/fzt/cxemizo.png">
            </p>

            <p>
                Zamenhof created Esperanto in 1887. His goal was to create an auxillary language that could be shared by
                everyone equally. A language where everyone is an equal and everyone, regardless of where they were
                born, can communicate and understand each other.
            </p>

            <p>
                I first started learning Esperanto out of sheer curiosity. Almost for the same reason I may have
                otherwise pondered to myself “Hey, how do you insult someone’s mother in Klingon?” – which by the way,
                is to suggest that she has a smooth forehead (Hab SoSlI’ Quch).
            </p>

            <p>
                Warning: Please don’t say this to any Klingons you know, as it’s very insulting, and they’re pretty good
                with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bat%27leth">bat’leth</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                To me, Esperanto was much more interesting than other constructed languages. I quickly realised that
                it’s a complete language with a rich vocabulary, a ridiculously simple grammar, and believe it or not,
                lots of fluent speakers across the world (and even a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_Esperanto_speakers">few native speakers</a>).
            </p>

            <p>
                After dabbling with the language for a long time, and studying it more deliberately in recent years, I
                have to admit that it has been one of the most enjoyable things I’ve done.
            </p>

            <p>
                Esperanto has some unique attributes which makes it a fun hobby to pursue, with some big upsides if you
                decide to take it further.
            </p>

            <p>
                Here’s why I’m a big fan:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    ⚡ It’s easy. Esperanto is by far the simplest language to learn, requiring a fraction of the time it
                    would take to learn a national language.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🧠 It’s consistent. It has a regular grammar, with rules that are consistently followed. This is one
                    of the reasons it’s easier to learn. It’s like a programming language for your mouth.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🕺 There’s a strong and very supportive community. Perhaps due to how few speakers there are
                    (relatively speaking), Esperantists always have time for each other. This is a huge benefit for me,
                    because it means I can be in almost any country in the world, and I’ll be able to find an Esperanto
                    speaker who’ll be more than happy to grab a coffee and hang out.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🌎 International friends. Through Esperanto, you can make new friends from all over the world. The
                    first unexpected benefit of this for me was that it gave me a window to a much wider perspective on
                    things, particularly world events. I can read news in Esperanto from different countries, and get a
                    sense of what is happening / what people are thinking in the non-English parts of the big rock we
                    live on.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🗣 It’s a gateway language. While Esperanto probably isn’t the best choice for a language that will
                    open doors to higher paid jobs, it does train your brain in a regular and consistent way to learn a
                    new language. It trains you to think about different aspects of language, including aspects of your
                    native language that you don’t start thinking about until you begin learning a second. Many people
                    go from Esperanto to a third language and find the experience easier with their new
                    language-learning-primed brains.
                </li>

                <li>
                    🛫 Travel. Lots of Esperantists will host other Esperantists in their home towns, for free, making
                    traveling the world even more appealing (and possible). The
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasporta_Servo">Pasporta Servo</a> has been going since
                    1966, allowing Esperantists to find hosts to stay with, or host traveling Esperantists themselves.
                    In each different country, you’ll be able to communicate via Esperanto, and have a completely
                    different experience than the typical tourist trails.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If all that sounds so sweet that you’ve already cancelled your weekend plans, perhaps your next question
                is “How do I learn it?”
            </p>

            <p>
                Well, since I’m here, allow me to give you a few tips:
            </p>

            <p>
                Saluton.
            </p>

            <p>
                Hello.
            </p>

            <p>
                That’ll nicely open up a conversation with any Esperanto speaker, and you’ll hear it quite often.
            </p>

            <p>
                Just like other languages, you’ll probably immediately throw in:
            </p>

            <p>
                Kiel vi fartas?
            </p>

            <p>
                How are you?
            </p>

            <p>
                To your amazement, you did not in fact ask the other person if they broke wind.
            </p>

            <p>
                Given that you both speak Esperanto, naturally you’re both feeling pretty awesome about things,
                warranting the response:
            </p>

            <p>
                Bonege dankon, kaj vi?
            </p>

            <p>
                Great thanks, and you?
            </p>

            <p>
                Maybe you’re a bit tired:
            </p>

            <p>
                Mi estas iomete laca, sed ne malbona.
            </p>

            <p>
                I'm a bit tired, but not bad.
            </p>

            <p>
                You’ve just noticed your Esperanto friend is
                <a href="https://i.imgur.com/KykL6rx.gifv">eating her peas one-by-one</a>,
                and want to wrap up the conversation as quickly as possible:
            </p>

            <p>
                Ĝis poste!
            </p>

            <p>
                See you later!
            </p>

            <p>
                Here’s a few cool things to note about this conversation.
            </p>

            <p>
                All letters in Esperanto make consistent sounds, so unlike English (where ‘ough’ has approximately 1
                billion different sounds), you can look at a written word and reliably say it.
            </p>

            <p>
                Also notice how we have <strong>-as</strong> on the end of the word fart<strong>as</strong>? That’s how
                you make a verb (a doing-word) refer to the present tense in Esperanto.
            </p>

            <p>
                And guess what? That’s <strong>always</strong> how you get the present tense version of a verb. I mean,
                how easy is that? Want the past tense instead? No problem, just change the <strong>-as</strong> to
                <strong>-is</strong>. The future? <strong>-os</strong> will be your friend. The best bit is that these
                rules never change – all verbs can be produced this way, with no exceptions.
            </p>

            <p>
                You probably don’t believe me, but it’s true – if having the sort of grammar that brings tears of joy to
                the eyes of its learners was a crime, Esperanto would be doing life in maximum security.
            </p>

            <p>
                But there’s more.
            </p>

            <p>
                Pop-quiz. How do you get the plural of a word in English?
            </p>

            <p>
                Add an ‘s’ to the end, you say? Well sometimes, but it doesn’t always work. I definitely don’t have two
                foots. And while I’ve been told I only have <strong>half</strong> a brain, I figure it’s the stronger of
                the two <strong>halves</strong> I’ve kept.
            </p>

            <p>
                In Esperanto, just add <strong>-j</strong>. You can add it to any singular noun or adjective. That rule
                never changes either.
            </p>

            <p>
                If I have more than one <strong>kato</strong> (cat), I most certainly have <strong>katoj</strong>
                (cats). If I were to drink more than one <strong>biero</strong> (beer), and honestly, I never do, then
                I’d have consumed <strong>bieroj</strong> (beers), and would probably slur my <strong>vortoj</strong>
                (words).
            </p>

            <p>
                In Esperanto, we don’t waste space in our dictionaries with both ‘good’ and ‘bad’, ‘left and ‘right’,
                ‘up’ and ‘down’. We just have one of them, and then use the prefix <strong>mal</strong> to create the
                logical opposite. Now you have fewer words to learn.
            </p>

            <p>
                I can only imagine you’re finding this post <strong>bona</strong> (good), but if you aren’t (and let’s
                face it… you are), you’d be finding it <strong>malbona</strong> (bad).
            </p>

                The prefix <strong>mal</strong> can be used to prefix anything, assuming it still makes sense. One could
                say <strong>malsaluton</strong>, which despite stepping all over the toes of <strong>ĝis</strong> (bye),
                would make sense to an Esperanto speaker. It would no doubt also make them think you’re a bit weird, but
                that’s beside the point – perhaps you are.
            </p>

            <p>
                Adverbs, adjectives, participles, and every other grammatical aspect of Esperanto has a similar sense of
                structure and consistency like the examples above, making it much easier to learn.

December 15, 2020 | https://thegreencodes.com/non-primitive-non-linear-data-structures-trees | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://thegreencodes.com/non-primitive-non-linear-data-structures-trees">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>Speaking of Christmas trees, let's shake one-two before the carols -  like our fathers and their fathers before them. Literally.</p>
<p>Now, when it comes to data storage, using linear structures, be it <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/data-structures-the-linear-non-primitives">linked lists and arrays</a> or even <a target="_blank" href="https://thegreencodes.com/data-structures-stacking-and-queueing">stacks and queues</a>, we have accountability over time complexity as the size of our data increases. That is, the larger the data being stored, the more time it takes to extract this data or manipulate it.</p>
<p>'<em>Ohh well great! You've shown me how to store data only to give me the cons afterward?! What on earth!</em>'</p>
<p>Hold on for one moment, will you! That's why this piece is here. <strong>The non-primitive non-linear data structures</strong>.</p>
<p>As with family lines, from grandpa to great grandpa and yourself, so is the same applied to data structures.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608017057888/XWm7wcCVx.png?auto=compress" alt="Trees.png"></p>
<p>A little theory before we get into the why. We'll start off with the parent; the root. 
It's from here that everything emanates. Just like a Linux directory structure. The <code>/</code> directory. </p>
<p>Our tree root has two 'children', <code>A</code> and <code>B</code>, defined by engineers as <code>nodes</code>. From here, we see <code>B</code> with its own pair of children, 'C' and 'D' of whom C proceeds to get a single child node 'E'. We might as well call C a parent at this point.</p>
<p>The little lines marking the links between parent and child would be named <code>edges</code>.
Following a specific path to the final child, for instance, following through to <code>E</code> would name this bottom descendant a leaf node or external node. It's the last child in this specific path with no children. The same applies to A and D.</p>
<h4 id="depth-of-nodes">Depth of nodes</h4>
<p>The number of edges from the root to the node. In our case, E would have a depth of 3.</p>
<h4 id="height-of-a-node">Height of a node</h4>
<p>How far is the smallest child from it in this specific path? B, for instance, will have a height of 2. Given there are two edges before we get to the furthest descendant in its path. Depending on how many children it has, how far is the furthest child of a node? How many nodes does this child have?</p>
<h4 id="height-of-tree">Height of Tree</h4>
<p>The height of a tree's root node.</p>
<h4 id="degree-of-node">Degree of Node</h4>
<p> The number of children of a node. Above, C has a degree of one while B has that of two.</p>
<p>A practical train of thought. We have data to be queried from an API REST endpoint. Our system has users, profiles, and articles. Thinking logically, a user profile is a child node of the user's endpoint. We will have to get a user to log in, get the token, and query the profile based on the token. Something like this:</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608021263968/inwO5DFit.png?auto=compress" alt="rest-endpoint.png"></p>
<p>So in your thought process, seeing as it is, software development is more of thinking than writing code, it would make sense to create a <code>user model</code> before a <code>profile</code>. Our <code>User</code> model is the parent, the root. </p>
<p>Compare this to having a linear data structure.</p>
<p>We could go on to break trees into more individual types:</p>
<p>a) General Tree</p>
<p>b) Binary Tree</p>
<p>c) Binary Search Tree</p>
<p>d) AVL Tree</p>
<h3 id="binary-tree">Binary Tree</h3>
<p>A tree, as displayed above, in which case parents have at max, two children. Due to this, the children are referred to as the left and right child. Think of how we might have this in decision trees, where we perform an action based on a condition. 
To elaborate further, we have the below groups.</p>
<h4 id="full-binary-tree">Full Binary tree</h4>
<p>Every node of the tree has two or zero children.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608022900340/czulV8J6u.png?auto=compress" alt="full-binary.png"></p>
<h4 id="perfect-binary-tree">Perfect Binary Tree</h4>
<p>The tree internal nodes have two children. All leaves also have the same depth. A perfect uniform.</p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608023219349/ootMFOgFX.png?auto=compress" alt="perfect-binary-tree.png"></p>
<h4 id="balanced-tree">Balanced Tree</h4>
<p>If the height of the left and right subtree at any node differs at most by 1, then the tree is called a balanced tree. So in the case of the perfect binary, if either of the last child nodes had one more child, one and only one, it would become a balanced tree. It's a strange way of calling something balanced, I know!</p>
<h3 id="general-tree">General Tree</h3>
<p>Consider a binary tree. Any type of binary tree, but without limitations to what number of children a node can have. Do you want 4? Do you want 17? Go ahead and fill your database or whatever it is your structuring.</p>
<h3 id="binary-search-tree">Binary Search Tree</h3>
<p>A different way of looking at Binary search trees if you may. Here, the left nodes are always smaller than their parents in terms of the value they possess. The right nodes, however, are a little cocky, always having more value than their parents or being equal. </p>
<p><img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1608024052809/c5HCm3fgY.png?auto=compress" alt="binary-search-tree.png"></p>
<p>'<em>Well, that's not right. I've never seen this man in my life!</em>'</p>
<p>Used maps/dictionaries before? Yeap. binary search trees you deserter!</p>
<p>Searching for a specific item in an array of 100 or 200 might not be a problem. Increase this to 10 000 or 1 000 000 items, however, no one wants to be the user.</p>
<h3 id="avl-tree">AVL Tree</h3>
<p>Named after Adelson, Velsky, and Landis, this is a self-balancing binary tree in which each node has extra information -  the balance factor-   whose value is either -1, 0, or 1.</p>
<p>You remember <a href="####Height of a node">heights</a>, right? Well, the balance factor comes in as below:</p>
<p><strong>BalanceFactor = height_of_left_subtree - height_of_right_subtree</strong></p>
<p>Whenever a tree is out of balance, AVL trees work around this by rotating nodes. Whether moving the right node to the left or the right, or left-right rotation or perhaps right-left rotation.</p>
<p>What this means is that at one point, the right node which seemed heavy/ larger to the left will become the parent and hence the parent becomes the left child while the left child becomes the new right child and so on. think of it in terms of the hour clock. It will rotate itself in either direction until the tree is balanced. More detail on this can be elaborated on in a later conversation. Keep an eye up!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>We've taken a bucket load of information. Trees and searching, children, and siblings. What is all this knowledge without implementation? Fire up that laptop one last time this year and think of how you could have consumed that endpoint differently. Take a sabbatical, if you may, and have the rest you need, then come back and break the time complexity barrier. Write more efficient code, more productive code, and let's make the user experience smoother.</p>

<![CDATA[Reasons You’re Hiring Too Junior]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
    <p>Growth startups often find themselves lacking senior team members as they scale. The problems that arise from this are plentiful, including things like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Requiring heroics to fix things</li>
  <li>Penalizing junior team members for failure to meet responsibilities well above their pay grade.</li>
  <li>Building technology that doesn’t scale</li>
</ul>

<p>Here’s some reasons why companies get into this situation.</p>

<h2 id="reason-1-habit">Reason 1: Habit</h2>

<p>When you’re a tiny startup budgets are extremely lean and products don’t have a lot of users. In that environment companies often prioritize breadth of functionality (see what works) and getting that via several (more affordable) junior team members guided by a smaller group of senior team members.</p>

<p>Problems arise if that strategy exists past market fit. The add-a-junior-to-do-more strategy implodes as the team grows too large for the senior staff to manage closely and the technical challenges start to look more daunting.</p>

<h2 id="reason-2-hubris">Reason 2: Hubris</h2>

<p>Sometimes people recognize the problems are getting more difficult but still don’t hire more seniors. This can often be chalked up to hubris - surely I can just direct a bunch of juniors to execute on the genius solutions I come up with for all our problems. The problem here is that you’re not a genius and even if you were that strategy doesn’t scale.</p>

<h2 id="reason-3-fear">Reason 3: Fear</h2>

<p>The flip side of hubris is fear. New senior staff can look like a threat to the power of existing senior staff. You might have to choose between doing what’s right for the company and retaining certain kinds of power. The answer there is simple - it’s better to be part of something great than the owner of something that fails.</p>

<p>A different play on this theme is junior teammates fearing that new senior teammates will take away some of their opportunities. It’s possible, sure. But more often the opportunities they will take over are the ones juniors would have had trouble succeeding in.</p>

<p>In a growing company with reasonably difficult challenges, good seniors will do more to expand the set of opportunities than shrink them. And good senior talent will help juniors via mentorship and guidance.</p>

<h2 id="reason-4-money-issues">Reason 4: Money Issues</h2>

<p>Money issues play out in a couple ways.</p>

<p>First, the cost of senior talent can subconsciously make you concerned about the remaining budget for yourself. I haven’t seen this played out directly and blatantly, but it’s another version of the fear game - assuming compensation is a zero sum game leads to weird incentives.</p>

<p>Second, it’s easy to think 2 juniors are better than one senior. As you read about the myth of the 10x engineer you might find yourself thinking this way. Let’s talk more about how this is a misconception in reason 5…</p>

<h2 id="reason-5-miscalculation-of-necessary-skills-for-right-now">Reason 5: Miscalculation of Necessary Skills For Right Now</h2>

<p>As referenced earlier, problems get much harder when you add significant growth to a platform. It’s not uncommon to underestimate the challenges at hand. In reality, even simple products at massive scale need significant senior leadership to ensure they are being built and operated effectively. Trying to replace the leadership of senior talent with a volume of junior talent is a sure-fire way to screw this up.</p>

<h2 id="reason-6-miscalculation-of-necessary-skills-in-the-future">Reason 6: Miscalculation of Necessary Skills In the Future</h2>

<p>To make things more difficult, you don’t just have to hire for right now, you have to hire for 2 or more years in the future. The senior talent you hire now must seed the leadership ranks you need in the future. Especially in product and engineering, you can’t just hire everyone you need when you need them. For starters, the job market would laugh at that sort of just-in-time attempt at hiring. But also, these roles require much more detailed understanding of the systems at play, so you need to have people with intimate knowledge developed in advance.</p>

<p>Think of it this way - look at whatever company you’re trying to be like in 5 years. Look at their team. If you don’t start hiring towards something like that team sooner rather than later you’ll never be that company.</p>

<h2 id="reason-7-arguments-about-what-seniors-need">Reason 7: Arguments About What-Seniors-Need</h2>

<p>Another reason people hire too junior is thinking around senior talent needing explicit areas of responsibility that don’t overlap. This is the “one alpha” theory - that senior talent can’t collaborate productively and need their own pack. There might be some nuggets of truth here, but most of it is nonsense. That’s like NASA saying they couldn’t have smart people work together on getting to the moon because these great scientists need their own domains.</p>

<p>Ultimately you have to look at the problems you’re solving. If they are truly challenging they can support a number of seniors. If they aren’t you’ll probably have trouble hiring and retaining more than a few.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>There’s a lot of reasons why you might hire too junior as your company grows. Know them and hire intentionally.</p>

    <p><small>Council adopts resolution on encryption</small></p>


        </div>

    




<p>The Council today adopted a resolution on encryption, highlighting the need for security through encryption and security despite encryption.</p>
<p>In this resolution, the Council underlines its support for the development, implementation and use of strong encryption as a necessary means of protecting fundamental rights and the digital security of citizens, governments, industry and society. At the same time, the Council notes the need to ensure that competent law enforcement and judicial authorities are able to exercise their legal powers, both online and offline, to protect our societies and citizens.</p>
<p>Law enforcement authorities and the judiciary are increasingly dependent on access to electronic evidence to effectively fight terrorism, organised crime, child sexual abuse, and a range of other cybercrime and cyber-enabled crimes. Such access is essential to the success of law enforcement and criminal justice in cyberspace. However, there are instances where encryption renders access to and analysis of evidence extremely challenging or impossible in practice.</p>
<p>The EU is striving to establish an active discussion with the technology industry, and with close involvement from research, academia, industry, civil society and other stakeholders, so as to strike the right balance between ensuring the continued use of strong encryption technology and guaranteeing the powers of law enforcement and the judiciary to operate on the same terms as in the offline world. Potential technical solutions will need to respect privacy and fundamental rights, and preserve the value that technological progress brings to society.</p>

<p><em>Sobering take on the future of work.</em></p>



<p>By now, you must have read many radical takes on the future of work. Whenever I read these extreme predictions, two things come to mind—regression to the mean and Amara’s Law.</p>



<p>A layman’s translation of the statistical term regression to the mean is—what goes up comes down. Regression to the mean is not directly translatable to the remote work predictions. Still, a loose way to think about it is that remote work is being overhyped, and the majority of the companies will revert to working from the office once the pandemic is over.</p>



<p>Amara’s Law states that—we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short run and underestimate the effect in the long run. You can apply this law to any recent, top of the zeitgeist phenomenon. In this case, replace technology with remote work.</p>



<div><figure><a href="https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/work-4127939_640.jpg"><img data-attachment-id="1456" data-permalink="https://abhyrama.com/work-4127939_640/" data-orig-file="https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/work-4127939_640.jpg" data-orig-size="640,426" data-comments-opened="1" data-image-meta="{&quot;aperture&quot;:&quot;4&quot;,&quot;credit&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;camera&quot;:&quot;ILCE-6500&quot;,&quot;caption&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;created_timestamp&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;copyright&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;focal_length&quot;:&quot;18&quot;,&quot;iso&quot;:&quot;125&quot;,&quot;shutter_speed&quot;:&quot;0.016666666666667&quot;,&quot;title&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;orientation&quot;:&quot;0&quot;}" data-image-title="work-4127939_640" data-image-description="" data-medium-file="https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/work-4127939_640.jpg?w=300" data-large-file="https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/work-4127939_640.jpg?w=640" src="https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/work-4127939_640.jpg?w=640" alt="" srcset="https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/work-4127939_640.jpg 640w, https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/work-4127939_640.jpg?w=150 150w, https://voidbetweenears.files.wordpress.com/2020/12/work-4127939_640.jpg?w=300 300w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px"></a></figure></div>



<p>One thing is for sure; remote work has become mainstream. Before the pandemic, remote work was the domain of heretics and hippies. These people were very vocal about it; few paid heed to their preaching. Now, they get to say—I told you so, you did not listen to me; it took a catastrophe to change your mind on something so obvious.</p>



<p>From now on, when anyone starts a company, not <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://abhyrama.com/2014/07/28/let-us-set-up-an-office/" target="_blank">setting up an office</a> and letting people work from wherever they want will be a valid, socially acceptable option. In the pre-covid world, it would have been diabolical to think along these lines.</p>



<p>Many companies will announce(already announced) permanent remote work(or remote first) and when problems crop up, think of reverting to the office. When things do not go as expected(which is bound to happen from time to time), leaders will search for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallacy_of_the_single_cause" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scapegoat</a>, and remote work will be the easiest to blame.</p>



<p>Companies that revert to working from the office will face resistance from employees after some time. Initially, people might like going back to the office. It might feel like a good break after a long period of remote work. But, once you start spending a significant chunk of your day commuting to work, people will yearn for the days when they could work remotely from the cozy comfort of their homes, avoiding the mind numbing commute. Young people who socialize at work and can shift residences based on their office location might not have this problem, but people with families will reminisce their remote work period.</p>



<p>It will rain bonanza on developers who will have many choices to pick when it comes to where and how to work. If the work is remote, what prevents a foreign company(or a young foreign startup) from starting an overnight Indian(or any other country where there is a critical mass of talent) office where they can hire the same(or better) talent? All that is needed is a group of people working in the same timezone. Many do not even agree that the timezone matters. I predict a war for talent in India, and Indian companies will have to compete with increased pay scales(at least for the top percentile of the skilled folks) that foreign companies can afford.</p>



<p>At the cost of stating the obvious, companies opting to go remote will be able to tap a <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/04/07/let-go-of-stereotypes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diverse talent pool</a>, which is excellent for companies and employees. Remote work will help in alleviating the stress on tech-centric cities.</p>



<p>People fresh to work will be at a significant disadvantage when compared to tenured folks. It is tough to remotely re-create the mentoring that one would receive when physically sitting next to each other; freshers need this the most. Tools might be able to bridge this gap; it will be interesting to see.</p>



<p>People will self-select their employment. Some folks rely on the environment(office) to motivate them to get things done; they feel more productive in an office. They cherish the human connection that stems from working with their co-workers in the same physical space. These people will find it tough to work remotely for long periods. Hence, they will opt for companies that have a robust physical office culture. Remote work favors those who are <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2018/08/02/self-infliction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">intrinsically motivated</a> and can self-manage. Such people will naturally gravitate towards remote work.</p>



<p>Remote companies will have to invest in <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/08/02/fade-to-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">processes</a>, <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/01/25/enablers-not-doers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tools</a>, and written <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2020/06/10/communication-architecture/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communication</a>. While working in the office, you can get by without these, but it is impossible to do it in a remote setting; it becomes <a href="https://abhyrama.com/2014/08/23/we-are-a-startup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dysfunctional</a>. Even though it is easy to institute these, entropy is the way of the world—people will veer off this path unless someone is continually reminding them. If you invest in processes, tools, and written communication, you can eliminate middle management—<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">bullshit jobs </a>might reduce as a side effect.</p>



<p>Some believe that physically working together is essential to do great work; that is where the magic happens. Some are vocal about remote work and believe that it is a significant productivity booster; letting people work on their own time and terms is the future. Ultimately, the stories that the leader believes in will shape how a company operates.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text"><p>One of the last projects we worked on at Myothis is a property management system for a big client.</p>
<p>It's a pretty large codebase, and we built the backend with the <a target="_blank" href="https://nestjs.com/">NestJS</a> framework, which is database agnostic but provides strong integration with TypeORM, which is why I've always decided to use it when I'm working with NestJS.</p>
<p>Since the <a target="_blank" href="https://prisma.io/">Prisma</a> team announced V2 I've kept an eye open on their Twitter profile, and when they announced the beta version of Prisma Client I've started to play around and got pretty excited about it. I almost immediately felt like I was looking at a truly next-gen approach to data access in NodeJS, which I always felt could be more than improved.</p>
<p>Prisma became generally available as stable in June 2020, and since there they constantly released new versions with bug fixes and lots of improvements and new features. After only six months it felt utopian to use it in production, especially for our big project, as I was pretty sure there were a lot of edge cases it couldn't be ready to handle. However I was too curious to give it a serious try, and one day, as an experiment, I decided to migrate a single part of the backend and see where it would take me.</p>
<p>The results impressed me so much, the next day we started to migrate the whole project.</p>
<h3 id="first-steps">First steps</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Please note: the migration process is explained in detail <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/guides/migrate-to-prisma/migrate-from-typeorm">here</a> in the Prisma docs. For this reason, I'll focus on my experience rather than the exact steps and the code.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The very first step to introduce Prisma to an existing codebase is <em>schema introspection</em>. It takes a single command for Prisma to analyze your database schema and fill out the <code>schema.prisma</code> file with model definitions, each one corresponding to a table in your schema. There were a couple of things to fix, mostly related to naming and relations handling, but since we're talking about a thirty-two tables schema with every possible form of relation involved, it did a pretty good job.</p>
<p>Now, I decided to make a couple of updates to our database schema to better fit Prisma conventions, to take the most advantage of code generation and avoid current limitations, in particular:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Join tables need to follow some <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-schema/relations#many-to-many-relations">conventions</a> to represent <em>implicit relations</em>, which means that Prisma will handle the relation <strong>completely</strong> behind the scenes, reducing complexity a lot. At the same time we can also have <em>explicit</em> many-to-many relations in case we need to add extra data to the join table.</p>
</li>
<li><p>JSON columns are supported, but query capabilities are pretty limited at the time of writing ( <a target="_blank" href="https://www.notion.so/Prisma-Roadmap-50766227b779464ab98899accb98295f?p=5acca22f9a474ab4a8f67e19d412cc25">this might change soon</a> ). That's why I decided to get rid of every JSON column, simply changing them to scalar columns or adding new tables. This might be a problem for some cases, but fortunately not for ours.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I also want to spend some words on the editing experience for the Prisma schema. Initially, I didn't like the idea of a separate schema with a new syntax, but I must say the <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Prisma.prisma">VSCode extension</a> does an impressive job at making things fast and easy to edit, other than giving you hints and warnings about any issue and even fixing those for you.</p>
<h3 id="nestjs-integration">NestJS integration</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If you are not interested specifically in NestJS you can safely skip this paragraph. NestJS basic knowledge is required to understand what I'm about to describe.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thanks to the NestJS dependency injection system Prisma integration is smooth, and it turns out to be less verbose than TypeORM.</p>
<p>With TypeORM we need to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Register <code>TypeOrmModule</code> in a global Nest module, with the configuration object.</li>
<li>Every time a new entity is introduced we need to register it in the <code>entities</code> array ( this may be skipped with <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/database#auto-load-entities">entities auto-loading</a> ).</li>
<li>Every time we need to use TypeORM repositories in a Nest module we need to add <code>TypeOrmModule.forFeature([EntityClass])</code> to the <code>imports</code> array for that module.</li>
<li>For every TypeORM repository we need to use in a provider class we need to add this to the class constructor:<pre><code><span>constructor</span>(<span>
 <span>@InjectRepository</span>(User)
 <span>private</span> usersRepository: Repository&lt;User&gt;,
</span>) {}
</code></pre>
Prisma integration, on the other hand, is pretty straightforward. We just need an injectable <code>PrismaService</code> extending the generated <code>PrismaClient</code>, add it to a global module, and it can now be used anywhere we need.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code><span>import</span> { Injectable, OnModuleInit, OnModuleDestroy } <span>from</span> <span>'@nestjs/common'</span>;
<span>import</span> { PrismaClient } <span>from</span> <span>'@prisma/client'</span>;

<span>@Injectable</span>()
<span>export</span> <span>class</span> PrismaService <span>extends</span> PrismaClient <span>implements</span> OnModuleInit, OnModuleDestroy {

  <span>async</span> onModuleInit() {
    <span>await</span> <span>this</span>.$connect();
  }

  <span>async</span> onModuleDestroy() {
    <span>await</span> <span>this</span>.$disconnect();
  }
}
</code></pre>
<pre><code>
<span>constructor</span>(<span><span>private</span> prisma: PrismaService</span>) {}
</code></pre>
<p>More on the NestJS - Prisma combo can be found on the Prisma <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prisma.io/nestjs">website</a>.</p>
<h3 id="migrations">Migrations</h3>
<p>Prisma also provides <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-migrate">Prisma Migrate</a>, which is a very promising tool to handle migrations, but it is not considered production-ready at the time of writing. That's why we decided to rely on an external tool for migrations, which is out of the scope of this article.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, they've just announced a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-migrate-preview-b5eno5g08d0b">release preview</a>, and I can't wait to try it out and write down my first impressions.</p>
<p>I've also had some not so nice experiences with TypeORM migrations generation, which is why I've always ended up using the CLI to generate empty files and then filling them up myself with raw SQL.
Because of that, giving it up wasn't difficult at all.</p>
<h2 id="developer-experience">Developer Experience</h2>
<p>The developer experience working with Prisma was definitely above my team's expectations.</p>
<h3 id="code-readability">Code readability</h3>
<p>With TypeORM, most of the queries end up being split into multiple parts, with a lot of the query builder methods scattered all over the function's body. This really hurts code readability, and it takes some time for anyone to fully understand what the query is doing. 
With Prisma, even the most complex query fits in an extremely well-structured object parameter, making it possible even for developers not really experienced with SQL to easily understand the purpose of the query.</p>
<h3 id="consistency-and-predictability">Consistency and predictability</h3>
<p>It is pretty common with TypeORM to start with a particular approach on a single query and then switch to another one because of some limitation or unpredictable behavior. There are lots of ways to do the same thing, and it may be confusing for newcomers to figure out which one is the best. With Prisma, there is a single, predictable, and intuitive way to perform any possible operation.</p>
<h3 id="type-safety">Type safety</h3>
<p>Although TypeORM is written in TypeScript, type safety is not really guaranteed. The type of a record in a query result set will always be the defined model class, regardless of any column selection or joined relation. Moreover, the query builder requires passing tables and column names as strings, which to me feels like the complete opposite of type safety.</p>
<p>Prisma generates advanced types based on the <code>schema.prisma</code> model, and thanks to that it manages to provide type safety at its best.</p>
<p>For a query like this:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> users = <span>await</span> <span>this</span>.db.user.findMany({
  select: {
    email: <span>true</span>,
    active: <span>true</span>,
    zones: {
      select: {
        name: <span>true</span>,
        properties: {
          select: {
            name: <span>true</span>,
            address: <span>true</span>,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>The result type would be:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> users: {
    email: <span>string</span>;
    active: <span>boolean</span>;
    zones: {
      name: <span>string</span>;
      properties: {
        name: <span>string</span>;
        address: <span>string</span>;
      }[];
    }[];
}[]
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, the result type is extremely precise, and it perfectly mirrors the query selection. I highly recommend taking a look at the generated types to better understand how the powerful TypeScript types system has been exploited.</p>
<p>I can confidently say this is the first time I feel like I'm working with a truly type-safe ORM.</p>
<p>More on this and the following paragraphs can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/more/comparisons/prisma-and-typeorm">here</a> in the Prisma docs comparison.</p>
<h3 id="relations-handling">Relations handling</h3>
<p>Managing relations has always been painful even with ORMs, and TypeORM makes no exception. For deeply nested and complex queries we end up writing a lot of <code>.leftJoinAndSelect()</code> methods because of the limitations of the ORM capabilities.</p>
<p>This is what a select query with multiple JOINs looks like with Prisma:</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> users = <span>await</span> prisma.user.findMany({
  include: {
    posts: {
      include: {
        categories: {
          include: {
            posts: <span>true</span>,
          },
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>Of course, we can add filters and custom selection on every level of the query.</p>
<p>Another example from the Prisma docs: this is a query to retrieve all users records where all posts are published and at least one related post mentions "Prisma":</p>
<pre><code><span>const</span> result = <span>await</span> prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    post: {
      every: {
        published: <span>true</span>
      },
      some: {
        content: {
          contains: <span>"Prisma"</span>
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
</code></pre>
<p>Basically, developers don't even need to know how a JOIN works to handle complex queries with relations involved.</p>
<h3 id="raw-queries">Raw queries</h3>
<p>Honestly, I expected I'd need to fall back to raw SQL queries all the time. It turned out I was very wrong. While with TypeORM I always needed to give up on the ORM and leverage the query builder, with half of the clauses as non-typed raw strings, with Prisma I only needed to write raw queries a couple of times for complex aggregation queries. I'm talking about really complex aggregations, since simpler ones are <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/aggregations">nicely supported</a>.</p>
<p>Even for those cases where raw SQL is required, Prisma <a target="_blank" href="https://www.prisma.io/docs/concepts/components/prisma-client/raw-database-access">provides</a> some nice helpers and hints to help us write raw queries, such as tagged templates helpers and utility functions and constants.</p>
<p>One thing that I miss from TypeORM is the possibility to mix type-safe query functions and raw SQL clauses, but I understand this is something the team is trying to avoid because of the consequences it might have on the developer experience and the wrong behavior it might lead to.</p>
<h3 id="transactions">Transactions</h3>
<p>Prisma lacks a way to handle long-running transactions the way we are used to writing them, such as with multiple operations encapsulated within a …</p></div></div>

ADHD is a chronic neuro disorder and usually remains in adulthood. Those patients usually have problems to pay attention, hyperactivity and impulsive behavior, which causes issues especially during childhood and adolescence during the learning process. Those issues frequently lead to problems in school, which can impact their education if they are not assisted by specialists.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Usually the treatment for those patients includes medications or behavioral interventions. However, a new approach has been developing, in which technology is involved. Scientists have discovered that video games can benefit kids who suffer with ADHD. In the last century video games were usually massively for entertainment purposes. Giant companies from game industries such as Nintendo and Sega have started the introduction of playing video games in the population. Those enjoyable visual contents were part of the childhood of many people worldwide. However, what people would not know is that in the future, <a href="https://www.brainlatam.com/blog/graphogame-jogo-de-alfabetizacao-para-criancas-chega-ao-brasil-2341" target="_blank">video games</a> could be used for other purposes rather than entertainment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>With the advance of computers and also computer graphic technology were the main responsible for the development of free softwares to the public who are interested in creating independent video games. Thus, different content and purpose of video games have been created, especially those related to serious games, which are dedicated for treatment.</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>In this regard, a team of researchers from the Institute of Sport Science at the University of Bern have discovered that physical exertion games (exergaming) can improve executive function in kids with ADHD. Executive functions are cognitive functions related to memory, logical reasoning, solving problems, task planning and execution. The research has counted 51 children diagnosed with ADHD between 8 to 12 years old. They have separated into an exergaming group and control group.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>The exergaming group have played a video game called Shape up while the control group have watched a documentary about mountain running. What scientists have found is that the exergaming group has a higher score in a test called Flanker test, in which measures the ability to ignore irrelevant information. Thus, the results show that physical exercise can impact and enhance cognition in children with ADHD. Also, exergaming might contribute for that.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Immersive worlds and video games have become a powerful tool in the health care system. The industry of video games which is bigger than the cinematographic, has increased exponentially, and the application of video games for treatment of neurological disorders and neurorehabilitation can enhance human quality of life. Combining those technologies with neuroimages techniques such as <a href="https://www.brainlatam.com/products/eeg" target="_blank">EEG</a> and <a href="https://www.brainlatam.com/manufacturers/nirx" target="_blank">NIRs</a> can enhance the perspectives of researches related to gaming,&nbsp; immersive worlds and human behavior, making it more accurate by measuring the brain rhythms while performing a task.&nbsp;</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>Reference:</span></p><p dir="ltr"><span>[1] </span><span>Valentin Benzing, Yu-Kai Chang &amp; Mirko Schmidt. </span><span>Acute Physical Activity Enhances Executive Functions in Children with ADHD. </span><span>Scientific Reports, 2018.</span></p></div></div><p>The content published here is the exclusive responsibility of the authors.</p></div>]]>

<p>The software has poured into almost all areas of our lives throughout the
years. It remembers phone numbers of our loved ones, it finds the best route to
a well-reviewed restaurant we want to eat in, and many many more things. This
ever-presence of software engineering in our day-to-day things brings all
kinds of questions on what is ethical and what is not.</p>
<p>The topic of ethics is significant for us programmers (developers) who
produce living and breathing pieces of code every day. Those pieces of code can
change and affect other people’s lives. So, is being ethical in your work worth
it? And what to do when presented with questionable requirements from your
superiors?</p>
<p>These are all hard questions and topics, but let’s try to break them together.</p>
<h2 id="to-bully-or-to-be-bullied"><a href="#to-bully-or-to-be-bullied" aria-label="to bully or to be bullied permalink"></a>To Bully, or To Be Bullied</h2>
<p>I recently came about a tweet where a company was being called out for planning
to build features that would do surveillance on their users. Here’s the <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1336266946044686337">tweet</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The surveillance regime marches on. This is Clockify promising a road map of ever-more oppressive and dehumanizing tracking of employees. If we're just being HONEST here, I'd like to see this blown into a million bits. Source code encrypted and the key lost. Just awful. <a href="https://t.co/OfnjKn6dDp">https://t.co/OfnjKn6dDp</a></p>— DHH (@dhh) <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh/status/1336266946044686337?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 8, 2020</a></blockquote> 
<p>A company named Clockify, which provides time-tracking features to their users,
exposed a road-map where they will do screenshots and GPS tracking of their
users. Of course, somebody took the picture in the tweet out of context. The
idea was to provide these features to only some portion of their users who
would pay for them. I am not saying it to justify the features they
are adding, just trying to put more context into the conversation.</p>
<p>Of course, the idea of watching over someone while they work is appalling to me,
and I would never work or run a company that does this. What’s more
intriguing to me is the dilemma of what do you do when you work for such a company. We will
always have some persona on social media that will bash the shit out
of ideas like user surveillance, but what can a ground-level developer like
you and me do in this situation?</p>
<p><span>

<p>Let’s say you work in that company, and someone asked you to build a feature that
tracks what users do on their computers. Would you stand up and say a hard ‘no’
to the management? Or, would you nod your head and leave a 👍 reaction.
Answering this question is hard. But to make it a bit easier, I would like to
remind you that even as an engineer, you can be held accountable, even though
you are not the ‘mastermind’ behind all of it.</p>
<p>I’m not trying to scare you or anything, but did you know that Volkswagen’s
engineer got sentenced to more than three years in prison for being involved in a
scheme that allowed VW to sell diesel cars that generated more pollution than
it was allowed? You can read all about it <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-volkswagen-emissions-sentencing/vw-engineer-sentenced-to-40-month-prison-term-in-diesel-case-idUSKCN1B51YP">here</a>.
You decide if it was worth it for that guy.</p>
<h2 id="taking-the-oath"><a href="#taking-the-oath" aria-label="taking the oath permalink"></a>Taking the oath</h2>
<p>No matter what job you do as a developer. You had to start somewhere. Some
folks took the university route. Some did the online courses at
home and honed their craft. But no matter what you did, rarely anyone had a
class or a course to them a thing or two about ethics.</p>
<p>In other professions, such as have their documents with core values and
standards. The most famous one is, of course, the Hippocratic oath medical
doctors need to take. Doctors promise to care responsibly for their patients
and learn ethics as part of their education. It is crucial for doctor’s
patients to feel confident that the doctor has their best interest at heart.</p>
<p>We should have something similar in our line of work but applied
more often. There are a couple of examples where people put together documents
that describe what ethics for software engineers is. For example, the world’s
largest educational and scientific computing society - ACM - has a
<a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct</a>.
Check it out, it is an interesting read.</p>
<p>I am not saying that enforcing all computing professionals to take some oath
will drop the surveillance or other unethical software to drop to
zero. People will try to go out of the way whatever we do. What we need to do
instead is to teach about ethics in computer science <strong>more</strong> since our actions
can impact the world more than ever.</p>
<h2 id="field-studies"><a href="#field-studies" aria-label="field studies permalink"></a>Field studies</h2>
<p>An interesting thing I found is that StackOverflow asked a couple of questions
about ethics in 2018 (now two years ago). It turns out that most of the developers
(58.5% to be precise) back then said that they would refuse to write code for
an unethical purpose. Also, a huge portion (almost 80%) said that developers have an
obligation to consider the ethical implications of their code, which is relieving.</p>
<p>Alongside these numbers of ethics awareness, there were a lot of ethical grays.
Devs are not entirely sure who would they report ethical problems. Furthermore,
developers think differently about who is ultimately responsible
for the unethical code. Right there, in those two spots, I see a lot of room for
improvement. There is potential to educate companies and teams and have go-to
persons to report unethical claims in establishments.</p>
<p>I wonder how the survey would perform if the same questions get asked this year. If
you’re interested in the survey, you can check it out
<a href="https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2018/#ethics">on StackOverflow here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="so-is-it-worth-it"><a href="#so-is-it-worth-it" aria-label="so is it worth it permalink"></a>So, is it worth it?</h2>
<p>Well, it depends on who you ask. If you are a person responsible for a company’s income,
your best interest is to see trends on charts go in the upwards
direction. How you do it, it might now be the most ethical way, but you are
still crushing it. Or are you?</p>
<p><span>
      <span></span>
  <img alt="Random chart" title="Random chart" src="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/eea6a884861dac2a0650ddcec764face/fcda8/random-chart.png" srcset="https://pragmaticpineapple.com/static/eea6a884861dac2a0650ddcec764face/12f09/random-chart.png 148w,

    </span></p>
<p>I am going back to the example of the Clockify (or Hubstaff, or any other time-tracking)
product. The new features that go over the ethics will probably be the most
expensive ones, and could provide more profit for the company. Is that a good
thing? Not always, I believe. If you’re chasing to increase those fancy
acronyms (ARR and MRR) and do not care about the ethics (and the world) - then
I think it is not a good thing.</p>
<p>Yes, the income will come quicker, but the broader impact on the world can be
detrimental. Imagine if all the time-tracking companies will slowly move to
this approach and that surveillance will become the norm in these apps.</p>
<p>So, in the end, no, I <strong>do think being ethical in your work is worth it</strong>. Maybe
not in a quantifiable way or in a way where you can plot a chart and show it to
your manager. Definitely, the actions you decide to take or not to take can
impact those around you. I feel that the fact that we can influence other
people’s lives is something we, as programmers, often overlook. And we shouldn’t
do that, because what’s most important to remember is that we are all in this
together.</p>
<h2 id="action-points"><a href="#action-points" aria-label="action points permalink"></a>Action points</h2>
<p>Where to go now? I recommend reading or going through a couple of resources here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_ethics">Programming ethics on Wikipedia</a> - provides a good summary</li>
<li><a href="https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics">ACM Code of Ethics</a> - in-depth example of an ethics code</li>
<li><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10284614-the-clean-coder">The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers</a> - great book overall</li>
<li><a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/ethical-programming-professional/">What It Takes To Be an Ethical Programming Professional</a> - an insightful blog post</li>
<li>If going through an online course is your thing, maybe try one of those</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, being ethical won’t be easy, and it won’t look great at times. The
most critical takeaway from this post is to spend time to set up your ethical
boundaries. From then on, it is easier to have conversations and ask questions
like - “is this in the best interest of our users?” and “how does this affect
our organization’s reputation?“.</p>
<p>I hope this post brought some insight or, at least, reminded you that something
like ethics still exists in our profession. If you like topics like these,

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 id="article-series">Article series</h2><ul><li>1st part :: <a href="https://dev.l1x.be/posts/2020/11/22/getting-started-with-firecracker-on-raspberry-pi/">https://dev.l1x.be/posts/2020/11/22/getting-started-with-firecracker-on-raspberry-pi/</a></li><li>2nd part :: this</li></ul><h2 id="intro">Intro</h2><p>Last time in the 1st article I briefly introduced Firecracker as a lightweight virtualization/containerization solution for extreme-scale (like AWS Lambda functions). This time around I am going to dig a bit deeper into the API and the management of microVMs. I am going to install Alpine on RPI, install Rust and Python, Docker, get the Linux kernel source and compile a new kernel with minimal config, compile our own Firecracker and then create a new rootfs to be able to boot up a guest. Most of these steps are optional, you can use the stock kernel the Firecracker team provides or download Firecracker release from Github.</p><h2 id="setup-alpine">Setup Alpine</h2><p>If you do not care about Alpine on RPI you can jump to the Firecracker section.</p><p>I would like to keep going with <a href="https://amzn.to/2Klb9fx">Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB</a> or <a href="https://amzn.to/2KeohTO">Raspberry Pi 4B 4GB</a> for many reasons. It is a small system that you can easily hack on without any change on your desktop. It is also an ARM64 (ARM Cortex-A72) system that has great performance even without active cooling. I usually use it with a <a href="https://amzn.to/3naOS2L">alu case</a> that provides the best heat dispersion and a cool CPU. It has enough CPU power and memory to compile any software including Firecracker, the Linux kernel, and more. Since this project is a side project I don’t care how long it takes to finish a new kernel, usually finishes within 2 hours (I might get exact timing later).</p><p>Another item on my to-do list is to get Alpine Linux as both the host and the guest system. For those who do not know Alpine is a small Linux distribution designed for security, simplicity, and resource efficiency. It comes with sane defaults and Musl as its C standard library. Alpine uses its own package management system, apk-tools, providing super-fast package installation. Alpine allows a very small system with minimal installation being around 130 MB. The init system is the lightweight OpenRC, Alpine does not use systemd. This was the primary reason I wanted to get into Alpine.</p><h3 id="installing-alpine-on-rpi-4">Installing Alpine on RPI 4</h3><p>This is the most complicated part of the setup because RPI has a special boot procedure that uses a FAT partition and the GPU. When installing Alpine first you need to create a FAT partition at the beginning of the SD card with MBR. I am using MacOS this time. I am pretty sure it is easy to translate this to Linux (not sure about Windows.)</p><h4 id="creating-the-partition">Creating the partition</h4><p>My microSD card is /dev/disk6. I create a partition with the name ALP (1024MB), then activate it with fdisk.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">diskutil list
diskutil partitionDisk /dev/disk6 MBR <span>"FAT32"</span> ALP 1024MB <span>"Free Space"</span> SYS R
sudo fdisk -e /dev/disk6
&gt; f <span>1</span>
&gt; w
&gt; <span>exit</span>
</code></pre></div><p>After this command runs successfully MacOS mounts the newly created partition in /Volumes/ALP.</p><h4 id="downloading-alpine-and-writing-it-to-the-sd-card">Downloading Alpine and writing it to the SD card</h4><p>You can initiate the download anywhere, make sure the previously created partition is mounted.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">wget http://dl-cdn.alpinelinux.org/alpine/v3.12/releases/aarch64/alpine-rpi-3.12.1-aarch64.tar.gz
tar xzvf alpine-rpi-3.12.1-aarch64.tar.gz -C /Volumes/ALP/
</code></pre></div><h4 id="configuring-rpi-boot">Configuring RPI boot</h4><p>This part is optional, you can disable audio, wifi, Bluetooth, etc and enable UART, configure GPU mem. The full documentation is here:</p><p><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/">https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/configuration/config-txt/</a></p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cd</span> /Volumes/ALP/
<span>echo</span> <span>'dtparam=audio=off'</span>          &gt;&gt; usercfg.txt
<span>echo</span> <span>'dtoverlay=pi3-disable-wifi'</span> &gt;&gt; usercfg.txt
<span>echo</span> <span>'enable_uart=1'</span>              &gt;&gt; usercfg.txt
<span>echo</span> <span>'gpu_mem=64'</span>                 &gt;&gt; usercfg.txt
<span>echo</span> <span>'disable_overscan=1'</span>         &gt;&gt; usercfg.txt
</code></pre></div><p>You are ready to remove the SD card.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>cd</span>
diskutil eject /dev/disk6
</code></pre></div><h4 id="booting-and-configuring-alpine">Booting and configuring Alpine</h4><p>After inserting the SD card into the RPI you can boot it up. I am using a special converter that converts the mini HDMI to a normal HDMI <a href="https://amzn.to/3452Ziz">converter</a> that makes it easy to connect a TV or a monitor to the PI. I usually connect the device to the network with an ethernet cable and plug in a wired USB keyboard.</p><p>Once the device is booting up you can login with root (no password).</p><p>Alpine has a neat tool to configure a new system. It asks a few questions about keyboard layout and timezone, also makes you create a root password.</p><p>Once setup-alpine is done you need to change a few things around because up to this moment you operated on the FAT partition. After updating the system and adding cfdisk you can create a new partition and use the remaining space on the SD card to have a proper system. In cfdisk, select “Free space” and the option “New”. It suggests using the entire available space, just press enter, then select the option “primary”, followed by “Write”. Type “yes” to write the partition table to disk, then select “Quit”.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">apk update
apk upgrade
apk add cfdisk e2fsprogs
cfdisk /dev/mmcblk0
</code></pre></div><p>Once our new partition is ready you need to create a filesystem on it and install a basic Alpine system with setup-disk. In “sys” mode, it’s an installer, it permanently installs Alpine on the disk. Ignore the errors, there might be some while executing setup-disk.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">mkfs.ext4 /dev/mmcblk0p2
mount /dev/mmcblk0p2 /mnt
setup-disk -m sys /mnt
mount -o remount,rw /media/mmcblk0p1
</code></pre></div><p>This section is what I found on the Alpine wiki and it works. There might be an easier way.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">rm -f /media/mmcblk0p1/boot/*
<span>cd</span> /mnt
rm boot/boot
mv boot/* /media/mmcblk0p1/boot/
rm -Rf boot
mkdir media/mmcblk0p1
ln -s media/mmcblk0p1/boot boot
</code></pre></div><p>There are only two steps left, adjusting fstab and cmdline.txt.</p><p>Fstab:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash"><span>UUID</span><span>=</span>your-uui-id  /                 ext4  rw,relatime  <span>0</span> <span>0</span>
/dev/mmcblk0p1    /media/mmcblk0p1  vfat  rw           <span>0</span> <span>0</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Add the following content to etc/fstab (please note no starting /).</p><p>Appending the following to the cmdline.txt:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">vi /media/mmcblk0p1/cmdline.txt
</code></pre></div><p>It looks like this for me:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat /media/mmcblk0p1/cmdline.txt
<span>modules</span><span>=</span>loop,squashfs,sd-mod,usb-storage quiet <span>console</span><span>=</span>tty1 <span>root</span><span>=</span>/dev/mmcblk0p2
</code></pre></div><p>I am not sure if lbu commit is necessary here. When Alpine Linux boots in diskless mode, initially it only loads a few required packages from the boot device by default. But local adjustments in RAM are possible, e.g. by installing a package or adjusting some configuration.</p><p>You can reboot and log in with root and verify everything is working. Going forward it is best to have a user other than root.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">adduser l1x
addgroup l1x wheel
</code></pre></div><p>I usually add the following packages and start to use sudo going forward:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apk add tmux fish ninja clang g++ sudo git python3 socat curl vim procps
</code></pre></div><p>Make sure that wheel group can use sudo:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">%wheel <span>ALL</span><span>=(</span>ALL<span>)</span> NOPASSWD: ALL
</code></pre></div><p>Changing my shell to fish:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">l1x:x:1000:1000:Linux User,,,:/home/l1x:/usr/bin/fish
</code></pre></div><p>Hopefully, by now you have a working environment. I use a bigger drive for /data where I store all the development folders.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">l1x@alpine ~&gt; mount <span>|</span> column -t <span>|</span> egrep <span>'^/dev'</span>
/dev/mmcblk0p2  on  /                 <span>type</span>  ext4        <span>(</span>rw,relatime<span>)</span>
/dev/mmcblk0p1  on  /media/mmcblk0p1  <span>type</span>  vfat        <span>(</span>rw,relatime,fmask<span>=</span>0022,dmask<span>=</span>0022,codepage<span>=</span>437,...<span>)</span>
/dev/sda1       on  /data             <span>type</span>  xfs         <span>(</span>rw,relatime,attr2,inode64,logbufs<span>=</span>8,logbsize<span>=</span>32k,...<span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><h2 id="setting-up-firecracker-dev-environment">Setting up Firecracker dev environment</h2><p>Once you logged in via SSH to your Alpine system make sure you have the dev tools you are going to need. I usually use the following tools, and some more:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apk add tmux git python3 curl vim
</code></pre></div><p>I was trying to figure out how to install Rust on ARM64 linux and the most straightforward way looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">curl --proto <span>'=https'</span> --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs <span>|</span> sh
</code></pre></div><p>If you want to compile Firecracker yourself you also need Docker. Docker for this version of Alpine lives in the community repo. Simply append the community line to your repositories:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">cat /etc/apk/repositories
<span>#/media/mmcblk0p1/apks</span>
http://your.nearest.mirror/mirrors/pub/alpine/v3.12/main
http://your.nearest.mirror/mirrors/pub/alpine/v3.12/community
</code></pre></div><p>Installing Docker:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apk add docker
sudo addgroup <span>$USER</span> docker
sudo rc-update add docker boot
sudo service docker start
</code></pre></div><p>After Docker is running you can clone the Firecracker repo:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">git clone git@github.com:firecracker-microvm/firecracker.git
</code></pre></div><p>Before you can compile a release you need to install two more packages:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">sudo apk add bash ncurses
</code></pre></div><p>Now you can compile the Firecracker binaries:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">./tools/devtool build --release --libc musl
<span>[</span>Firecracker devtool<span>]</span> About to pull docker image fcuvm/dev:v24
<span>[</span>Firecracker devtool<span>]</span> Continue? <span>(</span>y/n<span>)</span> y

</code></pre></div><p>There are few binaries generated:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="bash">ls build/cargo_target/aarch64-unknown-linux-musl/release/<span>{</span>firecracker,jailer<span>}</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Using these binaries we can create the VMs.</p><h2 id="creating-a-microvm">Creating a microVM</h2><p>Before getting started, there are multiple ways to start a microVM with Firecracker. Here are a few:</p><ul><li>starting up the Firecracker binary and through the Unix socket configure it and then start a VM</li><li>starting Firecracker with a complete VM config without the Unix socket API</li><li>starting Firecracker with Jailer so it uses cgroups to containerize the VM</li></ul><p>We are going to check out the first way.</p><p>When I started to fiddle with FC I was trying to use the official CLI (Firectl) and because it is written in Go you need to have a Go compiler if you would like to build it yourself. I did not like this option too much so …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><em>Guest author: </em><a href="https://twitter.com/dickiebush"><em>Dickie Bush</em></a><em><br></em><strong>‍</strong></p><p>I binged <a href="https://shop.visualizevalue.com/products/build-once-sell-twice-the-productization-playbook">Build Once, Sell Twice</a> in one sitting.</p><p>I expected an online course that would teach me about building and selling. </p><p>But it’s more than that. Build Once, Sell Twice is a mindset. A framework. <strong>An operating system for the 21st-century internet entrepreneur. </strong>And your future self can’t afford to live without it.</p><p>Within this operating system, there are hundreds of ideas, principles, and concepts.</p><p>But three of them were foundation-shaking - forever burnt into my grey matter.</p><p>I call these zero-to-one concepts. Concepts that once you see, you can't unsee.</p><p>This isn't an<a href="https://www.value.app/feed/build-once-sell-twice-preview"> executive summary</a>. It's a selfish distillation of three zero-to-one concepts from Build Once, Sell Twice. It was only by writing them out that I could fully wrap my head around them.</p><p>The three zero-to-one concepts:</p><ul role="list"><li>Ideas, People, Problems, Products, Proof, Process</li><li>Assets, Equity, and Dividends</li><li>Be the Bridge and Sell Your Sawdust</li></ul><h3><strong>Ideas, People, Problems, Products, Proof, Process</strong></h3><figure id="w-node-a3c01e53ae71-f921d246"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4c1c4bc17267761b21d253/5fd16c8a92062200196d55cb_TA%20Copy%20815.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>The TL;DR, six-word summary of BOST: Ideas, People, Problems, Products, Proof, Process.</p><p>If you want to sell a product, start with sharing your ideas, attract like-minded people, figure out their problems, solve their problems with products, extract proof once you've solved their problems, and document your process along the way (which becomes a separate product.)</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Ideas.</strong> Start sharing your ideas today. Brainstorm your unique combination of skills, interests, experiences, and perspective. Pick a single platform and start making noise in an authentic way. Tweets, essays, images, blog posts, podcasts, white papers, designs, whatever your medium, the more noise the better. Then, listen for signal.</li><li><strong>People.</strong> You will share your initial ideas into the void. Good. You need time to improve them anyway. But once you make enough noise, some ideas will resonate, both with you and with others. You'll find the ideas you enjoy sharing the people who enjoy them.<p>Double down on this signal. Sharpen them and tailor them. Before long, you will have built a network of ideas and a network of people with which they resonate.</p></li><li><strong>Problems.</strong> Like-minded people face similar problems. Luckily, you've built up a network of like-minded people. It's now your job to analyze: • Who are these people? • What do they have in common? • Why do they appreciate your point of view? • Most importantly, what are their problems?<p>From there, you can call attention to those problems. The ideas you share should put into words the problems your audience faces, but struggle to articulate.</p></li><li><strong>Products.</strong> With problems identified, it's your job to create products that solve them. Your content should bring attention to the problems and explain why your product is the solution. Position your solution as providing <strong>monetary, social, psychological, or practical value</strong> in solving their specific problem.</li><li><strong>Proof.</strong> You only need one customer to start. If your product solves their problem, they will rave about it. Iterate and hone your product until extracting this proof is easy. Once it's solving problems consistently, use testimonials and social proof to increase your credibility. Use that credibility to increase your price. Then, repeat.</li><li><strong>Process.</strong> All the while, document your process. Bring people behind the scenes as you build and iterate your product. Build with authenticity and transparency. Distill your knowledge and learnings into process equity. Turn the scraps of your build process, your sawdust, into an asset. This doubles your total market: you have people who will consume your product, and people who will consume your process.</li></ol><p>At any point on your journey, you are somewhere between these six steps. Execute accordingly.</p><h3><strong>Assets, Equity, and Dividends</strong></h3><figure id="w-node-19146f7ad326-f921d246"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4c1c4bc17267761b21d253/5fd16c947af476320d886fcf_TA%20Copy%20816.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Assets, equity, and dividends are the foundation of Build Once, Sell Twice.</p><p>Your time, energy, and attention are finite. If you spend them poorly, they're gone forever. But if you invest them wisely, they compound.</p><p>The goal is to invest our finite time, energy, and attention into building assets. Over time, these assets store our time, energy, and attention as equity. As that equity compounds, we can occasionally extract dividends.</p><p>Simple enough.</p><p>Simple? Yes. Easy? No.</p><p>When viewed this way, your time, energy, and attention become precious. They're all you have. But how often do you let them go to waste? One wasted day here, a couple distractions there, one by one they're gone forever.</p><p>Once you become physically ill from the thought of wasting them, you've understood their scarcity.</p><p>Before BOST, I thought of equity as capital. When I thought about compound interest, I saw money compounding at 2% a year for many years. Find a way to make money early and let compounding take care of the rest, I thought.</p><p>This equity is easy to see because it has an objective measure: dollars.</p><p>But BOST revealed four types of unseen equity. Equity that is always there but difficult to measure:</p><p>• Process <br>• Reputation <br>• Experience<br>• Relationships</p><p>Your cash compensation is simply extracting dividends from this equity. This makes your income a lagging indicator, not a leading indicator.</p><p>But the real zero to one moment is understanding how this equity compounds.</p><p>Process, reputation, experience, and relationships compound faster than capital. By extracting dividends (cash), we interrupt this powerful compounding force in exchange for dollars, which compound at 2%.</p><p>When measuring an opportunity, people overweight the dollar compensation and underweight the process, reputation, experience, or relationships. Everyone does this.</p><p>This makes prioritizing the unseen equity 21st-century arbitrage. The best projects, ones that reward you handsomely with this unseen equity, are wide open. Exploit that opportunity.</p><p>With this in mind, how should your operations change?</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Recognize the unseen equity.</strong> Work to spend your time, energy, and attention building assets. Allow those assets to compound. Understand that cash compensation is a dividend extraction, and therefore a lagging indicator.<br>‍</li><li><strong>Prioritize the unseen equity.</strong> Take on projects that compensate in experience, reputation, or relationships.<br>‍</li><li><strong>Be patient in extracting dividends from this equity.</strong> Keep the long view and avoid short-term thinking. Carefully weigh the risk/reward of extracting dividends and interrupting its compounding.</li></ol><h3><strong>Be the bridge and sell your sawdust</strong></h3><figure id="w-node-0ed8eaf2363b-f921d246"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5f4c1c4bc17267761b21d253/5fd16c7fdb04e6c552b0fcdc_TA%20Copy%20817.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>On your journey, there are two groups of people. There are people with more experience than you who you are learning from. And there are people following in your footsteps who you can teach.</p><p>See yourself as a bridge between these two groups of people. And build your bridge with process equity.</p><p>As you learn, iterate, and build, you will build your process. You could keep this process and experience to yourself, and that would be fine. But with a little extra effort, you can distill your process into an asset. You can then share (or sell) this asset to those following in your footsteps.</p><p>This is a subtle but profound shift. You now have two markets:</p><ol role="list"><li>Those you sell your <strong>product</strong> to (whatever it is you're building and selling.)<br>‍</li><li>Those you sell your <strong>process</strong> to (those following a similar path you took.)</li></ol><p><br>This concept is called selling your sawdust. You spend your days working, building, and iterating with your saw. But now, you can repackage and share the scraps and byproduct of your creative work - your sawdust.</p><p>The benefits of this shift cannot be understated:</p><ol role="list"><li><strong>Clarify and better understand your process.</strong> By distilling your experience and process into an asset, you better internalize them. When one teaches, two learn.<br>‍</li><li><strong>All of your time, energy, and attention goes toward creating equity.</strong> With the bridge and sawdust mindset, there are no wasted resources. You are spending your time, energy, and attention building and selling your product, or distilling and refining your process.<br>‍</li><li><strong>Increase the size of your total addressable market.</strong> The number of people you can provide value to explodes. You have product consumers and process consumers. Congratulations - you've productized yourself.</li></ol><h3><strong>Your turn</strong></h3><p>I purchased Build Once, Sell Twice on a whim. After watching Jack execute in public since early March, I knew he had the operating system down. </p><p>This course is immediately actionable. When I finished, I shut the module and got to work, first clarifying the ideas in my head, then putting them into action.</p><p>Because it’s not an online course. <strong>It’s an operating system for the 21st-century internet entrepreneur. </strong></p><p>Newsflash: it works. And it works well. And once you internalize it, it will change the way you think about the internet.</p><p>If you're considering Build Once, Sell Twice or any Visualize Value product, do it. You deserve it. </p><p>And your future self can't afford to live without it.</p><p>—</p><p><em>If you want to see how I’m using this operating system or chat about the course, </em><a href="http://twitter.com/dickiebush"><em>DM on Twitter @dickiebush.</em></a><em><br></em><br><a href="https://shop.visualizevalue.com/products/build-once-sell-twice-the-productization-playbook">Build Once, Sell Twice is available here.</a><br></p></div></div></div>]]>

<p>Bash scripts. Almost anyone needs to write one sooner or later. Almost no one says “yeah, I love writing them”. And that’s why almost everyone is putting low attention while writing them.</p>



<p>I won’t try to make you a Bash expert (since I’m not a one either), but I will show you a minimal template that will make your scripts safer. You don’t need to thank me, your future self will thank you.</p>



<h2><span id="why_scripting_in_bash"></span>Why scripting in Bash?<span></span></h2>



<p>The best summary of Bash scripting appeared recently on my Twitter feed:</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The opposite of "it's like riding a bike" is "it's like programming in bash".</p><p>A phrase which means that no matter how many times you do something, you will have to re-learn it every single time.</p></div>— Jake Wharton (@JakeWharton) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeWharton/status/1334177665356587008?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 2, 2020</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>But Bash has something in common with another widely beloved language. Just like JavaScript, it won’t go away easily. While we can hope that Bash won’t become the main language for literally everything, it’s always somewhere near.</p>



<p>Bash <a href="https://www.quora.com/Is-Bash-considered-the-lingua-franca-of-shells/answer/Paul-Reiber">inherited the shell throne</a> and can be found on almost every Linux, including Docker images. And this is the environment in which most of the backend runs. So if you need to script the server application startup, a CI/CD step, or integration test run, Bash is there for you.</p>



<p>To glue few commands together, pass output from one to another, and just start some executable, Bash is the easiest and most native solution. While it makes perfect sense to write bigger, more complicated scripts in other languages, you can’t expect to have Python, Ruby, fish, or whatever another interpreter you believe is the best, available everywhere. And you probably should think twice and then once more before adding it to some prod server, Docker image, or CI environment.</p>



<p>Yet Bash is far from perfect. The syntax is a nightmare. Error handling is difficult. There are landmines everywhere. And we have to deal with it.</p>



<h2><span id="bash_script_template"></span>Bash script template<span></span></h2>



<p>Without further ado, here it is.</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -Eeuo pipefail
trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)

usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

Available options:

-h, --help      Print this help and exit
-v, --verbose   Print script debug info
-f, --flag      Some flag description
-p, --param     Some param description
EOF
  exit
}

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}

setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
  else
    NOFORMAT='' RED='' GREEN='' ORANGE='' BLUE='' PURPLE='' CYAN='' YELLOW=''
  fi
}

msg() {
  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}

die() {
  local msg=$1
  local code=${2-1} # default exit status 1
  msg "$msg"
  exit "$code"
}

parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag
    -p | --param) # example named parameter
      param="${2-}"
      shift
      ;;
    -?*) die "Unknown option: $1" ;;
    *) break ;;
    esac
    shift
  done

  args=("$@")

  # check required params and arguments
  [[ -z "${param-}" ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing required parameter: param"
  [[ ${#args[@]} -eq 0 ]] &amp;&amp; die "Missing script arguments"

  return 0
}

parse_params "$@"
setup_colors

# script logic here

msg "${RED}Read parameters:${NOFORMAT}"
msg "- flag: ${flag}"
msg "- param: ${param}"
msg "- arguments: ${args[*]-}"</code></pre>



<p>The idea was to not make it too long. I don’t want to scroll 500 lines to the script logic. At the same time, I want some strong foundations for any script. But Bash is not making this easy, lacking any form of dependencies management.</p>



<p>One solution would be to have a separate script with all the boilerplate and utility functions and execute it at the beginning. The downside would be to have to always attach this second file everywhere, losing the “simple Bash script” idea along the way. So I decided to put in the template only what I consider to be a minimum to keep it possible short.</p>



<p>Now let’s look at it in more detail.</p>



<h3><span id="choose_bash"></span>Choose Bash<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash</code></pre>



<p>Script traditionally starts with a shebang. For the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21612980/why-is-usr-bin-env-bash-superior-to-bin-bash">best compatibility</a>, it references <code>/usr/bin/env</code>, not the <code>/bin/bash</code> directly. Although, if you read comments in the linked StackOverflow question, even this can fail sometimes.</p>



<h3><span id="fail_fast"></span>Fail fast<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code></pre>



<p>The <code>set</code> command changes script execution options. For example, <strong>normally Bash does not care if some command failed</strong>, returning a non-zero exit status code. It just happily jumps to the next one. Now consider this little script:</p>



<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash
cp important_file ./backups/
rm important_file</code></pre>



<p>What will happen, if the <code>backups</code> directory does not exist? Exactly, you will get an error message in the console, but before you will be able to react, the file will be already removed by the second command.</p>



<p>For details on what options exactly <code>set -Eeuo pipefail</code> changes and how they will protect you, I refer you to the <a href="https://vaneyckt.io/posts/safer_bash_scripts_with_set_euxo_pipefail/">article I have in my bookmarks for a few years now</a>.</p>



<p>Although you should know that there are some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/g1vsxk/the_first_two_statements_of_your_bash_script/fniifmk?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">arguments against setting those options</a>.</p>



<h3><span id="get_the_location"></span>Get the location<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>script_dir=$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" &amp;&gt;/dev/null &amp;&amp; pwd -P)</code></pre>



<p>This line <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/246128/2512304">does its best</a> to define the script’s location directory<s>, and then we <code>cd</code> to it. Why?</s></p>



<p>Often our scripts are operating on paths relative to the script location, copying files and executing commands, assuming the script directory is also a working directory. And it is, as long as we execute the script from its directory.</p>



<p>But if, let’s say, our CI config executes script like this:</p>



<pre><code>/opt/ci/project/script.sh</code></pre>



<p>then our script is operating not in project dir, but some completely different workdir of our CI tool. We can fix it, by going to the directory before executing the script:</p>



<pre><code>cd /opt/ci/project &amp;&amp; ./script.sh</code></pre>



<p>But it’s much nicer to solve this on the script side. So, if the script reads some file or executes another program from the same directory, call it like this:</p>



<pre><code>cat "$script_dir/my_file"</code></pre>



<p>At the same time, the script does not change the workdir location. If the script is executed from some other directory and the user provides a relative path to some file, we will still be able to read it.</p>



<h3><span id="try_to_clean_up"></span>Try to clean up<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>trap cleanup SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT

cleanup() {
  trap - SIGINT SIGTERM ERR EXIT
  # script cleanup here
}</code></pre>



<p>Think about the <code>trap</code> like of a <code>finally</code> block for the script. At the end of the script – normal, caused by an error or an external signal – the <code>cleanup()</code> function will be executed. This is a place where you can, for example, try to remove all temporary files created by the script.</p>



<p>Just remember that the <code>cleanup()</code> can be called not only at the end but as well having the script done any part of the work. Not necessarily all the resources you try to cleanup will exist.</p>



<h3><span id="display_helpful_help"></span>Display helpful help<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>usage() {
  cat &lt;&lt;EOF
Usage: $(basename "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}") [-h] [-v] [-f] -p param_value arg1 [arg2...]

Script description here.

...
EOF
  exit
}</code></pre>



<p>Having the <code>usage()</code> relatively close to the top of the script, it will act in two ways:</p>



<ul><li>to <strong>display help</strong> for someone who does not know all the options and does not want to go over the whole script to discover them,</li><li>as a <strong>minimal documentation</strong> when someone modifies the script (for example you, 2 weeks later, not even remembering writing it in the first place).</li></ul>



<p>I don’t argue to document every function here. But a short, nice script usage message is a required minimum.</p>



<h3><span id="print_nice_messages"></span>Print nice messages<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>setup_colors() {
  if [[ -t 2 ]] &amp;&amp; [[ -z "${NO_COLOR-}" ]] &amp;&amp; [[ "${TERM-}" != "dumb" ]]; then
    NOFORMAT='\033[0m' RED='\033[0;31m' GREEN='\033[0;32m' ORANGE='\033[0;33m' BLUE='\033[0;34m' PURPLE='\033[0;35m' CYAN='\033[0;36m' YELLOW='\033[1;33m'
  else
    NOFORMAT='' RED='' GREEN='' ORANGE='' BLUE='' PURPLE='' CYAN='' YELLOW=''
  fi
}

msg() {
  echo &gt;&amp;2 -e "${1-}"
}</code></pre>



<p>Firstly, remove the <code>setup_colors()</code> function if you don’t want to use colors in text anyway. I keep it because I know I would use colors more often if I wouldn’t have to google codes for them every time.</p>



<p>Secondly, those <strong>colors are meant to be used with the <code>msg()</code> function only</strong>, not with the <code>echo</code> command.</p>



<p>The <strong><code>msg()</code> function is meant to be used to print everything that is not a script output</strong>. This includes all logs and messages, not only the errors. Citing the great <a href="https://medium.com/@jdxcode/12-factor-cli-apps-dd3c227a0e46">12 Factor CLI Apps</a> article:</p>



<blockquote><p><strong>In short: stdout is for output, stderr is for messaging.</strong></p><cite><a href="https://jdxcode.com/">Jeff Dickey</a>, who <a href="https://github.com/oclif/oclif/graphs/contributors">knows a little</a> about <a href="https://github.com/heroku/cli/graphs/contributors">building CLI apps</a></cite></blockquote>



<p>That’s why in most cases you shouldn’t use colors for <code>stdout</code> anyway.</p>



<p>Messages printed with <code>msg()</code> are sent to <code>stderr</code> stream and support special sequences, like colors. And colors are disabled anyway if the <code>stderr</code> output is not an interactive terminal or&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://no-color.org/" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the standard parameters</a>&nbsp;is passed.</p>



<p>Usage:</p>



<pre><code>msg "This is a ${RED}very important${NOFORMAT} message, but not a script output value!"</code></pre>



<p>To check how it behaves when the <code>stderr</code> is not an interactive terminal, add a line like above to the script. Then execute it redirecting <code>stderr</code> to <code>stdout</code> and piping it to <code>cat</code>. Pipe operation makes the output no longer being sent directly to the terminal, but to the next command, so the colors should be disabled now.</p>



<pre><code>$ ./test.sh 2&gt;&amp;1 | cat
This is a very important message, but not a script output value!</code></pre>



<h3><span id="parse_any_parameters"></span>Parse any parameters<span></span></h3>



<pre><code>parse_params() {
  # default values of variables set from params
  flag=0
  param=''

  while :; do
    case "${1-}" in
    -h | --help) usage ;;
    -v | --verbose) set -x ;;
    --no-color) NO_COLOR=1 ;;
    -f | --flag) flag=1 ;; # example flag
    -p | --param) # …</code></pre></div></div>

<p><a href="https://mypy-lang.org/" rel="noopener">Mypy</a> is an optional static type checker for Python. It's been around since 2012 and is gaining traction even since. One of the main benefits of using a type checker is getting errors at "compile time" rather than at run time.</p>
<p>Exhaustiveness checking is a common feature of type checkers, and a very useful one! In this article I'm going to show you <strong>how you can get mypy to perform exhaustiveness checking!</strong></p>

<p>Say you have a system to manage orders. To represent the status of an order, you have the following enum:</p>

<p>You also have the following code to process an <code>Order</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>When the order is ready, you ship it; and when it's shipped, you charge it.</p>
<p>A few months go by and your system becomes big. So big in fact, that you can no longer ship orders immediately, and you add a new status:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>class</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>(</span><span>enum</span><span>.</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Ready</span> <span>=</span> <span>'ready'</span>
<span>    <span>Scheduled</span> <span>=</span> <span>'scheduled'</span>
</span>    <span>Shipped</span> <span>=</span> <span>'shipped'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Before you push this change to production, you run a quick check with mypy to make sure everything is OK:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
Success: no issues found in <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file
</pre></div>


<p>Mypy does not see anything wrong in this code, Do you? The problem is that <strong>you forgot to handle the new status in your function</strong>.</p>
<p>One way to make sure you always handle all possible order statuses is to add an assert, or throw an exception:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>assert</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>'Unhandled status "{status}"'</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>Now, when you execute the function with the new status <code>OrderStatus.Scheduled</code>, you will get a runtime error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>&gt;&gt;&gt;</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Scheduled</span><span>)</span>
<span>AssertionError</span><span>:</span> <span>Unhandled</span> <span>status</span> <span>"OrderStatus.Scheduled"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Another way to with deal with cases like this is to go over your test suite and add scenarios in all the places that use order status. But... if you forgot to change the function when you added the status, what are the chances you'll remember to update the tests? That's not a good solution...</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking in Mypy</strong></p>
<p>What if mypy could warn you at "compile time" about such cases? Well... it can, using this little magic function:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>NoReturn</span>
<span>import</span> <span>enum</span>

<span>def</span> <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>value</span><span>:</span> <span>NoReturn</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>NoReturn</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>False</span><span>,</span> <span>f</span><span>'Unhandled value: {value} ({type(value).__name__})'</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Before you dig into the implementation, try to use it to see how it works. In the function above, place <code>assert_never</code> after you handled all the possible order statuses, where you previously used <code>assert</code> or raises an exception:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Ready</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>)</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>Now, check the code with Mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"Literal[OrderStatus.Scheduled]"</span><span>;</span>
expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
Found <span>1</span> error in <span>1</span> file <span>(</span>checked <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file<span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Amazing! <strong>Mypy warns you about a status you forgot to handle!</strong> The message also includes the value, <code>OrderStatus.Scheduled</code>. If you use a modern editor such as VSCode you can get these warnings immediately as you type:</p>
<figure><img alt="mypy Error in VSCode" src="https://hakibenita.com/images/00-python-mypy-exhaustive-checking.png"><figcaption>mypy Error in VSCode</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can now go ahead and fix your function to handle the missing status:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>handle_order</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>:</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>None</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Pending</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'schedule order'</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Scheduled</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'ship order'</span><span>)</span>
</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>status</span> <span>is</span> <span>OrderStatus</span><span>.</span><span>Shipped</span><span>:</span>
        <span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'charge order'</span><span>)</span>

    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>status</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Check with mypy again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
Success: no issues found in <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file
</pre></div>


<p>Great! You can now rest assure you handled all order statuses. The best part is that you did that with <strong>no unit tests</strong>, and there were <strong>no runtime errors</strong>. If you include mypy in your CI, the <strong>bad code will never make it into production</strong>.</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="enumeration-types"><a href="#enumeration-types">Enumeration types</a></h2>
<p>In the previous section you used mypy to perform exhaustiveness check on an <code>Enum</code>. You can use mypy, and <code>assert_never</code> to perform exhaustiveness check on other enumeration types as well.</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking of a Union</strong></p>
<p>A <code>Union</code> type represents several possible types. For example, a function that casts an argument to <code>float</code> can look like this:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Union</span>
</span>
<span><span>def</span> <span>get_float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>Union</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
</span>    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>

    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Check the function with mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"float"</span><span>;</span> expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Whoops... you forgot to handle the <code>float</code> type in the code:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing</span> <span>import</span> <span>Union</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>:</span> <span>Union</span><span>[</span><span>str</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>float</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>str</span><span>):</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>float</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span>elif</span> <span>isinstance</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>,</span> <span>float</span><span>):</span>
</span><span>        <span>return</span> <span>num</span>
</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>num</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Check again:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
Success: no issues found in <span>1</span> <span>source</span> file
</pre></div>


<p>Great! mypy is happy...</p>
<p><strong>Exhaustiveness Checking of a Literal</strong></p>
<p>Another useful type is <code>Literal</code>. It is included in the built-in <code>typing</code> module since Python3.8, and prior to that it is part of the complementary <a href="https://pypi.org/project/typing-extensions/" rel="noopener"><code>typing_extensions</code> package</a>.</p>
<p>A <code>Literal</code> is used to type primitive values such as strings and numbers. <code>Literal</code> is also an enumeration type, so you can use exhaustiveness checking on it as well:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>from</span> <span>typing_extensions</span> <span>import</span> <span>Literal</span>

<span>Color</span> <span>=</span> <span>Literal</span><span>[</span><span>'R'</span><span>,</span> <span>'G'</span><span>,</span> <span>'B'</span><span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>get_color_name</span><span>(</span><span>color</span><span>:</span> <span>Color</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>color</span> <span>==</span> <span>'R'</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'Red'</span>
    <span>elif</span> <span>color</span> <span>==</span> <span>'G'</span><span>:</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>'Green'</span>
    <span># elif color == 'B':</span>
    <span>#     return 'Blue'</span>
    <span>else</span><span>:</span>
        <span>assert_never</span><span>(</span><span>color</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Checking the code without the commented part will produce the following error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span>$ mypy main.py
error: Argument <span>1</span> to <span>"assert_never"</span> has incompatible <span>type</span> <span>"Literal['B']"</span><span>;</span> expected <span>"NoReturn"</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Very handy indeed!</p>
<hr>
<h2 id="type-narrowing-in-mypy"><a href="#type-narrowing-in-mypy">Type Narrowing in Mypy</a></h2>
<p>Now that you've seen what <code>assert_never</code> can do, you can try and understand how it works. <code>assert_never</code> works alongside <strong>"type narrowing"</strong>, which is a mypy feature where the type of a variable is narrowed based on the control flow of the program. In other words, mypy is gradually eliminating possible types for a variable.</p>
<p>First, it's important to understand how various things translate to a <code>Union</code> type in mypy:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>int</span><span>]</span>
<span># Equivalent to Union[int, None]</span>

<span>Literal</span><span>[</span><span>'string'</span><span>,</span> <span>42</span><span>,</span> <span>True</span><span>]</span>
<span># Equivalent to Union[Literal['string'], Literal[42], Literal[True]]</span>

<span>class</span> <span>Suit</span><span>(</span><span>Enum</span><span>):</span>
    <span>Clubs</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♣"</span>
    <span>Diamonds</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♦"</span>
    <span>Hearts</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♥"</span>
    <span>Spades</span> <span>=</span> <span>"♠"</span>

<span>Suit</span>
<span># ~Equivalent to Union[</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Clubs],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Diamonds],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Hearts],</span>
<span>#   Literal[Suit.Spades]</span>
<span># ]</span>
</pre></div>


<p>To display the type of an expression, mypy provides a useful utility called <a href="https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/common_issues.html#reveal-type" rel="noopener"><code>reveal_type</code></a>. Using <code>reveal_type</code> you can ask mypy to show you the inferred type for a variable at the point it's called:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
<span>    <span># Revealed type is Union[Suit, None]</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>In the function above, the reveled type of <code>suit</code> is <code>Union[Suit, None]</code>, which is the type of the argument <code>suit</code>.</p>
<p>At this point you haven't done anything in the function, so mypy is unable to narrow down the type. Next, add some logic and see how mypy narrows down the type of the variable <code>suit</code>:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
<span>    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>
</span><span>    <span># Revealed type is Suit</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After eliminating the option of suit being <code>None</code>, the revealed type is <code>Suit</code>. Mypy used your program's logic to narrow the type of the variable.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, the type <code>Suit</code> is equivalent to the type <code>Union[Literal[Suit.Clubs], Literal[Suit.Diamonds], Literal[Suit.Hearts], Literal[Suit.Spades]]</code>, so next, try to narrow down the type even more:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

<span>    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
</span>        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

<span>    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>
</span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>After checking if <code>suit</code> is <code>Suit.Clubs</code>, mypy is able to narrow down the type to <code>Suit.Clubs</code>. Mypy is also smart enough to understand that if the condition does not hold, the variable <em>is definitely not</em> <code>Clubs</code>, and narrows down the type to <code>Diamonds</code>, <code>Hearts</code> or <code>Spades</code>.</p>
<p>Mypy can also use other conditional statements to further narrow the type, for example:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>
    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>

<span>    <span># `and`, `or` and `not` also work.</span>
</span><span>    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Diamonds</span> <span>or</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Spades</span><span>:</span>
</span><span>        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Spades]</span>
</span>        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Diamonds or Spades"</span>

<span>    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Hearts]</span>
</span><span>    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
</span></pre></div>


<p>By the end of the function, mypy narrowed down the type of <code>suit</code> to <code>Suit.Hearts</code>. If, for example, you add a condition that imply a different type for <code>suit</code>, mypy will issue an error:</p>
<div><pre><span></span><span>def</span> <span>describe_suit</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>:</span> <span>Optional</span><span>[</span><span>Suit</span><span>])</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>str</span><span>:</span>
    <span>assert</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>not</span> <span>None</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Clubs</span><span>:</span>
        <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Clubs]</span>
        <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>"Clubs"</span>

    <span># Revealed type is Literal[Suit.Diamonds, Suit.Hearts, Suit.Spades]</span>
    <span>reveal_type</span><span>(</span><span>suit</span><span>)</span>

    <span># `and`, `or` and `not` also work.</span>
    <span>if</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Diamonds</span> <span>or</span> <span>suit</span> <span>is</span> <span>Suit</span><span>.</span><span>Spades</span><span>:</span>

<p>Chuken, a Japanese Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/chukenDr">influencer</a> with over 12,000 followers, promises to teach his fans how to escape poverty — not by learning personal finance hacks or leaning on welfare programs, but by using loyalty points.</p>



<p>Chuken, which means “loyal dog,” calls himself one of Japan’s top-tier point stars, someone well-versed in the complicated art of “point alchemy.” The loyalty rewards he’s accumulated have helped him pay for everything from utility bills and vacations to the occasional trip to the salon. “I’m one of probably up to 100 people in Japan who earn more than 1 million yen [nearly $10,000] a year from points,” he told <em>Rest of World</em>.</p>



<p>Despite being the birthplace of payment technology like the QR code, Japan is still <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/fdbdb92c-a6ea-11e9-984c-fac8325aaa04">stubbornly addicted</a> to using cash: Around <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-boj/nearly-20-of-japan-households-using-e-money-but-cash-still-king-idUSKBN1XS0Q1">80% of people in the country</a> say they choose it over debit cards or payment apps for small purchases. The generous rewards programs that Chuken promotes are a way for digital payment companies to encourage consumer adoption. But the incentives have also given rise to an enthusiastic <em>poikatsu</em>, or “point activities,” subculture that wants to max out as much as possible.</p>



<p>“Considering how cash-dependent Japan is, for mobile payments to take off, there needs to be a change in consumer behavior,” said Celeste Goh, a financial technology analyst at the market intelligence firm S&amp;P Global. That’s where loyalty points enter the picture.</p>



<p>A doctor by day, Chuken, who asked to be identified only by his Twitter alias for privacy reasons, first became interested in rewards programs after experiencing his own financial struggles. He’s one of thousands of physicians at university hospitals in Japan who have gone <a href="https://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/news/backstories/606/">regularly unpaid</a>, even during the Covid-19 pandemic. At first, Twitter was where he swapped tips with other poikatsu enthusiasts, but the hobby soon evolved into a full-fledged lifestyle.</p>



<p>Chuken is just one of many poikatsu personalities that have emerged on Japanese social media in recent years. The biggest stars produce content a few times a week, and also earn additional income from sponsored posts and YouTube advertisements.</p>



<div><p>On Instagram there’s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/jojo_secco_point/">Setsuko Kikuhara</a>, or Sekko, who describes herself as a “poikatsu-obsessed woman.” The single mother of a 5-year-old, Sekko caters her content primarily toward other parents. One of her popular hacks is teaching followers how to nab year-long passes to Hong Kong Disneyland. Her extreme point collection even landed her on a popular Japanese <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwueZH3NcnU">talk show</a>.</p><p>One of the most successful poikatsu influencers is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/ryogakucho/">Ryogakucho</a>, a YouTube creator with more than 600,000 followers who posts step-by-step guides to point hacking. He regularly preaches the gospel of R-Points, a program run by e-commerce giant Rakuten, which rewards consumers for purchases made on its platform. A cartoon lion cheers on subscribers in every video.</p></div>

<div><p>Two years ago, a Japanese think tank <a href="https://www.nira.or.jp/pdf/cashless.pdf#page=15">surveyed 3,000 people in the country, the vast majority of whom said they used rewards points programs at least sometimes</a>. 37% said a major reason they did so was because it was fun. “It’s just like a math problem, game, or sport, but you’re spotting the loopholes of service providers,” said Chuken. “Poikatsu is a hobby that earns you money, rather than loses you money. The better you get, the more it benefits your life.”</p><p>The popularity of poikatsu is in part a result of Japanese consumers’ <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-economy-cashless-idUSKBN1XF0BT">notorious</a> resistance to cashless technology. Even as neighboring countries like South Korea and China quickly adopted digital payments, Japan has clung to physical currency, said Arnie Cho, a fintech analyst at the research firm GlobalData. In early 2020, upwards of <a href="https://daxueconsulting.com/payment-methods-in-china/">700 million consumers</a> were using mobile payments in China, often relying on WeChat Pay and Alipay’s QR code systems. In Japan, that <a href="https://www.nippon.com/en/news/fnn20191214001/the-little-known-story-of-the-birth-of-the-qr-code.html">homegrown technology</a> has rarely been used in fintech, and Chinese tourists have actually <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/smartphone-wielding-chinese-tourists-challenge-cashs-reign-11551609002">helped foster</a> its adoption in the country.</p></div>



<p>International commentators often <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/japan-holdout-asia-cash-free-future/">recycle cultural generalizations </a>to explain Japan’s devotion to cash, but some of the real reasons for the phenomenon may be purely pragmatic. A highly developed banking infrastructure in the country keeps ATMs close, whereas many markets in Southeast Asia are turning to mobile payments to serve the unbanked, said Cho. <a href="https://www.osac.gov/Content/Report/d3d72e3f-6cd9-4fef-9f64-15f4aea79d98#:~:text=There%20is%20minimal%20risk%20from,three%20robberies%20per%20100%2C000%20individuals">Low petty-crime rates</a> also allow the average consumer to feel comfortable carrying a wallet full of cash. Fintech services, meanwhile, <em>have</em> needed to combat problems with fraud. In 2019, <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/7-eleven-japan-7pay-hackers-passwords-2019-7">over $500,000 was stolen</a> from 7pay, 7-Eleven Japan’s debut in the mobile payment space. Almost three months after it launched, the company shuttered the program.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Rewards programs can be expensive for payment apps, but they’re also a reliable way to convince reluctant consumers to give their services a chance. The social media giant Line has relied heavily on point schemes over the past few years, after struggling to get the majority of Japan’s population who already use its messaging platform onto its digital wallet, Line Pay. “Point rewards are an easy-to-understand way to incentivize users,” said Line Pay spokesperson Mayu Kamioka.</p>



<div><p>Line introduced aggressive rewards campaigns in 2018 and 2019 for Line Pay, shortly after the Japanese government set a goal to increase digital payments to <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2018/12/03/reference/japan-grudgingly-heads-toward-cashless-society/">40% of all transactions by 2027</a> (it later <a href="https://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2018/0703_001.html">updated</a> the target to 2025). The strategy included the <a href="https://linecorp.com/ja/pr/news/ja/2020/3151">Line Point Club</a>, a tiered system that rewards users based on the number of purchases they make with Line Pay over a six-month span. The company has also used sporadic <a href="https://linecorp.com/ja/pr/news/ja/2019/2672">“Pay-Toku” campaigns</a>, flash deals that give rebates of up to 20% for Line Pay purchases.</p><p>Line said the incentives are working. In a <a href="https://www.linebiz.com/jp/column/research/20200219/">survey</a> the company’s research arm conducted in February, around 38% of smartphone owners said they used a mobile device to make a payment in brick-and-mortar shops in the past 12 months, an increase from 13% from the year before.</p></div>



<p>Line Pay is competing with over a dozen other payment apps in Japan, including PayPay, a service jointly operated by SoftBank and Yahoo! Japan. PayPay said it <a href="https://about.paypay.ne.jp/pr/20201021/01/">doubled its registered users</a> from 10 million to 20 million in three months last year, as it was relying on short-term cash-back <a href="https://image.paypay.ne.jp/pdf/pr20190204_en.pdf">programs</a>, which cost the company around $94 million (10 billion yen) each to run. As <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2020/08/03/business/corporate-business/yahoo-japan-line-to-postpone-merger-pandemic/">Line and Yahoo! Japan consider a merger next spring</a>, these competing promotions may end up benefiting both companies.</p>

<p>Japanese media outlets have dubbed ongoing fights between payment apps as the “Cashless Sengoku Period,” a nod to Japan’s warring feudal era dating back to the 1400s. Some influencers take it upon themselves to chart the competing campaigns, like Twitter user <a href="https://twitter.com/haiji_doctor">Haiji Hakase</a>, who is known for his rewards chart featuring color-coded breakdowns of the 12 major payment services and what they’ll be offering over the next few days. “The best deals have changed so rapidly as poikatsu booms. It’s fun to find the best solutions amid the moving targets,” he said.</p>



<p>Yuzuhiko, a 31-year-old office worker in the southwestern city of Fukuoka, who asked to use only his first name, posts poikatsu vlogs on his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgIUiYo9N8nmubnLNV6DBzA/">YouTube channel</a> three times a week. In his videos, he explains the latest digital payment trends while speaking through a 3D-animated avatar of a brown tabby cat in a samurai helmet. “I am the only ‘cashless VTuber,’” he said, referring to “<a href="https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181002-the-virtual-vloggers-taking-over-youtube">virtual YouTubers</a>” who use computer-generated avatars, a popular genre in Japan.</p>



<p>Yuzuhiko said he’s noticed a big bump in video views this year. In October 2019, <a href="https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2019/09/01/business/tax-rebate-small-retailers-cashless-payments/">a government rebate program</a> began awarding 5% back on some cashless payments, in an effort to boost adoption before the since-postponed 2020 Olympics. The increased popularity may also be due to Covid-19. “Because the pandemic brought financial difficulties to some households, now they might care more about making the most of the available point services,” Yuzuhiko said.</p>



<p>It’s not clear how long the boon in poikatsu content will last. The incentives offered by companies like Line and PayPay are designed to lure new users and could be discontinued once the companies establish a core base of customers. “Now might be the fad season for poikatsu,” said Chuken, “but I’m not sure if this trend will still be around in four to five years.”</p>

                <p>According to CBI Insights, “running out of money” is the second of the <a href="https://www.cbinsights.com/research/startup-failure-reasons-top/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">top 20 reasons why businesses fail</a>. It’s not the only money-related issue. Pricing and cost issues, lack of a business model, and poor marketing intersect with monetization, too. Though monetization potential is very important, distribution is even more important!</p>
<p>A quick note, that the #1 reason, “no market need” is largely addressed by sticking to a <a href="https://perceptionbox.io/business/software-outsourcing-to-boost-startups-and-mvps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Minimum Viable Product</a> (MVP) development process. The MVP process focuses on asking the tough questions first. Do customers love your product? Will they buy it? How much will they pay for it? These focus on finding a great product-market fit which also means creating a competitive product.</p>
<p>Distribution methods play a very important part in your software’s monetization potential.<br>
As <a href="https://www.smaato.com/blog/android-vs-ios-app-monetization/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Smaato</a> points out, “iPhone users spend on average over <a href="https://blog.soomla.com/2019/01/app-monetization-android-vs-ios.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$30 per online transaction</a>, compared to an average of $10 that Android users spend.” So, in all cases, you want to do your marketing research. Some of us on the marketing side have heard from tech companies that “They don’t need marketing.” With few exceptions – companies taking that stance either don’t last long or get bought out.</p>

                <p>Say, you’re in the breakfast cereal business. If you get your product in Walmart and Kroger, you’ve done well. Do you stop there? No. There’s still Albertsons, Safeway, HEB, 7-11s, corner stores, restaurants, and hotel chains. But, you have to prove to each that your product is worthy of their shelf space. If your product has a $10 price tag, distributors and retailers will take at least half as their share. You have to cover the warehousing, cost of promotions, and damages.</p>
<p>Many mobile app developers place their apps on Google Play and the App Store and call their distribution efforts “done.” For a very lucky minority, this can work. Even so, it’s by no means optimal and it’s one reason (of many) why so many mobile apps never made money. For one thing, it’s super freakin’ lazy – to be polite about it.</p>
<ul>
<li>If your app meets store guidelines – you’re basically guaranteed “shelf-space.”</li>
<li>It takes, at most, two hours to set up a new app on independent app stores.</li>
<li>No warehousing, no shipping costs for downloads, no damages.</li>
<li>No expensive promotional displays.</li>
<li>Most online stores take just 30% of sales.</li>
</ul>
<p>Granted no independent app stores have nearly the traffic as the Big Two. However, that fact alone also makes it easier to get exposure on them and be a big fish in a small pond.</p>
<p>Your team has spent months developing a software project. It’s worth the effort to have one person spend a few days expanding its distribution channels. Each is a “point of presence” – and helps to develop branding a la McDonald’s or Starbucks. Overall, it costs the same to develop a software product whether it is ultimately delivered to one or one million people. The goal, as with any product, is to get it into the hands of as many customers as inexpensively as possible.</p>

                <p>With the Internet, packaged software is the oddball as it incurs the extra cost and effort of developing <a href="https://site.handshake.com/blog/how-to-wholesale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">brick-n-mortar retail distribution</a> channels. But, it is possible to forego the packaged distribution effort and simply make the hard copy materials a purchase option. Desktop titles typically include a DVD for installation and a user manual. Gaming companies often have collector editions adding maps, art books, and assorted game paraphernalia. Basic options typically incur a $10-20 surcharge on the price of the electronic version. Premium options can add $20 to $80, or more, to the cost.</p>
<p>Companies like Microsoft, Apple, Sony, and Electronic Arts, among others, have the economy of scale and distribution channels to get good mileage from packaged software. Other companies should validate every packaged software aspect with their user-base before jumping into it. Startups are likely better off avoiding packaged software unless there’s active end-user demand.</p>
<p>Demand can be evaluated via crowdfunding campaigns starting off with a small, first-run packaged edition. Additional options can be opened if funding benchmarks are reached. Alternatively, if sales of electronic versions go well, you can always expand your packaged options later. Nevertheless, any effort in selling or developing distribution channels for packaged software involves a very significant physical effort.

                <p>Exponentially easier to develop and manage if only because you don’t have to worry about inventory or physical distribution efforts. If you have a software product, a website, and a Paypal account, you could be in business today! Retail shelf space isn’t an issue either. As long as your software meets store policies you should have no problems getting on most online (non-brand specific) software or app stores.</p>
<p>Another advantage is that most online stores only take a 30% commission. Both the App Store and Google Play reduce their commissions on subscription-based apps to 15% after one year. If you are selling internationally, for best effect you should pro-rate your cover price to accommodate purchasing power parity with different countries.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, top-shelf software and brand names do best with premium sales. Their core advantage applies via the marketing and advertising dollars they can throw at promoting their products. Their advantage is magnified by promoting new releases across the user-base of all of their other products. With different product strategies, premium software can employ most other monetization options except in-app advertising.</p>

    <p>We humans are social beings; we need to be around others, share our time and stories and gossip, the warmth of physical contact, and the display and feeling of love. It's in our nature. Since the internet's appearance, we've tried to fulfill this need with virtual calls, meetings, and gatherings—which render extremely useful in professional settings but don't suffice in our personal lives. We communicate in shallow ways via social media and instant messaging and connect more deeply through audio and video calls. Yet, all of this is insufficient for our well-being, and we often get a false sense of connection.</p>
<p>The big tech companies are working on immersive virtual and augmented realities to shorten the gap between the experience of in-person meetings and their virtual equivalents. Facebook Horizon lets you 'explore and create' collaboratively with virtual avatars. Apple—reportedly engineering a pair of augmented reality glasses, a headset along the lines of Google Glass and Microsoft HoloLens—is preparing to release augmented reality from the limitations of smartphones and tablets.
In these environments,
astonishing visuals would make participants believe they're in the same room,
haptic feedback would fool their bodies into thinking they're touching objects,
and brain waves could help them hallucinate the rest, ala Black Mirror.</p>
<p>If it were to reduce the risk of infecting ourselves and our loved ones during this (and future) pandemics while meeting our psychological and social needs, this scenario doesn't sound bad at all.</p>
<p>For now, nothing beats sitting together and holding each others' hands, even if wearing a face mask. But, of course, this isn't always a possibility.</p>
<p>As these immersive technologies improve, we'll rely on them more and more, replacing long-distance travel, hazardous physical interactions, and face masks with virtual gatherings and wearables.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, here's a reminder to myself: Protect what you have by being mindful and patient; better times lie ahead.</p>

  </p>

  <p>
    If you've ever managed any software project, you've probably asked
    yourself: how could our teams move faster? How fast are we moving today?
  </p>

  <p>
    For these kinds of questions, it's tempting to turn to metrics. After all,
    we use metrics routinely and successfully when we develop software. There's
    performance, production load, and uptime metrics. There are also metrics
    based on customer behavior, like conversion and retention. These metrics
    don't just provide visibility. More importantly, they create a feedback
    loop. We can make a change that is intended to improve something, and use
    metrics to see how much improvement there really was. Developer wisdom says
    that every software performance optimization must start with a measure,
    which makes perfect sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    Since metrics are so helpful, can't we apply them to software development
    speed? As better development processes should improve development output,
    maybe output metrics could measure whether processes really improved. So
    then, what metrics could we use?
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="we-dont-have-any-good-metrics-for-that">
    <a href="#we-dont-have-any-good-metrics-for-that">We don't have any good metrics for that</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Development speed is the amount of work produced per unit of time, so we
    need to measure both output and time. Measuring time is simple, no problem
    there. What about work output? Attempts to measure it are as old as
    software itself. Through the years one thing's held true: whenever we
    decide a metric measures work output, something unintended soon follows.
    Consider the following examples:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Lines of code</b> - Probably the oldest one. Almost no one takes it
      seriously today. Counting code lines just makes the code bloated and the
      developers focus on the simplest task possible;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of commits</b> - encourages developers to break up their commits
      into many parts. Once again, the focus is on the simplest tasks and
      refactorings. Complex problems are avoided;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of tasks completed</b> - leads to tasks being split into subtasks.
      Every problem, even minor, is submitted as a task. Also adds an incentive
      to cut corners to complete tasks as fast as possible;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>No. of bugs, or percentage of bugs</b> - not a metric of work output,
      but work quality. Discourages developers from making changes, and makes
      them reluctant to report bugs that they found themselves;
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Man-hours or storypoints</b> - when estimates form the basis for how
      team performance is measured, it's easy to guess what comes next —
      inflated estimates;
    </li>
    <li>... and so on.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Developers are smart. They specialize in cracking complex problems. For any
    metric you give them, they'll find the easiest way to improve on it. This
    way most likely won't correlate with work quality or desired project
    outcome. This doesn't necessarily mean that developers will game them. I'd
    say it depends on the context and how strong the incentives are. But one
    thing is certain - developers will realize that the measure of their
    productivity is disconnected from what matters. This is not only
    frustrating. It also distracts them from doing the real work.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="but-why">
    <a href="#but-why">But why?</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    Why do metrics work so well for software products, and not for measuring
    developer output? Is it some kind of developer conspiracy? Actually, if you
    look outside of software development, you'll find more examples where
    metrics work well, and where they don't.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Where metrics work well:</b> manufacturing and sales. Let's take the
    manufacture and sale of cups. You can measure production output, i.e. no.
    of cups produced per unit of time, and production quality — percentage of
    cups that failed to pass quality control. On the sales side, you can
    measure sales volume and profit margin. These metrics are really helpful
    for management. For example, the goal for the manufacturing department can
    be to improve the percentage of cups that successfully pass quality control,
    while keeping unit costs low. The head of sales can aim to increase sales
    volume or improve profit margins. Improvements in these metrics are good
    for business, so we can also treat them as a measure of efficiency of
    corresponding departments.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b>Where metrics don't work:</b> measuring scientific output. Scientists
    publish their research in articles. Now science also has some metrics that
    measure work output and quality: no. of articles published, no. of
    citations, statistical significance of the results. Can we say that a
    scientist who published 10 articles has produced twice as much value as a
    scientist who published 5? Unlikely. Works differ too much in their value.
    Even without numbers, it's often hard to say which work is more valuable.
    Because "hacking" one's number of publications  and citations is a
    well-known problem in the scientific community, they're not considered
    reliable indicators of work productivity. Statistical significance has its
    own issues too -
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=42QuXLucH3Q" target="_blank">
      p-hacking is a wide-spread problem</a>.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="two-key-criteria">
    <a href="#two-key-criteria">Two key criteria</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    In any context, metrics that work well share two important criteria:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      They relate directly to value;
    </li>
    <li>
      These values are consistent, i.e. in countable quantities of
      interchangeable units.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Let's take a look at the examples above:
  </p>

  <p>
    Metrics in manufacturing and sales satisfy both criteria. In cups
    manufacturing, value is represented in cups. Since it's mass produced,
    cups are identical. In sales, value is measured in dollars. The business
    goal is to make money, so money's relationship with business value is as
    direct as possible. As one dollar is equal to any other, metrics based on
    money measure consistent values.
  </p>

  <p>
    In science, these criteria aren't satisfied. We can't find a metric that
    would measure the value of scientific results directly. We have only
    indirect metrics, like no. of articles and citations, which can be hacked.
    In any case, these metrics aren't consistent either, because all
    publications are not made of interchangeable units.
  </p>

  
  <h2 id="developer-metrics-fail-both-criteria">
    <a href="#developer-metrics-fail-both-criteria">Developer metrics fail both criteria</a>
  </h2>


  <p>
    What do we have to measure developer output? Lines of code, no. of commits,
    no. of tasks completed, man-hours, storypoints… Considering these metrics
    against the two key criteria above, you'll find that:
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      None of them relate directly to value. We don't ship our customers lines
      of code, man-hours, or storypoints. They don't care how many commits we
      made or how many tasks we completed;
    </li>
    <li>
      All these measurements are inconsistent. One commit is not equal to
      another, one line of code is not as valuable as the other line, all tasks
      are also different, and man-hours and storypoints are based on estimates,
      which are by definition inaccurate.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    It's no surprise that none of these metrics work well.
  </p>

  <p>
    Why don't we have metrics for developers that would relate directly to
    value? For the same reason we don't have any for scientists. Developers,
    just like scientists, always create something new. They don't write the
    same code again and again — that wouldn't make sense. Code can be re-used
    in a variety of ways — you can either extract it to a module or a library,
    or, as a last resort, just copy and paste it. Every developers' workday is
    unique. Even if they solve similar problems, they solve them in a different
    context, or a new way, each time.

  </h2>


  <p>
    Of course, no one today seriously talks about measuring developers' output
    in lines of code. There should be something more modern, right?
  </p>

  <p>
    The book <i>Accelerate</i> from 2018 presents research on 2000
    organizations of different sizes. The research goal was to identify which
    metrics would differentiate high performers from low. Here's what they
    found:

    </sup>
  </p>

  <p>
    We can see four metrics here. Let's see how these metrics relate to value,
    and whether they're consistent:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <b>Deployment frequency</b> - I can see why it's listed here. The more
      frequently you ship to production, the more reliable the shipping process
      becomes. Productive teams tend to ship code more frequently. However,
      correlation doesn't imply causation. It's not directly related to
      customer value. People want a product that satisfies their needs, not a
      product that changes as frequently as possible. The metric is also
      inconsistent, because one change shipped to production is not equal to
      another.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Lead time</b> - the time for satisfying customer requests. This one
      relates more closely to value, because we're talking about the changes
      customers have asked for. However, it's not a metric with consistent
      units, because requests are not equal to each other. Some might be
      simple, and …</li></ul></div></div></div>

legend, Photoshop was presented (and rejected!) for marketing consideration back 
in the mists of time by Deluxe Paint's last producer at

(5/11 Update - Hal wrote in to say that the man involved was most likely Stewart 
Bonn, DPaint's first producer. Having known Stewart Bonn, I asked 
for (and eventually received) some more details but I'm not sure I'm ready to 
call this story gospel yet.)</p>
<p><i>(The following is a response I made in a <a href="http://forums.about.com/n/mb/message.asp?webtag=ab-graphicssoft&amp;msg=753.7">thread</a>
on about.com in response to users asking "Whatever happened to Deluxe Paint?" 
I'm not sure where you can grab it today - the pre-AGA version used to be available 
for free download at <a href="http://amiga.emucamp.com/top10.htm">http://amiga.emucamp.com/top10.htm</a> 
which at the time claimed sole EAUK permission and hosting rights.)</i></p>
<p>I was the co-developer of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Paint">Deluxe Paint</a> from version 4.1 on, along with Lee Ozer. Some people have been wondering whatever happened to the product series,
so here's a little background.</p>
<p>EA was going through a big transition from 1992 on, attempting some things
that never materialized (creating standup arcade games), some things that only
partially materialized (edutainment software, ala the Learning Company) and the
franchise-centric EA Sports brand, which was just two guys at the time
negotiating with sports agents. Deluxe Paint was part of the now-defunct 
Tools (formerly Creativity) division, which created everything that wasn't a game: Deluxe Paint, Deluxe
Video, Deluxe Music, Deluxe Animation, the Studio/8 and Studio/32 line of Mac
products, and others.</p>
<p>Deluxe Paint was one of the most profitable releases in EA history at that
point, but was already becoming eclipsed by the much more profitable cartridge
divisions selling titles for the Sega Genesis, etc. In fact, the home game
consoles were so strong that most of the company was being focused in that area,
with only reluctant support for CD-ROM products on PC's and Macs. By the time
the first EA Sports titles hit the shelves, it was pretty clear that the company
wasn't interested in PC applications anymore, and killed off the entire 
Tools
division. Deluxe Music 2 (done out-of-house by David Joiner) and Deluxe Paint V were the last applications to ship,
and we were racing the clock to get DPaintV out the door before Commodore went
bankrupt. It was a positively hellish time for morale, and both Lee and I left
the company soon after that release.</p>
<p>Dan Silva had already moved on to Autodesk after the first three versions of
Deluxe Paint. Lee had gotten her start at EA working with Dan on the port of
DPaint III that became Brent Iverson's
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deluxe_Paint_Animation">Deluxe Paint Animation</a> on the PC. Chris Mayer, a former
PC video card device driver engineer, maintained the IBM version of DPaint while 
I was there. (For the record the IBM and Apple II gs ports were also done by Brent 
Iverson, with Steve Shaw doing II 
Enhanced for the PC along with a bit of DPaint 4 &amp; DPA.)
Chuck Swan of Trimedia, Inc. (creator of the Amiga pressure-sensitive tablet
driver) consulted with us on pressure support and ARexx for DPaintV.</p>
<p><i>By the way: If anybody has made pressure support work on an Amiga
emulator, I'd like to know! Send me an email (address 
below.)</i></p>
<p>Deluxe Paint 4.5/4.6 AGA was the last shining moment for DPaint, as it not
only sold tons of copies (many to Commodore for bundling with the A1200) it was
also efficient and stable, being the most bug-free release in the entire DPaint
series.</p>
<p>DPaintV was much delayed by the fact that we were waiting for Commodore's RTG
(ReTargetable Graphics) solution to arrive for native 24-bit support and were
let down. The whole product had already been rewritten for 24-bit, but with EA 
being reluctant
to support 3rd-party cards (like Picasso, etc) - we just hoped
that C= would be ready for us by the time we were ready for them. Didn't happen.
Actually, a lot of things never happened; when I came on board, the company had
just given up on trying to turn DPaint a 3-D program, and my own Flash-like
video timeline editor (complete with audio and software music synthesizer!) was
deemed too advanced for the technology at the time.</p>
<p>Releasing DPaintV became a very low priority for EA upon the collapse of
Commodore, with Manufacturing bumping it out of the '94 Xmas release slot and into
the following year. It <i>was</i> released however with the help of EA UK, who
as our most important internal sponsor has been selling and licensing the
product through various third parties in Europe ever since.</p>
<p>Something overlooked in DPaintV is the Player. In prior versions
this was just a chopped-up scaled down version of DPaint that was made freely
redistributable so anyone could play ANIM files. But in DPaintV, I rewrote the
Player from scratch to support full-screen streaming off the hard drive and the thing just burns. 
(Remember, this was the era when Macs were animating postage stamps and calling 
it "Desktop Video." There was never a more efficient
animator on the Amiga, and it supported ARexx too.</p>
<p>Well, that's it. It was a very hard time in those end days watching Commodore
go under, and we only had a few weeks' warning ahead of the rest of the Amiga
community. Such is life.</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><h2 id="whats-in-this-post">What’s in this post?</h2><p>Enough about the insides of Postgres indexes to impress your coworkers at the coffee machine or recruiters at a job interview 🤓.</p><p>We’ll have a look at B-Tree, Hash, GIN, GiST, BRIN indexes and focus on demystifying them.</p><h2 id="why-the-hell-do-i-even-need-an-index">Why the hell do I even need an index?</h2><p>Indexes are at the core of any querying in relational databases (the classic SQL databases like Postgres or MySQL). Therefore it is very rewarding and important to have an idea of how they work.</p><p>An illustration is worth a thousand words so let’s take an example. Let’s say we have a <code>user</code> table containing 1M million entries (or rows):</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>user</span> (
  id   SERIAL <span>PRIMARY</span> <span>KEY</span>,
  name TEXT,
  age  INTEGER
);
</code></pre></div><p>We want to know how many of our users are above 30. We run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>Without any extra index, the database would have to go over the 1M entries one by one, look at their age and increment a counter for all the users above 30:</p><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/scan.png" alt="scan"></p><p>If it feels like an inefficient way of getting the result it’s because it is 💁‍♀️. It would be a slow query (called a “full table scan”, as every row needs to be scanned).</p><p>That’s where indexation comes into play. It will allow us to quickly locate the users we’re interested in, without having to lookup all the rows.</p><p>In Postgres, there are 5 types of indexes:</p><ul><li>B-Trees</li><li>Hashes</li><li>GINs</li><li>GiSTs</li><li>BRINs</li></ul><h2 id="before-we-start">Before we start</h2><h3 id="naming">Naming</h3><ul><li><strong>Row</strong>: An entry in the database (e.g. a user). Also called tuple.</li><li><strong>Column</strong>: An attribute of a row (e.g. the first name of a user).</li><li><strong>Table</strong>: A collection of rows (e.g. a user table).</li><li><strong>TID</strong>: Tuple ID. It’s an internal Postgres ID. It describes where to find the row on the disk.</li><li><strong>Operator</strong>: Reserved keyword representing operations on data (e.g. <code>AND</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>=</code>).</li><li><strong>Statement</strong>: Database operation (e.g. <code>CREATE TABLE user (name TEXT);</code>).</li><li><strong>Query</strong>: Statement that returns data (e.g. <code>SELECT * FROM user;</code>)</li></ul><h3 id="core-assumptions">Core assumptions</h3><ul><li>In general, an index needs to be able to fit in RAM to be fully efficient. That’s why having very large indexes can be problematic.</li><li>Fetching the row behind a <code>tid</code> is easy and relatively cheap to do. We consider it roughly equivalent to getting an element from an array by index (e.g. <code>var a = array[i]</code>).</li><li>We’ll only talk about read operations (queries). How to propagate writes to indexes is a whole other story.</li><li>Everything is more complex and complicated in real life, this post tries to explain things on a very high level and may be approximate on some parts. For more details, one should have a look at the <code>Further explanation</code> links.</li></ul><h2 id="b-tree-indexes">B-Tree indexes</h2><h3 id="usecase">Usecase</h3><p>So we want to index this query. We want to make it faster:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>We create a B-Tree index on the <code>age</code> column.</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age);
</code></pre></div><p>No need to specify anything, B-Tree is the default index for Postgres and many other databases including MySQL, Oracle or SQL Server.</p><h3 id="how-does-it-work">How does it work</h3><p>A binary search tree (<strong>different from a B-Tree</strong>) is a well known data structure where every node of the tree has two children nodes. The values of the left and right children being respectively smaller and larger than their parent’s value.</p><p>A B-Tree is a generalised binary search tree where every node can have more than two children.</p><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/tree_comparison.png" alt="tree comparison"></p><p>A very helpful property of these trees is that their values are sorted. It makes it easy to lookup values. Exactly what we need to speed up our query!</p><p>Now a B-Tree index is slightly more than just a B-Tree. It is a linked list of tids, sorted by value and linked to a B-Tree.</p><p>Let’s run our query again and see how it looks like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>&gt;</span> <span>30</span>;
</code></pre></div><p><img src="https://fabien.herfray.org/images/mastering-postgres-indexes-in-10-minutes/btree.png" alt="btree"></p><p>That was much easier! By using the sorting of the tree nodes, we can now quickly find the first user being above 30 and count from there. Remember? The linked list at the bottom is sorted by age!</p><p>As a side note, you may be wondering about multicolumn indexes, like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age_and_height <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age, height_cm);
</code></pre></div><p>The simplest way to visualize it is to imagine it as being roughly equivalent to a monocolumn index like:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>CREATE</span> <span>INDEX</span> user_by_age_and_height <span>ON</span> <span>user</span> (age<span>+</span><span>'-'</span><span>+</span>height_cm);
</code></pre></div><p>The B-Tree mechanism stays the same, but the values that are being sorted are now for example <code>28-182</code>.</p><p>This explains why the index wouldn’t help with trying to run:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> height_cm <span>&gt;</span> <span>160</span>;
</code></pre></div><p>In the tree, values like <code>28-182</code> are not sorted by height. They are sorted by age, and then for every individual age they are sorted by height.</p><p>On the other hand, the index would help us with this query:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>SELECT</span> <span>COUNT</span>(<span>*</span>) <span>FROM</span> <span>user</span> <span>WHERE</span> age <span>=</span> <span>30</span> <span>AND</span> height_cm <span>&gt;</span> <span>160</span>;
</code></pre></div><h3 id="tldr-too-long-didnt-read">TLDR (Too Long Didn’t Read)</h3><ul><li>B-Tree is the default index in many databases.</li><li>Is it so popular because it’s fast, efficient and flexible.</li><li>It makes operations like <code>=</code>, <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, <code>ORDER BY</code> or even <code>LIKE</code> faster.</li><li>A rule of thumb would be: if you need to speed up the above operations, use a B-Tree index unless there is a specific reason not to.</li></ul><h3 id="further-explanation">Further explanation</h3><ul><li><a href="https://www.qwertee.io/blog/postgresql-b-tree-index-explained-part-1/">https://www.qwertee.io/blog/postgresql-b-tree-index-explained-part-1/</a></li><li><a href="https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/443284">https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/443284</a></li></ul><h2 id="hash-indexes">Hash indexes</h2><h3 id="usecase-1">Usecase</h3><p>We’re only querying using the <code>=</code> operator and we’re having very specific scaling/performance issues (e.g. our table is huge and a B-Tree would be too large to fit in memory).

In particular they were not recorded in the write-ahead log so they could not be recovered after a failure/incident.</li><li>They only index the <code>=</code> operator and also don’t help with sorting. They’re not very flexible and for <code>=</code>, the B-Tree does the job very well too.</li></ul></li><li>So why should you use a hash index? Probably you shouldn’t. But they are smaller in size and can be faster than B-Trees so they can be useful under certain conditions. The read time being constant (<code>O(1)</code> vs <code>O(log n)</code> for B-Trees), they could for example benefit us for a high throughput of lookups by ID on a huge table.</li></ul><h3 id="further-explanation-1">Further explanation</h3><ul><li><a href="https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/442776">https://habr.com/en/company/postgrespro/blog/442776</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/@jorsol/postgresql-10-features-hash-indexes-484f319db281">https://medium.com/@jorsol/postgresql-10-features-hash-indexes-484f319db281</a></li></ul><h2 id="gin-generalized-inverted-index">GIN (Generalized Inverted Index)</h2><h3 id="usecase-2">Usecase</h3><p>GIN indexes are mostly useful for indexing multi-valued columns (e.g. arrays, full-text search).</p><p>Let’s add a <code>favorite_colors</code> column to our users:</p><div><pre><code data-lang="sql"><span>ALTER</span> <span>TABLE</span> <span>user</span> <span>ADD</span> <span>COLUMN</span> favorite_colors TEXT[];

I get hundreds of them every day, and for the most part, they suck. &nbsp;But they don't have to. After all, a customer is a prospect you just haven't met, and every customer has to find about you somehow.</p><div><p>Since <a href="https://cloutly.org/">Cloutly</a> was a bootstrapped/self-funded startup, we didn't have the luxury of experimenting with paid ads initially; not just from a costs perspective, but from a development perspective as well. Our first few customers would give us huge insight into our shortcomings, and while yes, we might have won some business from paid ads, it would have hurt twice as bad if we'd paid for them just to churn due to a bug or feature gap. With so many unknowns, we started with the things that didn't scale: cold outreach and high-touch outbound sales.</p><p>That required mastering... the cold email. </p><p>And as you've guessed, it went well! Lemlist did a write-up on <a href="https://www.lemlist.com/lotw/lachlan-fea">the very campaign</a> I'm about to walk you through, but in this blog, I'm going to delve a little deeper and dissect why it worked, what exactly went into the entire process - from building the list, to the exact cold email templates I used - and how you might replicate the results for your campaigns.</p></div><figure><img src="https://cloutly.org/blog/content/images/2020/12/FeaturedonLemlist.png" alt="" srcset="https://cloutly.org/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/FeaturedonLemlist.png 600w, https://cloutly.org/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/FeaturedonLemlist.png 1000w, https://cloutly.org/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/FeaturedonLemlist.png 1600w, https://cloutly.org/blog/content/images/2020/12/FeaturedonLemlist.png 2000w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Featured on Lemlist for this high performing cold email campaign</figcaption></figure><h3 id="does-cold-email-actually-work"><br>Does cold email actually work?</h3><div><p>Yes, yes it does.</p><p>Firstly, there's an important shift that you, as the marketer or salesperson, need to understand. That is: the purpose of cold email is not to sell, it's to prospect. But with great power, comes great responsibility and before we dissect the cold email templates that won for us, let's start with the Laws of Cold Email.</p><p>Law #1 - you shall not spam.<br>Law #2 - your list shall be clean.<br>Law #3 - your ask shall be small.<br>Law #4 - your value shall be great.</p><p>Who cares, right? Well, if you're about to pull the trigger on a mass cold email to 100,000 people, <strong>stop</strong>. Not only is this going to hurt your brand (and your email sender reputation), but - there's an old adage in advertising - when you speak to everyone, you speak to no-one. Everyone is not your customer.</p></div><h3 id="how-our-campaign-got-94-opens-and-42-replies">How our campaign got 94% opens and 42% replies</h3><div><p>Since Cloutly was a martech tool, our launch strategy was to get it in the hands of marketers who deeply understood the problem we solved, who could see and communicate that value to their team very quickly.</p><p>Our target prospect for our first cold email campaign: marketing agencies who might use Cloutly as a tool for their client campaigns to <a href="https://cloutly.org/blog/asking-for-a-review-template/">get more reviews</a> and win sales using social proof.</p><p>I cold emailed 122 marketing agencies in Australia and here's what happened:</p><p>- 94% open rate<br>- 42% reply rate<br>- 30+ meetings booked<br>~$60 spent on software and contractors</p><p>Let's walk through it, step-by-step.</p></div><h3 id="list-of-tools-we-used"><br>List of tools we used</h3><p>- <a href="https://linkedin.com/">LinkedIn</a> ($0 - for finding leads.

Building the cold email list</h3><div><p>I used LinkedIn to identify our ideal leads and then copied their profile URLs into an Excel spreadsheet.</p><p>I paid a freelancer on UpWork $0.20 per lead to enrich my spreadsheet with all the other data I'd need, including: First Name, Last Name, Email, Company, Website.</p></div><h3 id="2-enriching-the-list-and-adding-real-personalisation-icebreakers-"><br>2. Enriching the list and adding real personalisation (icebreakers)</h3><div><p>I added a new column called "Icebreaker" and then went through one-by-one to add a personalised introductory sentence to each row. Yep, that's right. Roll your sleeves up. This involved opening each company's website, LinkedIn, looking through recent media, socials etc. and genuinely doing my homework. Each row took me roughly 8-12 minutes on average to create a compelling opener.</p><p>I knew we had good leads because I'd picked them myself. Freelance lead generators can be a bit hit or miss, so do as much as you can yourself to ensure you're on target and not wasting your time (and your leads' time).</p></div><figure><img src="https://cloutly.org/blog/content/images/2020/12/Icebreaker.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://cloutly.org/blog/content/images/size/w600/2020/12/Icebreaker.jpg 600w, https://cloutly.org/blog/content/images/size/w1000/2020/12/Icebreaker.jpg 1000w, https://cloutly.org/blog/content/images/size/w1600/2020/12/Icebreaker.jpg 1600w, https://cloutly.org/blog/content/images/2020/12/Icebreaker.jpg 2346w" sizes="(min-width: 720px) 720px"><figcaption>Enrich your leads list with real personalisation</figcaption></figure><p>Here's an example of an icebreaker that did well:</p><blockquote>Major Sin City vibes from your site.

This creates intrigue.<br></p><blockquote>Think TrustPilot, Google, TripAdvisor, Facebook reviews etc all rolled into the one dashboard.

We show them what's in it for them, not what's in it for us.</p><p><strong>Desire:</strong></p></div><blockquote>Partnered with AGENCY 1 and AGENCY 2 recently. Would love for you to check it out, too.</blockquote><div><p>Cloutly is a platform built to leverage social proof, and in this line, we identify other agencies - in the same space as our target prospect - who we've worked with, to provide credibility.</p><p><strong>Action:</strong></p></div><blockquote>Can I send through some more info?</blockquote><p>This has worked very well for us and harkens back to our 3rd Law of Cold Email: your ask shall be small. The goal of cold outreach is not to drive a sale, but to identify a prospect. Many marketers and salespeople make the mistake of asking for too much, too soon. In our email, we only ask <strong>permission</strong> to send more information. </p><div><p>This achieves three things: </p><p>1. It actually gets people to reply to our emails (which is important for sender reputation).<br>2. It identifies people as prospects.<br>3. It provides a low-friction next-step.</p><p>Most people don't want to jump on a call straight away, so by adding this softer opt-in, it allows us to move them through marketing qualification with permission.</p></div><p><strong>Step 2: The Bump (3 days later)</strong></p><div><p>Personal preference; some don't like the idea of this, but it's worked for us.</p><p>Subject: Empty (same as previous step)</p></div><blockquote>Hey {{firstName}},<p>I'm sure you're busy.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-id="3f5a1f3" data-element_type="widget" data-widget_type="theme-post-content.default"><div><p>It can be tough when writing an email. Your end goal is to get your message across. Therefore, this blog post is going to show you how to professionally end an email, making look professional, and creating a good impression of you.</p><p>Don’t forget people not only form an impression of you, but also about your business. Creating an amazing impression could mean more business opportunities.</p><p>So it can be critical to learn how to end an email professionally.</p><p>In addition, if the end of your email doesn’t give the impression that you are professional and you know what you are doing. It could annoy the people who receive your emails.</p><p>You don’t want to annoy, rattle, or downright offend anyone you are emailing. So you need to learn the best practices to profession end an email.</p><p>That’s what this blog is about. Helping you end an email using the right words.</p><h2>Four Ways To Professionally End An Email</h2><p>I’ll start by running through four different scenarios.</p><p>In each scenario, you should end your professionally written emails differently.</p><h3>Asking For Feedback</h3><p>The key to asking for feedback is to present an “attitude of gratitude”.</p><p>Studies have shown being grateful for something another person has done for you, helps you build strong and long-lasting relationships.</p><p>It also shows you in a good light, people will think good things about you.</p><p>You can use this to your advantage when trying to get a bit of feedback from one of the recipients.</p><p>For example you could end with something like:</p><p>“I appreciate your help in resolving this matter”</p><p>“Thanks in advance for your time”.</p><p>“Looking forward to hearing from you”</p><p>“Thank you for your time. Let me know whether we can meet up for a coffee.”</p><p>My personal favorite and how I end a lot of my emails in these sorts of situations is.</p><p>“Thank you for your time and for reading this far/reading this email”</p><p>I learned this ending from <a href="https://tim.blog/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Ferriss</a>. I love it, as it doesn’t ask too much from the recipient. Sometimes ending with “I look forward to hearing from you”, implies you expect a reply.</p><p>By using this ending, it shows thanks and appreciation toward the recipients for both their time and for reading your email.</p><p>Therefore, painting you in a good light, which is what we are aiming for.</p><p>However, what if someone takes an age to reply back to your email? If needed, you could send them a little reminder.</p><p>You could use Outflash’s <a href="https://outflash.xyz/email-tracking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email tracking</a> to see if someone has opened and clicked your email. Allowing you to set a reminder to follow up with someone, that you know has read your email.</p><h3>Build A New Relationship</h3><p>You have a new lead. Or you have met someone at a <a href="https://www.meetup.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meet Up</a> event and you want to build up a relationship to promote yourself and your business.</p><p>A good way to start is by showing them that you care. End your emails with things like.</p><p>“Keep fighting the good fight”.</p><p>“Stay awesome”.</p><p>Another way, which I prefer is offering something that brings them value and supports them in what they are trying to achieve.</p><p>For example</p><p>“P.S. Here is [your offer/something of use] you might find interesting”</p><p>Link to something like a blog post, YouTube video. Or some other premium content like and eBook or info graphic.</p><p>This shows the recipient that you care and are willing to help them out. Without necessarily getting something upfront in return.</p><h3>“Lets Meet For A Coffee”</h3><p>Let’s say you work for <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a> as a sales professional and are chatting with a potential new client about our <a href="https://outflash.xyz/email-scheduling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">email scheduling</a> and <a href="https://outflash.xyz/mail-merge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">easy mail merge </a>functionality.</p><p>The new lead agrees to meet with you for a coffee and discuss how <a href="https://outflash.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Outflash</a> can benefit them.</p><p>This is a great opportunity for you to end the email by pre-framing what you would like to discuss.</p><p>You can end you emails either by saying.</p><p>“Look forward to meeting you soon”</p><p>“Talk to you soon”</p><p>However, this is very generic. What I also like to add on to the end of the email is some information about the features I would like to discuss when we meet for a coffee.</p><p>For example</p><p>“I hope [link to some valuable information] will help you understand our tool a bit more.</p><p>This is a great way to direct the conversation before you even meet up. It shows you have thought about what you would like to discuss. So they don’t feel the coffee will be a waste of their time.</p><h3>Requesting A Meeting</h3><p>If you would like to meet a new client or potential lead. You have to find a way to get them on board with the idea.</p><p>After giving them lots of reasons why it would be a good idea for the meeting you can add:</p><p>“Eager to work around your schedule”</p><p>“Hoping for sometime in your calendar”</p><p>Remember, people value their time and don’t want to give it away for free.</p><p>You have to show them or provide them with some value to display to them that the meeting with be of benefit to them.</p><p>How can you do that?</p><p>The best way is to add a P.S that shows them what the meeting will be about and how much time it should take.</p><p>For example</p><p>“P.S. I promise a good ROI for your 30 minute meeting with me. You’ll walk away with [something of tangible value].</p><p>There are lots of way to do this. Remember you want to end the email in a way that prompts the recipient to take action in a way that you would like.</p><h2>Professionally End An Email – The Close</h2><p>Using the examples above. you will have ended your email with the correct wording that reflects the goal of your email.</p><p>Next, you should focus on how to professionally end the email.</p><p>It’s important to have all these points in the professional email closing. And they should be formatted in the right way.</p><p>1) Closing remark – ensure you include a comma after your closing remark. And then include space before going to the next element.</p><p>2) Signature – embed your digital signature here if you have one. Otherwise, leave it blank.</p><p>3) Leave a space, then type your full name.</p><p>4) Your title and the company you work for.</p><p>5) Contact information.</p><p>Now you have seen how to end an email professionally. Let’s review how to professionally end an email with a runthough.</p><h3>Example Of How to Professionally End An Email</h3><p>Here is an example email that at first glances looks like it is a well written email.</p><pre><code>Hi Steve,

I'd love to discuss your company's software development requirements with you. Here are a couple of time slots that works for me.

Tuesday at 3 PM
Thursday at 1 PM

Let me know if these time suit you, or if another day works better for you and I can check my schedule. My number is [BEST NUMBER TO REACH YOU].

Phil.</code></pre><p>If you compared this email against a lot of the online email checklists out there. It will pass as good, clear, and concise.</p><p>So, what is wrong with it?</p><p>Well, it forgot to include the elements that make an good, professional email ending.</p><p>– No close phrase, so it sounds a little casual, not professional</p><p>– The email was closed using only my first name. How many Phil’s could the recipient know?</p><p>– There is no signature that details any contact information.</p><p>– There is no call to action. What do you want them to ultimately do from your email?</p><p>It could be that this email is easily ignored and deleted. Making you lose potential new customers.</p><p>Let’s run through what we have discussed in this post and see how we can professionally end the email above.</p><pre><code>Hi Steve,

We discussed how important gratitude is in an email.</p><p>Just writing ‘thanks’ makes your gratitude feel like an after thought and can make you sound not thankful at all.</p><h4>‘Thanks again’</h4><p>It’s even worse than ‘Thanks’ doesn’t seem genuine to the recipient.</p><h4>‘TTYL’, ‘TAFN’</h4><p>Do I need to explain these ones?</p><p>These are just unprofessional and are a bit confusing.</p><h4>‘Best Wishes’</h4><p>This one isn’t to bad and is deemed as formal. It may be OK on an initial email.</p><p>However, people see this sign off as ‘stuffy’ and forced.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>A good ending to a professionally written email is as important as starting the email well.</p><p>It shows how professional you and your business are.</p><p>Also check out “<a href="https://outflash.xyz/email/professionally-start-an-email-the-dos-and-dont/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Professionally Start An Email</a>” which will show you how to start off your emails.</p><p>Email is a huge part of our day-to-day life and has become key in business and professional communication.</p><p>Becoming great at writing email isn’t that hard. You just need a framework and a bit of practice.</p><p>Use a bit of care and attention, just fire out the email. Who knows what could happen?</p><p>You may land that client, the amazing job, get that promotion you deserve. All because you crafted a professionally worded email.</p><p>So, go ahead and use the tips mentioned above and write that amazing email.</p><p>And don’t forget to comment on this post with some tips if you have mastered the art of emailing!</p></div></div></div>]]>

But the process is not always easy if you are used to working on Debian-like systems.<br>Today, we’ll see how to install it on a Raspberry Pi, to configure it and use it like almost like any other operating system.</p><p><strong>FreeBSD is an open-source operating system, available on Raspberry Pi since 2014. It’s a good solution for any usage (server or desktop)<br>It’s not based on Linux, as they develop their code for everything. Even if there are many similarities, it includes several differences, more or less visible.</strong><span data-ez-name="raspberrytips_com-medrectangle-3"></span></p><p><span data-ez-name="raspberrytips_com-medrectangle-4"></span>To help you as much as possible, I will start by an introduction to FreeBSD, then I’ll show you how to install it, and finally, everything you need to know to use it the way you want.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> <em>I’m not an expert in BSD systems. I’m a fan of Pfsense which is based on FreeBSD, but I never really used it beside that. The goal here is only to share with you my notes about this system.</em></p><h2><span id="FreeBSD_introduction"></span>FreeBSD introduction<span></span></h2><h3><span id="Presentation"></span>Presentation<span></span></h3><p><strong>FreeBSD is not a new system, far from that. The first release comes in 1993! (same year as Debian).<br></strong>The main goal is to offer a lightweight system, with critical part related to stability. So you can use it almost anywhere.</p><div><figure><img loading="lazy" width="500" height="183" src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSI1MDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMTgzIj48L3N2Zz4=" alt="" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" ezimgfmt="rs rscb30 src ng ngcb30 srcset" data-ezsrc="https://raspberrytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/freebsd-logo.jpg" data-ezsrcset="https://raspberrytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/freebsd-logo.jpg 500w,https://raspberrytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/freebsd-logo-300x110.jpg 300w"></figure></div><p>FreeBSD works on two branches :</p><ul><li><strong>STABLE</strong>: The main branch, each new major version is released from the STABLE branch (<strong>RELEASE</strong>)</li><li><strong>CURRENT</strong>: It’s the development branch, to get the latest improvements, but less speed and stability.</li></ul><div><div><div><p><a href="https://raspberrytips.com/master-raspberry-pi" target="_blank"><img src="data:image/svg+xml;base64,PHN2ZyB4bWxucz0iaHR0cDovL3d3dy53My5vcmcvMjAwMC9zdmciIHdpZHRoPSIzMDAiIGhlaWdodD0iMjczIj48L3N2Zz4=" ezimgfmt="rs rscb30 src ng ngcb30" data-ezsrc="https://raspberrytips.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/1603165223-300x273.jpg"></a></p><div><p><span>Master your Raspberry Pi in 30 days</span><br>From beginner to expert in Raspberry Pi.<br>Learn useful Linux skills and practice multiples projects with step-by-step guides.</p></div></div></div></div><h3><span id="Usage"></span>Usage<span></span></h3><p><strong>FreeBSD can be used in any situation. It’s fast, stable and secure</strong>. So it’s perfect for a Raspberry Pi, but also for a server or a desktop usage.<br>By the way, the FreeBSD FAQ is pretty clear about this:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Can FreeBSD replace my current operating system?<br></strong>For most people, yes.</p><cite><a href="https://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/introduction.html#:~:text=the%20FreeBSD%20Handbook.-,1.2.,any%20purpose%20without%20strings%20attached." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FreeBSD documentation</a></cite></blockquote><p>We’ll see in the next parts how to install it on your Raspberry Pi, but it’s also a solid system for your computer or on server.</p><p><strong>FreeBSD has been adopted by many companies over the world.<br></strong>I already told you about Pfsense, but other brands like IBM, Apple or Sony are using parts of the FreeBSD code (for example, the PlayStation 4 system is a fork from FreeBSD).<br>Some NAS operating systems are also based on FreeBSD (FreeNAS for example).</p><h3><span id="FreeBSD_vs_Linux"></span>FreeBSD vs Linux<span></span></h3><p>As I told you in introduction, <strong>FreeBSD is not a Linux-based system</strong>.<br>Systems on Linux, are all using the same kernel and basic drivers, and then add many applications to offer a specific solution at the end.</p><p><strong>FreeBSD don’t use this base, they develop and release everything, including the kernel and drivers.</strong><br>However, the differences while using it are minimal (I will show you the main ones).<br>But you may have some commands working differently on Linux and FreeBSD.</p><h3><span id="FreeBSD_strengths"></span>FreeBSD strengths<span></span></h3><p>So, why do I need to try FreeBSD if it’s almost the same thing?<br>As always when I test systems, the main goal here is to experiment, and see how it works. So you’ll get more details at the end.</p><p>But in theory, <strong><span data-ez-name="raspberrytips_com-large-leaderboard-2"></span>FreeBSD is a minimal system that should be faster, more secure and with less compatibility issues than most Linux systems</strong>.<br>We’ll see now if this is true for the Raspberry Pi version 🙂</p><h2><span id="Install_FreeBSD_on_Raspberry_Pi"></span>Install FreeBSD on Raspberry Pi<span></span></h2><p>In this part, we’ll see how to install a basic FreeBSD system on your Raspberry Pi.</p><h3><span id="Raspberry_Pi_4"></span>Raspberry Pi 4<span></span></h3><p>During writing this tutorial, <strong>the Raspberry Pi 4 is not yet supported on the RELEASE version</strong> (12.x). But it works on CURRENT version (13.x).</p><p>So, if you have a Raspberry Pi 4, consider taking the latest version available. Currently, the 13.x and above are the only working for Raspberry Pi 4.<br>Unfortunately, if t’s a CURRENT version, it’s a debug one, with less stability and performances issues. But for a test it’s ok.</p><p><span data-ez-name="raspberrytips_com-leader-1"></span>The other option is to use a custom firmware, <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://github.com/pftf/RPi4"

step-by-step course to get started on Raspberry Pi OS and complete your first projects.</p></div></div></div></div><h3><span id="Download"></span>Download<span></span></h3><p><strong>FreeBSD offers pre-built images for the ARM and ARM64 architecture.<br></strong>The ARM64 version is working fine on Pi 3B+ and 4, I didn’t test on other models.</p><p>Here is the general link to the FTP server: <a href="https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/snapshots/">https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/</a><br>Once here, you have two choices:</p><ul><li><strong>Download the RELEASE version:</strong><ul><li>Open the releases subfolder and go to <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/releases/ISO-IMAGES/" target="_blank">ISO-IMAGES</a>.</li><li>Select the version you want to install (12.1 for example).</li><li>Then, find the image corresponding to your Raspberry Pi model.<br>For example:<br><code>FreeBSD-12.1-RELEASE-arm64-aarch64-RPI3.img.xz</code><br>If you have the Raspberry Pi 3 (look for arm architecture, and the last part of the name correspond to the Raspberry Pi model).</li></ul></li><li><strong>Download the CURRENT version:</strong><ul><li>Go to snapshots and then <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://download.freebsd.org/ftp/snapshots/ISO-IMAGES/" target="_blank">ISO-IMAGES</a>.</li><li>Select the version you want (13.0 for example).</li><li>Same thing here, find the FreeBSD images corresponding to your model, for example:<br><code>FreeBSD-13.0-CURRENT-arm64-aarch64-RPI3-20200813-r364182.img.xz</code><br>Currently, there is no specific version for the Raspberry Pi 4, so take the RPI3 one.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Download the file you need on this server, and feel free to ask in the comments if you are lost with this, or if I need to update it for the latest versions.</p><h3><span id="SD_card_preparation"></span>SD card preparation<span></span></h3><p>Once you have the image on your computer, the installation part is similar to what you may already know with other systems.<br>My favorite tool to create SD card is Etcher, here is how to use it:</p><ul><li><strong>Download Etcher <a rel="noreferrer noopener"

modern programming languages. The point of the garbage collector is to free up
memory used by objects which are no longer being used by a program. Although
it's convenient for developers not to think about manually deallocating memory,
it can be a poisoned chalice that comes with several hard-to-predict downsides.</p><h2>When garbage adds up<a href="#when-garbage-adds-up" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Some garbage collectors completely halt the program's execution to make sure no
new objects are created while it cleans up. To avoid these unpredictable
<strong>stop-the-world</strong> pauses in a program, incremental and concurrent garbage
collectors were developed. Although they provide great benefit in many cases,
there's additional design choices that wind up back into development phases
where you have to indirectly deal with memory allocation.</p><p>Another issue is that garbage collectors themselves consume resources to decide
what to free up, which can add considerable overhead. Environments dealing with
real-time data are latency-sensitive and require high performance and
efficiency. In these applications, unpredictable halting behavior combined with
excess computation time or memory usage is not acceptable.</p><p>As we're building an open source high-performance time series database, we have
these environments in mind and use design patterns and tooling that focuses on
writing code that's efficient and reliable. When we need additional
functionality that would introduce performance knocks through standard
libraries, we can leverage our own implementations using native methods. This is
what prompted us to add a network stack that executes garbage-free.</p><p>This component bypasses Java's native non-blocking IO with our own notification
system. This component's job is to delegate tasks to worker threads and use
queues for events and TCP socket connections. The result is a new generic
network stack used to handle all incoming network connections.</p><h2>TCP flow control<a href="#tcp-flow-control" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>When we have multiple nodes on a network, there are usually disparities in their
performance in computing power and network bandwidth. Some nodes can read
incoming packets at different rates than others, or conversely, some nodes may
be able to send data at a different rate.</p><p>Let's say we have a network with two nodes; a sender and a receiver. If the
sender can produce a lot more data than the receiver can read, the receiver is
likely to be overwhelmed. We're in luck, though, as TCP uses a built-in flow
control protocol that acts as a pressure valve to ensure the receiver is not
affected by such cases.</p><p>Control flow manifests itself in different ways, depending on whether the
network socket is blocking or non-blocking. If the receiver can process data
faster than a sender, a non-blocking socket is identical to a blocking one, and
the receiver thread would be parked while no data is read. There's not much
concern about this situation if it happens infrequently, but the park and unpark
is a waste of resources and CPU cycles if the receiver is under heavy load.</p><p>Let's assume the receiver gets 0-length data on a non-blocking socket,
indicating no data has arrived from the sender; there are two options:</p><ol><li>Loop over socket reads continuously, waiting for data to arrive.</li><li>Stop looping and consult our parser on two possible actions to take: park for
more reads or switch to write.</li></ol><p>The first option is quite wasteful, so we went with the second approach. To park
socket read operations without blocking the thread, we need a dedicated system
for enqueuing and notifying us when the socket has more data to read. On the OS
kernel level, IO notification utilities exist as <code>epoll</code> on Linux, <code>kqueue</code> on
FreeBSD and OSX, and <code>select</code> on Windows. In QuestDB, we've implemented a
dispatcher that operates exactly as these IO notification systems for enqueuing
sockets, and we named it IODispatcher.</p><h2>Java NIO and garbage collection<a href="#java-nio-and-garbage-collection" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>As you would expect from cross-platform languages, the IO Notification system
must be abstracted away to make application code portable. In Java, this
abstraction is called <code>Selector</code>. If we were to oversimplify a typical
interaction with the IO Notification system, it would essentially be a loop.
More often than not, this is an infinite loop, or rather, it executes
continuously during the server's uptime.</p><p>Since we are on a quest to have everything garbage-free, Selector presents a
problem right away - the output of the selector is a set of keys, coming from a
concurrent hash map via an iterator. All of this allocates objects on every
iteration of the loop. If you are not careful, this allocation continues even
when the server is idling. The behavior is intrinsic to the Java Non-blocking
I/O (NIO) implementation and cannot be changed.</p><p>To send or receive data from the network, Java mandates ByteBuffer instances.
When looked at in a vacuum, ByteBuffer may seem like a reasonable abstraction.
But if we look closer, it's easy to see it's a bit confused. It is a concrete
class instead of an interface, meaning that the whole NIO is stuck with the
provided implementation. The API is inconsistent as the OS requires memory
pointers for send and receive methods, but ByteBuffer does not provide an
explicit semantic for each case. So how does ByteBuffer translate to a memory
pointer?</p><p>When your data is on the heap, there is a memory copy for each socket IO. When
ByteBuffer is direct, there is no copy, but there is an issue releasing memory
and general Java paranoia about language safety.</p><div><p>Native Java socket write implementation</p></div><p>Considering the allocating nature of the Selector, that Java NIO libraries are a
layer above the OS, and how computationally expensive the overhead is with
ByteBuffer, we decided to go out on a limb and interact directly with the OS via
the Java Native Interface (JNI). This worked for QuestDB insofar as the API is
non-allocating outside of the normal bootstrap phase and lets us work with the
memory pointers directly.</p><div><p>QuestDB's JNI call for sending data to a socket</p></div><h2>QuestDB's thread model<a href="#questdbs-thread-model" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>Starting threads is expensive, and they're more often than not just wrappers for
the connection state. QuestDB operates a fixed number of threads to isolate the
database instance to specific cores and reduce the overhead of starting and
stopping threads at runtime. The actual threads are encapsulated by a WorkerPool
class.</p><p>The worker pool's idea is to have a simple list of "jobs" that all workers will
run all the time. Jobs themselves encapsulate "piece of work" and do not have
tight loops in them. Hence a job can simply return if IO is not available or the
queue is full or empty.</p><p>We have a notion of a "synchronized job." It is different from the definition of
"synchronized" in Java in that the QuestDB's thread never blocks. However,
synchronized jobs guarantee that only one thread can execute a job instance at
any moment in time.</p><h2>Introducing QuestDB's IODispatcher<a href="#introducing-questdbs-iodispatcher" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h2><p>IODispatcher is QuestDB's implementation of the IO Notification loop. We have
implemented <code>epoll</code>, <code>kqueue</code>, and <code>select</code>, so this works cross-platform. The
appropriate implementation is automatically chosen at runtime based on the OS.
The IODispatched API is message-driven via QuestDB's implementation of
non-blocking and non-allocating queues. These queues are outside of the scope of
this article, but you can read about them in our community
<a href="https://questdb.io/blog/2020/11/26/http-server-contribution">contribution from Alex Pelagenko</a>.</p><figure><img alt="A diagram of QuestDB's IODispatcher" height="284" src="https://questdb.io/img/blog/2020-12-10/iodispatcher-diagram.png" width="650"><figcaption>IODispatcher and queues for events, interest, and disconnections</figcaption></figure><p>IODispatcher is a synchronized job in context of QuestDB's thread model. It
consumes queues on the left and publishes to the queue on the right.
IODispatcher's main responsibility is to deliver socket handles (individual
connection identifiers), that are ready for the IO to the worker threads.
Considering that socket handles are read or written to by one thread at a time
the underlying IO notification system works in ONESHOT mode. This means socket
handle is removed from the IO notification system while there is socket activity
and re-introduced back when activity tapers off. Interacting with the IO
notification system is expensive. Worker thread will only recurse back to the
IODispatcher for enqueueing if there has been zero data from the socket for the
set period of time, which we call hysteresis.</p><p>You can find source code of the implementations of the IODispatcher for
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/questdb/network/IODispatcherLinux.java" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">epoll</a>
,

and
<a href="https://github.com/questdb/questdb/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/questdb/network/IODispatcherWindows.java" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">select</a>
on GitHub. Let's take a look at the components in the diagram above with an
outline of their purpose:</p><p><strong>IO Event Queue:</strong> Single publisher, multiple consumer queue. It is the
recipient of the IO events from as in epoll, kqueue, select. The events are
socket handles and the type of operation the OS has associated them with, e.g.,
read or write. The IODispatcher plays the publisher role, and any number of
worker threads are the consumers.</p><p><strong>Interest Queue:</strong> Multiple publisher, single consumer queue. Worker threads
publish socket handles and operations to this queue when IO is unavailable,
e.g., socket read or write returns zero. The IODispatcher will enqueue the
socket handle for more reads or writes as defined by the operation.</p><p><strong>Disconnect Queue:</strong> Multiple publisher, single consumer queue. Worker threads
publish socket handles to this queue destined to be disconnected from the server
and have their resources reused by other connections. The worker thread does not
disconnect the socket by itself because multiple threads may attempt to access a
data structure that is not thread-safe.</p><h3>Configuration<a href="#configuration" title="Direct link to heading">#</a></h3><p>We disregarded ByteBuffer for not being an interface, so it would only be fair
for us to have interfaces in key places. One of these places is configuration,
which provides IODispatcher with basics such as:</p><ul><li>The IP address of the network interface</li><li>Port to bind to</li><li>Bias</li><li>Buffer sizes</li><li>Network facade</li><li>Clock facade</li><li>Connection context factory</li></ul><p>It's necessary to explain bias here, which might not be so obvious. When the TCP
connection is first accepted, it is enqueued for IO right away. The bias
provides an expectation of the initial …</p></section></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In this article, we compare error handling methods in Kotlin; specifically: exceptions, <code>Either</code>, and <code>Result</code>.</p>
</section><article><section><p>Traditionally, we may use exceptions to handle errors. We perform some action and throw an exception if something goes wrong. But, if you are calling a function, how do you know if it can throw an exception at all? And if it does, what kind of exception? These are hard questions to answer, enter <code>Either</code>:</p>
<p><code>Either</code> can be used as a typesafe alternative for error handling. <code>Either</code> holds one of two values, a <code>Left</code> or a <code>Right</code>. When we call a function which returns an <code>Either</code>, we are forced to handle both a successful and an unsuccessful case, and get to know exactly what this function returns. On the other hand, if we were to use exceptions, there is no method signature for the developer to see what cases may occur. Developers may annotate a function with <code>@Throws</code>, but since this is optional, it is not dependable. Therefore, with lack of a complete method signature, developers must either ignore the exception or interpret the function body and all possible underlying method calls.</p>
<p>Let us say that we want to validate a user object using an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opaque_data_type"><em>opaque type</em></a>. Look at the code below. The only way to obtain an instance of <code>ValidatedUser</code> is to provide a <code>RawUser</code> with a valid email address to the static <code>validate</code> function.</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>data</span> <span>class</span> <span>RawUser</span><span>(</span>
    <span>val</span> email<span>:</span> String
<span>)</span>

<span>class</span> InvalidEmailException<span>:</span> <span>RuntimeException</span><span>(</span><span>"Invalid email"</span><span>)</span>

<span>class</span> ValidatedUser <span>private</span> <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>
    <span>val</span> email<span>:</span> String
<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>companion</span> <span>object</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>fun</span> <span>validate</span><span>(</span>rawUser<span>:</span> RawUser<span>)</span><span>:</span> ValidatedUser <span>=</span>
            <span>if</span> <span>(</span>EMAIL_REGEX<span>.</span><span>matches</span><span>(</span>rawUser<span>.</span>email<span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>ValidatedUser</span><span>(</span>rawUser<span>.</span>email<span>)</span>
            <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
                <span>throw</span> <span>InvalidEmailException</span><span>(</span><span>)</span>
            <span>}</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>And we may call it like so:</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>try</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println</span><span>(</span>ValidatedUser<span>.</span><span>validate</span><span>(</span><span>RawUser</span><span>(</span>emailAddress<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>.</span>email<span>)</span>
<span>}</span> <span>catch</span> <span>(</span>e<span>:</span> Exception<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println</span><span>(</span>e<span>.</span>message<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>You may have already noticed that we catch <code>Exception</code> and not <code>InvalidEmailException</code>. This illustrates the main issue with exceptions, they are dynamically typed. The only way to know which exceptions might be thrown is to manually parse the function body (and the body of any internal function calls). This may not always be trivial, for example, if you are calling a function from an external library.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a neat solution to this problem. Using the same <code>RawUser</code> class, we can implement it using <code>Either</code> from the <a href="https://arrow-kt.io/docs/apidocs/arrow-core-data/arrow.core/-either/">Arrow library</a>:</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>enum</span> <span>class</span> ValidationError <span>{</span>
    INVALID_EMAIL
<span>}</span>

<span>class</span> ValidatedUser <span>private</span> <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>
    <span>val</span> email<span>:</span> String
<span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>is</span> Right <span>-&gt;</span> <span>println</span><span>(</span>validatedUser<span>.</span>b<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p>It is crystal clear what this function does from the signature alone. You either get a <code>ValidationError</code> or a <code>ValidatedUser</code>. Because <code>Either</code> is a sealed class, we also get exhaustive pattern matching using <code>when</code>. Additionally, we get smart casting which automatically gives us access to an <code>a</code> (the error) if it is a <code>Left</code>-instance, or a <code>b</code> (the success value) if it is a <code>Right</code>-instance.</p>
<p>There are cons to this approach as well as with exceptions. The choice of whether the error value is in the left or right slot is completely dependent on convention. It is easy to confuse, especially when you are working with different implementations where they are reversed (for example, <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/">Result</a> in Rust and <a href="https://github.com/michaelbull/kotlin-result">Kotlin-result</a>). Consider this, which of these cases prints the error?</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>when</span><span>(</span><span>val</span> validatedUser <span>=</span> ValidatedUser<span>.</span><span>validate</span><span>(</span><span>RawUser</span><span>(</span>emailAddress<span>)</span><span>)</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>is</span> Left <span>-&gt;</span> <span>println</span><span>(</span>validatedUser<span>.</span>a<span>)</span>
    <span>is</span> Right <span>-&gt;</span> <span>println</span><span>(</span>validatedUser<span>.</span>b<span>)</span>
<span>}</span></code></pre></div>
<p><code>Either</code> is rather generic, and thus, <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code> may not make sense for the reader by itself. Additionally, you may also notice that <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code> suddenly change to <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>. Not a huge problem, but readability suffers nonetheless. </p>
<p>If you want all the advantages of <code>Either</code>, but also want to stay semantically accurate in the context of error handling, check out <a href="https://github.com/michaelbull/kotlin-result"><code>Result&lt;T, E&gt;</code></a>. <code>Right</code> changes to <code>Ok</code>, and <code>Left</code> to <code>Err</code>. It makes it significantly harder to confuse <code>Left</code> and <code>Right</code> as <code>Ok</code> and <code>Err</code> makes sense in their own right (pun intended).</p>
<div data-language="kotlin"><pre><code><span>class</span> ValidatedUser <span>private</span> <span>constructor</span><span>(</span>

December 14, 2020 | https://klimy.co/blog/trowing-away-bad-work-15-12-2020 | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://klimy.co/blog/trowing-away-bad-work-15-12-2020">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="blog">
                    <p>Today I have wanted to address one of the ideas, <a href="https://blog.stephsmith.io/">Steph Smith</a> mentioned in her book “Doing Content Right”.</p>
<p>She mentioned that you must be putting a lot of reps into the writing habit, but one of the graphs that she showed, discounted and went as far as not even publishing relatively lower quality content.</p>
<p>My first initial reaction was that it was outrageous not to share all your work with the public. After all, it has been <a href="https://books.google.fr/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YbRH25ZrL-oC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=judging+quality&amp;ots=FMsxr9QwUx&amp;sig=jIKaA89rLKHJn5gFrOYIZdSGmXo#v=onepage&amp;q=judging%20quality&amp;f=false">proven that quality is too hard to judge,&nbsp;</a>especially from the point of the author of work.</p>
<p>Every huge writer or blogger that I listened to talk about their creative process, keep on mentioning that the pieces that they love themselves, sometimes get no traction what so ever and so get lost under the huge pile of other pieces. And sometimes the pieces that were boring or even borderline throwaway reach number 1 spot pretty quickly.</p>
<p>So when I saw the graph with y column being quality, I was sceptical. How was it judged? What units? Compared to what? Why throw away the perfectly fine writing, even though you feel that its quality is lower?</p>
<p>One of the things I thought about is that I might be playing with fire here.</p>
<p>Writing has been an established field for more than 200 years. There have always been certain ways to do things. There are even full degrees for the field of writing. Maybe it is a common and widespread practice to drop and throw away bad pieces.</p>
<p>But my main question is, why would one throw away a ready piece, when <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/quality-over-quantity-in-writing">going from bad to great is very easy</a>? There are always editing and rewriting that can help you change your structure and context.</p>
<h2>What I have been doing</h2>
<p>I think one of the reasons that I don’t bother with throwing away bad pieces, is because I have put a specific way to dialogue with the reader. For me, the talk is much more personal and much more fluent than others.</p>
<p>I have separated the content into 2 main categories. <a href="https://klimy.co/blog/">Blog posts</a> and <a href="https://klimy.co/notes">Notes</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://klimy.co/blog/">Blog posts</a> of course, consist of the best pieces of work that I have written, and they are what gets referenced by me the most. They are also much longer and in-depth than Notes.</p>
<p><a href="https://klimy.co/blog/quality-over-quantity-in-writing">Notes</a> on the other hand, is a type of outlet to post less than amazing content. Even though I work on them the same amount of time and put the same amount of effort, sometimes the topic or my understanding is a little lacking, and that is why it goes straight into the Note section. The crazy part? Sometimes what I judge to be sub-par actually outperforms a normal blog post that I put into the main section.</p>
<p>These notes have helped me stop worrying about bad writing and carry on doing this every single day, treating it as any other blog post that I would write.</p>
<p>Writers' block has been a terrifying word for me, and I pray that I would never experience it, I have only heard about it and was very lucky to sidestep it.</p>
<p>I hope that this process of having an outlet for worst than usual work can help you to stop worrying about the quality of your content too much and keep on putting the reps into the writing.</p>
<p>Start now. Get perfect later.</p>
<p>Klim Y</p>

<p>In the early summer of 2018, Norway received an unusual request from Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's government.</p><p>Saudi Arabia wanted to send ten men on an official assignment to Norway, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs confirms to Dagbladet. The ten men were all security guards, who were deployed to work at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Norway, according to Dagbladet’s sources. But Saudi Arabia wanted the security guards to be registered as diplomats in Norway. This would give them extended room for manoeuvring in Norway.</p><p><strong>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intervened, and the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) has informed Iyad el-Baghdadi (43) - a Norway-based journalist, activist, and critic of the Saudi regime - about the incident. </strong></p><p>Dagbladet has asked the Saudi embassy several questions regarding this article. The embassy has responded with a press release they originally sent out last year, criticising "fabricated and false" accusations, "with the intent to insult Saudi Arabia."</p>
<p><em><strong>Update Thursday 17th of December:</strong> The Saudi Arabian Embassy in Oslo has replied specifically to the deplyment of the security team. Read the full comment further down in this article.</em></p><p>Dagbladet has received confirmation from several sources that there were several issues regarding the ten-man security team that made the Norwegian authorities react.</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<h2>The crucial points</h2><p>• <strong>The number:</strong> The number of security guards was unusually high. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs regularly publishes a list of all foreign diplomats accredited to Norway. According to the diplomat list from the summer of 2018, the total number of Saudi diplomats in Norway at the time was 18. Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that the Saudis were about to almost double the number - with only security people.</p>
<p>• <strong>The status:</strong> Both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the PST were surprised that Saudi Arabia requested that the security guards be granted diplomatic status - and registered in the official <a href="https://www.regjeringen.no/no/dep/ud/dep/forbindelser/id447053/">Diplomat List</a>. It is unusual for security people at embassies to be registered as diplomats. Both diplomats and other embassy personell - arriving on a so-called «D-visa» to Norway - is given <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diplomatic_immunity">diplomatic immunity</a>. Which, as one of several benefits, means that the host country cannot arrest you if you commit a crime. But being registered formally as a diplomat gives you a wider range of benefits.</p><p>• <strong>The increase:</strong> Norwegian authorities reacted to the fact that the major increase in security staff did not reflect what they knew regarding the activity level at the embassy.</p><p>• <strong>The key role:</strong> Officials at PST have later noted that security personnel, from the consulate in Istanbul, played key roles in the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, Dagbladet has learned.</p>
<p><strong>The PST declined to comment on this article, however, it has been presented with all the information herein – without finding any errors.</strong></p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>Guri Solberg, spokesperson at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirms in an e-mail to Dagbladet:</p><p>“In the summer of 2018, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs registered ten persons as new envoys at the Saudi Arabian embassy in Oslo. The status of other countries' envoys to embassies is regulated by the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (1961) and the role of the envoy at the embassy. As these were mainly persons who were to have internal tasks at the embassy, nine of the ten persons were registered as administrative / technical personnel in accordance with normal practice. One of the ten people was registered as a diplomat based on their role and responsibilities. In practice, there is little difference in the degree of immunity and privileges granted to diplomatic, administrative, and technical personnel. The rules on immunity and privileges are dictated by international law by which Norway is bound, in particular the Vienna Convention of Diplomatic Relations, that includes immunity from criminal prosecution in the host state.”</p><figure data-zoomable="1">

<p>The men arrived in Norway at the end of July 2018. The one security guard who received the diplomatic status Saudi Arabia requested, now works as Head of Security at the Saudi Arabian embassy, according to Dagbladet's sources. He is formally listed in the Foreign Ministry's diplomatic list as an "attaché".</p><div>

<p>“It was a discussion. There are regulations for the type of status that the embassies' security people can hold whilst staying in Norway. They are not diplomats”, a source familiar with the case tells Dagbladet.</p><div id="factbox-73180109" aria-expanded="false" tabindex="1">
    <h2>Facts: Diplomatic immunity in Norway</h2>
        
    
        <p>According to the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, all envoys from other countries have diplomatic immunity when they are working for their country’s embassy. This applies to both diplomats and administrative personnel, such as security staff. <br></p><p>However, different degrees of immunity are granted, according to the rank of the individual within the system. Only diplomats have full immunity. <br></p><p>Neither diplomats nor security staff at embassies can be prosecuted or subjected to taxation in Norway. Security staff (administrative personnel) do not, however, have immunity from civil proceedings arising from their conduct in private. Whilst diplomats can import as much as they desire tax-free for private use, administrative personnel are only exempt from customs duties on entry to a country. <br></p><p>Norway can sanction an envoy with diplomatic immunity by declaring them persona non grata in Norway.</p><p><em>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs</em></p>

<p>If you travel by sea to the Frognerstranda harbour, at times you can spot the Kingdom's characteristic green flag - with a white sabre, and the inscription "There is no god without Allah, and Muhammad is his prophet" - waving over the hedge. From a magnificent villa, designed in 1899 by the famed Norwegian architect Ingvar Hjorth, Saudi Arabia manages its activities in Norway.</p>
<p>Dagbladet has asked the Embassy in Oslo why they requested the security guards be granted diplomatic immunity, about the points Norway reacted to, about the Embassy’s relationship with the activist Iyad el-Baghdadi, and about why the Embassy wanted to increase the number of security guards by so many.</p><p><strong>The Embassy has declined to meet with Dagbladet, preferring to respond by email, with a press release originally sent out in 2019:</strong></p><p>"The Embassy is informed about what has been circulated in some media in regard to Mr. Iyad el-Baghdadi and the allegations against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Embassy would like to clarify that this person is not a Saudi citizen and is unknown to the Kingdom. What he said is fabricated and false and aims to offend the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. We have been in contact with the Norwegian Government to provide the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia with further information in this regard. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reserves the right to take the necessary legal measures against the mentioned-above in order to safeguard its rights."</p>
<p><em><strong>Update:</strong></em> <em>Dagbladet received the following statement on Thursday 17th of December:</em></p><p><em>«The Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reiterates what was released in 2019, and denies any previous knowledge or existing relationship between the Kingdom and Iyad el-baghdadi.</em></p><p><em>In regards to the issue concerning the security guards, these guards are positioned at the embassy to provide the necessary protection, around the clock, for both the Embassy building and the Head of Mission’s residence. Saudi embassies in several countries have received threats and have been targeted by terrorist attacks - the most recent of which being the incident at the Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in The Hague.»</em></p><h2>Briefed by the PST</h2><p>In a spartan apartment in Oslo, Dagbladet meets Iyad el-Baghdadi.</p><div id="parallax-73159998">

December 14, 2020 | https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-11/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-11/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="articleBody"><p>Hello and welcome to the seventh post in my series about learning Rust. In case you want to hit it from the start, <a href="https://levpaul.com/posts/rust-lesson-1/">here’s</a> a link to the first one! This entire series covers my journey from being a completely land-locked Gopher to becoming (hopefully) a hardened Rustacean, able to skitter the hazardous seabed of any application safely.</p><hr><p>This chapter covers a topic that engineers will have strong thoughts and feelings about, myself included. In college, I recall learning precisely zero about testing. This perhaps, because I studied Computer Science rather than Software Engineering? Alas, when I entered into my first real dev job it was a slightly jarring experience, figuring out how write tests for my code. In that nubile period, I can make no mistake in saying that test writing was <em>the</em> most tedious and painstaking task I can recall… (<em>Alongside waiting 2 minutes and thirty seconds for a our Java backend to compile</em>)</p><p>Mercifully, I’ve encountered many great engineers throughout my career whom took time to educate me, and I’ve grown to love testing. It once got to the point where testing was the sole driver for all code I wrote, via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development">TDD</a>, but now has come back around to something less intense. I find unit tests less helpful and instead, lean on acceptance/integration testing to capture most things.</p><p>Ultimately how and if you write tests will depend on a few key factors;</p><h5 id="1-development-style">1. Development Style</h5><p>Are you practicing Test-Driven Developement, or are you writing in a more conventional or exploratory way? In simpler terms - are you writing your tests before you code, as you code, or after you code?</p><h5 id="2-existing-tests">2. Existing Tests</h5><p>Does the project you’re working on contain existing test infrastructure? Can you answer yes to these questions?</p><ul><li>are unit/integration tests widespread in the project already?</li><li>do existing tests contain scaffolding that enables you to easily add more tests? (i.e. mocks/stubs of major dependencies)</li><li>is the test suite run automatically via continuous integration pipelines? If so, is the pipeline passing a programmatic requirement for all pull requests?</li></ul><p>The more yeses from these questions, the more likely change requests will come with at least a couple new test cases, no matter the development style of a contributor.</p><h5 id="3-barrier-to-extension">3. Barrier to Extension</h5><p>This is simply how hard it would be to add tests had there not been existing infrastructure in place. This could be for a brand-new project or in an older project that was missing a particular type of test (i.e. no integration tests).</p><p>My experience with Java has always been bad in this respect. The testing environment was so fragmented that you had to use different frameworks depending on what style test you were wanting, and you also had to integrate said frameworks with your build framework too, just to make them run. Go was a huge breath of fresh air for me here as it had testing built in as a first class citizen from day one.</p><hr><p>With all these factors in mind, it makes sense to view testing in <em>Rust</em> purely from the third point, as this is where a language has the most potential for enablement.</p><h3 id="11-writing-automated-testshttpsdocrust-langorgbookch11-00-testinghtml">11. <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-00-testing.html">Writing Automated Tests</a></h3><p>Not to start on the wrong foot but straight off the bat this chapter managed to annoy me thoroughly by leading with this excerpt:</p><blockquote><p>In his 1972 essay “The Humble Programmer,” Edsger W. Dijkstra said that “Program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.” That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to test as much as we can!</p></blockquote><p>I scratched my head and thought, “<em>this doesn’t sound right</em>”. So off I went to read <a href="https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html">The Humble Programmer</a> essay (which is fantastic). It became immediately obvious that Dijkstra had anything <em>but</em> an anti-testing sentiment. My guess is that the authors of the Rust Book may have just made a simple translation error. Take for example, the very next line of the essay. Dijkstra writes:</p><blockquote><p>The only effective way to raise the confidence level of a program significantly is to give a convincing proof of its correctness.</p></blockquote><p>No, Dijkstra isn’t talking about a formal proof. He’s talking about Test Driven Development in 1972. He continues:</p><blockquote><p>If one first asks oneself what the structure of a convincing proof would be and, having found this, then constructs a program satisfying this proof’s requirements, then these correctness concerns turn out to be a very effective heuristic guidance.</p></blockquote><p>One can only imagine the “Program testing” Dijkstra referred to in the original quote, could simply mean <em>manual testing</em> in today’s tongue. The Book missed a great opportunity to use Dijkstra to promote testing and instead we got only half of it. Oh well.</p><hr><h3 id="_setup_"><em>Setup</em></h3><p>I got a feeling that this chapter had a different author than previous ones, as the examples were numerous and verbose. I managed to skim over most of them as in essence the concepts were quite basic. Basic though, is a great quality in a testing framework.</p><h4 id="the-_basics_">The <em>Basics</em></h4><p>In no relevant order, let me talk about features of Rust testing that I loved.</p><p>First - tests are simple to add, just a <code>[#test]</code> annotation for a function and you’re off to the races. In Go you have to do two things - create a file that ends in <code>_test.go</code> <em>and then</em> write your test functions as</p><div><pre><code data-lang="go"><span>func</span> <span>TestXxx</span><span>(</span><span>t</span> <span>*</span><span>testing</span><span>.</span><span>T</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>… Now let me tell you that I’ve reviewed unit tests in Go which had me scratch my head and ask myself <em>“how the f*** did these tests pass??"</em>. It turned out that after another 10 minutes of faffing about and running the tests locally, did I find the test had never been run! Along with many others in the package for the past 6 months! Why? Because someone forgot to capitalize the first letter of the test function names, meaning their <code>testMyProgramWorks</code> “tests” weren’t exported, meaning Go didn’t classify them as real tests. Add some copy-pasta and there we were…</p><p>Having a much simpler API for specifying tests is a big win in my book. Thank you, Rust.</p><h5 id="seamless-integration">Seamless Integration</h5><p>Next on my testing crushlist is Intellij+Rust-plugin testing integration. I can just hit <code>shift+F10</code> and the IDE will run the tests for my crate and spit out a summary with links to failures and stuff. For one reason or another, I never run my Go tests from Goland (Intellij for Go). I use the command line with filters to run tests in specific packages. I don’t even know if I’ve ever even <em>tried</em> to run Go tests in Goland!?</p><p>After getting excited about this, I decided to try the IDE’s debugger with an integration test. Again, it just worked! I’ve used a debugger once or twice in Go, but you have to use <a href="https://github.com/go-delve/delve">Delve</a>, then find some tutorials for setting that up with your IDE… In practice, I’ve never felt it was worth my time to use a debugger in Go. I’m not <em>sure</em> this would change with Rust - but debuggers are definitely nice to have when you’re a newbie and want to get a stronger feel for what’s happening in your code. Very cool to have it in the IDE with zero effort.</p><h5 id="almost-seamless">Almost, Seamless</h5><p>As I continued my tool-driven gorge, I hovered over a polished button that had inlaid in it, “Run ‘Hello World’ with Coverage”. Oooooh, ahhhh, I ogled.</p><p>*<strong>click</strong>*</p><p><em>BZZZZZRRP!!!!</em></p><p>Oh no.</p><p><em>Code coverage is available only with nightly toolchain.</em></p><p>Well excuuuuuse me for being so <em>basic</em> that I only use the default <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install">rustup</a> install… To reinforce this further, the Book slaps me with this one too,</p><blockquote><p>Benchmark tests are, as of this writing, only available in nightly Rust.</p></blockquote><p>I am a big fan of Go benchmarks. Possibly the most underrated aspect of the Go testing ecosystem. It’s basically the standard for figuring out how alloc-y a package is and gives you hard numbers in that respect. Maybe benchmark tests <em>aren’t</em> that good in Rust, given you have much stricter control over your allocs?</p><p>So for now, I’ll add nightly-rust to my list of things to understand, post-Book.</p><h4 id="ok-enough-tool-talk-_the-tests_">Ok enough tool talk, <em>The Tests!</em></h4><p>The Rust testing tool chain is simple and comprehensive. The <code>assert!</code> style macros are a godsend. Every test I write in Go starts with me importing the <a href="https://github.com/stretchr/testify">testify</a> library, just to get access to <code>assert</code>. Rust testing is close to what Go offers, but looks to have a clear edge, out of the box.</p><p>On the opposite end of the stick, I’m not a huge fan of coercing us to put unit tests within the module being tested. Splitting up test code from production code makes for easier reading. Thankfully, <a href="http://xion.io/post/code/rust-unit-test-placement.html">this post</a> showed me how to split your tests into a sibling module, so with some slight hacks it appears my woes are surmountable.</p><p>A point of confusion came about when the Book ended a section saying we can write tests to return <code>Result&lt;T,E&gt;</code>’s. Apparently this is an acceptable way to write tests over <code>assert!</code> macros… The Book doesn’t make a suggestion about which is more idiomatic, so until I’m convinced otherwise, I’ll stick with asserts.</p><h5 id="delight-me-more">Delight me more</h5><p>Rust continued to delight me by doing simple things that Go doesn’t, for example having sane <em>help</em> printouts for the test command. Just trying to figure anything out by running <code>go help test</code> (and yes, in that specific arg order) is an exercise in futility. Any time I have to figure out how to disable test caching in Go, it’s a visit to Uncle Google.</p><p>Simiplicity continues in Rust with sane ways to filter running tests, and a simple mechanism to arbitrarily partition your tests too, using the <code>#[ignore]</code> annotation.</p><h5 id="splitting-hairs">Splitting Hairs</h5><p>There is no logical division in Go to encourage splitting unit tests from integration tests. You have to make such a divide yourself. I love that Rust has thought deeper about this and there are patterns to follow for each case.</p><blockquote><p>There’s debate within the testing community about whether or not private functions should be tested directly, and other languages make it difficult or impossible to test private functions.</p></blockquote><p>I haven’t heard this debate before, I’m guessing it would go something along the lines of “test the contract, if that works then you’re good”. Whilst I wouldn’t buy it completely, I do find substantially more value in integration and acceptance testing than unit testing <em>every function</em>.</p><h3 id="_teardown_"><em>Teardown</em></h3><p>Both Rust and Go have testing as first class citizens, but Rust wins for ease of use and …</p></div></div>

<p>Change is hard. Explaining that change in a way that makes sense is hard. Not getting frustrated when someone is explaining change to you, or while explaining it is hard. We are all human, so please be patient. But, before you get angry, please read this. I’ve been surfing <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/centos?lang=en">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/k95dt7/centos_project_shifts_focus_to_centos_stream/">Reddit</a>, and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25345428">HackerNews</a> threads just like many others. I’ve gathered some major buckets of complaints which seem to come up, and I’d like to address each of them.</p>
<p>Before I start, full disclosure, I work at Red Hat and I’ve been here 9.5 years. I’ve never missed a paycheck. Never. Not one time. It’s always been there on payday. That makes me happy, but just because you work somewhere doesn’t mean you check your brain at the door. I am constantly questioning what we are doing, and coming to my own conclusions. A work relationship is like any other relationship, and it must be evaluated from time to time. Like any rational human being, I do this every now and then. I’m also known for saying my mind, even when the truth is difficult to hear. I think this makes me a decent diplomat for tough conversations. That said, these are my opinions and thoughts, not Red Hat’s.</p>
<p>Let’s have a tough conversation here. There are a lot of complaints and some optimism about the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux">CentOS to CentOS Stream change</a>. Let’s dissect each of what I consider legitimate complaints:</p>





<h2><span id="1_This_Was_Communicated_Poorly">#1 This Was Communicated Poorly</span></h2>
<p>As I said in the introduction, messaging is hard. We are all human, even the people at Red Hat. Do I think it’s possible that this could have been communicated better? Sure. That said, I’ve seen a lot of people tossing hate toward Rich Bowen (<a href="https://blog.centos.org/2020/12/future-is-centos-stream/">CentOS Project shifts focus to CentOS Stream</a>) as well as Chris Wright (<a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/centos-stream-building-innovative-future-enterprise-linux">CentOS Stream: Building an innovative future for enterprise Linux</a>) who wrote the two main pieces which communicated this change.</p>
<p>That’s not fair. These are both stand up guys. I mean seriously. I met Rich many moons ago because I had read and used his Apache docs. I went up to him and said thank you with nervousness. This guy believes in open source, more than most. He not only uses, he contributes. Big time. Same with Chris. I’ve never seen anyone who gets open source more than Chris. Seriously, when you listen to him speak you can discern how deeply he thinks about it. He is committed to it. If Red Hat ever changed their stance on open source, I am 100% sure that both of these guys would leave. There’s no conspiracy here, not with these guys. I know them both personally, and I believe in both of them. When these guys get up and say something, it’s true to the best of their knowledge at the given time. But, the world changes, and so do strategies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Furthermore, this is a big change, and many people were involved, from both the community and from Red Hat. In fact, I’m writing this blog because I have a bias towards contribution and I believe it’s all of our responsibility to try to communicate this change effectively. Will Red Hat live and learn from this messaging? Yes, I believe so.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My only ask is, please extend some goodwill to Red Hat and see how this change goes. Give it a chance. I believe it will actually be better in the long run, and more sustainable.</p>

<h2><span id="2_Things_Changed_I_Don8217t_Like_Change">#2 Things Changed, I Don’t Like Change</span></h2>
<p>This brings me to the next most common gripe I hear. I get it it. Please try to separate your anger that is a direct result of unwanted change, from the other things discussed in this blog. Every time I’ve ever went through a re-org at work, changed roles, changed companies, bought a house, had a child or remodeled a room in my house, I’ve sort of had this “who moved my cheese” feeling. Everything was one way, now it’s another. Being annoyed by change is legitimate, but ask yourself what the benefits might be?</p>

<p><a href="http://crunchtools.com/files/2020/12/9780399144462_l.jpg"><img loading="lazy" src="http://crunchtools.com/files/2020/12/9780399144462_l.jpg" alt="" width="254" height="400"></a></p>
<p>Already, some people have proposed some benefits to this change, and I agree. I’m going to summarize the benefits I’ve seen from three different sources [1][2][3] and add some of my own thoughts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>It makes RHEL development more transparent and reliable [1]</strong> – historically, once a RHEL release snapped from Fedora it became a black box. Red Hat tries to solve this by creating Alpha and Beta releases which we share with customers and partners. We spend a tremendous amount of time/energy/money (as a PM I have to answer bunches of questions about Alpha/Beta), but literally almost nobody uses them. It’s expensive and painful. CentOS Stream will change this. Now any CentOS Stream user will have access to and be able to participate in this process. This is amazing.</li>
<li><strong>It provides a way for ISVs and developers to contribute fixes and features [1]</strong> – Even when partners and customers would use Betas/Alphas it was difficult for them to contribute changes back. None of the branches/repositories were public. Remember, the source code at git.centos.org is basically read only, downstream code from RHEL. That’s how Red Hat complies with the GPL. Technically we go above and beyond because we are only legally required to provide code to customers, and not required to provide code for BSD/Apache/etc licensed code, only attribution. Nonetheless, this was not a community, this was a code repository. The RHEL code was more akin to Android’s read-only, versus Kubernetes’ or the Linux kernel’s read-write community. With CentOS Stream, this all changes.</li>
<li><strong>It provides a way for the community to provide feedback [1]</strong> – Partners have special people dedicated to them called partner managers, and historically these partner managers help partners provide feedback and drive changes to the RHEL repositories. Community CentOS users (and even Fedora users) never had a way to drive changes into RHEL minor releases. Fedora drives changes into major releases, but there was a black box with minor releases. This gave RHEL the perception of being insulated from the upstream community, and it was. With CentOS Stream, this all becomes transparent. It’s a noble goal, and I genuinely believe this is better.</li>
<li><strong>Moving to a rolling stream is a consequence of moving to a cloud native world [2]</strong> – this was an interesting one and I hadn’t thought about this. This is a consequence of the world of containers. I always understood the value of containers to control when you absorb updates into your application dependencies, but it also means that a rolling stream of OS updates just doesn’t matter anymore. Now that containers control when the updates occur, why even care about whether it’s a rolling stream or released with version numbers. Do a “podman build” after the minor release drops in RHEL and don’t update again until the next dot release – boom, you have something quite similar to downstream CentOS Stream. A rolling stream lets us move faster and freer.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t underestimate the value of working directly with Red Hat engineering [3]</strong> – As Neal points out, CentOS was always a community driven project. Red Hat had extended it’s brand to the CentOS brand, and perhaps mistakenly given the perception that this was a well funded project when in fact it never was. Like every community driven project I have ever seen, there are more wants and desired than time and energy. Maintenance of community driven projects is not wholly unlike non-profits where a sort of depression permeates because it feels like you are never making enough progress, and worse you feel like you’re not being appreciated by the people who benefit from the charity. CentOS stream will be directly integrated with Red Hat engineering providing a direct line to RHEL. These are people paid to do this work, in service of making RHEL better. This aligns incentives and makes it much more sustainable, but more importantly, it creates a natural communication channel between Red Hat engineering and the community which frankly never existed. This will keep RHEL engineering more in touch with the realities of user needs, and provide the community a sense of connectedness. This is a very positive move.</li>
<li><strong>Don’t underestimate the power picking up a thousand new smart, highly motivated power users with a bias towards contribution, not consumption [4]</strong> – I haven’t seen anyone highlight this value yet. There are thousands of Solutions Architects, Consultants, Engineers, Product Managers, Product and Technical Marketing Managers, and Evangelists at Red Hat. None of them had an incentive to talk about CentOS much less contribute to it. I haven’t used CentOS in 9 years because I like getting a pay check. I was annoyed when customers wanted to talk to me about CentOS. I never contributed. I didn’t hate it, but I always viewed it as a wash – it garnered users of Red Hat technology, but these users very rarely contributed. I’ve never even seen a CentOS user file a RHEL issue (aka Bugzilla) or ping me on Twitter for CRI-O, Podman, Buildah, Skopeo, or anything else I work on at Red Hat. These users weren’t even on my radar. About a month ago, I installed CentOS Stream so that our team could collaborate with a customer on some Podman development. I didn’t have to feel dirty about pointing them to a downstream rebuild. With an upstream rebuild, the feedback is all directly useful to RHEL – feature requests, bugs, etc. This is powerful.&nbsp;</li>

<h2><span id="3_The_Life_Cycle_Commitment_Was_Changed">#3 The Life Cycle Commitment Was Changed</span></h2>
<p>The complaint is that the CentOS wiki originally said that CentOS 8 would be supported until 2029, and that this seems particularly egregious since CentOS 6 was recently deprecated.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><article><section><p>The year was 1996, and it’s the 11th of November. Macarena is topping the charts, Bill Clinton wins his second presidential term, and an article in a very peculiar e-zine is published which would change the world of information security forever. The publication in question was Phrack, an e-zine for and by hackers. The article in question was Aleph One’s “Smashing the Stack for fun and profit”, thus began what many regards as the golden age of software exploitation.</p>
<p>Smashing the stack for fun and profit was the first-ever article to in detail describe the buffer overflow vulnerability. Sure, buffer overflows were already being exploited in the wild prior to the release of Aleph One paper, but it had never been documented to this extent before. A lot has happened since the golden days. We have 64 bit-systems, compiler protections, kernel protections, and so on. While the examples from the paper aren’t possible without some dangerous compiler tweaks, the essence of the stack-based buffer overflow is still the same.</p>
<h2>Buffer Overflows</h2>
<p>So, what is a buffer overflow? An easy way to explain it is to imagine a spreadsheet containing a list of items. Each item has an id, a name, and a price. Imagine has implemented a very poor system for updating the items.</p>
<p>Now, what would happen if someone entered in a bunch of A’s while updating the name? Since this terrible spreadsheet app lacks bounds checking on the name, the value of name overflows into the price field. Now the price of the third item is 9 A’s. If we think a little more creatively about this, this means that we are able to write anything we want to the price field by carefully crafting a payload, that allows us to set the price to 1. Now that would be bad for business.</p>
<p>Ok, now we know the essence of what a buffer flow is, but what about the stack?</p>
<h2>The Stack</h2>
<p>Imagine a stack of plates, you can put (push) another plate on top of the already stacked plates, and you can remove a plate (pop) from the stack. I won’t go into great detail about how it works, but what you need to know is that each program executed by the operating system has its own stack, but instead of dinner plates the stack stores stack frames. You see, every time a program calls a function, it pushes a new stack frame on the stack. This frame contains the parameters for the function, its variables, and data needed to get back to the previous frame.</p>
<h2>The Return Pointer</h2>
<p>An important part of data needed to return from the function is the return pointer. It stores the memory address for where to resume execution after a function has been called. You can think of this part of the stack frame as the price field from the spreadsheet example. If you can overwrite the return pointer, you may redirect the code flow of the program.</p>
<h2>Exploitation</h2>
<p>But how do we redirect the code flow? The classic way, as described in smashing the stack, is to use shellcode. Shellcode is raw machine code, which typically executes a command shell. The attack creates the payload, by figuring out how much input is needed in order to overflow the return pointer. This is typically done by trial and error with the aid of a debugger. Next, the attacker uses the debugger to find the location of where the shellcode will end up in memory. If the exploit is successful, it will overflow the return address with the location of the shellcode, start executing the shellcode.</p>
<p>Now a lot has happened since the 90s, and the buffer overflow like it is presented in smashing the stack for fun and profit is no longer exploitable on modern systems. However, as application hardening evolved so did the techniques for exploitation.</p>
<p>The first defense against these sorts of attacks was NX, non-executable stack. This mitigation prevents code being executed in regions of the stack meant for data. This mitigation prevents the use of shellcode on the stack, but from this a very clever trick was discovered.</p>
<h2>Return-To-Libc</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, the return pointer has to point to a valid memory address. We cannot redirect code execution to somewhere on the stack, as it is marked as non-executable. But what if we point it to somewhere that already exists? Enter the return-to-libc technique. The concept is simple, we jump to a already existing function that will allow us to get code execution. There's multiple way to do this, but the most popular is to jump to the c library function <code>system()</code>.</p>
<p>We can't jump directly into <code>system()</code>, as it needs to be called with a useful string such as <code>/bin/sh</code>. In order to pull this off, we can leverage program instructions that modify cpu registers or the stack, as long as they are followed by a return instruction. The return instruction moves the stack pointer, meaning that we can chain together multiple instructions, as it will return into the next memory address we supply on the chain. These instructions are known as gadgets. By using this technique, we can write the string <code>bin/sh</code> in the register that is used as the first function parameter (on 32-bit systems, functions parameters are pushed onto the stack instead).</p>
<h2>ROP</h2>
<p>Actually, we don't even need access to library functions at all. If we chain together enough gadgets in a clever way, we can execute directly by using a system call. This is known as return-oriented programming (ROP) and is actually Turing complete! Meaning we can make the program to behave in any way we desire. Some people have actually implemented programming languages that run on top of a vulnerable program using return-oriented programming!</p>
<h2>Stack Cookies, ASLR and PIE</h2>
<p>Further attempts were made to stop exploitation, but they only succeed at making exploitation more involved. Like stack cookies, a special numeric value placed before the return pointer. If you corrupt this value, execution will terminate. However, these can be leaked and in some cases brute-forced.</p>
<p>Next we have ASLR, or address space layout randomization. This mitigations offsets memory addresses with a random value. This can be defeated by leaking addresses in order to calculate the offset.</p>
<p>The last one we're going to cover is Position Independent Executables or PIE for short. This mitigation is used in combination with ASLR. PIE randomly shuffles each section of the program i.e., we no longer know where anything is in memory. This makes leaking a lot more complicated, but it is defeatable by getting the right memory leaks.</p></section></article></div></div>]]>

<p>Here is my personal list of legally free Python books. <strong>Warning: Packt free books are highly unreliable, what can be free today can no longer be free tomorrow They were included as they are free at the time of writing this post. Similarly is Oreilly’s case. The two publishing houses have been annotated as necessary.</strong> In case of no longer free or broken links please mail me at `arj.python at gmail dot com` to update article. I have to thank the internet who took the pain to point these resources to me. I have skimmed through the contents to producs a list of legally free Python books of value. Here’s how i evaluated books (you might not agree, but that’s my personal take on it):</p>




<p>Some popular listed books like Python Module of the Week  is not a book and Tango with Django 1.7 is outdated.  Materials which provide only some free chapters are not free books. Docs manuals are docs manuals, you’d have to include a quarter of pypi’s packages manuals then. github projects are gihub projects unless it’s a book. Mark pilgrim ran away so should we from his book. We don’t want some illegal 100+ free list (Mark Lutz books are not free mind you), you could include all Python books hosted on drive then. Python2 is past, we passed over. Fullstackpython’s list is a collection of various sites’ articles, not a book. Really short books more qualified as leaflets did not make it. Such materials have been deliberately left out. What remains are books that you’ll enjoy!</p><p>

<p> Muhammad Yasoob Ullah Khalid </p>



<p> Python is an amazing language with a strong and friendly community of programmers. However, there is a lack of documentation on what to learn after getting the basics of Python down your throat. Through this book I aim to solve this problem. I would give you bits of information about some interesting topics which you can further explore. The topics which are discussed in this book open up your mind towards some nice corners of Python language. This book is an outcome of my desire to have something like this when I was beginning to learn Python. If you are a beginner, intermediate or even an advanced programmer there is something for you in this book. Please note that this book is not a tutorial and does not teach you Python. The topics are not explained in depth, instead only the minimum required information is given.  A true example of legally free Python books. </p>



<h3><a href="http://ralsina.gitlab.io/boxes-book/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Boxes: Your Second Python Book</a></h3>



<p>Roberto Alcina</p>



<p>This book tries to achieve only one thing: Show you a project go from&nbsp;<strong>nothing</strong>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<strong>OK</strong>. By nothing I mean, no code at all. Not even a fleshed idea of what it does. No goals, no commitments. Just a vague interest. And by OK I mean it will work, it will have tests, it will be available to use, it will be&nbsp;<strong>useful</strong>&nbsp;and be a real thing. Think of it as a sort of documentary on the beginnings of a rock band, only instead of rockers there is a single overweight Argentinian dev, and instead of a band there is a piece of software. So, not much like a documentary on the beginnings of a rock band.</p>



<h3><a href="https://learnpythonbreakpython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Learn Python, Break Python</a></h3>



<p>Scott Grant</p>



<p>Learn Python, Break Python is a hands-on introduction to the Python programming language, written for people who have no experience with programming whatsoever. Hey, we all have to start somewhere. As such, the examples and teaching style used in this text make absolutely no expectations about your prior programming experience. Anyone can pick up the art of programming with a little time and a bit of patience. However, when learning something new, I try to break things. In fact, in many cases, I go out of my way to break stuff. When picking up a new concept like computer programming, you can actually increase your comfort level by figuring out the type of cases that are likely to break. You’ll see what data can be used and where, and when you inevitably run into errors later (like everyone does), you won’t be surprised.</p>



<h3><a href="https://www.eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/PyBook/swan.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Algorithmic Problem Solving with Python</a> </h3>



<p> John B. Schneider, Shira Lynn Broschat, Jess Dahmen </p>



<p>(Not an algo book) Python’s syntax and idioms are much easier to learn than those of most other full-featured languages. This book uses programming language Python to introduce folks to programming and algorithmic thinking. </p>



<h3> <a href="https://buildmedia.readthedocs.org/media/pdf/python-guide/latest/python-guide.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Hitchhiker’s Guide to Python.</a></h3>



<p>Kenneth Reitz</p>



<p> This opinionated guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best-practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily basis. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.slitherintopython.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Slither Into Python</a></h3>



<p> Slither into Python is an introduction to Python for complete beginners. No prior programming experience or computer science background is necessary. Unlike any other Python resources I have found (not that they’re not out there), they don’t explain important computer science concepts such as memory or “how computers work”. In this book I will cover the fundamentals of the Python language and also introduce these important concepts. Put simply,&nbsp;<em>coding</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>computer programming</em>&nbsp;is about making computers do what you want, Computer Science is about&nbsp;<em>how</em>&nbsp;computers do it. Each go hand-in-hand, help you learn faster and improve your overall understanding of a language! This book aims to do exactly that through Python. </p>



<h3><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/a-whirlwind-tour-of-python.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A Whirlwind Tour of Python</a></h3>



<p>Jake VanderPlas – Oreilly</p>



<p>The book provides a whirlwind tour of some of Python’s essential syntax and semantics, built-in data types and structures, function definitions, control flow statements, and other aspects of the language. My aim is that readers will walk away with a solid foundation from which to explore the data science stack just outlined. </p>



<h3><a href="https://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python For You and Me</a></h3>



<p>Kushal Das (Core Dev)</p>



<p> A book for the total new comers into Python world. Was started as book for students before they read Python tutorial. Given it’s from a core dev, even up to chapter choice order is insightful.</p>



<h3> <a href="https://prappleizer.github.io/textbook.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Python for Astronomers </a></h3>



<p> Imad Pasha, Christopher Agostino </p>



<p> This text is designed to be an introduction to the Python programming language — which is now used nearly ubiquitously in astronomy — with applications to the types of tasks an undergraduate (or beginning graduate student) might have to tackle. It is not, in any way, meant to be comprehensive; my focus is on bringing you up to speed as efficiently and quickly as possible. This text might have useful information for those with a working knowledge of Python outside of a research setting, but is primarily designed for those with no prior programming experience. By the end of this text, I hope to have shared enough to make you feel comfortable taking the first steps into research-type problems (of which this book will contain several examples), whether in an astronomy course, a research internship, or on-campus research. </p>



<h3><a href="https://leanpub.com/intermediatepython" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OBI Intermediate Python</a></h3>



<p> Obi Ike-Nwosu </p>



<p>The python ecosystem is awash with books for beginners but few books target readers that are past the beginning stages but are not yet advanced users. The book aims to bridge that gap. The content of this book looks primarily at the various means for code organization in Python and provides user with a rigorous grounding in these. it dives into topics such as python object system, functions, decorators, metaprogramming and generators providing the reader with an in-depth knowledge of these topics that is essential for writing idiomatic and robust python code. It aims to&nbsp; provide a reader with not only a …</p></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemscope=""><p><a itemprop="keywords" title="category page" href="https://www.btctimes.com/news/category/bitcoin">Bitcoin</a></p><!----><!----><!----><p dir="ltr"><strong>If you’ve been following Bitcoin for any amount of time, Michael Saylor needs no introduction. As the founder and CEO of MicroStrategy, Saylor captured a zeitgeist when his publicly traded company announced a<a href="https://ir.microstrategy.com/news-releases/news-release-details/microstrategy-adopts-bitcoin-primary-treasury-reserve-asset" target="_blank">&nbsp;$250 million</a> bitcoin purchase in August. Since then, he has increased the company’s Bitcoin investment to<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/cash-is-trash-so-lets-bet-425-million-on-bitcoin-11604070071" target="_blank">&nbsp;$425 million</a> and ratcheted up his<a href="https://www.btctimes.com/news/Saylor-reveals-personal-bitcoin-holdings-microstrategy-buy-more" target="_blank">&nbsp;personal holdings</a>, all while starring in relentless in GigaChad memes. After months of pestering, I finally pinned Michael Saylor down for a chat with the BTC Times.</strong></p><hr><p dir="ltr">“Stop talking about regulatory arbitrage. Censorship-resistance, privacy, and tax evasion are bad ideas. We hate that.”</p><p dir="ltr">The conversation began with a huge letdown. I had asked Michael Saylor what could motivate greater institutional investment in Bitcoin—after all, if Bitcoin is going to the moon, we’re gonna need a lot of deep pockets to climb on board.&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">“People with billions of dollars don’t want to invest in crypto networks that support anarchists,” Saylor explained.</p><p dir="ltr">Anything that advertises privacy and freedom from government theft becomes a direct enemy of the FBI, Interpol, and every law enforcement agency on the planet.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s understandable that wealthy investors don’t want to antagonize the State; they tend to be the government’s biggest beneficiaries. That places them fundamentally at odds with Bitcoin’s philosophical goals. Proof-of-work, block size limits, and full nodes are expensive and wasteful prerequisites to secure the network from third-party interference. Institutional investors apparently hate these things, but the growing list of<a href="https://bitcointreasuries.org/" target="_blank">&nbsp;Bitcoin Treasuries</a> suggests that we can reconcile our differences.</p><p dir="ltr">I asked Saylor if this was a marketing problem.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">It’s a matter of emphasis. The industry would benefit if we didn’t call Bitcoin a cryptocurrency, but a crypto asset.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">As a “currency,” Bitcoin not only competes with the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, it also implies a payment network to compete with Square, Apple Pay, Alipay, and other services that are both faster and cheaper. Maybe that’s why even the venture capitalists on Sand Hill Road still struggle with Bitcoin as a technology. They see it as either a bet on the collapse of Western Civilization, or a heavily impaired PayPal.</p><p dir="ltr">What about Bitcoin Lightning?</p><p dir="ltr">“Inspirational, but it’s not going to displace Apple or Alipay,” Saylor points out, “right now, Bitcoin’s number one source of energy is the support from Square Cash and PayPal. These are two things that directly compete with the Lightning network.”</p><p dir="ltr">This might offend the Bitcoin crowd, but it’s actually a strong endorsement. A successful “cryptocurrency” might achieve a market cap on par with Square, but beyond payments lies a $300 trillion ocean of assets. We returned to the impetus behind MicroStrategy’s Bitcoin purchase: “Every company, every organization has the same problem: How do I conserve my money? When fiat currencies are debasing, that means every single investment is probably being inflated away.”&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">“Bitcoin is best as a basic network that stores value,” Saylor continues. “It solves the problem for all the money and all the people on the planet.” This year’s bull market coincides with a deadly pandemic, but maybe the price run wasn’t driven by the prospect of societal collapse so much as the profligate printing of money.</p><p dir="ltr">In that case, it makes no sense to compare Bitcoin with altcoins like ETH and TRON. That’s like listing Chuck E. Cheese tokens on the Chicago Board of Trade. Bitcoin should be alongside corporate bonds, real estate investment trusts, gold, and 30-year Treasuries. The reason it’s not is because crypto exchanges don’t make money if people just buy and HODL.</p><p dir="ltr">Crypto exchanges are one of the biggest things holding back the industry: “It’s dysfunctional for the exchanges to list all the other altcoins. It is absolutely insane that they offer 100X leverage. It attracts people that have gambling addictions.” Saylor likens this to a drug dealer selling Vicodin laced with Fentanyl: “The industry can’t grow if you overdose or kill all your customers with too much leverage. It sets back the entire cause by many, many years.”&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Besides, professional wealth managers don’t want to feel like they’re dropping client funds onto a roulette table. “99.9% of the money doesn't want to juggle altcoins on fire. 99.9% of the money just wants to keep their money.”</p><p dir="ltr">Eventually, Bitcoin may become the gateway through which institutional money flows to tokens and altcoins, but at this point, any attempt to supplant Bitcoin will hurt the industry as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">The Lindy effect is real. “Integrity is by far the number one deliverable of Bitcoin,” Saylor says. “Institutional investors need reliability and longevity. You have to watch the network run for three to five years without any failure before you even begin to think you can trust it.”&nbsp;</p><p dir="ltr">Over the past decade, Bitcoin developers have been careful to emphasize the experimental nature of the technology. In fact, the latest release of Bitcoin Core is only 0.20, implying the software is still in beta.</p><p dir="ltr">To those unfamiliar with cypherpunk prudence, the abundance of caution borders on paranoia. Bitcoin satellites and fireproof hardware wallets don’t resonate with professional wealth managers. These people have a fiduciary duty to their clients and can’t joke about Citadels and civilizational collapse.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Developing for edge cases hardens the network, but people like Jeff Bezos aren’t optimizing for the zombie apocalypse.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Network resilience is crucial; the irony is that everything that makes Bitcoin robust and stable are things that would horrify a professional wealth manager. Self-custody, for instance.</p><p dir="ltr">A willingness to “Be your own bank” is a fundamental part of decentralization. But according to Saylor, no employee at an investment firm is going to accept responsibility for the corporate private keys. Even with multisignature wallets, he compares key management to handling an explosive device: “It’s like finding three of your employees and giving each one some nitroglycerin. ‘Take this home with you and bring it back in the morning. The three of you be careful, and don’t get too close to each other. And don’t drop it.’”</p><p dir="ltr">Then there are practical concerns. Saylor declined to discuss his company’s key management strategy, but pointed out that it’s not always a matter of choice. Companies exist in physical jurisdictions with accounting rules that control how crypto assets must be acquired and handled. “These considerations impact the way institutions carry the asset on their balance sheet and how it reflects it on their P&amp;L statements,” he says. For example, current<a href="https://www.aicpa.org/content/dam/aicpa/interestareas/informationtechnology/downloadabledocuments/accounting-for-and-auditing-of-digital-assets.pdf" target="_blank">&nbsp;GAAP accounting</a> rules treat cryptocurrency as an intangible asset, a classification typically reserved for illiquid things like IP and trademarks.</p><p dir="ltr">Corporate partnerships can help resolve these challenges. Bitcoiners tend to be wary of trusted third parties, but tech companies like Apple and Facebook have the ability to bring Bitcoin to the next billion users. Saylor cautions against exclusionary arrogance: “Bitcoin can become a monetary network and an instrument of economic empowerment, but the best way to do that is incrementally and pragmatically, while in harmony with the political system.” </p><p dir="ltr">It’s a catch-22. If Bitcoin is to become a sovereign money, it needs to spread to every corner of the Earth. In order to spread to every corner of the Earth, it can’t storm out of the gate screaming about crypto anarchy. Square and Paypal integrations don’t need to be the endgame, but they’ll help us get there.</p><p dir="ltr">That doesn’t mean developers shouldn’t continue to improve privacy and censorship resistance; it just needn’t feature in an investor prospectus. After all, wealth managers don’t go off about the military’s nuclear arsenal when considering a purchase of Treasury Bonds. It’s a testament to Bitcoin’s technological success that unforgeable costliness and network resilience are now taken for granted. Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic, as they say.</p><p dir="ltr">What about the cypherpunk manifesto, the one where we arise and cast off our barbed wire fences? For the die-hard crypto anarchists, institutional money may seem anathema. It’s not necessarily a bad thing, according to Saylor:</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">If Bitcoin goes up by a factor of ten, these early HODLers are all going to be insanely rich. They can use their monetary energy to invent stuff and make the world a better place.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Maybe it’s a fact of life that anything cool and subversive is eventually co-opted by corporate interests, from punk rock to cypherpunk. There’s a never-ending search for the next disruptive thing. We can either complain and rail against the inevitable, or shut up and take their money.</p><!----><!----><div><div><p><img alt="clapping image" src="https://image.btctimes.com/fit-in/200x200/e299a519b673472199379a1e21e051db.png"></p><p>13</p><p><span>+ 1</span></p></div></div><div><div itemprop="about"><p><a href="https://www.btctimes.com/author/elaine-ou"><img itemprop="image" alt="author avatar image" src="https://image.btctimes.com/fit-in/400x200/958178613b4548d1aa2b47fe39c5ab73.jpg"></a></p></div><p> Elaine is an editor at the BTC Times.

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article><div><div><p>Nexus is a library originally authored by <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://twitter.com/tgriesser">Tim Griesser</a> that allows developers to build code-first and type-safe GraphQL APIs. Prisma has been a core contributor to the library for over two years and has helped shape its evolution.</p><p>Today, we're happy to announce that we've released Nexus 1.0.</p><p>This release is the culmination of outstanding community feedback and contributions, years of battle-testing Nexus in production, and responding to lessons learned in creating an excellent developer experience for those building GraphQL APIs.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Prisma's products are no longer GraphQL-centric. You can use Prisma in a REST API, a GraphQL API, or in any other setting where you want to access a database in Node or Go. Although we contribute to Nexus, it is not necessary to use it alongside Prisma. <a href="https://www.prisma.io/">Find out more</a> about what Prisma offers and how to use it.</p><h2 id="what-is-nexus"><a href="#what-is-nexus" aria-label="what is nexus permalink"></a>What is Nexus?</h2><p>Nexus offers a way to build code-first GraphQL APIs in Node. The code-first approach to building a GraphQL API is in contrast to the (potentially more common) schema-first approach.</p><p>Most developers that are new to building GraphQL APIs start out by taking the schema-first approach that has been popularized by companies like Apollo and their Apollo Server offering.</p><p>With the schema-first approach, writing the GraphQL API requires a set of <strong>type definitions</strong> and accompanying <strong>resolvers</strong>. A simple schema-first server might look like this:</p><pre><code>type Post <span>{</span>
  <span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
  <span>body</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
type Query <span>{</span>
  <span>posts</span><span>:</span> <span>[</span>Post<span>]</span><span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><pre><code><span>const</span> Query <span>=</span> <span>{</span>
  posts<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span>
    <span>{</span>
      id<span>:</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span>
      title<span>:</span> <span>'My first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
      body<span>:</span> <span>'How I wrote my first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
    <span>}</span><span>,</span>
  <span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>While the schema-first approach is easy to get started with, it comes with some inherent drawbacks that can make development difficult when applications start getting bigger.</p><p>Nexus takes a different approach to building GraphQL APIs. Instead of keeping a separate schema and set of resolvers, with Nexus, schemas and resolvers are written in the same spot using code.</p><p>Refactoring the Post example above to Nexus would look like this:</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> objectType<span>,</span> queryType<span>,</span> makeSchema <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'nexus'</span>

<span>const</span> Post <span>=</span> <span>objectType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

    t<span>.</span><span>string</span><span>(</span><span>'title'</span><span>)</span>
    t<span>.</span><span>string</span><span>(</span><span>'body'</span><span>)</span>
  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>

<span>const</span> Query <span>=</span> <span>queryType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  <span>definition</span><span>(</span>t<span>)</span> <span>{</span>
    t<span>.</span>list<span>.</span><span>field</span><span>(</span><span>'posts'</span><span>,</span> <span>{</span>
      resolve<span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>[</span>
        <span>{</span>
          id<span>:</span> <span>'1'</span><span>,</span>
          title<span>:</span> <span>'My first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
          body<span>:</span> <span>'How I wrote my first GraphQL server'</span><span>,</span>
        <span>}</span><span>,</span>
      <span>]</span><span>,</span>

  <span>}</span><span>,</span>

<span>const</span> schema <span>=</span> <span>makeSchema</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  types<span>:</span> <span>[</span>Post<span>,</span> Query<span>]</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>There are numerous benefits to taking a code-first approach with Nexus, including:</p><ul><li>Schema and resolver co-location</li><li>SDL and type generation</li><li>No need for extra tooling</li></ul><h3 id="schema-and-resolver-co-location"><a href="#schema-and-resolver-co-location" aria-label="schema and resolver co location permalink"></a>Schema and Resolver Co-location</h3><p>When building a schema-first GraphQL API, it is common to start out by placing all type definitions and resolvers in a single file. When both the schema and the resolvers live next to one another, it's fairly straightforward to work in both at the same time.</p><p>As the application grows, however, it is most often desired to move parts of the schema into their own separate modules and files. It's at this point that working on a GraphQL API becomes a bit more tedious. With this modularization comes the need to switch back and forth between the Schema Definition Language and JavaScript/TypeScript to write the resolvers. Not only does one need to constantly switch between files, they also need to do a context switch mentally to work between the two langauges.</p><p>With Nexus, our schema and its resolvers are always defined together. Nexus also allows us to write everything in a common language. This allows us to side-step the co-location/context switching issue altogether and helps us to be more productive, even as our applications grow to be quite large.</p><h3 id="automatic-type-and-schema-definition-language-generation"><a href="#automatic-type-and-schema-definition-language-generation" aria-label="automatic type and schema definition language generation permalink"></a>Automatic Type and Schema Definition Language Generation</h3><p>One major benefit of using Nexus is its ability to automatically generate TypeScript types and GraphQL Schema Definition Language (SDL) files. The generated types are useful for adding extra type safety to the code used to power your GraphQL API. The generated SDL files can be used for many purposes. For example, we can configure our editors to know about the shape of our APIs to give us introspection for the queries and mutations we write.</p><p>Type and SDL generation comes for free with Nexus and can be enabled by supplying some configuration in the <code>makeSchema</code> call.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> path <span>from</span> <span>'path'</span>
<span>const</span> schema <span>=</span> <span>makeSchema</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

Read the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/graphql-nexus/nexus/releases/tag/1.0.0">full changelog</a> and follow along below to see what's new!</p><h3 id="new-package-name"><a href="#new-package-name" aria-label="new package name permalink"></a>New Package Name</h3><p>Nexus 1.0 is now available under the <code>nexus</code> package name. All imports now come from <code>nexus</code> and not <code>@nexus/schema</code>.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> makeSchema <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'nexus'</span>

</code></pre><h3 id="changes-to-nullability"><a href="#changes-to-nullability" aria-label="changes to nullability permalink"></a>Changes to Nullability</h3><p>In previous versions of Nexus, fields were treated as non-nullable by default. This differed from other GraphQL API frameworks which would treat fields as nullable unless otherwise specified. The Nexus authors took this approach because allowing fields to be non-nullable by default posed some long-term risks for API development.</p><p>The default nullability for fields has now been inverted in Nexus so that we can align with GraphQL best practices and expectations, specifically from the authors of GraphQL.</p><p>At Nexus 1.0, you need to explicitly make fields non-null:</p><pre><code><span>const</span> Post <span>=</span> <span>objectType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>
  name<span>:</span> <span>'Post'</span><span>,</span>

  <span>}</span><span>,</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>The SDL for this type would look like this:</p><pre><code>type Post <span>{</span>
  <span>id</span><span>:</span> ID<span>!</span>
  <span>title</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
  <span>body</span><span>:</span> String<span>!</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre><p>The code for the <code>Post</code> object type above uses a property called <code>nonNull</code> which offers a bit more flexibility for specifying that fields should be non-null. It's useful for situations where the chaining API is not ideal, such as expressing deeply-nested types and when programmatically creating non-nullable types.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> queryType<span>,</span> stringArg<span>,</span> nonNull <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'nexus'</span>

  <span>}</span>
<span>}</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>The <code>nonNull</code> function accepts an argument which can be used to specify the type for a type or argument.</p><p>While fields are now nullable by default, it's possible to change this behavior either globally or at the type level in your Nexus API.</p><div><pre><code><span>queryType</span><span>(</span><span>{</span>

  <p><em>This article belongs to a series of articles about caching. The code in this article can be found at <a href="https://github.com/wb14123/redis_lease">my Github repo</a>.</em></p>

<ol>
  <li><em><a href="https://www.binwang.me/2020-11-02-Use-TLA+-to-Verify-Cache-Consistency.html">Use TLA+ to Verify Cache Consistency</a>.</em></li>
  <li><em>Redis Implementation for Cache and Database Consistency. (This one)</em></li>
</ol>

<p>In the <a href="https://www.binwang.me/2020-11-02-Use-TLA+-to-Verify-Cache-Consistency.html">last article</a>, we introduced an algorithm (described in paper <a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/6.824/papers/memcache-fb.pdf">Scaling Memcache at Facebook</a>) that can do a better job to maintain the data consistency between cache and database. We also used TLA+ to model the algorithm and verified it. In this article, we are going to implement the algorithm in real world for Redis. The implementation is very simple and doesn’t need to change Redis itself. It’s implemented it by using Redis script. However, it’s much harder to verify the correctness. In order to do it, I used <a href="https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a> to test it. If you look at the language analysis for the Github repo, you can see most of them are tests. The Redis script implementation, which is written in Lua, is only 5.1% of the project.</p>

<h2 id="algorithm-description">Algorithm Description</h2>

<p>We’ve described the algorithm in the previous article and even write a TLA+ model for it. But just make it easier for the readers, I’ll briefly describe the algorithm here again. Basically, whenever the client get a value from cache, it will be assigned a unique ID (lease) for the key. When the client writes back a new value, it needs to provide the  key’s newest lease ID. And delete the key will also invalidate all its leases.</p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>

<p>The implementation uses <a href="https://redis.io/commands/eval">Redis script</a>, which is written in Lua. It can implement multiple operations and make them atomic. In theory, this can also be done by client, but Redis script provides a consistent implementation across different clients and makes it easier to use. The algorithm is easy, so the implementation is also straight forward. The implementations are under <a href="https://github.com/wb14123/redis_lease/tree/master/scripts">scripts directory of the repo</a>. These scripts also works for Redis cluster (but I didn’t use Jepsen to test it under cluster mode). Here is an example implementation for get:</p>

<div><div>
  <div><pre><span> <a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a></span><span>local</span> <span>key</span> = <span><span>'</span><span>{</span><span>'</span></span>..KEYS[<span>1</span>]..<span><span>'</span><span>}</span><span>'</span></span>
<span> <a href="#n2" name="n2">2</a></span><span>local</span> <span>token</span> = ARGV[<span>1</span>]
<span> <a href="#n3" name="n3">3</a></span><span>local</span> <span>value</span> = redis.call(<span><span>'</span><span>get</span><span>'</span></span>, key)
<span> <a href="#n4" name="n4">4</a></span><span>if</span> <span>not</span> value <span>then</span>
<span> <a href="#n5" name="n5">5</a></span>    redis.replicate_commands()
<span> <a href="#n6" name="n6">6</a></span>    <span>local</span> <span>lease_key</span> = <span><span>'</span><span>lease:</span><span>'</span></span>..key
<span> <a href="#n7" name="n7">7</a></span>    redis.call(<span><span>'</span><span>set</span><span>'</span></span>, lease_key, token)
<span> <a href="#n8" name="n8">8</a></span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>{</span><span>false</span>, token<span>}</span></span>
<span> <a href="#n9" name="n9">9</a></span><span>else</span>
<span><strong><a href="#n10" name="n10">10</a></strong></span>    <span>return</span> <span><span>{</span>value, <span>false</span><span>}</span></span>
<span><a href="#n11" name="n11">11</a></span><span>end</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>After load the script, you can use it like this:</p>

<div><div>
  <div><pre><span><a href="#n1" name="n1">1</a></span>redis-cli evalsha &lt;script_sha1&gt; 1 &lt;key&gt; &lt;uniq_id&gt;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>It will return <code>value, nil</code> if there is value for the key, or <code>nil, lease</code> if there is no value.</p>

<p>One optimization here is, if we have value for the key, we will not store the lease. That’s because in our use case, if we can get the value, we will not get it from database and write back to the cache. This avoids a lot of memory overhead.</p>

<p>Another important decision I made is, when get the value, the client needs to provide a unique ID instead of let Redis provide one. This is because I cannot find a good way to generate unique ID in Redis cluster. In a single instance, it’s easy: just use a key and inc the value each time. You can still generate unique IDs for different keys on a cluster, but it adds a lot of memory overhead. So I decided to let clients provide it. Luckily, it’s not hard, basically every language has UUID implementation and that’s good enough.</p>

<h2 id="testing">Testing</h2>

<p>It’s easy to implement something, but very hard to make sure it’s correct. We can use TLA+ to model the algorithm and explore the state space, or use mathematical method to proof the correctness in theory. But once we implement the algorithm, it’s something different. We cannot make sure it’s exactly the same as what we’ve proofed. That’s why I find using Coq to implement, proof and generate real code is fantastic. But in this case, it’s not implemented in Coq, so we must find some other way to test it. By testing, we still cannot make sure it’s 100% correct, we can just explore as many situations as we can and make sure the system doesn’t behaves in a way we don’t expect.</p>

<p>The tool we use here is <a href="https://jepsen.io/">Jepsen</a>. It provides lots of tools to make it easy to test distributed systems. It can generate many concurrent requests, import different kinds of failures (host down, network partition, clock drift, and so on) to the system, record all the requests and responses, and check the history at the end.</p>

<p>Here is the test case I write: for each client, generate random read and write operations. For read operation, read from cache first, if the value is not found, read from database and write back to the data. For write operations, write to the database and delete the key from cache. Then after all the read and write operations, check whether the data in cache and database are the same. The test case is very simple, it implemented the way we would use the cache.</p>

<p>By providing different arguments to the test command, you can run the test case with raw Redis get/set/del operations, or use get/set/del operation implemented by the scripts. You can also import cache failure during the test.</p>

<p>If we run the test with raw Redis operations, we can find the test is failed. In the last article, we discussed that using plain get/set/del cache operations cannot guarantee cache consistency, so this is expected. If we run the test with our scripts, we can find the test passed. If we run the test with cache system failure, we can see the test failed, which is also expected from last article. The inconsistent because of cache failure can be resolved by clean up cache data after restart. But if the client is failed, it will have the same problem (I didn’t write the test case for this because it’s hard to test client failure in Jepsen), but it’s not a very good idea to cleanup cache in this case. Because client fails all the time, cleanup cache will make operations slow. The best way might be to setup an expire time so the data can be consistent after the key is expired.</p>

<p>Even though all the test result is expected, it doesn’t make sure the implementation is correct, since there are still many situation I didn’t test, like Redis cluster, network partition, database failure and so on. So welcome to add new test cases and break the system!</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
			<p>Eight illustrations by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Szukalski">Stanislav Szukalski</a> from <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Behold-Protong-Stanislav-Szukalski/dp/0867195193/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1198286798&amp;sr=8-1">Behold!!! The Protong</a> — a sampling of his 39 volume oeuvre on the science of Zermatism.</p>
<p>Szukalski was a polymath who, over a lifetime, developed a science that integrated singular theories in geology (cyclic deluges), anthropology (universal pictographs), linguistics (Protong, a universal first language), zoology (Yeti), anthropolitics (Yetinsyn), with many etceteras.  Common to his arguments is an overwhelming accretion of the <em>visual evidence</em>.</p>
<p>“Looking through thousands of illustrated books, I have learned how to SEE. Since childhood I have been addicted to seeing ‘pictures’ in books… I learned not only to look, but really SEE, for I did not know English yet and had to jump to CONCLUSIONS. In fact, I evolved the, to other people unnatural, instinct for UNDERSTANDING things, without knowing what they were. Looking became my life’s OBSESSION. When I am dying I will despair over the fact that I will no more be able to Look and See” (p14).</p>
<p>A sample of Szukalski’s science, on the subject of tribal flood scumlines:</p>
<p>“When the Secondary Globe (the lavaic ocean bottoms) began to submerge in the beginning of the last Farsolar Epoch, the global seas were forced to glide off the Primary (Geologic) Globe. The soil of all the lands that were re-emerging was washed off by the departing seas and the water of the globe became very muddy. In fact, Plato, after visiting Egyptian temples, learned of the chronicles that spoke of the Mediterranan Sea as ‘The Sea of Mud’. Homer’s Iliad was about Ilium (the Latin word for ancient Troy) which in Protong means ‘Mire Remembered’. The state of Illinois, U.S.A. is named after the Illinois River, and in Protong (‘Illi No J(e) Z’) actually means ‘Mire made-Born is From’.</p>
<p>“Wherever the terrified diluvial escapees shored re-emerging lands, their faces were caked with mud. And since each swam differently, each would emerge with individual muddy water ripples across the face. So when they lay there in the mud in the deadly faint, exhausted beyond words, and were found by earlier arrivees on that islet, the facial mud markings were remembered and the Flood Scumlines became the tribal markings. I have an entire volume on these Scumlines with 195 such drawings from every part of the globe” (p31).</p>
<p>Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-Rapa-Nui-head-19.jpg" alt="Rapa Nui head"></p>
<p>A head from Rapa Nui (Easter Island). “The horizontal line [the Flood Scumline] below the nose clearly shows that the ancestor swam to that island in the last Nearsolar Deluge” (p19).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-black-lines-24.jpg" alt="black lines"></p>
<p>“In Equador and the vicinity of the Panama Canal there are Indians who paint their bodies with black lines emulating the waters in which they stood. They repeat the same lines on their faces, but the topmost of these crosses their noses, just below the eyes. This means that their diluvial ancestor buried his face under the water while swimming and made a stronger stroke with his arms when he came up to get air” (p25).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-Eskimo-20.jpg" alt="Eskimo"></p>
<p>“This Eskimo’s diluvial ancestor swam with the nostrils under water, coming up to inhale while starting his arm strokes” (p20).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-Polish-funerary-jar-22.jpg" alt="Polish funerary jar"></p>
<p>“One of the many funerary jars for holding the ashes of the cremated dead. This one is from prehistoric Poland… Atop the head reposes the cover in the shape of Easter Island. On their necks are many metal necklaces and, as in this one, the image vomits the salt water of the sea. These rings on the neck emulate the water ripples spreading from a drowning person. Usually, there is a large ‘spzilla’ (Polish for ‘pin’) as a Rebus for ‘Z Bi La’ [Protong], which tells us that the person cremated came ‘From Killed (by) Flood’ land and to there was returning” (p22).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-Chiaco-flood-scumline-21.jpg" alt="Chiaco flood scumline"></p>
<p>“The Chiaco Indian tribe of Equador continue to mark their faces with the Flood Scumline on the very rim of their upper lip” (p20).</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-Etruscan-funerary-portrait-26.jpg" alt="Etruscan funerary portrait"></p>
<p>“A funerary portrait of a young man drawn from the lid of a large jar that holds the ashes of a cremated man. It was excavated in Italy and dates from the Etruscan period. On the man’s face the ancient tribal Flood Scumline was engraved, crossing his mask just below his nose, emulating a beard. However, the vertical direction of continuous lines tells us that this is really the draining water, heavy with mud.</p>
<p>“The two small circles on the chin and the edge of ripples around them made me turn the drawing upside down and there I saw that the mask resembled the Great Lioness (Easter Island), streaked with sliding-off water as if re-emerging from under the Flood” (p26).</p>
<p>An indication that contemporary Manapes also survived the Deluge:</p>
<p><img src="http://images.unurthed.com/Szukalski-Sasquatch-flood-scumline-76.jpg" alt="Sasquatch flood scumline"></p>
<p>“Among ancient carvings of the Dorset Culture of the Point Barrow region in Alaska, this mask was discovered which white men assume is an imaginary Devil. But you can plainly see that it is a portrait of a local Sasquatch. Incidentally, in the vertical lines we have a marvelous document. They were carved there to let us know that this creature, like the ancestors of the Alaskan Eskimos, also saved himself from the Deluge, for any lines, vertical or horizontal, represent ‘waters’, hence the Great Flood. There is still another pictograph, besides the vertical draining-off of muddy water. It is the horizontal line just below the nostrils which, by being placed above the water level, tell us that his breath, his SOUL, was saved” (p77).</p>
<p>“Those that saved themselves from drowning, noticed that these creatures also had the fortune to survive, so they named them accordingly, everywhere on this globe in one language, my Protong. The present name Sasquatch was then ‘Sa Z Gladz’, which means ‘Here From Destroyed’ (i.e. the deluged continent)” (p75-6).</p>

<p><em>All who eagerly perceive the as yet unnamed are vagabonds.</em></p>

<h2 id="problem">Problem</h2><p>I got on a call with the CEO of a company that helps businesses recruit tech talents. Let's call this company TechTalentRecruitment. The perfect customer profile for TechTalentRecruitment is small and medium-sized companies that are hiring for software engineers.</p><h2 id="getting-a-list-of-small-and-medium-companies">Getting a list of small and medium companies</h2><p>The prospect has a few requirements. The prospect's ideal customer profile is:</p><ol><li>A small or medium business. Venture capital funding signals can identify such companies.</li><li>Is looking to hire software engineers.</li><li>Located in the US, Germany, and Canada</li></ol><p>We will leave item number 2 for the next step. In the meantime, I exported a list of companies that matches item 1 and item 3 with Crunchbase Pro.</p><h2 id="use-proxycurl-linkedin-api-to-filter-for-companies-that-are-hiring-software-engineers-">Use Proxycurl Linkedin API to filter for companies that are hiring software engineers.</h2><p>To use the <a href="https://nubela.co/proxycurl/docs#linkedin-jobs-listing-endpoint">Job Listings endpoint in Proxycurl's Linkedin API</a>, I need the company's search_id. You can fetch the search_id of the company using <a href="https://nubela.co/proxycurl/docs#linkedin-company-profile-endpoint">Proxycurl's Linkedin Company Profile API endpoint</a>.</p><p>For each company in the exported CSV file, I will fetch its corresponding <em>search_id</em> like this:</p><pre><code>def get_search_id(coy_url):
    api_key = 'API_KEY'
    host = 'https://nubela.co/proxycurl'
    api_endpoint = f'{host}/api/linkedin/company'
    header_dic = {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + api_key,
                  }
    response = requests.get(api_endpoint,
                            params={'url': coy_url},
                            headers=header_dic)
    dic = response.json()
    return dic['search_id']
</code></pre>
<p>With the <code>search_id</code>, I will query for jobs posted by each company like this:</p><pre><code>def get_all_jobs(search_id):
    jobs = []
    page_no = 0
    while True:
        data = get_job_listing(search_id, page_no)
        if len(data['job']) == 0:
            break

        jobs += data['job']

        if data['next_page_no'] is not None:
            page_no = data['next_page_no']

    return jobs

  
def get_job_listing(search_id, page_no=0):
    api_key = 'API_KEY'
    host = 'https://nubela.co/proxycurl'
    api_endpoint = f'{host}/api/linkedin/company/job'
    header_dic = {'Authorization': 'Bearer ' + api_key}
    response = requests.get(api_endpoint,
                            params={'search_id': search_id,
                                    'page': page_no,
                                    },
                            headers=header_dic)
    return response.json()
</code></pre>
<p>The role of the job can be found in the response returned by the job listing endpoint. To verify that a job posted by a company is for a software engineer role, I will call <code>does_job_qualify()</code> function on it. (This function relies on a function I built that compares similar string; you can find the code for <a href="https://giki.wiki/@nubela/Software-Engineering/similar-string"><code>is_string_similar()</code> here</a>)</p><pre><code>def does_job_qualify(job):
    keywords = ['software engineer', 'backend engineer',
                'frontend engineer', 'software developer', 'software architect']
    for kw in keywords:
        if is_string_similar(kw, job['job_title']):
            return True
    return False
</code></pre><p>Putting it all together, this is how I take a list of companies exported from Crunchbase and identify companies that are hiring for software engineers</p><pre><code>def run():
    company_lis = get_company_lis()
    for idx, company_url in enumerate(company_lis):
        print(f"{idx}/{len(company_lis)}: Searching {company_url}")
        search_id = get_search_id(company_url)
        jobs = get_all_jobs(search_id)
        print(f"Found {len(jobs)} jobs")
        has_matching_jobs = list(map(does_job_qualify, jobs))
        if True in has_matching_jobs:
            print(f"SUCCESS! Adding to CSV.")
            append_valid_company(company_url)
</code></pre><h2 id="results">Results</h2><p>Out of 1000 Series A/B/C companies based in the US that I had exported from Crunchbase Pro, I found 286 companies that were actively hiring software engineers. Not bad. A 28% hit rate of prospect companies.</p><p><br><em>PS: Looking to wield Linkedin datasets for your company's growth efforts?

      <h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>Einstein has once confidently pointed out that under the assumptions of special relativity, matter, anything that has weight, cannot travel faster than constant light speed $c$.</p>



<p>In this blog post, I would like to use two mathematical approaches to show that why this is the case.</p>

<h3 id="relativistic-momentum-approach">Relativistic Momentum Approach</h3>

<p>In my previous blog <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Relativistic-Momentum-Relativistic-Mass/">post</a>, I have derived the expression of relativistic momentum.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
p &amp;= m_r v \\
&amp;= \gamma m_0 v \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $m_r$ is the relativistic mass at the velocity of $v$, and $m_0$ is the rest mass which does not change with velocity.</p><p>

\[\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\]

</p><p>Newtonâ€™s second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body is directly proportional to the force applied, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the applied force.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
F &amp;= \frac{dp}{dt} \\
&amp;= \frac{d(m_r v)}{dt} \\
&amp;= \frac{d(\gamma m_0 v)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d(\gamma v)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d\bigg(\frac{v}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}\bigg)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d\bigg(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{v^2} - \frac{1}{c^2}}}\bigg)}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{d ( v^{-2} - c^{-2} )^{-\frac{1}{2}}}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{-\frac{1}{2} ( v^{-2} - c^{-2} )^{-\frac{3}{2}} (-2) v^{-3} dv}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{ ( v^{-2} - c^{-2} )^{-\frac{3}{2}} (v^{2})^{-\frac{3}{2}} dv}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \frac{ \big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}} dv}{dt} \\
&amp;= m_0 \big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}}  \frac{dv}{dt} \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>We could easily see that if we apply a constant force to matter, as the velocity $v$ of matter approaches $c$, $\big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}} \rightarrow \infty$, the apparent acceleration $\frac{dv}{dt} \rightarrow 0$, meaning that the apparent acceleration becomes smaller with the constant force applied on the matter. When $v = c$, to make the matter travel faster than light, you would need to have a tiny apparent acceleration $\frac{dv}{dt}$. However, in this time, since $\big( 1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2} \big)^{-\frac{3}{2}} = \infty$, we would need to apply infinity large force $F$ to the matter, which is not plausible.</p>

<h3 id="mass-energy-equivalence-approach">Mass-Energy Equivalence Approach</h3>

<p>In my previous blog <a href="https://leimao.github.io/blog/Mass-Energy-Equivalence-Derivation/">post</a>, I have also derived the mass-energy equivalence.</p><p>

\[\begin{align}
E &amp;= m_r c^2 \\
&amp;= \gamma m_0 c^2 \\
\end{align}\]

</p><p>where $\gamma$ is the Lorentz factor, $m_r$ is the relativistic mass at the velocity of $v$, and $m_0$ is the rest mass.</p>



<p>We could easily see that as the velocity $v$ of matter approaches $c$, the Lorentz factor $\gamma \rightarrow \infty$, and the total energy of the matter $E \rightarrow \infty$. Based on the energy conservation, we would need to supply infinity energy to the matter to archive velocity $c$, which is not plausible.</p>

<p>In the fall of 2018, we noticed that there was something that set Google apart from other big tech companies. Everybody was talking about how to regulate these tech companies, and everybody had pretty good plans for how to do it — for every company besides Google. In our opinion, it was because nobody really seemed to understand what Google does, or how they do it. So, for the past two years, we’ve been researching and analyzing Google. Through this work, we’ve found some really compelling evidence about what powers Google’s monopoly, so much so that <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/2020/10/07/we-crawled-our-way-into-the-big-tech-antitrust-report/">Congress referenced this work as part of their recently released Big Tech Antitrust Report</a>. The big ideas that we have is that that crawling the web is a natural monopoly, that Google has control of that monopoly, and that once you understand why this is true and what it means it becomes pretty clear about what sorts of regulations should be taken to reign in Google’s power over the internet. </p>
<p>We have published on this website the economic arguments that we have developed that we think help people understand the foundations of Google and how to regulate<a href="https://knuckleheads.club/understanding-google/"> </a>them. Up until now we have done all this work in private, reaching out to and meeting with regulators on an individual basis. With the publishing of an article about this work in <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/14/technology/how-google-dominates.html">The New York Times</a>, we are publishing this research for everyone to read and opening up the club for people to join and participate in researching Google’s monopoly. We have a <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/whats-next/" data-type="page" data-id="2518">solid plan for the next year</a> about how to finish this research and work with legislators and governments to get legislation drafted and introduced to regulate Google’s web crawling advantages. If you find yourself agreeing with what you read on this website and get caught up imagining a better future where the internet isn’t just five big tech companies all cutting deals with each other, please consider <a href="https://knuckleheads.club/join-the-club/" data-type="page" data-id="2444">joining the Knuckleheads’ Club</a> and helping us fight to win a better world. </p>
<p>So, with all that said as an introduction, let’s dive into what Google is exactly. </p>

After requesting the SU password, they were told flat out it doesn’t exist and referred to the manual by the vendor. Taking that argument to the telco ombudsman got the same response. If there were one and you wanted to change it for security reasons, it looks like you can’t and with the vendors denying it’s existance, there’s no help coming.</p>
<p>So, the password for the SU account that doesn’t exist…</p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>



<p>China’s largest retailer, JD.com serves more than 300 million active customers with its e-commerce business. “A few years ago, it became apparent that as our data became more extensive, our MySQL databases became larger, resulting in declining performance and higher operations and maintenance costs,” says JD Retail Chief Architect Haifeng Liu. “We needed a solution that would enable us to easily and quickly scale MySQL, facilitate operation and maintenance, and reduce hardware and labor costs.”</p>



<h3>Solution</h3>



<p>JD chose Vitess for scalable management of large-scale database services and the support of online expansion of complex transactional data in MySQL. “We now run MySQL databases in containerized environments with Kubernetes and use Vitess for scalable cluster management and handling large volumes of complex transactional data,” says Liu.</p>



<h3>Impact</h3>



<p>With Vitess, JD has seen improvements in&nbsp;the scalability and elasticity of the database clusters. Increased resource utilization and efficiency and the automation of operation and maintenance functions have also led to reductions in labor and resource costs.</p>

<h3>China’s largest retailer and the world’s third-largest Internet company by revenue, JD.com serves more than 300 million active customers with its e-commerce business.</h3>



<p>The company also owns China’s largest e-commerce logistics infrastructure, which covers an incredible 99% of the country’s population and has achieved delivery rates of more than 90% of orders delivered same- or next-day.</p>



<p>“A few years ago, it became apparent that as our data became more extensive, our MySQL databases became larger, resulting in declining performance and higher operations and maintenance costs,” says JD Retail Chief Architect Haifeng Liu, who leads the Technological Infrastructure Department responsible for driving innovation in containerized infrastructure and developing the hyperscale, containerized, Kubernetes-based platform that powers all facets of JD’s business. “We needed a solution that would enable us to easily and quickly scale MySQL, facilitate operation and maintenance, and reduce hardware and labor costs.”</p>



<p>The company previously used JProxy, a cobar-based database middleware system for MySQL database management. After a thorough evaluation process, Liu says, “we eventually chose Vitess since it was the most suitable solution to address the biggest challenge we were facing: scalable management of large-scale database services and the support of online expansion of complex transactional data in MySQL. We now run MySQL databases in containerized environments with Kubernetes and use Vitess for scalable cluster management and handling large volumes of complex transactional data.”</p>

<p>Being a very early adopter of Vitess—and with one of the largest and most complex deployments of the technology, to boot—came with some challenges. “The re-sharding process was initially manual, the performance was poor, and the orchestrator could fail in large clusters with more than 5,000 instances,” says Liu.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To make sure that Vitess would work at JD’s scale, Liu’s team made numerous improvements and changes, including bug fixes and new functionalities and features. They have also developed performance optimization and automated management tools for the company’s JDOS Kubernetes platform. Among them:&nbsp;</p>



<ul><li>JTransfer, an online data synchronization and transmission tool that migrates data from JD’s traditional MySQL databases to the Vitess cluster in real time. All topology information in Vitess is stored in etcd.&nbsp;</li><li>BinLake, a MySQL collection tool for real-time collection of Binlog in Vitess and traditional MySQL database services, and publication of the collected Binlog to the Message Queue (JMQ) service. Integrated with Vitess, “BinLake provides intelligent and highly available binlog collection services in clusters,” says Liu. “If there is resharding or failover in Vitess, Binlake will automatically adjust the database instance of the binlog.”</li><li>Mole, a Vitess management system with a GUI console, which improves Vitess service management. “With Mole, we can easily create, reshard, monitor, and back up Vitess’s keyspaces,” says Liu.</li></ul>



<p>“Most of our improvements have been contributed back to the Vitess code base for other developers in the community to benefit from,” says Liu.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“We eventually chose Vitess since it was the most suitable solution to address the biggest challenge we were facing: scalable management of large-scale database services.”</p><cite>— HAIFENG LIU, CHIEF ARCHITECT AT JD RETAIL</cite></blockquote>



<p>With Vitess, JD has seen improvements in the scalability and elasticity of the database clusters. Increased resource utilization and efficiency and the automation of operation and maintenance functions have also led to reductions in labor and resource costs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, “Vitess helped the team grow their technical knowledge and strength in the areas of scalable management and elastic database,” says Liu. “The fact that Vitess is a CNCF project means we can significantly benefit from working with a large number of developers and end users in the most active and fast-growing open source community. With CNCF’s endorsement, Vitess can gain increasing awareness, attract more end users and bring together developers to the project. This is very beneficial for Vitess and its end users, which is important to us.”</p>



<p>Liu and his team are excited about the future of Vitess. In addition to migrating its systems to the newly-released Vitess 3.0 (which Liu calls “a significant improvement”), they’re working on developing some common functions for the latest version and developing a more complete operations and maintenance monitoring system.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote><p>“The fact that Vitess is a CNCF project means we can significantly benefit from working with a large number of developers and end users in the most active and fast-growing open source community.”</p><cite>— HAIFENG LIU, CHIEF ARCHITECT AT JD RETAIL</cite></blockquote>



<p>For other organizations considering Vitess, Liu offers this advice: “The most value can be derived from Vitess when it is used in concert with Kubernetes. Before using Vitess, it is imperative to perform more testing and research to determine if Vitess is the right solution for your business, and to better understand what adjustments you might have to make to integrate it with your existing systems.”</p>



<p>For JD, Kubernetes, Vitess, and other cloud native technologies have been a game-changer. “Modern service platforms need to be scalable and extremely efficient and agile,” says Liu. “Cloud native technology is well-suited to handle these ever-changing environments. It offers flexibility, efficiency, scalability, independence, continuous integration and delivery for software services, all of which further enhance the quality of software services and resource efficiency. Kubernetes has become the de facto standard and cloud native is a sure thing to bet on for the future.”</p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>



<p>Four years ago, <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square</a> branched out into peer-to-peer transactions via its <a href="https://cash.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cash App</a>. After some steady growth, the app rocketed in popularity in 2016, reaching millions of users over just a few months. But its large monolith of a few hundred thousand lines of code was built on the assumption of one single <a href="https://www.mysql.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MySQL</a> database and wasn’t designed to scale.</p>



<h3>Solution</h3>



<p>To solve the long-term scalability problem, they turned to <a href="https://vitess.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vitess</a>, the open source database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL. “The nice thing is if we solved it once, then we have a piece of infrastructure that would be the cookie-cutter way we would scale out other systems that are built the same way,” says Engineering Manager Jon Tirsen.</p>



<h3>Impact</h3>



<p>The first shard split with Vitess took place in November 2017, and “there was less than a second of downtime, so it was not user visible,” says Tirsen. Nowadays, “it’s completely routine. We did ten shard splits last week.” Looking ahead at Cash App’s continued growth, Tirsen says, “You have to keep on working on it, but Vitess does provide you essentially with near unlimited scale.</p>

<h3>For millions of people, from taxi drivers to market vendors to big businesses, <a href="https://squareup.com/us/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Square</a> has made getting paid by credit card much easier since it launched its card reader and mobile app in 2010.</h3>



<p>Four years ago, the company branched out into peer-to-peer transactions via its <a href="https://cash.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cash App</a>. After some steady growth, the app rocketed in popularity in 2016, reaching millions of users over just a few months and landing at the top of the App Store’s most popular downloads.</p>



<p>The only problem? “We had a large monolith of a few hundred thousand lines of code that was built on the assumption of one single MySQL database; it was never really designed to scale from the start,” says Engineering Manager Jon Tirsen. With users increasing by the minute, the company had to dedicate more and more expensive hardware for its database. But that clearly wasn’t a long-term solution, so Tirsen’s team of three was tapped to solve the scalability problem for Cash App. “Because we had the growth trajectory, we really needed to solve it very, very quickly to step up to the challenge of the product side,” he says.</p>



<p>The team’s first pass was trying to pull data out into key value storage that they built on top of MySQL. “It’s an inherently scalable storage platform, but less feature rich,” Tirsen says. Plus, this solution would have required rewriting hundreds of thousands of lines of code and thousands of different queries, and “there was just no way we would have had the time to do it,” he says.</p>

<p>So the team proposed solving sharded MySQL themselves. At the time, addressing the problem in the application rather than in the infrastructure layer was the default way to solve scale at Square, as well as at many other companies like Facebook or Pinterest. The team had begun drawing up plans, when someone else at Square suggested they look at <a href="https://vitess.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vitess</a>, the open source database clustering system for horizontal scaling of MySQL.</p>



<p>The project was still relatively new, but after Tirsen started digging into the code, he realized it would work for Cash App. Vitess met two of the team’s key requirements: infrastructure or platform layer query routing—sending queries to the right database—and online shard splitting without downtime.</p>



<p>Additionally, “the nice thing is if we solved it once, then we have a piece of infrastructure that would be the cookie-cutter way we would scale out other systems that are built the same way,” says Tirsen. “So that was kind of exciting, and it would mean that we didn’t need to completely rebuild our system. We could just make Vitess work, and the system would work. Maybe we had to change 5% of the system rather than 95% of the system.”</p>



<blockquote><p>“You have to keep on working on it, but Vitess does provide you essentially with near unlimited scale.”</p><cite>— JON TIRSEN, ENGINEERING MANAGER AT SQUARE</cite></blockquote>



<p>Tirsen’s team spent about a year making those changes, as well as adapting Vitess to work inside the overall Square infrastructure. To enable an external database to work with Vitess, the team rebuilt a lot of the shard-splitting workflows.</p>



<p>“The biggest thing we did was we changed the way sharding works,” says Tirsen. “Before, Vitess did shard splits by stopping replication, but because we can’t control our external databases, we changed that to instead use MySQL’s built-in support for consistent snapshots, where you can view the database at a fixed point in time, even if the database is still getting updated. Then you can make a copy of the database based on that consistent snapshot.”</p>



<p>That work has been upstreamed, and is now commonly used throughout the Vitess community. “It’s an amazing bonus that we can work together on solving problems across companies that don’t normally have a formal way of working together,” Tirsen says.</p>



<p>Next, the team practiced the shard splits in staging and testing environments—a lot. “You can practice the entire shard split except the last query reroute, where you basically start writing to the new shard, without affecting any production traffic at all,” says Tirsen.</p>



<blockquote><p>“While we were doing these very dramatic changes to our architecture to make it scalable, the feature teams were building incredible features on top of Cash App.”</p><cite>— JON TIRSEN, ENGINEERING MANAGER AT SQUARE</cite></blockquote>



<p>The first shard split with Vitess took place at 5 a.m. ET in November 2017, and “there was less than a second of downtime, so it was not user visible,” says Tirsen. “It was incredibly exciting.” Nowadays, he adds, “it’s completely routine. We did ten shard splits last week.”</p>



<p>Overall, Tirsen says he is proudest of this fact: “We didn’t have to completely change how developers built applications, so while we were doing these very dramatic changes to our architecture to make it scalable, the feature teams were building incredible features on top of Cash App, on top of our platform. So it was like changing the engines of the airplane while it was still in the air flying.” In fact, during that year of work, marquee features like the Cash card were launched.</p>



<p>Looking ahead at Cash App’s continued growth, Tirsen recognizes that solving the problem of scalability will always be a work in progress for his team. They’re currently building a developer platform based on <a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kubernetes</a>, <a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prometheus</a>, <a href="https://www.envoyproxy.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Envoy</a>, <a href="https://www.jaegertracing.io/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jaeger</a>, and other CNCF technologies, which Tirsen envisions supporting potentially thousands of developers. “Vitess is going to become part of this essential underlying infrastructure to make sure that everything that we build becomes scalable by default,” he says. “You have to keep on working on it, but Vitess does provide you essentially with near unlimited scale.”</p>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><img alt="Disney Drops Anti-Gambling Stance With ESPN+" src="https://www.gamingpost.ca/wmsimages/2020/December/14DEC3.png"></p>
<p>Traditionally a company opposed to gambling, and to such an extent that only a little over 2 years ago it had been willing to drop millions in support of its family-friendly cause, Disney has clearly done a one-eighty on the topic of sports betting. The motion picture and theme park entertainment giant announced on Thursday that it will be revving up its efforts to provide dedicated sports betting and fantasy sports content to ESPN+ subscribers.</p>
<p>Projecting as many as 11.5 million new subscribers, Disney clearly intends to make the most of the U.S. market for daily fantasy sports – a market currently estimated to hit nearly $50 billion by 2027. And from the perspective of a lagging-behind ESPN, who recently announced it intended letting go around three hundred employees, embracing the strong interest shown in Disney’s sports betting arm by sports bettors certainly makes sound economic sense.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamingpost.ca/canadian-sports-science-news/fox-espn-to-broadcast-xfl/"><strong>Read More...ESPN And Fox To Broadcast McMahon’s XFL</strong></a></p>
<h2>Sports Betting A Life Raft</h2>
<p>Disney’s intended 2021 expansion plans in overseas markets such as Hong Kong, Asia, South Korea, and Eastern Europe, will without a doubt benefit a great deal from a stronger focus on sports betting and daily fantasy sports offerings.</p>
<p>2020 was very much a mixed bag for Disney, with revenue from its theme parks and products division down 37% to $16.5 billion as a result of the shuttering of theme parks, hotels and cruises for more than half of the year. Also heavily affected was the company’s studio entertainment leg of business, with the global closure of the movie theatre industry driving the company all the way towards a 51% year-on-year plummet by the final quarter of the current year.</p>
<p>The message was suddenly clear: Disney desperately needed a life raft. And that life raft would be to make the most of the sports betting and daily fantasy sports infrastructure it already enjoys in its sports betting leverage via sports media brand ESPN and its stake in DraftKings.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Disney Makes A Strategic Move</h2>
<p>According to market analysts, Disney’s announcement regarding ESPN+ and the future carrying of dedicated sports betting and daily fantasy sports betting content is exactly what the company needs right now in order to survive and thrive.</p>
<p>Sports fans are clearly gravitating towards ESPN+, said Roundhill Investments analyst Matias Dorta of Disney’s announcement, which puts the entertainment giant in a near-perfect position to introduce millions more viewers to the exciting world of betting on sports – not to mention capitalise on those viewers in the end.</p>

This blog post is my answer.</p><p>Big O notation (example: <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(n))</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is a notation used to describe the time it takes code (example: a function) to execute on a given input (example: an array of integers). A fancy term often used to describe the time it takes code to execute is "time complexity". If you come across the term "time complexity", think "The speed of the code".</p><p>Big O notation is in the form <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>O</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">O(f(n))</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, where <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(n)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> is a <em>function</em> of <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, meaning for every possible value of <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>n</mi></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">n</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span>, <span><span><span><math><semantics><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>(</mo><mi>n</mi><mo>)</mo></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">f(n)</annotation></semantics></math></span></span></span> outputs exactly one answer, and that answer does not change.</p><pre><code><span>function</span><span> </span><span>addOne</span><span>(</span><span>n</span><span>)</span><span> </span><span>{</span><span>

The most common Big O notations, in ascending order of speed, are <code>O(1), O(lg n), O(n), O(n lg n), and O(n^2)</code>.</p><p>I am going to describe each of the common notations with a coding example.

December 14, 2020 | https://leerob.io/blog/tailwind | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://leerob.io/blog/tailwind">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><span><p>My site is an opportunity to try new tech and form opinions on what I enjoy using. I learn best by building real things. After some evaluation, I've landed on the following tech stack:</p><ul><li>Next.js (Upgraded to <code>v10</code>)</li><li>Tailwind CSS (Switched from Chakra UI)</li><li><code>next-mdx-remote</code> (Switched from <code>next-mdx-enhanced</code>)</li><li>Deployed with Vercel</li></ul><p>I've improved performance, added new features, and cleaned up some code. Let's dive into why I chose this tech stack.</p><h3 id="nextjs-10">Next.js 10</h3><p>Next.js 10 introduced the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization">Image Component and Automatic Image Optimization</a>. I've optimized images manually before (using ImageAlpha / ImageOptim) as well as with automated tools (like ImgBot). With Next.js 10, I no longer need to worry about that.</p><p>The <code>Image</code> component helps prevent <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://web.dev/cls/">Cumulative Layout Shift</a> (CLS) by defining the <code>width</code> and <code>height</code> ahead of time. No more jumping layouts. It only loads images as they're scrolled into the viewport, keeping page loads fast. Plus, images are served in modern formats likeÂ&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/Image_types">WebP</a>Â&nbsp;when the browser supports it.</p><p>Preventing CLS required a mental model shift. Previously, my images used normal Markdown image syntax and expanded to fill the width of their container (<code>700px</code>). For example:</p><pre><code><span>!</span><span>[</span><span>Siamese</span> <span>Cat</span><span>]</span><span>(</span><span>/</span>cat<span>.</span><span>png</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre><p>I wanted to avoid using the <code>height</code> and <code>width</code> props of <code>next/image</code>, if possible. The <code>Image</code> component exposes different <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#layout">layout props</a> like <code>layout=fill</code>, which led to me believe I could <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/examples/image-component/pages/layout-fill.js">escape defining sizes</a>. In reality, there's no way to avoid layout shift unless you explicitly tell the layout how much space to allocate. Once that clicked in my head, the <code>Image</code> component made sense.</p><p>This meant switching from Markdown image syntax (shown above) to using <code>next/image</code> via MDX. Since I had hundreds of Markdown files, I wanted to automate this. I created a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/master/scripts/markdown-to-next-image.js">Node script using remark</a> that transformed every image and read the dimensions from the file system. For example, the above Markdown image was transformed to:</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Image</span></span> <span>alt</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>Siamese Cat<span>"</span></span> <span>src</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>/cat.png<span>"</span></span> <span>height</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>50</span><span>}</span></span> <span>width</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>50</span><span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre><h3 id="tailwind-css">Tailwind CSS</h3><p>At first glance, Tailwind seems horrible. I've heard this sentiment many times and read <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://adamwathan.me/css-utility-classes-and-separation-of-concerns/">Adam's rebuttals</a>. Earlier this year, I had the opportunity to try Tailwind on a project. I didn't hate it. Still, I needed a larger project to form an opinion on the framework.</p><p>Well, the verdict is out. <strong>I really enjoy Tailwind.</strong> There was a learning curve as I tried to translate my existing CSS knowledge to Tailwind specific naming. For example, this vanilla CSS:</p><pre><code><span>display</span><span>:</span> flex<span>;</span>
<span>flex-direction</span><span>:</span> row<span>;</span>
<span>align-items</span><span>:</span> center<span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>translates to these utility classes with Tailwind:</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>flex flex-row items-center<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre><p>The Tailwind classes feel intuitive and their documentation makes it easy. The underlying idea of being bound to a design system made plenty of sense coming from Chakra UI. For example:</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> <span>Flex</span> <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'@chakra-ui/react'</span><span>;</span>

<span><span><span>&lt;</span><span>Flex</span></span> <span>px</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>4</span><span>}</span></span> <span>py</span><span><span>=</span><span>{</span><span>2</span><span>}</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>Chakra's <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chakra-ui.com/docs/theming/theme#spacing">spacing system</a> is inspired by Tailwind. 1 spacing unit is equal to <code>0.25rem</code>, which translates to <code>4px</code> by default in most browsers. In the example below, we're adding <code>16px</code> of horizontal padding and <code>8px</code> of vertical padding.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>className</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>px-4 py-2<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre><p>I still enjoy Chakra for larger applications. Having pre-built UI components saves a lot of time. Their documentation has some good notes on the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://chakra-ui.com/docs/comparison#how-is-chakra-different-from-tailwind-css">differences between Tailwind</a>. For further reading, check out <a href="https://leerob.io/blog/css-with-react">How Should I Style My React Application?</a>.</p><h3 id="dark-mode">Dark Mode</h3><p>Tailwind 2.0 makes using dark mode painless. Enable the <code>dark</code> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://tailwindcss.com/docs/dark-mode">variant</a> and prefix your classes with <code>dark:</code>. That's pretty much it.</p><pre><code><span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span> <span>class</span><span><span>=</span><span>"</span>bg-white dark:bg-gray-800<span>"</span></span> <span>/&gt;</span></span>
</code></pre><p>I was able to keep a <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/master/components/Container.js">dark mode toggle</a> in the navigation thanks to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes">next-themes</a>. Tailwind and <code>next-themes</code> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/pacocoursey/next-themes#with-tailwind">pair well</a> together.</p><pre><code><span>import</span> <span>{</span> useTheme <span>}</span> <span>from</span> <span>'next-themes'</span><span>;</span>

<span>const</span> <span><span>ThemeChanger</span></span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>)</span> <span>=&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

  <span>return</span> <span>(</span>
    <span><span><span>&lt;</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span><span>
      The current theme is: </span><span>{</span>theme<span>}</span><span>

    </span><span><span><span>&lt;/</span>div</span><span>&gt;</span></span>
  <span>)</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>I hit a few issues along the way adding dark mode to Tailwind Typography. The documentation felt a bit disjointed from the rest of Tailwind. I would have expected more guidance on pairing the two together.</p><p>After digging through GitHub Issues, I was able to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/master/tailwind.config.js">get things working</a>. It wasn't obvious I needed <code>dark:prose-dark</code>. I also managed to get <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/blob/master/styles/global.css">syntax highlighting</a> working through some custom styles.</p><h2 id="performance">Performance</h2><p>Libraries like <code>emotion</code> and <code>styled-system</code> require runtime JavaScript to compute styles and generate class names. That doesn't mean you can't use <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/callstack/linaria">CSS-in-JS</a> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/ben-rogerson/twin.macro">correctly</a>. But I'd argue using "plain" CSS helps you fall into the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/falling-into-the-pit-of-success/">pit of success</a> (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/built-in-css-support">CSS Modules</a>, Tailwind, etc) more easily.</p><p>There is no correct answer. Each has their own tradeoffs. For my simple site, I choose the performance tradeoff. I was able to reduce the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/cli#build">number of assets downloaded</a> <strong>by 43%</strong>.</p><ul><li>ðŸ“¦ Before â†’ <code>~150kb</code> First Load JS</li><li>ðŸ“ˆ After â†’ <code>~85kb</code> First Load JS</li></ul><p>This change, paired with <code>next/image</code>, has my <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://vercel.com/docs/analytics">Vercel Analytics</a> looking incredible. Zero CLS.</p><div><p><img alt="Vercel Analytics" src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" decoding="async"></p></div><p>I'm also evaluating using Preact in the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io/commit/74a3ebb14b81f785ea96f9c73fbe4f6c2463679c">client-side production build</a>. This prevents needingÂ&nbsp;<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/preactjs/next-plugin-preact">next-plugin-preact</a>Â&nbsp;to handle SSR and HMR (<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://blogify.dev/egoist/how-i-made-my-next-js-build-50-percent-smaller">source</a>). So far, I haven't noticed any issues with my small site and the results are promising. <strong>39% smaller</strong>.</p><ul><li>ðŸ“¦ Before â†’ <code>~85kb</code> First Load JS</li><li>ðŸ“ˆ After â†’ <code>~52kb</code> First Load JS</li></ul><h3 id="mdx">MDX</h3><p><a href="https://leerob.io/blog/mdx">Last year</a>, I switched from using <code>@next/mdx</code> to <code>next-mdx-enhanced</code> mostly for front matter and layout support. These are now both <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/blog/markdown">solved problems</a>. Given that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-enhanced">next-mdx-enhanced</a> will likely be deprecated soon (see below) I wanted to explore <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote">next-mdx-remote</a>.</p><blockquote><p>You probably should be using <code>next-mdx-remote</code> instead of this library. It is ~50% faster, more flexible with content storage, does not induce memory issues at scale, and fits much better with the way that data is intended to flow through Next.js.</p></blockquote><p>With the addition of <code>getStaticPaths</code> / <code>getServerSideProps</code>, you can treat your MDX data like any other data source in Next.js. It also removes the limitation of being bound to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/pages">file-system based routing</a> for your <code>.mdx</code> files. Since my site has hundreds of MDX files, moving these to a top-level <code>data/</code> folder made more sense to me.</p><p>Still, the MDX experience feels <em>fragmented</em>. I'd like to merge <code>next-mdx-remote</code> with <code>@next/mdx</code> so there are fewer options. <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://github.com/shuding/nextra">nextra</a> (another related project) allows you to use methods like <code>getStaticProps</code> directly inside your MDX files. Maybe there's a path to convergence for all three.</p><h3 id="other">Other</h3><p>I added <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/module-path-aliases">absolute Imports and module path aliases</a> to improve the readability of nested imports inside files. Here's a before and after example:</p><pre><code>
<span>import</span> db <span>from</span> <span>'../../lib/db-admin'</span><span>;</span>


<span>import</span> db <span>from</span> <span>'@/lib/db-admin'</span><span>;</span>
</code></pre><p>I also merged my previous project (jamstackfns) directly into this site with a new section called <a href="https://leerob.io/snippets">Snippets</a>! These are interesting pieces of code that didn't justify writing an entire blog post. For example, here's a few snippets I've added recently:</p><ul><li><a href="https://leerob.io/snippets/search">React hook for storing a search value with Context</a></li><li><a href="https://leerob.io/snippets/loading-progress">React hook for displaying loading progress</a></li><li><a href="https://leerob.io/snippets/email-query-params">React hook to parse an email from a URL</a></li><li><a href="https://leerob.io/snippets/gradient-border">Gradient border with CSS</a></li><li><a href="https://leerob.io/snippets/sticky-nav">Sticky navigation with CSS</a></li><li><a href="https://leerob.io/snippets/crud-api-route">CRUD Next.js API route</a></li></ul></span></p></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<div>
			<h6><span>Knowing what software you’re running sounds like a simple challenge. </span></h6>
<p><span>The reality is very different. Modern software is often composed of a large number of independent services. Those services are themselves often built from a large number of open source libraries. Ecosystems vary, but it’s not unusual to have 1000s of individual open source libraries in use by a single application.</span></p>
<p><span>Wikipedia describes a bill of materials (or BOM) as:</span></p>
<pre><code>A list of the raw materials, sub-assemblies, intermediate assemblies, sub-components, parts, 
and the quantities of each needed to manufacture an end product.</code></pre>

<p><span>BOMs are widely used across industries, especially where complex supply chains come together in the manufacturing of goods from individual components. A software bill of materials (or SBOM) is simply the application of this idea to software systems. (A good place to start reading about this is this SecAdvent post on </span><a href="https://www.devseccon.com/security-fractals-and-the-open-source-supply-chain-secadvent-day-4/"><span>Security Fractals</span></a><span>.)</span></p>
<p><span>There are lots of use cases for SBOM, including but not limited to:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span>Software license compliance</span></li>
<li><span>Identifying out of date libraries</span></li>
<li><span>Finding vulnerable dependencies</span></li>
<li><span>Export restrictions and other compliance matters</span></li>
<li><span>Managing aggregate risk across a company software stack</span></li>
</ul>
<h2><span>Languages and standards</span></h2>
<p><span>For those familiar with specific languages you might be thinking “ah, like package.json” or “like pom.xml?”. There are a wide range of different package management tools with just as wide a range of different formats. These are generally slightly different to a SBOM in important ways. For instance these tools are generally about providing a good user interface for developers to define the main dependencies. The package management tools then use that information, and the state of the world (for instance what versions of that software are currently available) to determine what to install.</span></p>
<p><span>For instance in Python you might create a requirements.txt file containing a single line, like so:</span></p>
<pre><code>structlog</code></pre>
<p><span>When you install this with </span><span>pip</span><span> or other suitable Python tool it will&nbsp;</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span>Determine a specific version of the package</span></li>
<li><span>Determine whether the package has any dependencies</span></li>
<li><span>Determine versions for those dependent packages</span></li>
<li><span>Install all of them</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span>So on their own, package manifests don’t work well as a bill of materials.</span></p>
<p><span>Several package management tools will be able to save this more detailed information as well, describing all of the versions and maybe filesystem hashes of the required packages and dependencies. You’ll find files like </span><span>package-lock.json</span><span> or </span><span>Gemfile.lock.</span><span> Back to our Python example, you might have something like this:</span></p>
<pre><code>six==1.13.0 \
--hash=sha256:1f1b7d42e254082a9db6279deae68afb421ceba6158efa6131de7b3003ee93fd \&nbsp;  
--hash=sha256:30f610279e8b2578cab6db20741130331735c781b56053c59c4076da27f06b66structlog==19.2.0 \
--hash=sha256:6640e6690fc31d5949bc614c1a630464d3aaa625284aeb7c6e486c3010d73e12 \
--hash=sha256:4287058cf4ce1a59bc5dea290d6386d37f29a37529c9a51cdf7387e51710152</code></pre>
<p><span>While in some cases this can work for the purposes of a general bill of materials, lots of software applications or systems are composed of components written in different languages, and using different package management tools. Some of the software might also be dependent services run by others, or unpackaged. You might have some Java code, a front end in Javascript and have packaged things up as a container with a specific JDK and supporting operating system software. Lock files or similar are intended as useful implementation details of the relevant package managers more than a general purpose bill of materials.</span></p>
<p><span>What we really need is something that covers all of the various languages and domains that make up a typical application, and something that’s focused on being consumed by other tools, more than just used within that package manager or ecosystem. What we need are standards.</span></p>

			<h2><span>What is CycloneDX?</span></h2>
<p><a href="https://cyclonedx.org/"><span>CycloneDX</span></a><span> is one project that’s been working on solving this problem for a while. Originally designed as part of work on OWASP Dependency-Track, the project now operates independently, with an active group of maintainers evolving the specification as well as supporting tools.</span></p>
<p><span>CycloneDX provides schemas for both XML and for JSON, defining a format for describing simple and complex compositions of software components. Here’s a quick sample.</span></p>

<p><span>CycloneDX also has a </span><a href="https://cyclonedx.org/tool-center/"><span>wide range of tools</span></a><span> written for a variety of languages, to help with generating SBOMs from existing package management manifests or other inputs. For instance let’s look at the </span><a href="https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-python"><span>CycloneDX Python module</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>We can use that like so:</span></p>
<pre><code>$ pip install cyclonedx-bom

$ cyclonedx-py -j</code></pre>

<p><span>cyclonedx-py</span><span> will read a requirements.txt file (it requires the explicit version numbers for the dependencies which </span><span>pip freeze</span><span> will add) and generate an </span><span>bom.json</span><span> file like the following:</span></p>

<p><span>You could run this as part of your CI system to ensure SBOMs are kept up-to-date, and even store individual SBOMs for each commit or each released version of your software. Similar tools exist, both from the CycloneDX project and from the wider open source community, for Ruby, Javascript, Maven, Gradle, Go, Rust and lots more.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>CycloneDX also supports various signing approaches, including XML Signatures, JSON Signature Format (JSF) and more, so you can ensure the integrity of SBOMs where non-repudiation is important.</span></p>
<p><span>Alternative formats exist too, for instance SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange) and Software Identification (SWID) Tags, and I wouldn’t be surprised to see others emerge as well. But CycloneDX’s active community and widespread tooling support makes it worth further investigation.</span></p>

<h2><span>What happens next?</span></h2>
<p><span>While a software bill of materials as an idea isn’t new, there does appear to be an increasing amount of interest in the area, with several active industry working groups working on this at present. For instance the work under the NTIA (National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the US Department of Commerce) on </span><a href="https://www.ntia.gov/SoftwareTransparency"><span>Software Component Transparency</span></a><span> and the work under CISQ (Consortium for Information and Software Quality) on </span><a href="https://www.it-cisq.org/software-bill-of-materials/"><span>Software Bill of Materials exchange</span></a><span>.</span></p>
<p><span>I think in 2021 we might just see wider adoption of some of these ideas and see standards drive some of that adoption into the software ecosystem. Widespread adoption here will mean not just producing lots of SBOMs but, most importantly for success, new and interesting tools that consume SBOMs and allow consumers to solve real world software supply chain problems.</span></p>

December 14, 2020 | https://sirupsen.com/shitlists/ | <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/*/https://sirupsen.com/shitlists/">archive.org</a>
<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="article-content">
    

    <p>Recently the team I work with completed a project to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UyDK2bDjc4">allow Shopify to run in
multiple datacenters</a>. This project
was a refactoring project in disguise. When you undertake large refactoring of a
code-base with 100s of developers and 100,000s of lines of code, you can’t align
by sending an email. The merge-conflicts a single pull request would entail
makes me shiver. When deprecating in a large code-base the only way to reliably
avoid new deprecated behaviour is a failing test that tells you what to do.
Otherwise the pace that new deprecated code is introduced can easily outpace the
speed at which you can remove them, or be a massive source of frustration.</p>
<p>Typically deprecations come in the form of soft warnings: Logging to <code>stderr</code>,
capital letters and exclamation marks in the documentation, or a legacy prefix
to the method or class name. At the end of the day, everyone needs to get work
done, and if they see a code-path already being used from 10 places in the
code-base despite these soft warnings–it doesn’t seem crazy to introduce
another. However, if another project is blocked on these deprecated code-paths,
piling on may have a large cost.</p>
<p>To solve this problem <a href="https://twitter.com/fw1729">Florian Weingarten</a> on our
team introduced what he calls “shitlists”: a whitelist of deprecated behaviour.
Existing deprecated behaviour is OK and whitelisted. New usage of the deprecated
API is banned and fails a test with a well-defined error.</p>
<p>They come in many forms, but could look like this:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>Shitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>ClassA</span>,
  <span>ClassB</span>,
  <span>ClassC</span>
<span>]</span>

<span>def</span> <span>push_job_that_does_crazy_things</span>(klass)
  <span>if</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>.</span>include?(klass)
    <span># Existing deprecated behaviour is called.</span>
  <span>else</span>
    <span>raise</span> <span>Shitlist</span><span>::</span><span>Error</span>, <span>&lt;&lt;-EOS
</span><span></span><span>You</span><span>'</span>re pushing a job that does crazy things<span>.</span> <span>This</span> <span>API</span> has been 
deprecated <span>in</span> this code<span>-</span>base<span>.</span> <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;</span> is actively trying to get
rid of this code<span>-</span>path, because
<span>&lt;</span>reason<span>&gt;.</span> <span>We</span> suggest you instead <span>do</span> <span>&lt;</span>alternative<span>&gt;.</span> <span>If</span> you have questions, please
ping <span>&lt;</span>team<span>&gt;.</span>
  <span>EOS</span>
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>A shitlist could be something as simple as a <code>git grep</code> for a certain code-path:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>test</span> <span>"no new introductions of legacy code path"</span> <span>do</span>
  actual <span>=</span> <span>`git grep some_legacy_method_with_a_unique_name`</span>
  assert_equal <span>321</span>, actual
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other times you can reach into another API and get a count or shitlist:</p>
<div><pre><code data-lang="ruby"><span>RedisShitlist</span> <span>=</span> <span>[</span>
  <span>Session</span>,
  <span>FragmentCache</span>,
  <span>AuthenticationTokens</span>,
<span>]</span>

<span>test</span> <span>"no new redis models introduced"</span> <span>do</span>
  assert_equal <span>RedisShitlist</span>, <span>RedisModel</span><span>.</span>descendants
<span>end</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Other ways we’ve used shitlists in the past:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that a certain datastore is only read from in a certain context (or
not used at all). This would allow for using a read-only slave, or improving
resiliency in a certain area.</li>
<li>Ensure fallbacks for all uses of a secondary data-store. E.g. if you access
sessions in Redis and Redis is down, you should be able to still render the
page (i.e. have an empty session fallback).</li>
<li>Shitlisting joins between tables that have no business being joined. This is
helpful to keep data-models and scope clean, or separating a part of an
application.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have a linter for a project, you may be able to encode rules. For example
you might use <a href="http://www.foodcritic.io/">Foodcritic</a> for Chef, or
<a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop">Rubocop</a> for Ruby.</p>
<p>Sometimes the shitlist is quite complicated, and much more domain-specific.</p>
<p>Building the shitlist gives the team responsible for it a number of advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Strong feedback loop.</strong> The goal is to reduce the <code>Shitlist</code> to an empty
Array and always raise or remove the code entirely. Remove a class from the
list, fix the code and the tests, celebrate and move on.</li>
<li><strong>Stopped the bleeding.</strong> New deprecated behaviour is not introduced unless
the team is contacted or some other action defined in the error is taken.</li>
<li><strong>Success metric</strong>. If you have shitlists for everything that needs to be
done for your project, you have metrics that you can track. Every week you
can look at how these lists are shrinking. Refactoring for months at a time
can be exhausting, but if you see that you’re making progress with metrics
moving, it’s much more rewarding.</li>
<li><strong>Enforces a guarantee</strong>. For example, you can have a shitlist that all jobs
have a retry mechanism. In that case, you know that you can kill any worker
gracefully at any time since the job will retry. Because of 1-3 you know how
much work it will take to have this guarantee.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is important that the shitlist errors are actionable. If you hit the shitlist
of another team, you need to know what to do next. Ideally the error explains
exactly what you need to do, and no humans need to talk, but reaching out to the
owner of the shitlist should always be part of the shitlist.</p>
<p>If you own a shitlist, you must empathize with the problems of everyone who’s
running into problems. If you simply deprecate new behaviour and don’t offer an
alternative, you will be the source of frustration. If the value of emptying the
shitlist far outweighs the value of adding to the shitlist, it may be OK to not
offer a direct other solution but ask the person who ran into the error to
revise their solution.</p>
<p>It is important that people run into shitlists as early in development as
possible. If you run into a shitlist after spending hours implementing your
solution, you will be less than popular. Some shitlists may require an entire
re-architecting of some teams’ solutions.</p>
<p>Months, in our case more than a year, of refactoring can be overwhelming and
unrewarding work. With the strong feedback loop that shitlists introduce you can
see the light at the end of the tunnel. You know that nothing is added to the
shitlist without you knowing about it.</p>
<p>Creating shitlists in some cases can be extremely difficult. Some take hours to
create, others weeks, and in our case one took months to come up with. You’ll
have to place the cost of developing the shitlist against the cost of not having
it. In some cases logging when you hit a bad code-path may be enough (simple
soft warning deprecation) if you assert the risk of new behaviour small and the
complexity of introducing the shitlist big.</p>
<p>Delegating with shitlists is great. Due to the tight feedback loop, asking other
teams or onboarding new team members becomes much easier. Remove something on
the shitlist, fix the code and the tests, then move on. Sometimes during large
refactorings you may need other teams with more domain expertise of a certain
area of the code-base to help. The shitlist becomes a great rock to point people
at.</p>
<p>If you are about to embark on a large refactor, I highly recommend adding
shitlists to your toolbox. Your project will look much less daunting when it
goes from an opaque objective to a list of shitlists.</p>

<p>Few events are as compelling as an epidemic. When sufficiently severe, an epidemic evokes responses from every sector of society, laying bare&nbsp;social and economic fault lines and presenting politicians with fraught medical and moral choices. In the most extreme cases, an epidemic can foment a full-blown political crisis. Thus,&nbsp;Thucydides describes how the repeated visitations of plague to Athens in 430-426 BC&nbsp;provoked widespread social disorder and the breakdown of civic norms.</p>



<p>‘Men, not knowing what was to become of them, became utterly careless of everything, whether sacred or profane,’ writes Thucydides. ‘All the burial rites before in use were entirely upset and… many had recourse to the most shameless sepulchres.’</p>



<p>As the plague progresses, Thucydides describes how Athenians were swept up in a wave of hedonism and lawlessness, threatening the foundations of Athenian democracy: ‘Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly done in a corner… fear of gods or law of man there was none to restrain them.’</p>



<p>The resulting crisis, Thucydides claimed, undermined Athenians’ faith in the rule of law and the democratic principles that underpinned the Greek city state, paving the way for the installation of a Spartan oligarchy known as the Thirty Tyrants. Even though the Spartans were later ejected, Athens never regained its confidence.</p>



<p>Covid-19 appears to have engendered a similar crisis in our world, the main difference being in scale. Whereas the crisis Thucydides describes was confined to Athens, the coronavirus pandemic has destabilized governments from Brazil to Belarus,&nbsp;not just that of a 5<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;century city-state. The political reckoning has been particularly rapid in the United States, where Donald Trump’s inability or unwillingness to check the spread of the coronavirus was a key factor in his recent election defeat. Now, the lockdowns and social distancing measures look set&nbsp;to&nbsp;plunge the world into the worst economic depression since the 1930s, raising the spectre of further political instability.</p>



<p>Given the wide-ranging&nbsp;social, economic and political impacts of Covid-19, it is natural to assume that the same must have been true of past epidemics and pandemics. But is this the case? Do pandemics really have the historical impacts that are often claimed for them or are these claims simply the product of particular narratives and readings of history? &nbsp;</p>



<p>For instance, in&nbsp;numerical terms, the most devastating pandemic of all time was the 1918-19 ‘Spanish influenza’. Coinciding with the end of the First World War, the Spanish flu is estimated to have killed between fifty to one hundred million people worldwide. However, while 1919 was the first year since records began that the death rate exceeded the birth rate, those that survived generally enjoyed longer and healthier lifespans and, in many instances, benefited from higher wages too. Moreover, while the global death toll was immense, in developed industrial countries the mortality rate averaged two percent, meaning the Spanish flu left most of society unaffected. Indeed, the Spanish flu appears to have made little impression on public memory and social institutions, hence its historiographical characterisation as the&nbsp;<a href="https://theconversation.com/why-historians-ignored-the-spanish-flu-101950" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘forgotten pandemic’.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-narrating-epidemic-crises">Narrating Epidemic Crises</h2>



<p>A crisis is normally conceived of as an isolated moment in time in which our lives are shattered and plunged into disorder – what the cultural anthropologist Hendrik Vigh has called&nbsp;‘a momentary malformation in the flow of things’.&nbsp;Vigh <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00141840801927509" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">observes that</a> for many people crises are ‘endemic rather than episodic’ and cannot be delineated as an aberrant moment of chaos or a period of decisive change.&nbsp;This is particularly the case for those living at the margins of society for whom crises are ever present. Indeed, social critics such as Naomi Klein argue that instability is baked into the capitalist system, hence the way that&nbsp;in the last few decades<strong>&nbsp;</strong>neoliberal societies have lurched from one financial crisis to another.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, crises have long been regarded as a way of accessing deeper historical truths. As Janet Roitman <a href="https://read.dukeupress.edu/books/book/330/Anti-Crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has argued</a> in&nbsp;<em>Anti-Crisis</em>&nbsp;(2013), a crisis ‘marks and generates history’. This is particularly the case for epidemics and pandemics which, unlike other natural disasters such as famines, are not limited to a particular region or moment in time but may come to encompass the whole globe. As the medical anthropologist Christos Lynteris <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/i40144420" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">puts it</a>, disease outbreaks involve a ‘radically different ontological order’, a mode of being that is simultaneously ‘pathological and infectious’. Or to put it another way, one could conceivably outrun a famine but those who try to flee a plague may become unwitting carriers, contaminating new communities and introducing the pathogen to new places.</p>



<p>What is also not widely appreciated is that the roots of the term ‘crisis’ lie in the Ancient Greek word&nbsp;<em>krinô</em>&nbsp;(meaning to separate, choose, cut, decide, judge) and can be traced back to Hippocrates, whose scientific method influenced Thucydides’ approach to history. For the Hippocratic school of medicine, prognosis took precedence over diagnosis, the point being to identify the turning point of a disease in order to intervene and bring about a satisfactory resolution to the illness. Similarly, Thucydides hoped that by tracking the social and moral dissolution that envelopes Athens under the strain of the plague, his history could serve as a ‘great case-book of social pathology’, enabling readers to recognise similar historical patterns in future and intervene so as to restore order and stability. In this way, <a href="https://www.waterstones.com/book/the-invention-of-medicine/robin-lane-fox/9780241277058#:~:text=Robin%20Lane%20Fox's%20remarkable%20book,that%20survive%20under%20his%20name." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it has been argued</a>, Thucydides applied a medical template to epidemic crises that has coloured our interpretation of them ever since.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-black-death-and-demographic-change">The Black Death and demographic change</h2>



<p>Perhaps the standout example of the transformative power of disease is the fourteenth century Black Death. Caused by the plague bacillus,&nbsp;<em>Yersinia pestis</em>, the pandemic coincided with the transition from medieval to early modern European society and was greatly enhanced by new shipping networks linking Venice and Genoa with Constantinople, Tunis, London and Bruges. The larger broad-bellied ships required for these long voyages provided perfect conveyances for plague-carrying rats and were soon sparking outbreaks across Europe.</p>



<p>Some scholars claim the pandemic killed a third of Europe’s then population between 1347 and 1353; others say up to one half. Whatever the true mortality there is little doubt the Black Death represented a massive external shock to medieval society and, together with the famines that preceded it, contributed to a declining or stagnant population in Europe for almost 150 years afterwards. The result was a demographic, economic and political crisis.</p>



<p>A smaller population meant less demand for grain putting downward pressure on the price of basic foodstuffs. At the same time, a diminished population fuelled competition, exerting upward pressure on wages and challenging the villeinage system of forced labour that underpinned the feudal system. The result was a wave of popular uprisings across Europe, including the Jacquerie in France in 1358, the revolt of the Florentine&nbsp;<em>Ciompi</em>&nbsp;or wool carders in 1378-82, and the 1381 Peasants’ Revolt in England. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The demands of English peasants included the abolition of an inequitable poll tax and the removal of a statute, passed in the wake of the Black Death, that sought to restrict wages to pre-pandemic levels. The Florentine carders meanwhile demanded a more equitable fiscal policy and the right to establish guilds, fore runners of trade unions. Today, we take collective wage bargaining and trade unions for granted, but in the fourteenth century these demands threatened the basis of the feudal system, hence the observation of the French chronicler Jean Froissart that: ‘Never was any land or realm in such great danger as England at that time.’</p>



<p>This economic levelling also spurred a series of social and cultural changes, including the right of everyone except the lowliest manual worker to wear furs – a privilege that previously had been the preserve of nobles and clerics.&nbsp;In most cases the political reforms were short-lived. For instance,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.bl.uk/learning/timeline/item126561.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wat Tyler</a>, the leader of the English rebels, marched to London to petition King Richard II with 60,000 peasants at his back. Demanding that ‘all men should be free and of one condition’, the rebels occupied the Tower of London, ransacked the palaces and mansions of wealthy Londoners, and executed the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Lord Chief Justice, as well as other hated representatives of the nobility. Within a few weeks Wat Tyler and other leaders of the revolt had been arrested and executed and the crisis was over. Nonetheless, the movement resulted in concessions to peasants: the poll tax was abandoned, and wage bargaining expanded over time, leading to the emergence of a new yeoman class.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-collapse-of-the-aztec-and-incan-empires">The collapse of the Aztec and Incan empires</h2>



<p>Similar claims&nbsp;have been made about the crisis that enveloped the Aztec and Incan empires following the Spanish Conquest of Central and South America in the early sixteenth century. In&nbsp;<em>Plagues and Peoples</em>, McNeill&nbsp;<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Plagues-People-William-McNeill/dp/0385121229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued that</a>&nbsp;‘disaster is to be expected whenever some previously remote and isolated tribe comes into contact with the outside world and there encounters a series of destructive and demoralizing epidemics.’</p>



<p>In the case of the Aztecs and Inca, the&nbsp;root cause of crisis and societal collapse&nbsp;was the introduction by Columbus and, later, the conquistador Hernan Cortez, of smallpox, measles and other Old World diseases to which Amerindian populations of modern-day Mexico, Guatemala and Peru had little or no immunity. The result was that&nbsp;within a century of Cortes’s arrival in the Gulf of Mexico in 1518 the population of Central Mexico had been reduced, according to some estimates, from 25 million to 1.5 million. A similar demographic …</p></div></div></div>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div href=""><p>Over the years, the articles on this blog have spanned a wide range of audiences, from fun facts (<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/multiplying-non-numbers">Multiplying Non-Numbers</a>), to undergraduate level (<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/the-first-isomorphism-theorem-intuitively">The First Isomorphism Theorem, Intuitively</a>), to graduate level (<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-an-operad-part-1">What is an Operad?</a>), to <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/language-modeling-with-reduced-densities">research level</a>. Today's article is more on the fun-fact side of things, along with—like most articles here—an eye towards <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/categories/category-theory">category theory.</a></p><p>So here's a <a href="https://twitter.com/AlgebraFact/status/1337795612583006212">fun fact</a> about greatest common divisors (GCDs) and the <strong>Fibonacci sequence </strong>$F_1,F_2,F_3,\ldots$, where $F_1=F_2=1$&nbsp;and $F_n:=F_{n-1} +&nbsp;F_{n-2}$ for $n&gt;1$. For all $n,m\geq 1$,</p><figure id="w-node-56ded0a0ed9d-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5fd6b348cd57457fe072fa24_fact.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In words, the greatest common divisor of the $n$th and $m$th Fibonacci numbers is the Fibonacci number whose index is the greatest common divisor of $n$ and $m$. (<a href="https://www.cut-the-knot.org/arithmetic/algebra/FibonacciGCD.shtml">Here's</a> a proof.) Upon seeing this, your "spidey senses" might be tingling.&nbsp;<em>Surely</em>&nbsp;there's some structure-preserving map $F$ lurking in the background, and this identity means it has a certain nice property. But what <em>is</em> that map?&nbsp;And what structure does it preserve?&nbsp;And what's the formal way to describe the nice property it has?</p><p>The short answer is that the natural numbers $\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ form a partially ordered set (poset) under division, and the function $F\colon \mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ defined by $n\mapsto F_n:=F(n)$ preserves <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_and_meet"><em>meets</em></a>:&nbsp;$F_n\wedge F_m = F(n\wedge m)$. When viewing $\mathbb{N}$ from this perspective, the meet of two natural numbers is precisely their GCD:&nbsp;$n\wedge m = \text{gcd}(n,m).$ Now, a poset in which every nonempty finite subset has a meet is called a <strong>meet-semilattice</strong>, and the natural numbers are an example.&nbsp;You can always find the GCD of a finite subset of natural numbers. And a meet-preserving function between meet-semilattices, such as our $F$ above, is called a <strong>meet-semilattice homomorphism.</strong></p><p><strong>‍</strong>Short and sweet.</p><p>But posets, meets, and meet-semilattice homomorphisms can <em>all</em> be re-expressed in the language of category theory: posets are <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-a-category">categories</a>; meets are <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/limits-and-colimits-part-1">categorical limits</a>, and meet-semilattice homomorphisms are <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-a-functor-part-1">functors</a> with a nice property. This shift in perspective is a bit overkill, but it's fun to think about!</p><figure id="w-node-83b339d115dd-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5fd6992bd4f3f5a0c9ce007a_examples_of.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>In particular, the category of natural numbers that we'll define below is one of my favorite introductory examples. What's more, unwinding these ideas will take us through a tour of basic ideas discussed previously on the blog—<a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-a-category">categories</a>, <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/what-is-a-functor-part-1">functors</a>, and <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/limits-and-colimits-part-1">categorical limits</a>—which may be helpful for anyone learning the subject.</p><p>So let's begin! I want to show you how the natural numbers form a category with a nice property: it has all limits. Moreover, the identity $\text{gcd}(F_n,F_m)=F_{\text{gcd}(n,m)}$ is another way of saying our Fibonacci function $F\colon \mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ is a functor that preserves limits, which is to say it's a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limit_(category_theory)#Preservation_of_limits">continuous functor</a>. </p><p>Let's go through these claims one-by-one.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>The natural numbers $\mathbb{N}$ are a <strong>category</strong>.</h2><p>Consider a category whose objects are natural numbers $\mathbb{N}=\{1,2,3,\ldots\}$ and whose morphisms&nbsp;are given by divisibility.&nbsp;That is, given two natural numbers $n$ and $m$, there is a morphism $n\to m$ if and only if $n$ evenly divides $m$. I've drawn a few objects and (nonidentity) morphisms below, but there are infinitely many more.</p><figure id="w-node-9f1be0914bfc-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5fd6bb281ece2a16f5e175e5_divide.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>It's quick to check this does indeed define a category: there's an identity morphism $n\to n$ for each $n\in \mathbb{N}$ since $n$ divides evenly into itself, and composition of morphisms $n\to m\to p$ follows from transitivity of divisibility.</p><p>In fact, looking under the hood, divisibility defines a <strong>partial order</strong> on the set $\mathbb{N}$; that is, it's a reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive relation. Equipped with this partial, the set $\mathbb{N}$&nbsp;is a <strong>poset</strong>. Alternatively, as we've just shown, we can also view $\mathbb{N}$ as category: the identity morphisms $n\to n$ are provided by reflexivity $n\mid n$, and composition $n\to m\to p$ is provided by transitivity. In fact, this is a very simple category: there is <em>at most</em> <em>one</em> morphism between any two objects. Every poset viewed as a category has this property. </p><p>In what follows, let's be flexible when thinking of $\mathbb{N}$ as a poset or a category—moving between the two is simply a change in perspective.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>The category $\mathbb{N}$ has all <strong>limits</strong>, given by the GCD.</h2><p>As we <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/limits-and-colimits-part-1">discussed long ago</a>, limits and colimits in category theory are a (and in some sense <em>the</em>) most efficient way of constructing new mathematical objects from old.</p><figure id="w-node-23fb8181ac1e-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b5910cb0bfb3cc32a29cbae_one.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>For instance, given a bunch of natural numbers, how might we combine them to get a <em>new </em>number?&nbsp;There are lots of possibilities: we could add them, subtract them, multiply them, divide them, compute their GCD, and so on. The last option is decidedly different from the rest because it satisfies something called a <em>universal property.</em></p><p>We won't get into the details, but recall that the GCD of $n$ and $m$ is their meet<em> </em>in the poset $\mathbb{N}$.&nbsp;So not only is the GCD <em>a</em> lower bound on $n$&nbsp;and $m$, it's the larg<em>est</em> of all lower bounds. The "est" here is what clues us in to a universal property lying in the background. Indeed, in the eyes of category theory, $\text{gcd}(n,m)$ is called the categorical<strong> product </strong>of $n$ and $m$, which is a general construction that appears all across the mathematical landscape. Other <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/limits-and-colimits-part-3">examples</a> of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_(category_theory)">products</a> include, meets in general posets, the Cartesian product of sets $X\times Y$, the direct sum of finite-dimensional vector spaces $V\oplus W$, the Cartesian product of topological spaces (hello <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/multiplying-non-numbers">Multiplying Non-Numbers!</a>), and lots more.</p><p>In fact, not only is $\text{gcd}(n,m)$ the product of $n$ and $m$, it's also their <strong>pullback</strong>, their <strong>inverse limit</strong>, and their <strong>equalizer</strong>!&nbsp;These are all examples of more general constructions called categorical <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/limits-and-colimits-part-2"><em>limits</em></a>. In a poset viewed as a category, these different constructions all happen to coincide&nbsp;with each other. In particular, in our category $\mathbb{N}$, all of these lofty terms simply become the GCD. We've discussed this in detail <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/limits-and-colimits-part-3">before</a>. </p><figure id="w-node-311666b6bd58-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5fd6a166db239146ff9ebb68_gcd.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>Now, recall that the poset $\mathbb{N}$ is a <em>meet-semilattice</em>, which is the name given to posets in which the meet of every nonempty finite subset exists. Not surprisingly, this concept has a generalization in category theory.&nbsp;There, <em>meets</em> are replaced by <em>limits</em>, and a category in which the limit of every collection of objects (called a <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/a-diagram-is-a-functor">diagram</a>, more formally) exists is called a <strong>complete category</strong>. So every meet-semilattice such as $\mathbb{N}$ is an example of a complete category.</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>The Fibonacci sequence is a <strong>functor</strong>.</h2><p>Let's now recall the function $F\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ defined by&nbsp;assigning to each natural number $n$ the $n$th Fibonacci number, $F(n):=F_n$. When viewing $\mathbb{N}$ as a category, $F$ is a functor. This follows from the fact that $$n\mid m \quad\text{implies}\quad F_n\mid F_m$$ for all $n,m\geq 1$ or equivalently, that for each $n\geq 1$, one has $F_{n}\mid F_{nk}$ for all $k\in\mathbb{N}$, which can be <a href="https://www.cut-the-knot.org/arithmetic/algebra/FibonacciMatrix.shtml#proposition">proved</a> by induction on $n$. To see this, know that a functor between categories is an assignment on objects (that's the $n\mapsto F_n$ part) <em>and </em>on morphisms. The latter means for every morphism $n\to m$ we need a morphism $F_n\to F_m$. But that's precisely the divisibility implication above. Reflexivity and transitivity of division further guaratee that $F$ preserves identity morphisms as well as composition.</p><p>More generally, functors between posets viewed as categories are precisely order-preserving functions.</p><figure id="w-node-85174c59c192-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5fd6a63b97fda235de3c6ea6_functor.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>And now we're ready for the punchline!</p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><h2>This functor is <strong>continuous</strong>.</h2><p>In category theory, a functor between categories $F\colon\mathsf{C}\to\mathsf{D}$ is called <strong>continuous</strong> if it preserves limits. Said more formally, one starts with something called a <a href="https://www.math3ma.com/blog/a-diagram-is-a-functor">diagram</a> $X$ in $\mathsf{C}$, as mentioned earlier. Then one computes the limit $\text{lim}&nbsp;X$ of that diagram in $\mathsf{C}$, if it exists, and one says $F$&nbsp;is <em>continuous</em> if there is an isomorphism $F(\text{lim}&nbsp;X)\cong \lim&nbsp;(FX)$. </p><p>It turns out that when both categories $\mathsf{C}$&nbsp;and $\mathsf{D}$ are meet-semilattices, a continuous functor between them reduces to something simple:&nbsp;a <strong>meet-semilattice homomorphism</strong>. In our case, that amounts to a function $F\colon \mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ that satisfies the following properties for all $n,m\geq 1$:</p><ol start="" role="list"><li>[$F$ is a functor] It's compatible with the partial order: $n\mid m$ implies $F(n)\mid F(m)$.</li><li>[$F$ preserves limits.] It preserves meets; that is, there is an equality $F(n\wedge m) = F(n)\wedge F(m).$</li></ol><p>And as we noted earlier, meets $\wedge$ in $\mathbb{N}$ are greatest common divisors!&nbsp;Thus, taking $F$ to be the Fibonacci sequence $n\mapsto F_n$, the equality in item (2)&nbsp;brings us back to where we started: $F(n\wedge m) = F(n) \wedge F(m)$ is precisely the condition that $F_{\text{gcd}(n,m)}= \text{gcd}(F_n,F_m)$. <em> </em></p><figure id="w-node-c73f759f1104-24b29fc4"><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5fd6a8ea603e1d854aab451f_final.jpeg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p><em>Et voila!</em></p><figure><p><img src="https://uploads-ssl.webflow.com/5b1d427ae0c922e912eda447/5b527d2844acede360b8e7ae_hline.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""></p></figure><p>To summarize, the Fibonacci sequence $n\mapsto F_n$ can be thought of as a continuous functor from the complete category $\mathbb{N}$ to itself. More simply, it's a meet-semilattice homomorphism between the natural numbers when viewed as a poset under divisibility. </p><p>Now, I'll be the first to admit—the categorical language is a bit overloaded for such a simple idea. But it's fun to peak into the world of abstraction, and see how familiar things are special cases of something much more general! And by the way, there's nothing too special about the Fibonacci numbers here—any <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Divisibility_sequence">strong divisibility sequence</a>&nbsp;can be recast in this way!</p></div></div>]]>

<br/><!-- hnss:readable-content --><hr/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>  <p><span>14 Dec 2020</span></p><p>This article provides practical tips on how to optimize the loading speed of your website. Some advice specifically aims at users of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, the blog-enabled static site generator. However, the basic ideas also apply to other tools and should therefore be easy to transfer.</p> <p>Note: This is an article written by and for the occasional web developer. If you’re a professional full-time web developer, you might know much of the content. I still encourage you to continue reading, though!</p> <h2 id="why-care">Why Care?</h2> <p>Why should you care about performance? We’ve got tiny supercomputers in our pockets, so who cares? And aren’t static websites such as those generated by <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> super fast out of the box? Well, not so fast.</p> <p>Performance matters a lot, and tiny improvements can make a vast difference. According to research from Google, the speed it takes to load a page has an impact of around 75% for user experience, clearly above other criteria such as ease of use or attractiveness:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/speed_impact.jpg" alt="Impact of Speed on UX"></p> <p>If you would like to learn more, have a look at this talk from Google’s 2019 I/O conference:</p> <p> <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mLjxXPHuIJo" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p> <p>When it comes to static websites the situation surely is not as bad as in other cases. Remember Flash, anyone? However, investigating performance more closely reveals opportunities for optimization even for static sites.</p> <h2 id="performance-analysis">Performance Analysis</h2> <p>First, we need to measure performance before we can optimize it. My current tool of choice is Google’s <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse">Lighthouse</a>. You can either run it in a browser through <a href="https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools">Chrome Dev Tools</a> or online at Google’s <a href="https://web.dev/measure">web.dev</a> pages.</p> <p>Lighthouse not only analyzes raw performance but also provides insight into how well your website performs according to</p> <ul> <li>Accessibility</li> <li>Best practices</li> <li>Search engine optimization</li> </ul> <p>Here’s what I got for an older version of my site using Chrome Dev Tools:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/lighthouse_perf_old.jpg" alt="Performance results on old website"></p> <p>That’s quite a bit of red and orange. In contrast, this is what I get after optimization, using <a href="https://web.dev/measure">web.dev</a> this time:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/lighthouse_perf_results.jpg" alt="Performance results on current website"></p> <p>Read on to see how you might get there as well.</p> <h2 id="minification">Minification</h2> <p>Low-hanging fruits first.</p> <p>A straightforward way to reduce the size of your pages is to minify the HTML code. Just like other text-based formats, HTML can be minified by reducing white space, comments, newlines, or optional closing tags.</p> <p>There is a Jekyll plugin that exactly does that job for you: <a href="https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html">jekyll-compress-html</a>. The usage is super simple:</p> <ol> <li>Download the <code>compress.html</code> file from the repository</li> <li>Copy it to the <code>_layouts</code> folder of your Jekyll website</li> <li> <p>Edit your top-level layout file (usually <code>default.html</code>) to have the following front matter:</p>  </li> </ol> <p>This will change your HTML code from something nicely formatted and human-readable to something much more compact. Here is a comparison before and after enabling minification:</p> <p><img src="https://www.danielsieger.com/images/compress_before_after.png" alt="HTML minification example"></p> <p>This saves about 1K in size on a random HTML page of mine. Doesn’t sound too impressive, but Lighthouse already shows some improvement.</p> <h2 id="only-include-what-you-need">Only Include What You Need</h2> <p>From here on things get slightly more complicated, but the gain in speed is also significantly greater. Hang tight.</p> <p>Depending on your Jekyll setup, you eventually include a <em>lot</em> of additional assets like CSS frameworks, JavaScript libraries, or custom fonts. Chances are that you only need a subset of them.</p> <p>I use <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to build this site (see <a href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2019/01/12/creating-jekyll-bootstrap-template.html">this post</a>), which depends on <a href="https://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>. Both libraries are quite heavyweight. Turns out I only need a fraction of them, offering an excellent opportunity for size reduction.</p> <h3 id="bootstrap">Bootstrap</h3> <p>I compile my own version of Bootstrap using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sass_(stylesheet_language)">Sass</a>, see this <a href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2019/01/12/creating-jekyll-bootstrap-template.html">post</a> for details. Therefore, I can easily configure which CSS modules to include from the Bootstrap distribution.

</code></pre></div></div> <p>That’s more than half of the modules, and I’m sure I could optimize this even further after more careful investigation.</p> <h3 id="jquery">jQuery</h3> <p>The Bootstrap JavaScript code depends on jQuery, which is quite a heavy library providing a lot of functionality. The good news is: As long as you are only using the CSS part of Bootstrap, you are fine <em>not</em> to include it.</p> <p>Check if you really need the Bootstrap JavaScript modules. If not, just remove the corresponding <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags for both from your template and watch your performance score improving.</p> <p>In my case, I still use jQuery to retrieve comments on blog posts via GitHub, see <a href="https://www.danielsieger.com/blog/2018/10/23/blog-comments-using-github.html">here</a> for details. However, instead of including jQuery by default on all pages, I now only include it on blog posts using the comment functionality:</p> <div><div><pre><code>{% if page.issue and site.github_comments_repository %}
...
<span>&lt;script </span><span>src=</span><span>"/js/jquery.min.js"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
...
{% endif %}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>I admit that it is still overkill include jQuery just to retrieve some data from GitHub. I’m sure there are more lightweight alternatives. Can you recommend one? Leave a comment below!</p> <h3 id="mathjax">MathJax</h3> <p>Many technical blogs include support for <a href="https://www.mathjax.org/">MathJax</a>, a convenient way to typeset mathematical formulas in your posts. Again, this is quite a heavy dependency pulling in lots of JavaScript code.</p> <p>Similarly, the solution is to use conditional inclusion: Only include MathJax when you really need it. Here, a dedicated front-matter variable in posts needing MathJax support will do the trick:</p> <div><div><pre><code>---
layout: post
title: Fancy Post With Lots of Math
mathjax: true
---
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Next, change your layout or include file (depending on where you actually include MathJax) to check for the variable being defined:</p> <div><div><pre><code>{% if page.mathjax %}
  <span>&lt;script </span><span>type=</span><span>"text/x-mathjax-config"</span><span>&gt;</span>
    <span>&lt;!--</span> <span>your</span> <span>config</span> <span>here</span> <span>--&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;/script&gt;</span>
  <span>&lt;script </span><span>async</span> <span>src=</span><span>"/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS_HTML"</span><span>&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</span>
{% endif %}
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Note the <code>async</code> attribute above to enable asynchronous loading of the script. This eventually enhances performance in case you actually use MathJax.</p> <h2 id="deferred-loading">Deferred Loading</h2> <p>As shown above, adding the <code>async</code> attribute to <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags is one way to improve page load time for scripts that you absolutely have to load. Using the <code>defer</code> attribute is another alternative. See the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/script">script</a> HTML element documentation for more information.</p> <p>Another commonly used technique is to defer the loading by placing your <code>&lt;script&gt;</code> tags at the very end of the document. However, you should not need this anymore when using the <code>async</code> or <code>defer</code> attributes.</p> <p>For more information on how to eliminate render-blocking resources, please see the corresponding Google Developers <a href="https://web.dev/render-blocking-resources/">page</a>.</p> <h2 id="inline-critical-css">Inline Critical CSS</h2> <p>Another optimization technique is to <em>inline</em> CSS code directly into the HTML document instead of loading an external script. The key point is to inline only <em>critical</em> CSS styles needed to render the first paint and make the core functionality work.</p> <p>I adopted a simple version of this by using an online critical path CSS <a href="https://jonassebastianohlsson.com/criticalpathcssgenerator/">generator</a>. This takes your website URL and the full CSS code as input and generates a small set of critical CSS styles to include directly in your HTML header.</p> <p>The resulting CSS looks far from being optimal, but for the moment it works fine. I am sure there are better alternatives out there. Maybe you know something that integrates well with Jekyll? Comment below, or drop me a <a href="mailto:dsieger@posteo.de">mail</a>.</p> <h2 id="asynchronous-loading-of-css">Asynchronous Loading of CSS</h2> <p>Another tweak I applied was to defer loading of the full CSS files using a <del>hack</del> creative solution based on the media attribute.</p> <div><div><pre><code> <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"stylesheet"</span>
       <span>href=</span><span>"style.css"</span>
       <span>media=</span><span>"print"</span>
       <span>onload=</span><span>"this.media='all'"</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>Note that this requires inlining of critical CSS, otherwise you will get ugly “Flashes of Unstyled Content” (FOUC). See the full <a href="https://css-tricks.com/the-simplest-way-to-load-css-asynchronously/">description</a> at <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">css-tricks.com</a> for more details.</p> <h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2> <p>Custom web fonts are popular and available to everyone through services like <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Fonts</a>. However, ask yourself if you really need them.</p> <p>As an alternative, consider using a system font stack relying on fonts already installed on the user’s system. This offers significant performance gains since</p> <ul> <li>there are no font files to transfer and load</li> <li>the browser likely has the fonts cached</li> </ul> <p>All major operating systems include somewhat decent fonts these days, so this really is an alternative. Plus, the system fonts match the look and feel of the operating system, so users are used to it.</p> <p>Here’s one way to use system fonts:</p> <div><div><pre><code><span>body</span> <span>{</span>
  <span>font-family</span><span>:</span> <span>-apple-system</span><span>,</span> <span>BlinkMacSystemFont</span><span>,</span> <span>"Segoe UI"</span><span>,</span>
               <span>Roboto</span><span>,</span> <span>Helvetica</span><span>,</span> <span>Arial</span><span>,</span> <span>sans-serif</span><span>,</span>
               <span>"Apple Color Emoji"</span><span>,</span> <span>"Segoe UI Emoji"</span><span>,</span>
               <span>"Segoe UI Symbol"</span><span>;</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div></div> <p>However, if you are like me and want more precise control over the fonts being used, there are some guidelines to do this efficiently:</p> <ul> <li>Host the fonts yourself if possible. This avoids additional connection requests and/or name resolution.</li> <li>Use <code>font-display: swap</code> in the <code>@font-face</code> definition to make sure text remains visible while the browser loads the fonts.</li> <li>Reduce the size of the font files by sub-setting. Only include the glyphs for the languages you are using.</li> <li> <p>Pre-load essential font files by adding appropriate special tags to your header:</p> <div><div><pre><code>  <span>&lt;link</span> <span>rel=</span><span>"preload"</span>
        <span>href=</span><span>"/font.woff2"</span>
        <span>as=</span><span>"font"</span>
        <span>type=</span><span>"font/woff2"</span> <span>crossorigin</span><span>&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div> </div> </li> </ul> <p>Last remark: Popular icon font sets such as <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">Font Awesome</a> are quite heavy as well. The latter contains something around 1000 icons (depending on your version), and I doubt you really need all of them. Consider creating a customized version containing only the icons you actually use. …</p></div></div>

    <h4>Developer Heuristics and Aphorisms</h4>
    <h6>Reflections from ten years in Software Development</h6>
    <hr>

    <p>
        The code you will find most jarring to review is your own, six months from now.
        </p>

    <p>
        There are two types of code review, short blocks of code, which you will analyse and critique, and large blocks of code, to which you will give a cursory glance and say ‘looks good’.
        </p>

    <p>
        Always refuse to review large chunks of code. Anything over 50 lines sees rapidly diminishing returns.
        </p>

    <p>
        The more a developer is obsessed with displaying deep knowledge of a language, framework, or philosophy, the less likely he is to be a good developer.
        </p>

    <p>
        The importance of testing is understated. The belief in testing is over zealous.
        </p>

    <p>
        Prioritise testing the parts of the codebase that never fail, over the parts that fail frequently. That is where the tail risk hides.
        </p>

    <p>
        Great code and great software are not the same thing.
        </p>

    <p>
        Customers / stakeholders will always change their minds. Always. Always. Always. Accept this as a fundamental fact of life.
        </p>

    <p>
        Don’t over optimise your code, unless your product is extremely mature, or solves a single, specific problem - and even then, don’t over optimise your code.
        </p>

    <p>
        All developers need to learn the basics of UI and UX - even backend developers
        </p>

    <p>
        You should always be thinking about the user.
        </p>

    <p>
        Good UI design isn’t always about making things simple and shiny. Expert users may want complexity.
        </p>

    <p>
        A steep learning curve is not necessarily a bad thing, if it allows an expert user to get things done quickly when learnt.
        </p>

    <p>
        Instead of learning the latest library or language, most developers would be better served learning sales.
        </p>

    <p>
        Think a good developer is expensive? They are an order of magnitude cheaper than a bad one.
        </p>

    <p>
        It amazes me how many software developers I see take a shitty or superior attitude with stakeholders in other parts of an organisation. If you are a developer, you are in the customer service business first and foremost.
        </p>

    <p>
        To a user, time has an elasticity. The first few seconds of a loading screen go by quickly, the new few seconds take an eternity.
        </p>

    <p>
        No new page or view should take longer than five seconds to load.
        </p>

    <p>
        Have a conversation with a fellow developer in which you both pause for five seconds each time you give a response. You will discover  a new appreciation for the frustration of loading times.
        </p>

    <p>
        Coding tests during interviews are pointless. Far better to give candidates a stakeholder test. Offer competing and conflicting requirements for a piece of software and watch closely how they respond.
        </p>

    <p>
        People who say ‘just read the documentation’, haven’t read the documentation.
        </p>

    <p>
        The number of bugs a user encounters vs. how irritated they become, is not linear. The first couple of bugs will be met with mild annoyance, the third and fourth with utter contempt.
        </p>

    <p>
        Good developers never complain to the end client. Great developers never complain.
        </p>

    <p>
        If a requirement is intractable, or impossible to deliver, always have an alternative suggestion lined up before communicating it to the client.
        </p>

    <p>
        Any challenges you encounter are more convincing to the client when you DON’T use technical language to explain them.
        </p>

    <p>
        Wait until a language, library or framework has been around for at least five years before learning it. If you have to use it before then, just learn enough to get by.
        </p>

    <p>
        The vast majority of a software developer’s career is learning just enough to get the job done. The myth of the all knowing developer is just that, a myth.
        </p>

    <p>
        Depending on what type of person you are, time constraints will either kill creativity or enhance it.
        </p>

    <p>
        Every developer thinks the code they inherit is shitty code. The developer who comes after you will think your code is shitty too.
        </p>

    <p>
        Software development is one of the most cultish industries around. Avoid fads in methodology, language, or design like the plague.
        </p>

    <p>
        Every organisation has their own definition of ‘agile’. None of them are correct.
        </p>

    <p>
        Over time, technical jargon seems to morph into management jargon. Be careful not to conflate the two.
        </p>

    <p>
        99% of software projects do not need a CI pipeline.
        </p>

    <p>
        The code you will find most jarring to review is your own, six months from now.
        </p>

    <p>
        Don’t waste time trying to create the perfect deployment process, it is a form of technical masturbation.
        </p>

    <p>
        Your users don’t care what programming language you use.
        </p>

    <p>
        It is more important to understand different programming paradigms, than a large number of languages.
        </p>

    <p>
        Keep your functions and class methods short. Under 50 lines, and in most cases far less.
        </p>

    <p>
        Requirements gathering should be like sculpting a statue. Start with a rough outline, and use iteration and feedback to refine and polish.
        </p>

    <p>
        Don’t be afraid to recycle code.
        </p>

    <p>
        Do not bother to deliberately memorise large amounts of syntax that is easily available as an online resource. Save that capacity for more abstract concepts.
        </p>

    <p>
        During requirements gathering, what is not said can be more important than what is said. Politics, Organisation culture, and other intangibles matter. Account for them when creating your product.
        </p>

    <p>
        The more developers that are assigned to a delayed project, the longer that project will take to deliver.
        </p>

    <p>
        Functionality and aesthetics are more closely related than may think.
        </p>

    <p>
        95% of SaaS businesses can be replaced with a spreadsheet.
        </p>

    <p>
        If you only have enough time to make the design great or the architecture great, choose the former. Users are much more forgiving when they love the look and feel of a product.
        </p>

    <p>
        Under promise and over deliver.
        </p>

    <p>
        Decentralise your architecture as much as possible, even at the expense of efficiency
        </p>

    <p>
        The only start-up you should be working for is your own.
        </p>

    <p>
        The meaning of the word start-up has become so diluted as to become meaningless. If you’re not worried if you’re going to go bankrupt next month, you’re not working for a start-up.
        </p>

    <p>
        If you're a developer, It is better to work for managers who are non-technical. Technical managers will concentrate on what they know best  (technology), vs. outcomes. This lends itself to endless (pointless) debates over the tech stack and architecture.
        </p>

    <p>
        An average developer who is a great communicator will be far more successful than a great developer who is an average communicator.
        </p>

    <p>
        The last ten years have been about big data, AI, processing power, and storage. The next ten years will be about perfecting human computer interaction to enable users to generate insight from it.
        </p>

    <p>
        It takes far more effort to write simple code, than it does to write complex code.
        </p>

    <p>
        Context switching is cancer to productivity.
        </p>

    <p>
        Have the courage to keep your daily stand up comments brief. Resist the urge to ‘pad out’ what you are doing.
        </p>

    <p>
        Most of the team aren’t listening to your daily stand-up, they’re thinking about what they are  going to say, or have already said.
        </p>

    <p>
        Most of your career will be spent developing CRUD apps, in one form or another.
        </p>

    <p>
        If you’re writing a feature that has to interact with another system within your organisation, increase your time estimate by a factor of four. If you work in the financial sector, increase it by a factor of eight.
        </p>

    <p>
        For every database table you create, add ‘created’ and ‘updated’ timestamp fields. This will future proof the queries you make.
        </p>

    <p>
        Reduce database tables to the smallest atomic unit possible. If you’re re-using a selector frequently, create a new table for it and use a foreignkey.
        </p>

    <p>
        It is better to store irrelevant data in a table, than it is to prune data you don’t think is relevant, only to add it later. Data storage is cheap. Development time is not.
        </p>

    <p>
        100% of projects need version control. Develop the discipline to use it well.
        </p>

    <p>
        You are a truly great developer when you remove more lines of code than you write.
        </p>

    <p>
        Software is easy. People are hard.
        </p>

    <p>
        Never disable Copy / Paste in your app.
        </p>

    <p>
        Debugging code is twice as hard as writing it. Therefore, don’t try to make your code too clever.
        </p>

    <p>
        UX is the art of misdirection. And a beautiful UX will misdirect beautifully.
        </p>

    <p>
        Not every developer is a designer, but every developer should treat the user as their compass.
        </p>
